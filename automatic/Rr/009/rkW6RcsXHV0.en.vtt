00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
with this and to this is going to have

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.710 
with this and to this is going to have
hurricane-force<00:00:26.400> winds<00:00:26.880> at<00:00:27.029> landfall<00:00:27.060> and

the<00:00:28.320> big<00:00:28.500> problem<00:00:28.920> with<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.189> going<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.580> be

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the big problem with this is going to be

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.519 
the big problem with this is going to be
the<00:00:29.820> slow<00:00:30.060> movement<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:30.720> heavy<00:00:30.929> rainfall

the slow movement with heavy rainfall
and<00:00:31.740> storm<00:00:32.309> surge<00:00:32.579> which<00:00:33.120> will<00:00:33.329> see<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
and storm surge which will see on the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.709 
and storm surge which will see on the
NFC<00:00:34.260> track<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.800> second<00:00:35.239> but<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.360> looks<00:00:36.540> like

the circulation just hasn't been able to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.459 
the circulation just hasn't been able to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
mix out the dry air the reason it has

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.959 
mix out the dry air the reason it has
been<00:00:40.620> strengthening<00:00:41.190> gradually<00:00:41.730> over<00:00:41.820> the

been strengthening gradually over the
last<00:00:42.120> 48<00:00:42.600> hours<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:43.079> because<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> amazing

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
last 48 hours is because of the amazing

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.209 
last 48 hours is because of the amazing
outflow<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.180> upper<00:00:45.930> level<00:00:46.260> pattern<00:00:46.289> above

the<00:00:47.370> storm<00:00:47.670> allowing<00:00:48.270> air<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.510> leave<00:00:48.930> through

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the storm allowing air to leave through

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.709 
the storm allowing air to leave through
the<00:00:49.289> top<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.430> pressure<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:51.000> falling<00:00:51.360> so

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the top and the pressure is falling so

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.569 
the top and the pressure is falling so
this<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.020> strengthening<00:00:52.530> upon<00:00:52.829> landfall<00:00:53.370> and

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
this is strengthening upon landfall and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.850 
this is strengthening upon landfall and
this<00:00:53.910> will<00:00:54.059> be<00:00:54.149> one<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.510> first

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
this will be one of the first

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.869 
this will be one of the first
strengthening<00:00:55.860> hurricanes<00:00:56.370> at<00:00:56.550> landfall

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
strengthening hurricanes at landfall

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.459 
strengthening hurricanes at landfall
that<00:00:57.090> we've<00:00:57.210> seen<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.719> little<00:00:57.960> while<00:00:58.140> on

now<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.650> again<00:02:40.650> i'll<00:02:40.830> probably<00:02:41.070> have<00:02:41.250> to

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.760 
now and again i'll probably have to
refresh<00:02:41.820> this<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.390> actually<00:02:42.570> loops<00:02:43.080> our

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.520 
get the winds up there a little bit more
it's<00:03:12.300> wobbling<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.900> little<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.200> can<00:03:13.320> see<00:03:13.500> a

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
it's wobbling a little you can see a

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.990 
it's wobbling a little you can see a
little<00:03:13.680> bit<00:03:13.860> of<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:14.040> wobble<00:03:14.190> west-northwest

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
little bit of a wobble west-northwest

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.550 
little bit of a wobble west-northwest
this<00:03:15.210> morning<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.050> is<00:03:16.170> probably<00:03:16.320> going

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
this morning so this is probably going

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.020 
this morning so this is probably going
to<00:03:16.650> take<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:17.040> west<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.640> mouth<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:17.970> the

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
to take it west of the mouth of the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.730 
to take it west of the mouth of the
Mississippi<00:03:18.600> River<00:03:18.630> now<00:03:19.080> as<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.380> comes<00:03:19.560> into

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
Mississippi River now as it comes into

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.980 
Mississippi River now as it comes into
Louisiana<00:03:20.490> the<00:03:20.970> problem<00:03:21.390> with<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.690> is<00:03:21.750> it's

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
Louisiana the problem with this is it's

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.080 
Louisiana the problem with this is it's
coming<00:03:22.200> in<00:03:22.530> west<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.430> here<00:03:23.580> which<00:03:23.730> means<00:03:23.940> it's

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
coming in west of here which means it's

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.480 
coming in west of here which means it's
piling<00:03:24.540> in<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.750> water<00:03:25.020> on<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.890> eastern<00:03:26.310> side

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
piling in the water on the eastern side

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.770 
piling in the water on the eastern side
and<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.850> course<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.270> is<00:03:27.390> going<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:27.660> be

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
and of course this is going to be

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.930 
and of course this is going to be
nothing<00:03:27.930> compared<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.620> Katrina<00:03:29.130> but<00:03:29.700> with<00:03:29.910> a

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
nothing compared to Katrina but with a

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.699 
nothing compared to Katrina but with a
slow<00:03:30.240> moving<00:03:30.570> storm<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.990> storm<00:03:31.200> surge<00:03:31.500> is

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
slow moving storm the storm surge is

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.140 
slow moving storm the storm surge is
going<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.190> be<00:03:32.280> larger<00:03:32.670> than<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:32.910> would<00:03:33.060> expect

we'll have to see how that goes is this

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.409 
we'll have to see how that goes is this

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
of rain and this is going to be a big

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.420 
of rain and this is going to be a big
problem<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.449> function<00:05:01.229> take<00:05:02.009> their<00:05:02.219> guard

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
problem and function take their guard

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.010 
problem and function take their guard
down<00:05:02.550> on<00:05:02.699> this<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.210> wind<00:05:03.419> may<00:05:03.629> not<00:05:03.810> be<00:05:03.930> the

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
down on this the wind may not be the

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.540 
down on this the wind may not be the
biggest<00:05:04.289> issue<00:05:04.409> with<00:05:04.620> the<00:05:04.740> system<00:05:05.099> but

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
biggest issue with the system but

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.640 
biggest issue with the system but
rainfall<00:05:06.030> definitely<00:05:06.719> will<00:05:06.960> be<00:05:07.169> so<00:05:07.379> this<00:05:07.530> is

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
rainfall definitely will be so this is

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.950 
rainfall definitely will be so this is
going<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:07.979> be<00:05:08.099> known<00:05:08.659> probably<00:05:09.659> for<00:05:09.840> its

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
going to be known probably for its

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.050 
going to be known probably for its
flooding<00:05:10.319> potential<00:05:10.650> and<00:05:11.009> then<00:05:11.759> you'll<00:05:11.879> see

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
flooding potential and then you'll see

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.149 
flooding potential and then you'll see
it<00:05:12.210> comes<00:05:12.419> up<00:05:12.659> into<00:05:13.409> the<00:05:13.710> center<00:05:13.979> of<00:05:14.009> the

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
it comes up into the center of the

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:16.040 
it comes up into the center of the
country<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:14.610> bring<00:05:14.819> some<00:05:15.090> rain<00:05:15.300> to<00:05:15.569> the<00:05:15.599> areas

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
country and bring some rain to the areas

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.839 
country and bring some rain to the areas
that<00:05:16.080> I<00:05:16.289> believe<00:05:16.680> needed<00:05:17.129> up<00:05:17.250> here<00:05:17.490> the

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
that I believe needed up here the

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.309 
that I believe needed up here the
this<00:05:18.030> I<00:05:18.240> believe<00:05:18.509> is<00:05:18.629> a<00:05:18.780> drought<00:05:19.050> stricken

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 
this I believe is a drought stricken

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.920 
this I believe is a drought stricken
area<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:19.889> is<00:05:20.340> going<00:05:20.520> to<00:05:20.639> like<00:05:21.180> this<00:05:21.419> rain<00:05:21.719> as

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
area and is going to like this rain as

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.839 
area and is going to like this rain as
this<00:05:22.229> curves<00:05:22.590> north<00:05:22.949> and<00:05:23.129> eventually<00:05:23.520> curves

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
this curves north and eventually curves

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.800 
this curves north and eventually curves
off<00:05:24.060> to<00:05:24.719> the<00:05:24.750> Northeast<00:05:25.699> so<00:05:26.699> overall<00:05:27.150> this<00:05:27.750> is

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
off to the Northeast so overall this is

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.420 
off to the Northeast so overall this is
a<00:05:27.960> strengthening<00:05:28.560> will<00:05:28.830> be<00:05:28.949> strengthening

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
a strengthening will be strengthening

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.370 
a strengthening will be strengthening
hurricane<00:05:29.940> upon<00:05:30.240> landfall<00:05:30.659> not<00:05:30.840> officially<00:05:31.349> a

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
hurricane upon landfall not officially a

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.709 
hurricane upon landfall not officially a
hurricane<00:05:31.889> yet<00:05:32.099> but<00:05:32.310> it<00:05:32.400> is<00:05:32.520> getting<00:05:32.699> there<00:05:33.060> it

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:33.719 
hurricane yet but it is getting there it

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:36.080 
hurricane yet but it is getting there it
continues<00:05:34.259> to<00:05:34.560> strengthen<00:05:34.800> and<00:05:35.279> although<00:05:35.909> it

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
continues to strengthen and although it

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.610 
continues to strengthen and although it
looks<00:05:36.300> ragged<00:05:36.719> on<00:05:36.779> satellite<00:05:37.319> this<00:05:37.500> is

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
looks ragged on satellite this is

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.439 
looks ragged on satellite this is
definitely<00:05:38.069> a<00:05:38.099> beast<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.699> we'll<00:05:39.150> be<00:05:39.240> bringing
