 uk affairs william haig in every way 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.340
 tries to convince the country and with what follows 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.800
 arm the so-called moderate 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.260
 rebels in syria are actively promoting 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.450
 the position of France and the center-left 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.520
 newspaper le mond published an article in 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.860
 which states that the troops are fighting 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.810
 on the side of bashar al-Assad used 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.100
 chemical weapons and that one of 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.750
 journalists felt myself 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.030
 chimatake effects 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.430
 critics will no doubt say time 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.440
 publication is not randomly selected considering 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.300
 that leaders must decide with 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.579
 other side some countries 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.530
 concerned that lifting the embargo may 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.149
 cause the weapon to end up 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.250
 fall into the hands of criminals 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.469
 it is also alleged that both sides 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.020
 conflict and therefore the Syrian rebels 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.299
 violated human rights by words 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.520
 William Haig if the European Union does not accept 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.860
 coherent decision each of the countries 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.490
 probably have on their own 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.790
 formulate a policy regarding 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.100
 sanctions and this we are already seeing the task 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.350
 promoted by russia and usa negotiations 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.080
 peaceful resolution of the conflict convince everyone 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.400
 start a peaceful dialogue in Geneva is that 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.650
 washington expressed his support 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.890
 rebels may make it difficult to attract 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.869
 to the dialogue of all parties bashar asad said 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.860
 that in principle intends to take part in 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.200
 these negotiations 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.229
 however, the opposition said it would go on 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.090
 it is only if asad resigns then 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.159
 have a preliminary start again 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.840
 condition disagreement even before 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.509
 advance in the peaceful poll 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.580
 settlements we have already seen that all 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.830
 Essentially I agree that the Syrian 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.500
 the problem needs to be solved but how to do it 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.990
 there is no agreement in this and every country 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.850
 similar in their sees the solution to this 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.250
 the situation persists for the last two years 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.229
 and we can say that it impedes 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.229
 tangible advancement of the Syrian issue
