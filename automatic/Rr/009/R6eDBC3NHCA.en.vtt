Blaise pin and this is a really simple

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.390 
Blaise pin and this is a really simple
little<00:00:26.180> turn<00:00:27.170> signal<00:00:27.529> that<00:00:27.830> they've<00:00:28.160> just

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
little turn signal that they've just

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.820 
little turn signal that they've just
come<00:00:28.580> out<00:00:28.730> with<00:00:28.880> it's<00:00:29.480> available<00:00:29.869> in<00:00:30.410> black

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
come out with it's available in black

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.760 
come out with it's available in black
and<00:00:31.189> polished<00:00:31.580> and<00:00:32.090> it's<00:00:32.689> just<00:00:33.140> a<00:00:33.230> real<00:00:33.410> simple

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
and polished and it's just a real simple

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.010 
and polished and it's just a real simple
and<00:00:33.980> small<00:00:34.340> like<00:00:34.730> the<00:00:34.910> name<00:00:35.090> implies<00:00:35.120> almost

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
and small like the name implies almost

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.500 
and small like the name implies almost
as<00:00:36.140> small<00:00:36.350> as<00:00:36.470> a<00:00:36.560> pin<00:00:36.829> turn<00:00:37.340> signal<00:00:37.760> but<00:00:38.300> not<00:00:38.390> to

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
as small as a pin turn signal but not to

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.430 
as small as a pin turn signal but not to
worry<00:00:38.600> these<00:00:38.930> things<00:00:39.140> are<00:00:39.260> still

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
worry these things are still

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.740 
worry these things are still
outrageously<00:00:40.400> bright<00:00:40.730> and<00:00:40.970> won't<00:00:41.300> be<00:00:41.480> missed

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
outrageously bright and won't be missed

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.500 
outrageously bright and won't be missed
so<00:00:42.579> we<00:00:43.579> look<00:00:43.760> at<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:43.970> product<00:00:44.300> it's<00:00:44.450> really

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
so we look at the product it's really

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.060 
so we look at the product it's really
pretty<00:00:44.810> simple<00:00:45.230> it's<00:00:45.410> just<00:00:45.560> a<00:00:45.650> little<00:00:45.890> bullet

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
pretty simple it's just a little bullet

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.370 
pretty simple it's just a little bullet

positive one thing to note is this

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.260 
positive one thing to note is this
little<00:00:57.290> silver<00:00:57.580> part<00:00:58.580> on<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:58.850> wire

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
little silver part on the wire

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.090 
little silver part on the wire
you<00:00:59.660> can't<00:00:59.900> cut<00:01:00.080> that<00:01:00.200> off<00:01:00.410> that's<00:01:00.710> a<00:01:00.860> really

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
you can't cut that off that's a really

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.400 
you can't cut that off that's a really
important<00:01:01.550> piece<00:01:01.760> it's<00:01:02.060> the<00:01:02.660> voltage<00:01:03.140> I'm

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
important piece it's the voltage I'm

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.840 
important piece it's the voltage I'm
sorry<00:01:03.620> it's<00:01:03.770> the<00:01:03.800> current<00:01:04.100> regulator<00:01:04.489> for<00:01:04.729> the

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
sorry it's the current regulator for the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.870 
sorry it's the current regulator for the
LED<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:05.810> you<00:01:05.900> need<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:06.259> have<00:01:06.380> that<00:01:06.729> one<00:01:07.729> other

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
LED so you need to have that one other

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.070 
LED so you need to have that one other
thing<00:01:08.119> to<00:01:08.240> take<00:01:08.360> a<00:01:08.420> look<00:01:08.509> at<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:08.990> pay

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
thing to take a look at and pay

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.810 
thing to take a look at and pay
attention<00:01:09.110> to<00:01:09.470> is<00:01:09.770> these<00:01:09.950> are<00:01:10.189> directional

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
attention to is these are directional

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.789 
attention to is these are directional
there's<00:01:11.150> a<00:01:11.240> small<00:01:11.689> little<00:01:12.110> reflector<00:01:12.619> that's

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
there's a small little reflector that's

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.539 
there's a small little reflector that's
molded<00:01:13.159> into<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:14.180> glass<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:15.020> that<00:01:15.070> makes<00:01:16.070> the

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
molded into the glass and that makes the

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.669 
molded into the glass and that makes the
majority<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.150> light<00:01:17.270> kind<00:01:17.570> of<00:01:17.659> go<00:01:17.840> in<00:01:18.109> one

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
majority of the light kind of go in one

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:19.959 
majority of the light kind of go in one
direction<00:01:18.829> so<00:01:19.159> you<00:01:19.399> want<00:01:19.670> to<00:01:19.729> point<00:01:19.880> that

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
direction so you want to point that

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.099 
direction so you want to point that
forward<00:01:20.420> or<00:01:20.570> backwards

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
forward or backwards

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:22.959 
forward or backwards
whichever<00:01:21.710> if<00:01:22.009> you're<00:01:22.159> on<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:22.640> front<00:01:22.789> of<00:01:22.909> the

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:22.969 
whichever if you're on the front of the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:25.359 
whichever if you're on the front of the
bike<00:01:23.149> or<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.299> back<00:01:23.479> of<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:23.659> bike<00:01:24.159> the<00:01:25.159> cool

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
bike or the back of the bike the cool

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:26.560 
bike or the back of the bike the cool
part<00:01:25.609> about<00:01:25.670> how<00:01:25.909> that<00:01:25.969> works<00:01:26.240> is<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:26.479> actually

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
part about how that works is it actually

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.719 
part about how that works is it actually
does<00:01:26.780> light<00:01:27.229> up<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.469> entire<00:01:27.560> dome<00:01:28.100> but<00:01:28.640> it

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
does light up the entire dome but it

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.840 
does light up the entire dome but it
directs<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.270> majority<00:01:29.810> of<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:29.990> light<00:01:30.140> in

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
directs the majority of the light in

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.559 
directs the majority of the light in
whichever<00:01:31.850> direction<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:32.240> point<00:01:32.509> the

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
whichever direction you point the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:35.410 
whichever direction you point the
reflector<00:01:33.020> so<00:01:33.770> that's<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.340> EM<00:01:34.429> blaze<00:01:34.640> pin<00:01:34.909> why

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
reflector so that's the EM blaze pin why

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.609 
reflector so that's the EM blaze pin why
don't<00:01:35.539> we<00:01:35.600> take<00:01:35.689> a<00:01:35.749> look<00:01:35.899> at<00:01:36.020> an<00:01:36.109> installation

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
don't we take a look at an installation

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.069 
don't we take a look at an installation
all<00:01:37.549> right<00:01:37.700> here<00:01:37.880> we've<00:01:38.030> got<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.420> basically

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
all right here we've got a basically

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.239 
all right here we've got a basically
stock<00:01:39.499> MV<00:01:40.189> Agusta<00:01:40.579> Brutale<00:01:40.819> a<00:01:41.149> 910<00:01:41.630> R<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.249> you

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
stock MV Agusta Brutale a 910 R and you

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:44.889 
stock MV Agusta Brutale a 910 R and you
probably<00:01:43.460> haven't<00:01:43.819> noticed<00:01:43.850> but<00:01:44.509> we<00:01:44.719> did

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
probably haven't noticed but we did

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.989 
probably haven't noticed but we did
install<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.439> M<00:01:45.560> blazed<00:01:45.799> pin<00:01:46.130> right<00:01:46.579> there<00:01:46.819> and

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:46.999 
install the M blazed pin right there and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:49.629 
install the M blazed pin right there and
it's<00:01:47.689> pretty<00:01:47.840> hard<00:01:48.109> to<00:01:48.200> spot<00:01:48.289> until<00:01:48.710> we

00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:49.639 
it's pretty hard to spot until we

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:50.980 
it's pretty hard to spot until we
actually<00:01:49.789> light<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:50.179> up<00:01:50.299> we've<00:01:50.509> made<00:01:50.810> this

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
actually light it up we've made this

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.510 
actually light it up we've made this
system<00:01:51.799> so<00:01:51.920> that<00:01:52.009> it's<00:01:52.130> going<00:01:52.189> to<00:01:52.280> stay<00:01:52.490> on

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
system so that it's going to stay on

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.099 
system so that it's going to stay on
constantly<00:01:53.240> rather<00:01:53.420> than<00:01:53.600> flashing<00:01:53.990> like<00:01:54.079> a

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
constantly rather than flashing like a

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:55.629 
constantly rather than flashing like a
turn<00:01:54.350> signal<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.859> that<00:01:55.280> way<00:01:55.399> we<00:01:55.520> can

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:55.639 
turn signal and that way we can

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:57.249 
turn signal and that way we can
illustrate<00:01:55.819> that<00:01:56.270> directional<00:01:56.899> light<00:01:57.079> we

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
illustrate that directional light we

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.169 
illustrate that directional light we
were<00:01:57.319> talking<00:01:57.619> about<00:01:57.679> so<00:01:57.920> you<00:01:57.950> can<00:01:58.039> see<00:01:58.369> it's<00:01:59.119> a

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
were talking about so you can see it's a

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.719 
were talking about so you can see it's a
really<00:01:59.420> bright<00:01:59.689> spot<00:02:00.079> that<00:02:00.889> stays<00:02:01.490> pointed

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
really bright spot that stays pointed

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.789 
really bright spot that stays pointed
forward<00:02:02.240> but<00:02:02.929> you<00:02:03.020> can<00:02:03.170> also<00:02:03.319> get<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:03.590> little

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
forward but you can also get a little

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.230 
forward but you can also get a little
bit<00:02:03.889> of<00:02:03.979> illumination<00:02:04.340> around<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.759> side<00:02:04.939> so

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
bit of illumination around the side so

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.819 
bit of illumination around the side so
you<00:02:05.299> still<00:02:05.600> get<00:02:05.719> visibility<00:02:06.319> from<00:02:06.469> the<00:02:06.619> sides

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
you still get visibility from the sides

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.499 
you still get visibility from the sides
in<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.039> back<00:02:07.219> but<00:02:07.579> most<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.119> light<00:02:08.300> goes

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
in the back but most the light goes

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.510 
in the back but most the light goes
where<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.780> need<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.020> pointed<00:02:09.380> forward<00:02:09.740> there

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
where you need it pointed forward there

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.370 
where you need it pointed forward there
you<00:02:10.610> have<00:02:10.759> it<00:02:10.910> that's<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.209> end<00:02:11.300> lays<00:02:11.569> pin<00:02:11.840> nice

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
you have it that's the end lays pin nice

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.199
