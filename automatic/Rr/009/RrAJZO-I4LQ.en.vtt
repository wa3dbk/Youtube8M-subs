00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
now the OneNote app made it on the list

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.509 
now the OneNote app made it on the list
it's<00:03:45.870> kind<00:03:46.109> of<00:03:46.140> like<00:03:46.380> a<00:03:46.410> Google<00:03:46.620> keep<00:03:47.040> but<00:03:47.340> from

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
it's kind of like a Google keep but from

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.550 
it's kind of like a Google keep but from
Microsoft<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:48.630> if<00:03:48.840> you're<00:03:48.959> in<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:49.109> Microsoft

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
Microsoft so if you're in the Microsoft

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.560 
Microsoft so if you're in the Microsoft
ecosystem<00:03:49.769> you'll<00:03:50.459> really<00:03:50.700> love<00:03:50.940> this<00:03:51.120> app<00:03:51.359> I

ecosystem you'll really love this app I

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.120 
ecosystem you'll really love this app I
mean<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:51.780> has<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:51.930> lot<00:03:52.170> of<00:03:52.200> similar<00:03:52.620> functions

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
mean it has a lot of similar functions

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.130 
mean it has a lot of similar functions

to the Google keep app but there are

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.420 
to the Google keep app but there are
some<00:03:55.380> differences<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:56.100> some<00:03:56.310> of<00:03:56.370> the

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
some differences and some of the

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.370 
some differences and some of the
differences<00:03:56.820> include<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.450> ability<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:58.200> use<00:03:58.350> a

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
differences include the ability to use a

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.069 
differences include the ability to use a
stylus<00:03:58.950> or<00:03:59.130> digital<00:04:00.000> ink<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.570> write<00:04:00.600> down<00:04:01.019> your

stylus or digital ink to write down your

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.199 
stylus or digital ink to write down your
notes<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.709> would<00:04:02.190> say<00:04:02.370> there<00:04:02.519> are<00:04:02.640> also<00:04:02.820> more

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
notes I would say there are also more

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.240 
notes I would say there are also more
formatting<00:04:03.750> options<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.530> you<00:04:04.769> can<00:04:04.829> even

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
formatting options and you can even

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.920 
formatting options and you can even
record<00:04:05.579> audio<00:04:06.030> straight<00:04:06.450> from<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.780> app
