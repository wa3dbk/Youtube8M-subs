00:00:49.780 --> 00:01:00.649
 ah ah ah ah ah ah 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.649
 ah 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:27.640
 รณ Coaster out of the year and I missed the 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.520
 front is good 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.009
 If you leave me here, you stay the whole day and 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.190
 This is a part that surprised me. 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.060
 after their turns 15 all brake 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.000
 did not come down 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.060
 I felt the small delay of just 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.280
 of yesterday little loss of effectiveness now 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.550
 only at the end but expensive making here 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.770
 already 56 hot turns within my limit 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.390
 Clear the limit of the car to cut 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:58.090
 above that but the car simply 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.479
 a tank and a very precise watch 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.149
 hide here in some other cars 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.690
 and if you lose brake already on the second 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.899
 back at the beginning of the third cause 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.360
 including even slower than here 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.590
 and surprised the healing touch of exit 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:21.280
 of this car with 1.4 turbo engine see the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.500
 and reveal the 140 horses and 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.200
 I'm wrong to think it's no big deal. 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.680
 but the curve output signal in a 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.959
 track like this one with 1.4 is fun 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.690
 others say it for a clue why 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.970
 in this narrower configuration with 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.850
 cross more attacked as soon as they cut 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:44.980
 money than staying here is so 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:49.630
 fun as he has I thought 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:54.190
 up to 1 a higher jump is in relation to the gti 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.970
 but why it's cool is that it's revealed 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.610
 over 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.890
 it's not because gti surprised me a little 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.310
 is because this guy who learned a lot 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.740
 so I'm sure in a few 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.500
 months and already talking new 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.740
 the guys who like cars 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.990
 dynamically cool cars discreet cars 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.380
 Staying here is going to be a little cute leave. 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.470
 of staff at the moment in the market who 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.740
 had even a void in this category of 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.650
 average hatch in dynamic terms is so 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.000
 than golf 4 and the old focus that still 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.100
 are always sold if 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.670
 are two of the best cars we have 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:37.690
 category because he likes to drive 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.520
 logically are already well behind and there 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.520
 You have this guy here coming so it's 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.260
 another very easy victory in the market 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.140
 it is worth remembering that the focus is not 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.810
 arriving there also involves the touch know 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.600
 which is sensational of technically I 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.820
 I'm sure 2014 is going to be a fight. 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.600
 those pretty cool 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.460
 was goiano new outbreaks had taken the 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.480
 ford bring in the sports versions of the 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.220
 focus 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.740
 I also got the sports version of 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.150
 dossier that we really have a 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.110
 market configuration that people 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.620
 love the fiscal if the factory suits 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.229
 fighting 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.880
 Only the people will have done much. 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.579
 loaded on the track there I hope you 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.560
 makes sense here as either the end 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.919
 oh hope the chance to try 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.240
 this car here is the proof of the cup 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.130
 dynamically the new favorite in 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.050
 right category 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.050
 Look at the next folks.
