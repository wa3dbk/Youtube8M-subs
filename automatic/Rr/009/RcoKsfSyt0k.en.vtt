00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
time so I line them up and I try and

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.479 
time so I line them up and I try and
feel<00:00:32.910> what<00:00:33.420> what<00:00:33.780> I'm<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.050> mood<00:00:34.350> for<00:00:34.680> I'm

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
feel what what I'm in the mood for I'm

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.740 
feel what what I'm in the mood for I'm
not<00:00:35.640> necessarily<00:00:35.820> cuz<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.329> gonna<00:00:36.420> give<00:00:36.630> me<00:00:36.719> a

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
not necessarily cuz it's gonna give me a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.930

better review or not but I think when

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.260 
better review or not but I think when
people<00:00:39.180> mainly<00:00:39.450> taste<00:00:40.050> spirits<00:00:40.649> or<00:00:41.430> make
