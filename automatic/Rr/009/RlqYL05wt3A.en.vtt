00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.369
 today we will make a concern for 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:13.900
 lose weight ie europa smoothie which 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.900
 is quite balanced but who 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.090
 allows you to lose weight with the summer that 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.970
 comes to the recipe of a worry 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.340
 completely vegetal which at the same time 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.289
 allows to take a meal at lunch very 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.529
 fast since it only takes a few 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.210
 seconds to be prepared it starts to 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.630
 to make beautiful we want to get in 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.870
 shirt 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.140
 if we want to be really at the top 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.300
 lose some curves in the winter this 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.429
 smoothie for lunch at noon and 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.969
 ideal plan for a small diet 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:48.010
 while remaining completely balanced 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.589
 so I propose a version 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.170
 sweet a yellow smoothie I will make a 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:57.010
 next video with a real concern that 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.859
 will be more so with greens is 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.569
 perhaps more in teeth 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.129
 salty flavors there today we are 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:05.260
 in sugar and because that makes 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.290
 pleasure also tell me sometimes of two 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.640
 sweet breakfasts I offer you a worry 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.320
 with mango 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.150
 so I take frozen mango 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.340
 because that allows it at the same time 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.720
 to have a very fresh smoothie and one 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.600
 not always find fresh mangoes 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.180
 good quality so it's German 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.830
 early cutting found at 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.720
 picard it is super practice a banana 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.250
 to give envy to hits and 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.300
 troubles 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.910
 and then for it to be completely 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.550
 balanced and well I'm using 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.590
 sun warriors brand proteins 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.570
 that he is an American brand of super 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.490
 quality 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.890
 that's the warrior blend that means 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.560
 that it's not just proteins 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.030
 completely vegetable without gluten 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.710
 by the way what allows like that to 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.710
 allergic people to be able to use it 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.630
 but it's in addition to proteins that 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.210
 are enriched with plenty of nutrients 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.090
 in full of good things which allows 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.270
 to really have the energy and 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.460
 the full of 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.750
 good things for the body in 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.129
 this smoothie then for the lion one can 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.780
 take the other coconut if you want 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.760
 something light or milk 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.430
 vegetable me for my part I like the 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.200
 rice milk can also be taken from 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.799
 soy milk why not milk 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.660
 almond 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.730
 there is also milk oat milk 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.750
 hazelnut finally there are heaps but 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.640
 in this recipe 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.400
 I recommend you rather the rice milk 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.700
 nature the almond milk or the milk 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.180
 soy then we will use 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.690
 of course the super to blender mentek he 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.349
 absolute weapon for the worries I'm going 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:49.579
 start with m the lam years and always 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:55.030
 what is the most nagging 1st 2 I'm going 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:55.030
 then put the banana 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.730
 and then I'm going to add the proteins 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.209
 unclassified at revel 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.209
 there is also as a nation 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:33.310
 I will give this 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:36.160
 since yesterday not really finally with 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.180
 this dose of small we close the zip that 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.890
 remains completely closed as needed 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.080
 it can be kept without problem at the shelter of 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:50.800
 light in a closet 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:54.040
 and then I add the rice milk I'm going 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.160
 put at least 500 since at this 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.650
 that there seems to be there after we can 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.820
 always add some according to the texture 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:11.340
 that we want for science po if I 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:15.370
 do I choose wrongly beverage 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:18.790
 selected smoothie we also have the worry 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.410
 xl xxl the normal moussy session 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.840
 even choose if simply 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.900
 and beware of making noise 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.900
 sure 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.750
 Yes 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.690
 that's 24 seconds 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.639
 I think there are still pieces 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:05:04.479
 mango 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:05:06.130
 I check everything so think about the game 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.100
 leave for a ride 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.750
 we will cut for you to avoid this noise 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.500
 but who is it is hard anyway 20 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.360
 seconds it's over now 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.500
 it remains more than to taste on its 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.410
 terrace or so to prevail for his 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.820
 lunch if we work in a 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.820
 office and we do not go home 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.930
 so either pour it into a glass 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.120
 to drink it immediately or in a 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.970
 isothermal shaker like that you 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.710
 take it to your workplace and 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:44.770
 it makes you a great delicious meal 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.630
 hyper balanced and with that you will lose 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.530
 of the pot certainly and you will be the most 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.530
 beautiful in jersey this summer
