B with a headed thing here and here this

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.089 
B with a headed thing here and here this
is<00:00:22.169> a<00:00:22.349> whisk<00:00:23.069> or<00:00:23.339> a<00:00:23.429> ankle<00:00:24.300> weight<00:00:24.569> and<00:00:24.929> this<00:00:25.800> is

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
is a whisk or a ankle weight and this is

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.849 
is a whisk or a ankle weight and this is
a<00:00:26.369> pistol<00:00:26.939> grip<00:00:26.970> with<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.569> smoked<00:00:28.109> part<00:00:28.499> from<00:00:28.800> a

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
a pistol grip with a smoked part from a

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.819 
a pistol grip with a smoked part from a
magic<00:00:29.579> arm<00:00:29.849> or<00:00:30.089> a<00:00:30.119> friction<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.829> articulating

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:31.829 
magic arm or a friction on articulating

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.890 
magic arm or a friction on articulating
arm<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.780> clamp<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.330> this<00:00:36.330> becomes

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
arm and this is a clamp and this becomes

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.610 
arm and this is a clamp and this becomes
basically<00:00:37.470> a<00:00:37.820> Steadicam<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.570> does<00:00:40.440> it

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
basically a Steadicam so does it

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.400 
basically a Steadicam so does it
actually<00:00:40.830> work<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.970> have<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.420> say<00:00:42.630> it<00:00:42.930> actually

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
actually work I have to say it actually

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.260 
actually work I have to say it actually
works<00:00:44.160> quite<00:00:44.300> okay<00:00:45.300> however<00:00:46.670> if<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.910> looks

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
works quite okay however if it looks

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.350 
works quite okay however if it looks
professional<00:00:48.870> its<00:00:49.970> depends<00:00:50.970> on<00:00:51.090> your<00:00:51.150> taste

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
professional its depends on your taste

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.600 
professional its depends on your taste
but<00:00:51.810> probably<00:00:52.470> looks<00:00:52.800> much<00:00:53.280> more

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
but probably looks much more

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.150 
but probably looks much more
professional<00:00:54.030> than<00:00:54.540> the<00:00:54.810> tutorials<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.770> also

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
professional than the tutorials and also

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.190 
professional than the tutorials and also
the<00:00:57.060> hardware<00:00:58.010> made<00:00:59.010> DIY<00:00:59.790> versions<00:01:00.420> because

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
the hardware made DIY versions because

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.440 
the hardware made DIY versions because
these<00:01:01.650> are<00:01:01.950> mostly<00:01:02.310> from<00:01:02.640> standard<00:01:03.090> parts

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
these are mostly from standard parts

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.889 
these are mostly from standard parts
only<00:01:03.900> this<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.829> something<00:01:05.579> that<00:01:06.329> doesn't<00:01:06.659> look

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
only this is something that doesn't look

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.069 
only this is something that doesn't look
that<00:01:07.380> much<00:01:07.950> maybe<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.759> this<00:01:09.090> weight<00:01:09.509> was<00:01:09.810> in

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
that much maybe if this weight was in

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.090 
that much maybe if this weight was in
black<00:01:10.530> was<00:01:11.009> probably<00:01:11.520> slightly<00:01:11.880> better<00:01:13.100> but

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
black was probably slightly better but

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.959 
black was probably slightly better but
the<00:01:14.490> rest<00:01:14.700> arm<00:01:15.119> yeah<00:01:16.109> it<00:01:16.530> doesn't<00:01:16.799> look<00:01:17.009> too

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
the rest arm yeah it doesn't look too

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.649 
the rest arm yeah it doesn't look too
shabby<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:19.549> yeah<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.030> actually<00:01:21.210> use<00:01:21.630> it

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
shabby so yeah have I actually use it

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.770 
shabby so yeah have I actually use it
for<00:01:21.869> filming<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.639> say<00:01:24.469> the<00:01:25.469> 5<00:01:25.799> 6<00:01:26.009> 6<00:01:26.310> TB

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
for filming I have to say the 5 6 6 TB

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.959 
for filming I have to say the 5 6 6 TB
with<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:28.259> added<00:01:28.770> weight<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.219> actually<00:01:29.429> filmed

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:29.969 
with this added weight I actually filmed

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.010 
with this added weight I actually filmed
a<00:01:30.240> movie<00:01:30.659> walking<00:01:31.409> backwards<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.340> stairs

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
a movie walking backwards on the stairs

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.629 
a movie walking backwards on the stairs
basically<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.469> setup<00:01:34.859> and<00:01:35.189> actually

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:35.639 
basically with this setup and actually

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:37.789 
basically with this setup and actually
it<00:01:35.819> works<00:01:36.090> quite<00:01:36.450> well<00:01:36.479> however<00:01:37.079> back<00:01:37.590> then<00:01:37.770> I

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
can use this as a monopod and especially

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.510 
can use this as a monopod and especially
with<00:02:05.369> these<00:02:05.579> free<00:02:05.909> legs<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.389> can<00:02:06.719> stand<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.889> its

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
with these free legs it can stand on its

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.080 
with these free legs it can stand on its
own<00:02:08.940> however<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.690> do<00:02:09.930> not<00:02:10.710> like<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.310> leave<00:02:11.880> it

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
own however I do not like to leave it

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.850 
own however I do not like to leave it
alone

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
alone

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.370 
alone
as<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.460> can<00:02:13.790> easily<00:02:14.060> top<00:02:14.450> over<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.020> fall

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
as it can easily top over and fall

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.730 
as it can easily top over and fall
however<00:02:16.010> using<00:02:16.730> this<00:02:16.880> as<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.150> Steadicam<00:02:18.080> it's

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
however using this as a Steadicam it's

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.810 
however using this as a Steadicam it's
quite<00:02:19.160> okay<00:02:20.080> for<00:02:21.080> slow<00:02:21.320> movement<00:02:21.920> walking

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
quite okay for slow movement walking

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.290 
quite okay for slow movement walking
however<00:02:23.600> running<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.530> have<00:02:24.560> not<00:02:25.070> really<00:02:25.820> tried

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
however running I have not really tried

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.590 
however running I have not really tried
it<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.810> much<00:02:27.170> yet<00:02:27.530> but<00:02:28.010> running<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:28.760> do<00:02:29.060> feel

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
it that much yet but running I do feel

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.600 
it that much yet but running I do feel
like<00:02:29.630> this<00:02:30.620> left<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.430> right<00:02:32.200> yeah

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
like this left and right yeah

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.540 
like this left and right yeah
rotating<00:02:34.690> rotations<00:02:35.690> shake<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:36.350> curse<00:02:37.190> much

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
rotating rotations shake a curse much

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.670 
rotating rotations shake a curse much
more<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.530> it's<00:02:40.150> yeah<00:02:41.150> harder<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.080> counteract

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
more and it's yeah harder to counteract

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.540 
more and it's yeah harder to counteract
while<00:02:43.310> running<00:02:43.959> because<00:02:45.040> walking<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.370> can

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
while running because walking you can

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.840 
while running because walking you can
easily<00:02:46.850> use<00:02:47.600> your<00:02:47.780> arms<00:02:48.110> but<00:02:48.470> running<00:02:49.459> your

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
easily use your arms but running your

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.690 
easily use your arms but running your
whole<00:02:50.720> body<00:02:50.959> shakes<00:02:51.290> too<00:02:51.590> much<00:02:51.800> to<00:02:52.160> counteract

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
whole body shakes too much to counteract

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.770 
whole body shakes too much to counteract
it<00:02:52.880> so<00:02:54.340> also<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.520> like<00:02:55.850> this<00:02:56.150> part<00:02:57.040> may<00:02:58.040> so

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
it so also I like this part may so

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.160 
it so also I like this part may so
because<00:02:59.780> you<00:02:59.959> can<00:03:00.140> now<00:03:00.640> basically<00:03:02.020> hold<00:03:03.020> it

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
because you can now basically hold it

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.440 
because you can now basically hold it
much<00:03:03.380> smaller<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.340> have<00:03:04.700> like<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.030> small

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
much smaller and have like a small

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.420 
much smaller and have like a small
package<00:03:06.040> compared<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.250> those<00:03:07.810> DIY<00:03:08.810> mates<00:03:09.430> I've

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
package compared to those DIY mates I've

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.400 
package compared to those DIY mates I've
seen<00:03:10.700> out<00:03:10.880> there<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:11.720> basically<00:03:11.870> have<00:03:12.260> this

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
seen out there that basically have this

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.030 
seen out there that basically have this
part<00:03:12.830> sticking<00:03:13.640> out<00:03:13.880> so<00:03:14.209> now<00:03:15.170> you<00:03:15.230> have<00:03:15.470> like<00:03:15.739> a

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
part sticking out so now you have like a

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.039 
part sticking out so now you have like a
simple<00:03:16.840> multiple<00:03:17.840> functional<00:03:19.000> yeah<00:03:20.000> kind<00:03:20.930> of

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
simple multiple functional yeah kind of

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.009 
simple multiple functional yeah kind of
a<00:03:21.230> Steadicam<00:03:21.799> with<00:03:22.090> an<00:03:23.090> extra<00:03:23.630> hand

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
a Steadicam with an extra hand

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.140 
a Steadicam with an extra hand
yeah<00:03:24.530> I'm<00:03:24.739> using<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.250> mirror<00:03:25.459> not<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:25.970> show

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
yeah I'm using the mirror not to show

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.110 
yeah I'm using the mirror not to show
it's<00:03:26.390> really<00:03:26.540> steady<00:03:27.140> just<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:28.010> show<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.340> the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
it's really steady just to show you the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.199 
it's really steady just to show you the
transition<00:03:29.959> of<00:03:30.170> that<00:03:30.830> I<00:03:31.040> am<00:03:31.310> actually<00:03:31.850> using

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
transition of that I am actually using

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.289 
transition of that I am actually using
it<00:03:32.480> instead<00:03:32.780> of<00:03:32.989> trying<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:34.010> show<00:03:34.250> a<00:03:34.580> Steadicam

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
it instead of trying to show a Steadicam

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.370 
it instead of trying to show a Steadicam
shot<00:03:35.330> that<00:03:35.720> of<00:03:36.350> it<00:03:36.620> but<00:03:37.269> let's<00:03:38.269> see<00:03:38.540> how<00:03:38.989> it

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
shot that of it but let's see how it

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:46.300 
shot that of it but let's see how it
does<00:03:39.410> so<00:03:40.250> let's<00:03:40.910> go<00:03:41.209> out<00:03:41.480> of<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.720> door<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:45.310> now

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
does so let's go out of the door and now

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.360 
does so let's go out of the door and now
we're<00:03:46.519> using<00:03:46.670> it<00:03:47.650> let's<00:03:48.650> go<00:03:48.830> down<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.190> fire

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
we're using it let's go down the fire

00:03:49.370 --> 00:04:27.150 
we're using it let's go down the fire
stairs

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.700 

so<00:04:28.160> that<00:04:28.460> was<00:04:28.669> it<00:04:28.940> trying<00:04:29.360> it<00:04:29.599> out<00:04:29.750> you<00:04:30.319> see<00:04:30.530> me

so that was it trying it out you see me
walking<00:04:30.949> down<00:04:31.280> stairs<00:04:31.610> with<00:04:31.849> it<00:04:32.410> it's

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
walking down stairs with it it's

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.200 
walking down stairs with it it's
actually<00:04:33.650> okay<00:04:34.479> have<00:04:35.479> to<00:04:35.599> say<00:04:36.669> I'll<00:04:37.669> try<00:04:38.090> to

actually okay have to say I'll try to
make<00:04:39.080> a<00:04:39.319> comparison<00:04:39.710> with<00:04:40.039> all<00:04:40.550> kinds<00:04:41.240> of

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
make a comparison with all kinds of

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.800 
make a comparison with all kinds of
other<00:04:42.009> steadicams<00:04:43.030> because<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.180> also<00:04:44.419> have<00:04:44.660> to

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
other steadicams because I also have to

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.850 
other steadicams because I also have to
take<00:04:45.190> MMC<00:04:46.220> and<00:04:46.490> also<00:04:47.210> ordered<00:04:47.870> a<00:04:47.990> new<00:04:48.590> one

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
take MMC and also ordered a new one

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.189 
take MMC and also ordered a new one
which<00:04:49.190> is<00:04:49.490> close<00:04:49.849> to<00:04:50.150> a<00:04:50.180> flight<00:04:50.599> cam<00:04:50.810> or<00:04:51.020> two

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
which is close to a flight cam or two

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.510 
which is close to a flight cam or two
head<00:04:51.319> cam<00:04:51.560> or<00:04:52.330> from<00:04:53.330> unknown<00:04:53.810> brand<00:04:54.520> yeah
