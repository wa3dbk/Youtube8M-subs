00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.290
 from now on we all have the 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.850
 opportunity to have free water 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.850
 with the agrarian system 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.500
 of rainwater that we present 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.050
 in it both collect the roof and 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.320
 Drive through the canals and downpipes to 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.050
 buried tank will plot here the water 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.660
 of the rain goes through the optimax filter 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.500
 own and goes without turbulence to the 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.500
 tank bottom 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.260
 the water catchment point is located 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.270
 a few centimeters below the surface 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.280
 where we always make sure we get the 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.199
 water of better quality 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.809
 and all the equipment is controlled by the 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.809
 water control system silence 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.610
 this in case of finishing the water of the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.520
 tank with automatically mutates the 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.180
 water limitation of the network 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.190
 and water control equipment silence us 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.040
 allows to distribute the water that we have 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.370
 collected from the rain at each point where 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.440
 is going to be used we can use the water 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.960
 of the rain for everything where not 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.210
 potable water is required we can 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.660
 use high quality free water 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.900
 for the washing machine for the toilet for the 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.930
 cleaning or to water the garden save 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.660
 50% of drinking water and help 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.670
 conserve the environment all with the 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.130
 professional craft system 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.979
 recovery and use of water 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.540
 of rain the modular system graf 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.110
 composed of the following four 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.600
 elements the tank the coverage of the 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.479
 tank where the lid can be even 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.570
 passable by vehicles the unit of 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.060
 filtration and the technical unit starting 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.910
 of these four modules let the 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.580
 graf system suits your exact 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.229
 needs your dealer graf you 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.830
 will provide all the components 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.770
 required 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.110
 of the system thanks to the optimal design of 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.210
 all the components gap our 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.210
 system for water use 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.979
 rain does not need more than a single day 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.620
 to complete your installation 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.290
 let's see how is the assembly and putting 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.510
 team's march the first step is the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.910
 excavation of the land for 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.550
 Tank placement and preparation 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.070
 of the base of the tank according to our 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.010
 assembly instructions we can already 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.960
 deposit the tank making sure that 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.570
 stay perfectly in position 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.070
 horizontal the dome of the tank serves 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.250
 for the connection of all 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.380
 conductions a perfect sealing prevents 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.470
 that could enter filtered water in the 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.900
 earth this is simply placed on 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.610
 the tank and it is spun freely 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.220
 to get the most guidance 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.930
 convenient the time has come for 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.660
 install the second component of 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.180
 our module the filtration unit and 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.090
 security that this contains all the 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.580
 components for cleaning filtration 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.130
 and the drain of excess water 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.550
 we have the drain trap with function 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:12.000
 of defense to small animals the filter 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.690
 Optimax self-cleaning with 95% 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.650
 performance opti cleaning control 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.140
 clean with transparent lid and the 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.040
 quiet influx driving 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.040
 the incoming water 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.879
 now we can connect all this 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.879
 unit to the tank 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.500
 the downspouts of the channels are connected 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.620
 from the roof to the entrance of the tank and the 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.989
 siphon to the drainage system the assembly 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.540
 of these pipes is made 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.450
 through pegs and the patented system 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.390
 assembly expand fix a method 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.000
 extremely fast and without needing 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.459
 use any tool to 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.530
 finish the installation of the tank 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.470
 ride a ride to the interior 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.599
 from the house around here the tube is installed 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.940
 that observes water from the tank with the 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.940
 floating catchment tube 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.180
 optical filter feed and the 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.069
 tank level probe the control of 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.739
 the entire system of use of 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.459
 rainwater craft is made to 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.500
 through the current team center silence 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.750
 This advanced control armored to 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.510
 meeting ensures the functioning of 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.060
 all our devices including 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:34.919
 when we have shortened the water reserve 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:37.350
 the backfilling is vacuum 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.630
 always carry out taking into account that 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.000
 there must be a minimum distance of 30 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.100
 centimeters from the water entrance 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.650
 to the surface of the ground 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.630
 before finally covering the 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.570
 tank we put the accessory 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.790
 telescopic made to measure with the system 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.640
 flexible continuous progression is 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.370
 get an easy and simple adjustment to 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.770
 ground level 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.790
 with a gasket we will seal the tank 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.070
 completely once signaled 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.229
 Visibly the pipes that contain 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.360
 rainwater our system of 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:16.800
 Rainwater recovery graph 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.380
 It is ready save up to 50% water 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.120
 drinking water and protect our environment 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.240
 with the installation of the system 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.290
 professional water recovery 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.290
 the rain craft
