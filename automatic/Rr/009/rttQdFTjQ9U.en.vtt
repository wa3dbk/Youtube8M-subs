00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
this video I'm going to be counting down

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.730 
this video I'm going to be counting down
my<00:00:05.009> top<00:00:05.069> 5<00:00:05.700> most<00:00:05.970> innovative<00:00:06.600> maps<00:00:06.870> in<00:00:07.140> zombies

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
my top 5 most innovative maps in zombies

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.250 
my top 5 most innovative maps in zombies
now<00:00:08.370> bear<00:00:08.639> in<00:00:08.670> mind<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.389> not<00:00:09.420> necessarily

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
now bear in mind this is not necessarily

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.230 
now bear in mind this is not necessarily
a<00:00:10.440> list<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:10.920> innovative<00:00:11.519> maps<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:11.969> turned

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
a list of innovative maps that turned

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.810 
a list of innovative maps that turned
out<00:00:12.480> well<00:00:12.870> but<00:00:13.500> just<00:00:13.679> innovative<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:14.400> general

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
out well but just innovative in general

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.310 
out well but just innovative in general
so<00:00:15.030> these<00:00:15.150> maps<00:00:15.389> had<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.839> bring<00:00:16.020> something

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
so these maps had to bring something

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.980 
so these maps had to bring something
completely<00:00:17.070> new<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.580> table<00:00:17.850> also<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.630> will

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
completely new to the table also I will

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.019 
completely new to the table also I will
not<00:00:19.230> be<00:00:19.439> including<00:00:19.890> knocked<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.760> list

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
not be including knocked on this list

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.120 
not be including knocked on this list
because<00:00:21.480> yes<00:00:21.779> innovative<00:00:22.500> because<00:00:22.859> it's

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
because yes innovative because it's

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.340 
because yes innovative because it's
introducing<00:00:24.090> zombies<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.720> general<00:00:25.109> but<00:00:25.260> it's

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
introducing zombies in general but it's

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.960 
introducing zombies in general but it's
the<00:00:25.470> first<00:00:25.740> nap<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.310> think<00:00:26.369> that's<00:00:26.640> kind<00:00:26.880> of

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the first nap so I think that's kind of

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.240 
the first nap so I think that's kind of
cheating<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.990> starting<00:00:28.380> off<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.740> list<00:00:29.070> at

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
cheating so starting off this list at
