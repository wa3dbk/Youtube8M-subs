County aside from that what we're

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.619 
County aside from that what we're
dealing<00:01:02.100> with<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.730> basically<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.270> cloudy

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
but then as we go through the day we can

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.830 
but then as we go through the day we can
expect<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.850> flurries<00:02:26.240> to<00:02:26.390> taper<00:02:26.600> off<00:02:26.750> by
