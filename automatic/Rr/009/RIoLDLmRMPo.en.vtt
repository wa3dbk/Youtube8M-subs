00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:04.471
I'm heading to bars
that I've rescued

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.206
with the most
delusional owners

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:08.041
to test the concepts
I put in place

00:00:08.107 --> 00:00:10.610
and determine if they've
maintained their success

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.278
or led the bar to failure.

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:14.848
Dimples owner Sal
has fallen back

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:17.317
into alienating women
with his jackass remarks.

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:18.952 align:start size:63% position:38%
Kara's
a horny broad, guys.

00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:20.587 align:start size:53% position:47%
If you're hungry,
here she is.

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.923
But that's no longer
the biggest threat
to his livelihood.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.293
Sal:<i> All of a sudden,
 I get this notice.</i>

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:29.796 line:0%
At 60 days,
you have to vacate.

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:31.598
<i> ( thunder crashes )</i>

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:34.000
<i> The whole
 couple of blocks
 have been bought,</i>

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.469
<i> and the owner has
 decided to tear it down</i>

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.571
<i> and build a big
 apartment complex.</i>

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:40.707
And I've got
nothing to say.

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:42.609 align:start size:84% position:16%
All right,
what's our plan?

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:45.011 align:start size:69% position:31%
The plan is
to find another place.

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.313 align:start size:75% position:25%
Naturally I want to stay
in this area here.

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:50.150 line:0%
Sal is devastated
that we got this
60-day notice.

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:51.384 line:0%
I mean,
this is his life.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.987
<i> He's here six,
 seven days a week</i>

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:55.889
<i> from open to close.</i>

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:57.290
You know,
this is his home.

00:00:57.356 --> 00:01:00.293
So what happens
if we don't find
a place in 60 days?

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.895 align:start size:41% position:59%
We still
keep looking.

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:04.864
Since the "Bar Rescue"
came here, we've been
doing wonderful,

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:08.735
<i> about $5,000 a month more
 than we usually made.</i>

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:12.539
<i> But by having to look
 for another club,</i>

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:16.142
I'm losing about, you know,
$300,000, $400,000.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.645
<i> To buy something
 in 60 days puts
 pressure on you,</i>

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:20.980
<i> and you have
 no negotiation power.</i>

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:24.050 align:start size:56% position:44%
If we ever
do close, which is
the probability,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.387 align:start size:72% position:28%
we just wait and wait
till we can make
a better choice.

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:30.957
<i> Being in business here
 at Dimples 32 years</i>

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:33.426
<i> and doing the same thing
 every night,</i>

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:37.063
<i> it's quite devastating
 to get a notice</i>

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:40.400
<i> to tell me, "You gotta
 move in 60 days."</i>

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:42.202
I have to get rid
of all this.

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:43.703
It's impossible.

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:45.839
I feel terrible
for Sal,

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.474
but if
he had listened to me,

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.043
he'd be in a much
stronger position
to afford a new place.

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:52.212
<i> My new cocktail
 and food menus</i>

00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:54.380
<i> helped him increase
 his revenue a bit,</i>

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.683
<i> but he offset a lot
 of that with the crap</i>

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.118
<i> he brought back
 into the bar</i>

00:01:58.217 --> 00:02:01.121
<i> and his refusal to stop
 perving on his customers,</i>

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.957
which means he
can't get butts in seats.

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:05.792
Sal's in limbo,

00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:07.327
and so is my judgment,

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:10.964
so the jury is out
on Dimples.

00:02:11.063 --> 00:02:11.164
