00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
is an example and all work should be

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.919 
is an example and all work should be
done<00:00:12.960> by<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.349> qualified<00:00:13.830> electrician<00:00:14.929> right

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
done by a qualified electrician right

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.450 
done by a qualified electrician right
the<00:00:16.139> first<00:00:16.350> thing<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.710> needs<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.980> be<00:00:17.100> done<00:00:17.279> is

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
the first thing that needs to be done is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.310 
the first thing that needs to be done is
the<00:00:17.490> 'pliance<00:00:18.000> remove<00:00:18.420> disconnected<00:00:19.230> from

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
the 'pliance remove disconnected from

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.320 
the 'pliance remove disconnected from
the<00:00:19.529> electricity<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.310> now<00:00:20.550> we'll<00:00:20.789> remove<00:00:21.119> the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
the electricity and now we'll remove the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.910 
the electricity and now we'll remove the
backplate<00:00:21.510> I've<00:00:22.050> done<00:00:22.289> done<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.619> screws

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
backplate I've done done the screws

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.509 
backplate I've done done the screws
earlier

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
earlier

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.550 
earlier
so<00:00:24.449> I'll<00:00:24.570> just<00:00:24.750> showing<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.080> where<00:00:25.230> they<00:00:25.410> are

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
so I'll just showing you where they are

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.509 
so I'll just showing you where they are
roughly<00:00:27.380> right<00:00:28.380> now<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.619> need<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.980> peel<00:00:29.250> the

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
roughly right now you need to peel the

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.440 
roughly right now you need to peel the
insulation<00:00:30.090> back<00:00:31.700> and<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:33.030> will<00:00:33.210> give<00:00:33.329> you

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
insulation back and this will give you

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:43.430 
insulation back and this will give you
access<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.260> two<00:00:34.440> screws<00:00:42.020> then<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.260> would

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
access to the two screws then you would

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.950 
access to the two screws then you would
need<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.980> remove<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.760> wiring<00:00:45.000> marking<00:00:45.809> up

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
need to remove the wiring marking up

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.299 
need to remove the wiring marking up
where<00:00:46.230> you're<00:00:46.410> actually<00:00:46.710> taking<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.100> wires

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
where you're actually taking the wires

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:56.470 
where you're actually taking the wires

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.060 

now<00:00:57.480> we're<00:00:57.660> actually<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.320> remove<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
now we're actually going to remove the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.000 
now we're actually going to remove the
element<00:01:01.039> but<00:01:02.039> first<00:01:02.280> I'm<00:01:02.550> going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:04.010> remove

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
element but first I'm going to remove

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:15.070

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.600 

now<00:01:16.909> with<00:01:17.909> these<00:01:18.330> removed<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.710> once<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.340> undo

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
now with these removed and once we undo

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.530 
now with these removed and once we undo
the<00:01:20.790> screws<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.950> plate<00:01:22.950> self<00:01:23.850> clean<00:01:24.150> plate

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the screws the plate self clean plate

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.660 
the screws the plate self clean plate
which<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.020> at<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.320> top<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.740> oven<00:01:25.979> will<00:01:26.460> be

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
which is at the top of the oven will be

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.440 
which is at the top of the oven will be
loose<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.180> well<00:01:27.570> as<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.080> element<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.450> it

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
loose as well as the element so it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.710 
loose as well as the element so it
doesn't<00:01:30.689> matter<00:01:30.810> if<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.079> falls<00:01:31.350> down<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:32.040> it's

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
doesn't matter if it falls down but it's

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.149 
doesn't matter if it falls down but it's
those<00:01:33.720> two<00:01:33.960> screws<00:01:34.259> actually<00:01:34.680> go<00:01:34.799> through<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
those two screws actually go through the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.109 
those two screws actually go through the
self<00:01:35.369> cleaning<00:01:35.579> plate<00:01:40.460> as<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.850> see<00:01:41.970> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
self cleaning plate as you can see the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.780 
self cleaning plate as you can see the
covers<00:01:42.420> loose<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.100> hold<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.399> cover<00:01:44.579> up
