the eggs or larvae I'm not sure the
exact<00:00:59.039> term<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.820> bracketed<00:01:00.449> wasp<00:01:00.800> they

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
exact term of the bracketed wasp they

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.850 
exact term of the bracketed wasp they
basically<00:01:02.340> get<00:01:02.609> laid<00:01:02.930> just<00:01:03.930> attached<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
basically get laid just attached to the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.830 
basically get laid just attached to the
scanner<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.549> slightly<00:01:05.850> into<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> skin<00:01:06.630> of

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
scanner just slightly into the skin of

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.219 
scanner just slightly into the skin of
the<00:01:07.650> tomato<00:01:08.220> hornworm<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.799> as<00:01:11.240> they<00:01:12.240> mature

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the tomato hornworm and as they mature

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.039 
the tomato hornworm and as they mature
and<00:01:13.500> grow<00:01:13.710> they<00:01:14.040> eat<00:01:14.310> their<00:01:14.549> way<00:01:14.670> inside<00:01:15.049> of

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
and grow they eat their way inside of

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.440 
and grow they eat their way inside of
the<00:01:16.140> tomato<00:01:16.439> hornworm<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.970> can<00:01:18.150> see<00:01:18.420> that

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
the tomato hornworm and you can see that

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.719 
the tomato hornworm and you can see that
basically<00:01:19.170> all<00:01:19.470> that's<00:01:19.710> left<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.130> him<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.400> sort

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
basically all that's left of him is sort

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.260 
basically all that's left of him is sort
of<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.970> kind<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.259> know<00:01:22.290> floppy<00:01:23.240> dried<00:01:24.240> out

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
of a kind of you know floppy dried out

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.920 
of a kind of you know floppy dried out
shell<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:26.400> those<00:01:26.640> bracketed<00:01:27.240> wasps<00:01:27.750> have

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
shell so those bracketed wasps have

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.160 
shell so those bracketed wasps have
taken<00:01:28.890> care<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.299> this<00:01:30.299> particular<00:01:30.979> individual

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
taken care of this particular individual

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.810 
taken care of this particular individual
garden<00:01:34.170> pests<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.950> me<00:01:36.079> and<00:01:37.610> just<00:01:38.610> kind<00:01:38.790> of

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
phenomenon here but this was one where

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.780 
phenomenon here but this was one where
you<00:01:51.750> know<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.869> actually<00:01:52.170> got<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> chance<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.579> see

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
you know I actually got a chance to see

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.330 
you know I actually got a chance to see
it<00:01:54.290> after<00:01:55.759> after<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.619> damage<00:01:58.619> was<00:01:58.799> done<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.280> to

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
it after after the damage was done so to

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.190 
it after after the damage was done so to
speak<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.880> caterpillar<00:02:00.479> here<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:00.990> terms

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
speak to the caterpillar here in terms

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.950 
speak to the caterpillar here in terms
of<00:02:01.439> in<00:02:02.100> terms<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:03.090> him<00:02:03.240> being<00:02:03.420> all<00:02:03.570> dried<00:02:03.930> out

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
of in terms of him being all dried out

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.560 
of in terms of him being all dried out
so<00:02:04.380> i<00:02:04.409> thought<00:02:04.619> i<00:02:04.680> would<00:02:04.770> add<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.360> this<00:02:06.360> video
