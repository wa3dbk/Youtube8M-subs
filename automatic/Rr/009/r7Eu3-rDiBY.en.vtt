00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
guess that happens when you walk this

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.980 
guess that happens when you walk this
far<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.200> we<00:01:55.380> put<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> bucket<00:01:56.009> pre<00:01:56.719> pre<00:01:57.719> release

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
