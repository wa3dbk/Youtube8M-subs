or as has a spill proof so long as you

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.740 
or as has a spill proof so long as you
shake<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.620> off<00:02:51.860> shake<00:02:52.130> it<00:02:52.910> off<00:02:53.090> within<00:02:53.360> about

that
but<00:02:56.540> I'm<00:02:56.780> probably<00:02:57.019> not<00:02:57.260> going<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.440> go<00:02:57.590> around

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
but I'm probably not going to go around

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.880 
but I'm probably not going to go around
spilling<00:02:58.280> water<00:02:58.430> on<00:02:58.700> my<00:02:58.900> my<00:02:59.900> netbook<00:03:00.260> it's

spilling water on my my netbook it's

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.050 
spilling water on my my netbook it's
probably<00:03:01.190> not<00:03:01.280> something<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.730> want<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:01.940> be

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
probably not something you want to be

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.680 
probably not something you want to be
doing<00:03:02.920> also<00:03:03.920> it's<00:03:04.190> got<00:03:04.280> Samsung<00:03:04.580> easy<00:03:05.120> I'll

DNA<00:03:10.400> I'm<00:03:10.519> gonna<00:03:10.670> be<00:03:10.760> looking<00:03:11.000> at<00:03:11.060> that<00:03:11.180> that's

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
DNA I'm gonna be looking at that that's

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.250 
DNA I'm gonna be looking at that that's
the<00:03:11.980> share<00:03:12.980> over<00:03:13.220> wireless<00:03:13.489> ad-hoc

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
the share over wireless ad-hoc

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.440 
the share over wireless ad-hoc
thingamajig<00:03:15.260> should<00:03:16.010> be<00:03:16.070> great<00:03:16.450> that's

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
thingamajig should be great that's

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.500 
thingamajig should be great that's
probably<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:18.250> 4.3<00:03:19.250> new<00:03:19.700> pixel<00:03:20.060> camera<00:03:20.239> there

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
probably a 4.3 new pixel camera there

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.820 
probably a 4.3 new pixel camera there
and<00:03:21.470> yeah<00:03:22.459> so<00:03:22.640> this<00:03:22.760> this<00:03:23.230> this<00:03:24.230> package<00:03:24.620> comes

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
and yeah so this this this package comes

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.460 
and yeah so this this this package comes
with<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.280> atom<00:03:26.090> Intel<00:03:26.450> in<00:03:27.910> 55<00:03:28.910> 50<00:03:29.299> which<00:03:30.290> is<00:03:30.320> a

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
with the atom Intel in 55 50 which is a

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.830 
with the atom Intel in 55 50 which is a
dual-core<00:03:30.799> it's<00:03:31.519> onboard<00:03:31.880> graphics<00:03:32.090> I

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
dual-core it's onboard graphics I

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.080 
dual-core it's onboard graphics I
believe<00:03:33.820> 250<00:03:34.820> GB<00:03:35.000> hard<00:03:35.269> drive<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:36.320> a<00:03:36.850> 1-1<00:03:37.850> gig

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
believe 250 GB hard drive and a 1-1 gig

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.759 
believe 250 GB hard drive and a 1-1 gig
ram<00:03:38.480> expandable<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:40.870> expendable<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:42.049> to<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:42.530> I

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
ram expandable to expendable to to you I

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.060 
ram expandable to expendable to to you I
believe<00:03:43.580> that's<00:03:43.700> de<00:03:44.030> r3<00:03:44.660> but<00:03:44.900> it's<00:03:45.830> probably

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
believe that's de r3 but it's probably

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.670 
believe that's de r3 but it's probably
better<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.060> go<00:03:47.180> with<00:03:47.330> ddr2<00:03:47.930> or<00:03:48.350> something

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
better to go with ddr2 or something

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.379 
better to go with ddr2 or something
which<00:03:48.799> everyone<00:03:48.920> says<00:03:49.820> more<00:03:50.090> batteries

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
which everyone says more batteries

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.550 
which everyone says more batteries
that's<00:03:51.260> what<00:03:51.410> I'm<00:03:51.500> after

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
that's what I'm after

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.450 
that's what I'm after
so<00:03:53.100> yeah<00:03:53.220> lots<00:03:53.550> of<00:03:53.670> lots<00:03:54.000> of<00:03:54.120> keyboard<00:03:54.480> space

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
so yeah lots of lots of keyboard space

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.820 
so yeah lots of lots of keyboard space
yeah<00:03:56.490> we've<00:03:56.790> got<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.180> home<00:03:57.990> keys<00:03:58.260> down<00:03:58.500> here

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
yeah we've got the home keys down here

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.480 
yeah we've got the home keys down here
which<00:03:59.580> you<00:03:59.700> probably<00:03:59.880> saw<00:04:00.150> before<00:04:01.340> it's<00:04:02.340> got

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
which you probably saw before it's got

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.930 
which you probably saw before it's got
all<00:04:02.670> your<00:04:03.020> extra<00:04:04.020> functions<00:04:04.410> at<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.560> top<00:04:04.940> I

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
all your extra functions at the top I

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.150 
all your extra functions at the top I
did<00:04:06.390> want<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.660> a<00:04:06.690> keyboard<00:04:07.020> with<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.620> home<00:04:07.920> and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
did want to a keyboard with the home and

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.820 
did want to a keyboard with the home and
end<00:04:08.550> because<00:04:09.120> I'll<00:04:09.750> probably<00:04:09.990> be<00:04:10.320> using<00:04:10.350> it<00:04:10.740> to

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
end because I'll probably be using it to

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.550 
end because I'll probably be using it to
do<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:10.980> lot<00:04:11.280> of<00:04:11.310> typing<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.930> know<00:04:13.050> doing

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
do a lot of typing and you know doing

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.400 
do a lot of typing and you know doing
shift<00:04:13.860> I'll<00:04:14.310> probably<00:04:14.550> have<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.820> press<00:04:15.410> FN

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
shift I'll probably have to press FN

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.330 
shift I'll probably have to press FN
ctrl<00:04:17.130> shift<00:04:17.390> to<00:04:18.390> do<00:04:18.540> like<00:04:18.810> a<00:04:19.340> complete

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
ctrl shift to do like a complete

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.180 
ctrl shift to do like a complete
document<00:04:20.959> select<00:04:21.959> which<00:04:22.680> is<00:04:22.830> actually<00:04:23.160> very

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
document select which is actually very

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.530 
document select which is actually very
useful<00:04:23.550> if<00:04:23.850> you<00:04:23.940> want<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.150> copy<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.480> whole

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
useful if you want to copy the whole

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.230 
useful if you want to copy the whole
document<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.169> then<00:04:25.320> just<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.280> know<00:04:26.310> paste<00:04:27.000> it

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
document and then just you know paste it

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.500 
document and then just you know paste it
to<00:04:27.570> a<00:04:27.600> blog<00:04:27.870> online<00:04:28.080> or<00:04:28.410> something<00:04:28.680> like<00:04:28.770> that

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
to a blog online or something like that

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.360 
to a blog online or something like that
so<00:04:30.510> yeah<00:04:30.660> that's<00:04:31.169> the<00:04:31.290> model<00:04:31.470> a<00:04:31.770> quick<00:04:32.100> review

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
so yeah that's the model a quick review

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
hopefully you can get to board like that

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.470 
hopefully you can get to board like that
I'm<00:04:35.070> going<00:04:35.190> to<00:04:35.280> plug<00:04:35.430> it<00:04:35.520> in<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:35.820> give<00:04:36.030> it<00:04:36.060> a<00:04:36.150> go

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
I'm going to plug it in and give it a go
