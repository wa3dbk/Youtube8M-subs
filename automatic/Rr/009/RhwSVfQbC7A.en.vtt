but<00:00:35.850> if<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.120> ask<00:00:36.239> me<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.540> think<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:37.050> looks<00:00:37.260> too

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
but if you ask me I think that looks too

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.619 
but if you ask me I think that looks too
small<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.309> don't<00:00:38.730> usually<00:00:38.820> bear<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.480> like

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
small so I don't usually bear it like

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.479 
small so I don't usually bear it like
that<00:00:39.780> no<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.050> don't<00:00:40.440> think<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.680> wear<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:40.950> out<00:00:41.190> but

that no I don't think I wear it out but

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.220 
that no I don't think I wear it out but
I'd<00:00:41.940> where<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.239> usually<00:00:42.840> wear<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.200> just

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
I'd where I usually wear it just

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.959 
I'd where I usually wear it just
connected<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.040> other<00:00:44.160> side<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.760> use<00:00:44.940> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
connected to the other side and I use it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.270 
connected to the other side and I use it
as<00:00:45.180> an<00:00:45.329> accessory<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:46.020> my<00:00:46.110> pocketbook<00:00:46.469> so

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
what's in it let's take a look so I have

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.700 
what's in it let's take a look so I have
it<00:00:50.399> pretty<00:00:50.579> packed<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.239> can<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:52.590> know

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
it pretty packed as you can see you know

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.380 
it pretty packed as you can see you know
turn<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.100> around<00:00:53.160> here<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.789> get<00:00:53.940> surprises

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
turn it around here so you get surprises

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.600 
turn it around here so you get surprises
can<00:00:54.570> see<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.440> pretty<00:00:55.649> bad<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.370> I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
can see but it's pretty bad so I

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.479 
can see but it's pretty bad so I
wouldn't<00:00:57.239> recommend<00:00:57.739> putting<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.129> pact

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
wouldn't recommend putting it this pact

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.490 
wouldn't recommend putting it this pact
only<00:00:59.879> because<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.329> makes<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.899> harder<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.230> find

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
only because it makes it harder to find

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.189 
only because it makes it harder to find
the<00:01:01.649> stuff<00:01:01.859> inside<00:01:02.180> but<00:01:03.180> let's<00:01:03.780> take<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> look

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199
