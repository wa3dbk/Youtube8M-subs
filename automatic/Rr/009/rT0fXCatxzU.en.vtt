00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.850
 Yes Hi High I will do training for the improvement of jumping ability today as well 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:12.940
 I will 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:14.470
 I think that is which way do without the center of gravity me when you jump you I probably higher resting 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.120
 Hey, in this kind of Fu 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:21.940
 On my left foot 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:24.780
 I always get on trying to fly high in the center of gravity 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.780
 Have 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:34.640
 I think there are also people with this right foot 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.640
 People who always fly over the center of gravity to the right leg say to Jean 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.490
 To tap and get out 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:49.990
 People who always have their center of gravity on their left foot 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:51.800
 It is better to expect also the muscle exercise practice of jumping with the right foot 20 team 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.670
 I will do it 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:00.500
 At the time of the class tribe which we put on center of gravity first 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.310
 Make sure your pelvic knees and toes are in line 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.870
 On the ground 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.300
 Straight 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.330
 I hope the door will come out with load 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.590
 I will practice 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.710
 First of all 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.710
 The center of gravity that I always go is easy 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:24.480
 As it jumped up 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.480
 And this time the opposite is the opposite 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.240
 If you have a right foot 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:35.570
 I bit the pelvis 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:39.250
 Your knees and toes may not be in a straight line. 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.740
 I think I can not push the ground straight 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:47.159
 Because it is better to have it straight 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.159
 I will do it consciously to be as straight as possible 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.920
 In by replacing the foot also to jump 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.909
 eh 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.490
 th 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.890
 eh 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.569
 I do n't like this practice 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.450
 The theme is to jump high with one foot 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:26.660
 Because 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.660
 Just make time for a little to jump up 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.020
 After making time for reverse 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.240
 I hope you will fly 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.850
 Please 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.650
 Straight 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.740
 For g men 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.970
 Place and fly up 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.970
 Please keep this in mind 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.120
 that's all
