00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
battering ram need this is where you

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.500 
can be an AI or it can be your friend as
pens<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:42.220> don't<00:03:42.400> have<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.610> manually<00:03:43.150> just

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
pens and you don't have to manually just

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.790 
pens and you don't have to manually just
hit<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.840> same<00:03:44.049> key<00:03:44.320> at<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.530> same<00:03:44.739> time<00:03:44.950> like

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
hit the same key at the same time like

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.410 
hit the same key at the same time like
down<00:03:47.050> and<00:03:48.050> it's<00:03:48.260> that's<00:03:48.920> kind<00:03:49.250> of<00:03:49.280> fun<00:03:49.550> but<00:03:49.880> you

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
down and it's that's kind of fun but you

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.630 
down and it's that's kind of fun but you
guess<00:03:50.600> a<00:03:50.630> bit<00:03:50.750> repetitive<00:03:51.080> you<00:03:51.560> now<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:54.640> this

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
guess a bit repetitive you now and this

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.400 
guess a bit repetitive you now and this
is<00:03:55.850> this<00:03:56.270> is<00:03:56.450> kind<00:03:56.720> of<00:03:56.780> where<00:03:56.960> you<00:03:57.140> really

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
is this is kind of where you really

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.320 
is this is kind of where you really
start<00:03:57.470> not<00:03:57.890> at<00:03:58.040> our<00:03:58.160> passage<00:03:58.640> of<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.940> gamers

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
start not at our passage of the gamers

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.180 
start not at our passage of the gamers
where<00:03:59.570> you<00:03:59.660> just<00:03:59.810> keep<00:04:00.020> doing<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.440> same<00:04:00.470> combo

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
where you just keep doing the same combo

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.550 
where you just keep doing the same combo
over<00:04:01.640> and<00:04:01.760> over<00:04:01.880> again<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.390> kill<00:04:02.600> them<00:04:02.780> and

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
over and over again to kill them and

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.700 
over and over again to kill them and
it's<00:04:03.770> like<00:04:04.690> I'm<00:04:05.690> trying<00:04:05.780> to<00:04:06.290> I'm<00:04:06.320> trying<00:04:06.470> to

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 
it's like I'm trying to I'm trying to

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.690 
it's like I'm trying to I'm trying to
figure<00:04:06.920> out<00:04:06.950> you<00:04:07.130> know<00:04:07.160> if<00:04:07.310> there's<00:04:07.430> any<00:04:07.610> other

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
figure out you know if there's any other

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.060 
figure out you know if there's any other
way<00:04:07.880> you<00:04:08.060> can<00:04:08.270> kill<00:04:08.510> them<00:04:08.690> so<00:04:09.080> I<00:04:09.110> eventually<00:04:09.890> I

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
way you can kill them so I eventually I

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.340 
way you can kill them so I eventually I
pick<00:04:10.250> up<00:04:10.370> another<00:04:10.580> weapon<00:04:10.820> and<00:04:11.330> like<00:04:11.570> you<00:04:12.320> know

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
pick up another weapon and like you know

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.920 
pick up another weapon and like you know
maybe<00:04:12.740> this<00:04:12.860> is<00:04:13.190> different<00:04:13.640> things<00:04:14.180> but<00:04:14.510> it's

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
maybe this is different things but it's

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.509 
maybe this is different things but it's
basically<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.410> exact<00:04:15.740> same<00:04:15.920> combo<00:04:16.310> there's

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
basically the exact same combo there's

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.009 
basically the exact same combo there's
now<00:04:16.640> there's<00:04:16.850> this<00:04:16.940> little<00:04:17.150> Perry<00:04:17.510> move<00:04:17.810> which

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
now there's this little Perry move which

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.440 
now there's this little Perry move which
is<00:04:18.140> why<00:04:18.290> you<00:04:18.350> you<00:04:19.310> kind<00:04:19.459> of<00:04:19.609> both<00:04:19.940> attack<00:04:20.299> at

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
is why you you kind of both attack at

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.849 
is why you you kind of both attack at
the<00:04:20.510> same<00:04:20.690> time<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.230> you<00:04:21.290> just<00:04:21.320> have<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.739> do

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
the same time and you just have to do

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.540 
the same time and you just have to do
the<00:04:21.890> same<00:04:22.160> key<00:04:22.460> so<00:04:23.230> it's<00:04:24.230> it's<00:04:24.620> a<00:04:24.770> fun<00:04:25.010> game<00:04:25.040> but

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
the same key so it's it's a fun game but

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.640 
the same key so it's it's a fun game but
the<00:04:25.850> same<00:04:26.060> time<00:04:26.300> do<00:04:26.660> this<00:04:26.870> is<00:04:27.140> so<00:04:27.320> repetitive

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
the same time do this is so repetitive

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.580 
the same time do this is so repetitive
and<00:04:28.250> you<00:04:28.430> just<00:04:28.580> kind<00:04:28.790> of<00:04:29.170> hit<00:04:30.170> in<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.380> same

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
and you just kind of hit in the same

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.740 
and you just kind of hit in the same
cheese<00:04:30.860> over<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:31.370> over<00:04:31.460> again<00:04:31.670> and<00:04:32.060> it's<00:04:32.570> not

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
cheese over and over again and it's not

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.930 
cheese over and over again and it's not
really<00:04:32.960> challenging<00:04:33.680> well<00:04:34.580> that's<00:04:34.760> why<00:04:34.910> I

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
really challenging well that's why I

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.060 
really challenging well that's why I
fought<00:04:35.030> anyway<00:04:35.510> until<00:04:35.660> you<00:04:36.170> know<00:04:36.290> whilst

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
fought anyway until you know whilst

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.860 
fought anyway until you know whilst
playing<00:04:37.220> this<00:04:37.490> I<00:04:37.670> was<00:04:37.760> just<00:04:37.910> like<00:04:38.060> this<00:04:38.330> is<00:04:38.390> not

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
playing this I was just like this is not

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.740 
playing this I was just like this is not
to<00:04:39.050> have<00:04:39.290> been<00:04:39.640> when<00:04:40.640> you<00:04:40.850> doing<00:04:41.180> that<00:04:41.360> you<00:04:41.540> all

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750

to have been when you doing that you all
like<00:04:42.110> at<00:04:42.350> the<00:04:42.470> end<00:04:42.500> of<00:04:42.620> that<00:04:42.740> mission<00:04:42.950> you

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
like at the end of that mission you

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.800 
like at the end of that mission you
fight<00:04:43.370> this<00:04:43.520> boss<00:04:43.760> and<00:04:44.060> as<00:04:44.420> you<00:04:44.540> can<00:04:44.660> see<00:04:44.690> I'm

just<00:04:44.990> getting<00:04:45.170> my<00:04:45.200> ass<00:04:45.410> kicked<00:04:45.650> it's<00:04:46.310> really

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
just getting my ass kicked it's really

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.290 
just getting my ass kicked it's really
hard<00:04:47.240> and<00:04:48.520> especially<00:04:49.520> got<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:49.850> difficulty

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
hard and especially got the difficulty

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.240 
hard and especially got the difficulty
pie<00:04:50.450> it's<00:04:50.660> just<00:04:50.890> ridiculously<00:04:51.890> hard<00:04:52.070> and<00:04:52.220> I

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
pie it's just ridiculously hard and I

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.530 
pie it's just ridiculously hard and I
got<00:04:52.400> to<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.550> point<00:04:52.669> where<00:04:52.910> I<00:04:52.940> just<00:04:53.000> my<00:04:53.270> slot

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
got to the point where I just my slot

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.000 
got to the point where I just my slot
wasn't<00:04:53.900> doing<00:04:54.080> anything<00:04:54.260> in<00:04:54.470> actually<00:04:54.770> broke

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
wasn't doing anything in actually broke

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.220 
wasn't doing anything in actually broke
