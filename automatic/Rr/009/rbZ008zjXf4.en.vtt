this<00:00:35.300> it's<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.450> camera<00:00:36.899> accessory<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.469> we

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
this it's a camera accessory that we

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.950 
this it's a camera accessory that we
insert<00:00:38.070> into<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.340> optical<00:00:38.820> path<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.540> allow<00:00:39.780> us

to<00:00:39.989> manipulate<00:00:40.260> an<00:00:40.829> image<00:00:43.010> but<00:00:44.010> what<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.309> all

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
to manipulate an image but what is all

how does this help it reduces the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.330 
how does this help it reduces the

haziness of images in daylight it also

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.429 
haziness of images in daylight it also
helps<00:01:20.700> get<00:01:20.850> rid<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.000> something<00:01:21.240> called<00:01:21.570> purple

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
helps get rid of something called purple

off

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.820 

instead<00:01:48.460> what<00:01:49.460> does<00:01:49.670> it<00:01:49.820> do

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
instead what does it do

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.860 
instead what does it do
now<00:01:51.830> polarization<00:01:52.580> is<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.670> huge<00:01:52.940> topic<00:01:53.150> but<00:01:53.780> the

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
now polarization is a huge topic but the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.210 
now polarization is a huge topic but the
basics<00:01:54.230> that<00:01:54.320> you've<00:01:54.470> gotta<00:01:54.680> know<00:01:54.860> is<00:01:55.040> that

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
basics that you've gotta know is that

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.500 
basics that you've gotta know is that
reflected<00:01:55.640> light<00:01:55.790> waves<00:01:56.000> travel

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
reflected light waves travel

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.690 
reflected light waves travel
horizontally<00:01:56.660> and<00:01:57.350> this<00:01:57.620> glass<00:01:57.800> only<00:01:58.250> lets<00:01:58.550> in

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
horizontally and this glass only lets in

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.480 
horizontally and this glass only lets in
vertical<00:01:59.180> waves<00:01:59.330> which<00:01:59.900> means<00:02:00.260> less<00:02:01.250> light

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
vertical waves which means less light

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.530 
vertical waves which means less light
gets<00:02:01.520> into<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.060> lens

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
gets into the lens

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.980 
gets into the lens
it's<00:02:02.660> like<00:02:02.810> sunglasses<00:02:03.160> for<00:02:04.160> your<00:02:04.340> camera<00:02:04.990> but

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
it's like sunglasses for your camera but

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.040 
it's like sunglasses for your camera but
is<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.320> more<00:02:06.470> light<00:02:06.710> better<00:02:07.600> not<00:02:08.600> always

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
is it more light better not always

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.080 
is it more light better not always

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.610 
natural colors what else does it do it
allows<00:03:35.360> you<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.600> slow<00:03:35.810> shutter<00:03:36.110> speed

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
allows you to slow shutter speed

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.259 
allows you to slow shutter speed
increasing<00:03:37.099> image<00:03:37.370> detail<00:03:37.760> and<00:03:37.940> motion<00:03:38.209> blur

increasing image detail and motion blur
but<00:03:38.629> what<00:03:38.810> is<00:03:38.959> a<00:03:38.989> good<00:03:39.260> form<00:03:39.590> well<00:03:40.010> if<00:03:40.099> you<00:03:40.190> want

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
but what is a good form well if you want

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.920 
but what is a good form well if you want
to<00:03:40.400> take<00:03:40.580> a<00:03:40.610> picture<00:03:40.849> of<00:03:41.000> an<00:03:41.090> empty<00:03:41.239> street<00:03:41.599> but

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
to take a picture of an empty street but

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.210 
to take a picture of an empty street but
can<00:03:42.140> because<00:03:42.470> they're<00:03:42.620> pedestrian<00:03:43.040> you're

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
can because they're pedestrian you're

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.160 
can because they're pedestrian you're
gonna<00:03:43.459> just<00:03:43.879> slap<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.120> neutral<00:03:44.540> density<00:03:44.599> filter

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
gonna just slap a neutral density filter

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.900 
gonna just slap a neutral density filter
on<00:03:45.290> there<00:03:45.440> slow<00:03:45.980> down<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.250> shutter<00:03:46.400> speed<00:03:46.580> and

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
on there slow down the shutter speed and

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.460 
on there slow down the shutter speed and
eventually<00:03:47.330> wipe<00:03:47.660> away<00:03:47.780> all<00:03:48.080> the<00:03:48.140> moving

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
eventually wipe away all the moving

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.900 
eventually wipe away all the moving
objects<00:03:48.800> from<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:49.010> frame<00:03:49.250> it's<00:03:49.670> like<00:03:49.849> a

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
objects from the frame it's like a

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.720 
objects from the frame it's like a
battery<00:03:50.319> ok<00:03:52.120> yeah<00:03:53.120> yeah<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:54.019> is<00:03:54.430> it's<00:03:55.430> also<00:03:55.580> a

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
battery ok yeah yeah it is it's also a

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.160 
battery ok yeah yeah it is it's also a
great<00:03:55.879> lens<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.239> use<00:03:56.390> for<00:03:56.629> seascapes<00:03:57.019> and

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
great lens to use for seascapes and

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.390 
great lens to use for seascapes and
landscapes<00:03:57.620> because<00:03:57.830> you<00:03:58.010> can<00:03:58.160> lower<00:03:58.310> the

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
landscapes because you can lower the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.650
