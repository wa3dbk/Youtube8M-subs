you<00:00:27.449> now<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.830> control<00:00:29.220> settings<00:00:29.699> that's

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
you now the control settings that's

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.450 
you now the control settings that's
another<00:00:30.990> step<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.830> do<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.279> would

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
another step you have to do you would

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.780 
another step you have to do you would
have<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.850> make<00:00:33.090> both<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.340> cartridge<00:00:35.340> one<00:00:35.550> and

many times it's so annoying as hell now

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.319 
many times it's so annoying as hell now
let's<00:01:34.170> try<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.409> get<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.009> easier<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.150> actually

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
let's try to get the easier to actually

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:43.160 
let's try to get the easier to actually
work<00:01:37.250> what<00:01:38.250> I'm<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.790> do<00:01:38.970> right<00:01:39.000> now

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.570 

what<00:01:44.170> first<00:01:44.470> thing<00:01:44.680> that<00:01:44.830> you<00:01:44.950> notice<00:01:45.159> when

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
what first thing that you notice when

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.030 
what first thing that you notice when
you<00:01:45.729> get<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.180> connected<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.530> pop-up<00:01:48.009> window

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
you get it connected the pop-up window

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.810 
you get it connected the pop-up window
pops<00:01:48.700> up<00:01:48.880> automatically<00:01:49.509> the<00:01:49.689> first<00:01:49.930> time<00:01:50.200> so

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
pops up automatically the first time so

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.639 
pops up automatically the first time so
so<00:01:51.820> you<00:01:51.909> don't<00:01:51.939> have<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.360> rabo<00:01:52.720> uploading<00:01:53.560> it

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
so you don't have the rabo uploading it

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.080 
so you don't have the rabo uploading it
again<00:01:53.890> in<00:01:54.070> tow<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:57.070> when<00:01:57.640> you<00:01:57.789> get<00:01:57.970> up

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
again in tow you so when you get up

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.050 
again in tow you so when you get up
there<00:01:58.890> one<00:01:59.890> thing<00:02:00.130> you'll<00:02:00.310> notice<00:02:00.490> that<00:02:00.670> was

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
there one thing you'll notice that was

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.630 
there one thing you'll notice that was
only<00:02:01.299> one<00:02:01.630> of<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.930> cards<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.590> all<00:02:02.979> that<00:02:03.310> does

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
only one of the cards of all that does

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.149 
only one of the cards of all that does
not<00:02:03.789> work<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:04.299> it's<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.539> 5p<00:02:05.049> wings<00:02:05.320> I<00:02:05.590> tried

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
not work and it's the 5p wings I tried

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.279 
not work and it's the 5p wings I tried
that<00:02:06.189> so<00:02:06.580> many<00:02:06.880> times<00:02:07.240> it<00:02:07.539> just<00:02:07.570> doesn't<00:02:08.170> want

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
that so many times it just doesn't want

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.859 
that so many times it just doesn't want
to<00:02:08.350> work<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:08.800> it's<00:02:09.580> best<00:02:10.060> that<00:02:10.269> you<00:02:10.330> not<00:02:10.569> try

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
to work so it's best that you not try

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.860 
to work so it's best that you not try
that<00:02:10.899> one<00:02:11.230> so<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.250> peeling<00:02:12.640> this<00:02:13.330> is<00:02:13.480> what<00:02:13.720> I'm

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
that one so the peeling this is what I'm

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.009 
that one so the peeling this is what I'm
going<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.080> do<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.830> try<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.100> out<00:02:15.840> which<00:02:16.840> will

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
going to do to try it out which will

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.870 
going to do to try it out which will
work<00:02:17.350> flawlessly<00:02:19.440> so<00:02:20.440> there<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:20.890> go<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.700> will

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
work flawlessly so there you go it will

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.930 
work flawlessly so there you go it will
connect<00:02:22.239> like<00:02:22.450> that<00:02:22.980> see<00:02:23.980> once<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.640> got<00:02:24.910> that
