00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.149

 and two lubián terminals today I wanted 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.940
 tell you about various news 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.339
 I started it has been a pretty week 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.379
 interesting and especially updates 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.600
 and of new applications the first 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.720
 extend the application this social that 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.460
 use facebook to gather people from 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.790
 same interest that takes more or less 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.260
 close then extend Mr. rudy the 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.830
 creator of sistán and other applications 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.960
 pretty good because toads his 6 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.750
 tend and a few days had to 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.060
 withdrawing it was because tending told him that 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.250
 had to withdraw it seems that at 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.530
 final what will remain is that rudy is 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.100
 has joined the group to tend to have 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.230
 an official application so we wait 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.590
 soon he has that application and 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.710
 that we can use it because each one with 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.350
 what what you like most good other 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.880
 update is 6 is in the boy 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.440
 ruiz our almost favorite programmer 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.440
 you are updating all your applications 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.470
 every time they are better and then the last 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.960
 update those that allow us to go to 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.000
 give us like or not like the photographs 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.850
 so you know if you like this to go 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.400
 scoring the finger of facebook because 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.860
 we have it insists then we have a 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.410
 widget update which are the 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.120
 truth is that in Spain he has not had a 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.540
 expansion as expected is that 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:32.740
 bet because I remember some 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.540
 functions like month type and everything but this 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.210
 has been there a little half-way here in 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.400
 Spain but the truth is that in Asia it has 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.950
 given very strong and keeps updating what 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.960
 now we will be able to create groups of more 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.320
 of 100 people I think I do not have one hundred 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.000
 sorry friends and send messages to 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.440
 many more people say that we were 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.150
 forward a message not only do we have to 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.270
 send only one person but we're going 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.539
 to be able to send it to several 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.219
 so nothing a more equal update 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.159
 that whatsapp that is not an update 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:08.080
 but it is a rumor and that inside 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:10.330
 let little power on the back of the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.799
 night to personalize them in that way 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.530
 by the people who like the most person 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:17.260
 have more personalized your mobile 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.599
 with this is one more option is not a 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.060
 option the truth that gives us many 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.709
 improvements but good is always appreciated and 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.709
 There are people who like to have a lot 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.750
 personalized everything on your mobile then 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.430
 also since we are talking about the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.410
 applications is to be able 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.420
 communicate to communicate that of 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.670
 talk about skype to skype the truth is 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.890
 which is very well integrated in windows 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.319
 phone every time I buy it microsoft makes 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.470
 a time and has it integrated into windows 8 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.079
 and in windows with 8.1 because the truth is 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.060
 that is very integrated you can lower the 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.549
 application works very well and I wanted 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.079
 tell you how great the news came out now 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.579
 that counts percent of calls 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.600
 international and is doing with 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.030
 skype 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.960
 has stayed a little behind the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.870
 whatsapp but I think if you use 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.950
 It works very well and it is clear that 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.200
 to make calls to do 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.340
 video calls and lately with the 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.530
 latest updates that have made 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.180
 even to be able to send messages and 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.160
 use it as we use whatsapp or 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.260
 whatsapp works really well 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.910
 then there has been this week presentation 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.890
 of results has a lot of company 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.930
 has presented results microsoft have 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.370
 achieved record sales revenue 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.470
 both surface that I like it 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.290
 the income from sufferings have been 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.840
 doubled more than doubled 400 million 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.980
 at 800 and peak millions and the output of 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.380
 the crisis when the truth is that it has 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.100
 been pretty good my opinion follows 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:46.340
 being liked more prison 4 but 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.260
 well the xbox one will fall some day and I 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.620
 I will buy and sure I liked a 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.080
 heap and then also nokia presented 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.550
 your results have had benefits 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.420
 but he did not say how many phones he has sold 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.120
 It is estimated that about 72 million of Nokia 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.550
 Lumia are being sold but you can see that 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.530
 with this that soon they are going to 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.060
 happen to microsoft because they have not 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.710
 wanted to give this data and has stayed 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.380
 a little bit of emptiness this is this 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.350
 results presentation 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.840

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.490
