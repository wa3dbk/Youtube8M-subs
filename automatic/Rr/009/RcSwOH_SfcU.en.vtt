anyways<00:03:40.680> um<00:03:41.040> so<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:42.420> think<00:03:42.870> those<00:03:43.349> were<00:03:43.590> the

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
anyways um so I think those were the

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.619 
anyways um so I think those were the
reasons<00:03:44.129> for<00:03:44.160> my<00:03:44.340> two<00:03:44.730> stalls<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.390> then<00:03:45.480> as

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
reasons for my two stalls and then as

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.890 
reasons for my two stalls and then as
far<00:03:45.870> as<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.110> game<00:03:46.319> could<00:03:46.769> be<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:48.450> we<00:03:48.599> can't

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
far as the game could be and we can't

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.319 
far as the game could be and we can't
pinpoint<00:03:49.140> as<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.769> why<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:49.950> have<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.430> game<00:03:50.670> the

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
pinpoint as to why I have the game the

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.890 
pinpoint as to why I have the game the
only<00:03:51.810> thing<00:03:52.049> that<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:52.440> can<00:03:53.180> get<00:03:54.180> remotely<00:03:54.599> close
