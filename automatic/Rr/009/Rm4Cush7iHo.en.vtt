shoulder and skies are darkening up just
a<00:02:17.820> little<00:02:18.030> bit<00:02:18.180> more<00:02:18.390> but<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.840> big<00:02:19.110> noticeable

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
a little bit more but the big noticeable

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.500 
a little bit more but the big noticeable
changes<00:02:19.980> here<00:02:20.190> have<00:02:20.610> been<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.000> wind<00:02:21.270> the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
changes here have been the wind the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.060 
changes here have been the wind the
winds<00:02:21.750> are<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> lot<00:02:22.020> stronger<00:02:22.320> on<00:02:22.590> my<00:02:22.620> back<00:02:22.890> out

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
winds are a lot stronger on my back out

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.130 
winds are a lot stronger on my back out
of<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.250> south<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.940> also<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.510> humidity<00:02:25.020> is

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
of the south and also the humidity is

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.290 
of the south and also the humidity is
increasing<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.740> little<00:02:25.830> bit<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:26.700> storm

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
increasing a little bit so this storm

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.670 
increasing a little bit so this storm
system<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.660> we've<00:02:27.840> been<00:02:27.960> speaking<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.500> is

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
system that we've been speaking of is

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.680 
system that we've been speaking of is
definitely<00:02:29.070> quite<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.550> moisture<00:02:30.000> pump<00:02:30.240> it's

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
definitely quite a moisture pump it's

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.420 
definitely quite a moisture pump it's
coming<00:02:31.080> up<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.290> lot<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.470> warm<00:02:31.770> moist<00:02:31.980> air<00:02:32.250> and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
coming up a lot of warm moist air and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.920 
coming up a lot of warm moist air and
that's<00:02:32.580> something<00:02:32.970> if<00:02:33.270> you've<00:02:33.450> been<00:02:33.600> out<00:02:33.720> over

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
that's something if you've been out over

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.450 
that's something if you've been out over
the<00:02:34.020> past<00:02:34.200> couple<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.740> days<00:02:34.890> really<00:02:35.160> hasn't

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
the past couple of days really hasn't

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.550 
the past couple of days really hasn't
been<00:02:35.640> around<00:02:36.000> really<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.420> good<00:02:37.110> shot<00:02:37.410> at

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
been around really a good shot at

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.110 
been around really a good shot at
humidity<00:02:38.040> here<00:02:38.220> over<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.460> past<00:02:38.490> couple<00:02:38.820> of

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
humidity here over the past couple of

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.030 
humidity here over the past couple of
days<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.570> that's<00:02:40.080> what<00:02:40.470> we<00:02:40.560> mean<00:02:40.650> we<00:02:40.800> talked

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
days and that's what we mean we talked

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.470 
days and that's what we mean we talked
about<00:02:41.130> dew<00:02:41.400> point<00:02:41.670> which<00:02:41.820> is<00:02:41.970> simply<00:02:42.300> the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
about dew point which is simply the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.840 
about dew point which is simply the
measure<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.230> water<00:02:43.650> or<00:02:43.800> water<00:02:44.220> vapor<00:02:44.520> in<00:02:44.820> the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
measure of a water or water vapor in the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.790 
measure of a water or water vapor in the
atmosphere<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:46.080> more<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.620> have

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
atmosphere and the more of that you have

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.440 
atmosphere and the more of that you have
unfortunately<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.760> more<00:02:47.910> fuel<00:02:48.210> for

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
unfortunately the more fuel for

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.270 
unfortunately the more fuel for
thunderstorms<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.680> as<00:02:49.830> bill<00:02:49.980> was<00:02:50.010> telling

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.180 
several cloud strokes to each cloud but
also<00:04:51.850> several<00:04:52.540> cloud<00:04:52.900> to<00:04:53.200> ground<00:04:53.230> strokes<00:04:54.010> so

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
also several cloud to ground strokes so

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.890 
also several cloud to ground strokes so
that<00:04:54.220> means<00:04:54.550> there's<00:04:55.270> some<00:04:55.390> severe<00:04:55.690> weather

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
that means there's some severe weather

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.390 
that means there's some severe weather
out<00:04:56.110> there<00:04:56.320> and<00:04:56.380> there<00:04:56.560> is<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:56.770> potential<00:04:57.070> for

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
out there and there is the potential for

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.680 
out there and there is the potential for
lightning<00:04:57.730> of<00:04:57.970> course<00:04:58.150> they're<00:04:58.330> coming<00:04:58.570> down

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
lightning of course they're coming down

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.180 
lightning of course they're coming down
to<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:58.900> earth<00:04:58.990> so<00:04:59.170> be<00:04:59.290> careful<00:04:59.680> as<00:05:00.040> you<00:05:00.070> can

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190

70s but what we have seen in the past
couple<00:05:12.970> of<00:05:13.210> hours<00:05:13.330> is<00:05:13.690> an<00:05:14.080> increase<00:05:14.410> in<00:05:14.440> the

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
couple of hours is an increase in the

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.830 
couple of hours is an increase in the
relative<00:05:14.800> humidity<00:05:15.160> notice<00:05:16.150> in<00:05:16.330> through<00:05:16.540> here

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.590 
relative humidity notice in through here
we<00:05:17.410> do<00:05:17.560> see<00:05:17.770> about<00:05:17.920> 60%<00:05:18.760> it<00:05:18.850> was<00:05:18.940> about<00:05:19.150> 52

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
we do see about 60% it was about 52

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.570 
we do see about 60% it was about 52
before<00:05:20.200> so<00:05:20.470> the<00:05:20.680> moisture<00:05:21.010> is<00:05:21.100> coming<00:05:21.280> in

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
before so the moisture is coming in

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.740 
before so the moisture is coming in
that's<00:05:21.940> a<00:05:22.120> sign<00:05:22.330> that<00:05:22.360> we<00:05:22.570> have<00:05:22.660> an

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
that's a sign that we have an

that's a sign that we have an
approaching<00:05:23.170> frontal<00:05:23.440> system<00:05:23.830> let's<00:05:24.250> talk<00:05:24.490> a

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
approaching frontal system let's talk a

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.890 
approaching frontal system let's talk a
little<00:05:24.670> bit<00:05:24.850> about<00:05:25.120> the<00:05:25.270> weather<00:05:25.420> pattern

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
little bit about the weather pattern

the most part the Rocky Mountains have

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.400 
the most part the Rocky Mountains have
been<00:05:33.910> squeezing<00:05:34.360> a<00:05:34.450> lot<00:05:34.630> of<00:05:34.750> the<00:05:34.810> moisture<00:05:35.230> out

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.020 
been squeezing a lot of the moisture out
of<00:05:35.680> those<00:05:35.890> weather<00:05:36.130> systems<00:05:36.610> and<00:05:36.760> by<00:05:36.820> time

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
of those weather systems and by time

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.070 
of those weather systems and by time
they<00:05:37.180> make<00:05:37.300> their<00:05:37.450> way<00:05:37.540> into<00:05:37.690> the<00:05:37.750> plain

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
they make their way into the plain

degrees<00:07:33.779> so<00:07:34.379> we've<00:07:35.009> had<00:07:35.219> ourselves<00:07:35.339> a<00:07:35.849> squall

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 
degrees so we've had ourselves a squall

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.490 
degrees so we've had ourselves a squall
