well<00:00:23.970> we're<00:00:24.150> getting<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.420> big<00:00:25.140> growth<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.710 
well we're getting a big growth in the
flat<00:00:26.070> water<00:00:26.220> paddling<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.760> there<00:00:27.359> was<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> call

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
flat water paddling and there was a call

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.300 
flat water paddling and there was a call
for<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.990> board<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.320> was<00:00:28.410> fast<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:28.949> flat<00:00:28.980> water

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
for a board that was fast on flat water

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.669 
for a board that was fast on flat water
but<00:00:29.789> really<00:00:30.090> stable<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:31.320> wanted<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> make

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
but really stable and we wanted to make

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.260 
but really stable and we wanted to make
it<00:00:31.830> as<00:00:31.920> compact<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.399> possible<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.000> was<00:00:33.149> easy

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
it as compact as possible so it was easy

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.790 
it as compact as possible so it was easy
to<00:00:33.390> manage<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.110> put<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.410> roof<00:00:34.559> racks

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
to manage and put on the roof racks

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.950 
to manage and put on the roof racks
store<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.820> that's<00:00:36.360> where<00:00:36.570> we<00:00:36.660> came<00:00:36.750> up<00:00:36.870> with

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
store and that's where we came up with

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.569 
store and that's where we came up with
the<00:00:37.079> right

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
the right

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.819 
the right
you<00:00:38.579> took<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.969> volume<00:00:39.120> very<00:00:39.960> much<00:00:40.200> out<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
you took the volume very much out on the

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.560 
you took the volume very much out on the
rail<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.280> can<00:00:41.460> see<00:00:41.700> here<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.059> board<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.420> very

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
rail you can see here the board is very

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.760 
rail you can see here the board is very
stable<00:00:43.070> we<00:00:44.070> have<00:00:44.250> quite<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> bit<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.440> nose<00:00:46.440> width

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
stable we have quite a bit of nose width

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.479 
stable we have quite a bit of nose width
here<00:00:47.219> around<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.910> area<00:00:48.950> slightly<00:00:49.950> round<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
here around this area slightly round the

here around this area slightly round the
bottom<00:00:50.700> shape<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.390> little<00:00:52.140> bit<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.590> piercing

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
bottom shape a little bit of a piercing

bottom shape a little bit of a piercing
bow<00:00:53.489> not<00:00:53.730> too<00:00:53.879> much<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:55.160> what<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.309> did<00:00:56.520> we

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
bow not too much and what we did we

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.849 
bow not too much and what we did we
learned<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.510> lot<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.809> our<00:00:57.930> race<00:00:58.199> development

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
learned a lot in our race development

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.729 
learned a lot in our race development
about<00:00:59.129> bottom<00:00:59.489> lines<00:01:00.170> Skoob<00:01:01.170> rocker<00:01:01.410> lines

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
about bottom lines Skoob rocker lines

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.070 
about bottom lines Skoob rocker lines
and<00:01:02.039> we<00:01:02.520> actually<00:01:02.699> incorporated<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.840> this

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
and we actually incorporated in this

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.070 
and we actually incorporated in this
shape<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.920> same<00:01:05.189> sort<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.640> scoop<00:01:06.570> rocker<00:01:06.810> line

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
shape the same sort of scoop rocker line

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.929 
shape the same sort of scoop rocker line
that<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.500> are<00:01:07.650> using<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.130> our<00:01:08.280> race<00:01:08.549> boards

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
that we are using on our race boards

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.270 
that we are using on our race boards
this<00:01:09.510> allows<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.290> board<00:01:10.530> especially<00:01:10.830> when

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
this allows the board especially when

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.250 
this allows the board especially when
it's<00:01:11.400> not<00:01:11.430> pure<00:01:11.820> flat<00:01:12.119> water<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.600> pitch<00:01:12.869> over

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
it's not pure flat water to pitch over

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.080 
it's not pure flat water to pitch over
the<00:01:13.350> waves<00:01:13.560> we're<00:01:14.010> using<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.430> similar<00:01:14.820> scoop

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
the waves we're using a similar scoop

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.550 
the waves we're using a similar scoop
rocker<00:01:15.330> line<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> right<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.380> we're

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
rocker line on the right that we're

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.030 
rocker line on the right that we're
using<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:17.100> our<00:01:17.250> fly<00:01:17.670> race<00:01:17.970> boards<00:01:18.650> it's<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.799> very

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
using on our fly race boards it's a very

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.649 
using on our fly race boards it's a very
slight<00:01:20.340> curve<00:01:20.700> through<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.150> whole<00:01:21.330> board

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
slight curve through the whole board

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.749 
slight curve through the whole board
which<00:01:21.990> allows<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.530> board<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.770> pitch<00:01:23.100> over<00:01:23.340> top

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
which allows the board to pitch over top

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.300 
which allows the board to pitch over top
and<00:01:24.030> gives<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.780> very<00:01:24.900> clean<00:01:25.320> release<00:01:25.680> through

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
and gives a very clean release through

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.890 
and gives a very clean release through
the<00:01:26.460> tail<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.939> there's<00:01:27.119> no<00:01:27.299> wake<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.750> we<00:01:27.810> were

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the tail so there's no wake so we were

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.100 
the tail so there's no wake so we were
pretty<00:01:28.170> quick<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.770> board<00:01:29.750> comes<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.960> two

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
pretty quick on this board comes in two

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.200 
pretty quick on this board comes in two
sizes<00:01:31.619> eleven<00:01:32.100> oh<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.400> twelve<00:01:32.670> oh<00:01:32.880> so

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210

roof racks easy to store so we tried to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.550 
roof racks easy to store so we tried to
take<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.600> properties<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.170> race<00:01:52.320> board

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
take the properties of the race board

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.730 
take the properties of the race board
and<00:01:52.770> bring<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.310> as<00:01:53.460> compact<00:01:53.850> as<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.270> could<00:01:54.710> so<00:01:55.710> a

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
and bring it as compact as we could so a
