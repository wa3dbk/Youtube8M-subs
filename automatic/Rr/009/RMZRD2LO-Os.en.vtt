 it's in that all the changes 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.970
 all this is stronger in the second half 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.079
 but a police source 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.229
 there are only elites as to expectations why I need more 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.599
 take for example the psychotropic evaluation committee the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.269
 damages 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.050
 who approved the antidepressant paxil 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.130
 every 6 4 members of this committee have financial links with the industry 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.310
 pharmaceutical 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.660
 here the conflicts of interest have become so common that they ended up 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.300
 to provoke a certificate from the congress 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.980
 web but it's not like a victim would have leaned 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.460
 m up the group proposes to pay damages 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.819
 in order to keep abreast of this festive week 

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:44.520
 in order to meditate for the dry flights but spectacular fardc 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.580
 and three percent 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.870
 this party does not entice the world daniel maric cm1227 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.450
 nothing really is happening 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.819
 and this network of financial conflict of interest between psychiatry 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:00.500
 the pharmaceutical industry and the fda 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.510
 it's even reinforced in 1992 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.630
 with the vote of the law on the tax for users of psychotropic drugs 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.630
 still called the bdv fr 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.870
 thanks to this law the fda can receive a fee of $ 100,000 part 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.910
 than formerly to accelerate his approval 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.550
 and put it in the hands of psychiatrists and doctors faster 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.550
 than ever 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.520
 these find affidÃ©s 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.119
 I come so far from the election as to mister schmitt who like that he 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.380
 must also stop the cardinal also welcomed an audience young woman 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.960
 had been inspected 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.960

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.680
 and create 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.940
 and why not hide me 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.060
 a month ago in china less 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.770
 we see that his mission ends, ie what to do 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.100
 and this approval system 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100
 has been established to the detriment of the safety of the cyclo-cross 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.930
 since the busy ubs was approved the time spent to evaluate 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.169
 a psychotropic rose from everyone in 1992 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.359
 at just six months four years later 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.359
 while the number of new cases what three points 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.980
 a quick approval jacques disastrous for public safety 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.569
 they allow psychiatrists and the pharmaceutical industry 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.199
 because faster a psychotropic and approved faster it will bring back

 every day a psychotropic earns on average over that comma 7 million 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:36.949
 of dollars 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.899
 the zyprexa for example 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.009
 millions of dollars every day 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:45.139
 and even though it was a million-dollar factor for every new 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:46.349
 psychotropic 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.040
 this accelerated approval procedure and the most used that 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.669
