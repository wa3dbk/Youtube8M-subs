00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.330
 gian paolo tomassone two words on the fly 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.400
 on your very long experience perhaps 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.090
 one of the most beautiful booths richer than 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.630
 appetizing of shg but what we like 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.939
 know your opinion first opinion on 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.519
 this our experiment at the forum of 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.580
 Assago spaces as it is obvious that it was 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.369
 much wider, much more livable 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.920
 I will say more without ready to increase 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.870
 I still know if the organizer is me 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.850
 he is interviewing in the shops but second 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.829
 I'm ready for a jump yet 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.239
 more broadly we say that this phase 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.340
 intermediate 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.180
 maybe it was already to do two years ago e 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.550
 without being pushed to become the real fair 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.190
 of the musical instrument in short, useless 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.449
 hiding behind a finger is obvious 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.059
 they will be happy with these two words 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.980
 however I like to know though instead of up 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.129
 of you on your tools on how 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.049
 that response from the public what 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.280
 how it went if it's always worth that 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.260
 the phrase made but being there is 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.909
 indispensable barely adds to 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.580
 end of the evening when you still shoot 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.700
 sums in all senses see that it 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.430
 effort that I believe is mandatory for 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.680
 demonstrate affection for the event 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.180
 has been amply repaid 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.000
 and then anyway they are the contacts that is the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.130
 understand that there is 6 in an event 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.079
 important because now it is so 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.540
 absolute therefore lacking would be foolish 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.890
 and we try to do it better then already 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.259
 let's make the effort to do it 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.360
 partially showing what 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.549
 I represent that I believe this 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.770
 effort your our etcetera have 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.390
 there is also much talk of a crisis 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.790
 of what also has a value for 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.650
 look for book of vegetables to resist 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.260
 such as 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.450
 according to you but I think it will be the 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.000
 moment of who really has something from 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.090
 say to the market maybe it will finally be 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.190
 recognized as a true leader in 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.930
 all the senses not only in words but also 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.470
 right in the commercial measures 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.450
 which will slowly be eliminated 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.030
 people who are marginal units of the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.830
 stair market leading up 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.690
 disaffection because they do not create the right 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.700
 movement ie they create more problems than 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.160
 advantages therefore is not to wish death 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.810
 no one but wish those who remain both 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.090
 always led to give a message 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.020
 positive to student music as po 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.260
 the same thing with exhibitions 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:34.010
 thanks thanks for being used 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.010
 condition but thanks to you thank you
