00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
6715 on this map we clutched it out the

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.020 
6715 on this map we clutched it out the
end<00:03:51.380> of<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.530> game<00:03:51.560> I'd<00:03:51.950> like<00:03:52.400> four<00:03:52.610> calves<00:03:52.850> and

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
end of the game I'd like four calves and

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.310 
end of the game I'd like four calves and
six<00:03:53.180> defends<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:53.660> we<00:03:53.720> end<00:03:53.840> up<00:03:53.900> saving<00:03:54.110> it

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
six defends and we end up saving it

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.350 
six defends and we end up saving it
because<00:03:54.560> of<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:55.130> killstreaks<00:03:55.580> and<00:03:55.850> the

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
because of the the killstreaks and the
