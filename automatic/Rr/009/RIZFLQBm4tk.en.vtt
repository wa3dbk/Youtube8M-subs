silver car and the bighead carp we're in
the<00:00:15.959> system<00:00:16.350> when<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.950> started<00:00:17.490> back<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:17.760> the

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.030 
the system when I started back in the

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.110 
the system when I started back in the
early<00:00:18.330> 90s<00:00:18.920> I<00:00:19.920> believe<00:00:20.730> 95

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.120 
early 90s I believe 95

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.270 
early 90s I believe 95
they<00:00:22.690> you<00:00:22.990> know<00:00:23.020> we<00:00:23.260> started<00:00:23.500> seeing<00:00:23.800> higher

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:24.280 
they you know we started seeing higher

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.240 
they you know we started seeing higher
numbers

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
numbers

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.780 
numbers
and<00:00:26.700> around<00:00:27.030> 2,000<00:00:27.840> really<00:00:28.170> jumped<00:00:28.950> up<00:00:29.100> so<00:00:29.430> I

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:29.790 
and around 2,000 really jumped up so I

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.089 
and around 2,000 really jumped up so I
hate<00:00:30.180> to<00:00:30.330> call<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.720> success<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.440> for<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
hate to call it a success but for the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.319 
hate to call it a success but for the
fish<00:00:32.310> certainly<00:00:32.910> was<00:00:33.090> they<00:00:33.570> did<00:00:33.989> really<00:00:34.200> well

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.450 

some<00:00:36.629> locals<00:00:37.170> tell<00:00:37.440> me<00:00:37.559> they've<00:00:38.100> seen<00:00:38.309> him

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
some locals tell me they've seen him

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.189 
some locals tell me they've seen him
jump<00:00:38.609> in<00:00:38.789> the<00:00:38.879> damn<00:00:39.089> that<00:00:39.390> Bernadotte<00:00:39.839> so

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
jump in the damn that Bernadotte so

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.229 
jump in the damn that Bernadotte so
they're<00:00:40.829> definitely<00:00:41.039> up<00:00:41.429> streaming<00:00:41.940> up<00:00:42.059> those

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
they're definitely up streaming up those

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.810 
they're definitely up streaming up those
tributaries<00:00:42.769> so<00:00:43.769> it<00:00:43.920> only<00:00:44.039> makes<00:00:44.159> sense<00:00:44.399> they

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
tributaries so it only makes sense they

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.520 
tributaries so it only makes sense they
can<00:00:45.000> make<00:00:45.179> it<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.479> the<00:00:45.809> Great<00:00:46.049> Lakes<00:00:46.289> and

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
can make it to the Great Lakes and

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.740 
can make it to the Great Lakes and
beyond<00:00:48.949> well<00:00:49.949> we<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.460> them<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.539> don't

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
beyond well we have them and you don't

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.200 
beyond well we have them and you don't
one<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.109> it<00:00:52.289> here's<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.680> data<00:00:52.859> if<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.879> look<00:00:54.059> at

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
one of it here's the data if you look at

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.450 
one of it here's the data if you look at
their<00:00:54.390> native<00:00:54.780> range<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.350> China<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:56.250> go<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
their native range in China just go to

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.189 
their native range in China just go to
the<00:00:56.640> literature<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.149> find<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.539> silver<00:00:57.839> carps

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the literature you find the silver carps

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.109 
the literature you find the silver carps
range<00:00:58.530> over<00:00:58.859> there<00:00:59.010> goes<00:00:59.339> all<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.609> way<00:00:59.850> into

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:00.119 
range over there goes all the way into

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:02.899 
range over there goes all the way into
Siberia<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.769> mere<00:01:02.039> river<00:01:02.339> and<00:01:02.640> then<00:01:02.729> if<00:01:02.820> you

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
Siberia the a mere river and then if you

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.299 
Siberia the a mere river and then if you
just<00:01:03.119> simply<00:01:03.299> draw<00:01:03.659> a<00:01:03.989> parallel<00:01:04.769> line<00:01:04.799> around

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
just simply draw a parallel line around

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.330 
just simply draw a parallel line around
the<00:01:05.460> earth<00:01:05.929> the<00:01:06.929> southern<00:01:07.409> tip<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.950> their

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the earth the southern tip of their

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.730 
the earth the southern tip of their
range<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.819> China<00:01:09.119> sits<00:01:09.539> about<00:01:09.780> at<00:01:09.960> Chicago<00:01:10.530> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
range in China sits about at Chicago and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.620 
range in China sits about at Chicago and
would<00:01:11.429> run<00:01:11.610> all<00:01:11.789> the<00:01:11.909> way<00:01:11.940> north<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.360> about

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
would run all the way north to about

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.139 
would run all the way north to about
Hudson<00:01:12.990> Bay<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.399> mean<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> flag<00:01:14.970> is

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
Hudson Bay and so I mean the flag is

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.730 
Hudson Bay and so I mean the flag is
there<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.569> immediately<00:01:16.170> goes<00:01:16.440> up<00:01:16.619> because

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
there it's immediately goes up because

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.710 
there it's immediately goes up because
it<00:01:17.009> could<00:01:17.130> really<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.970> has<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> potential<00:01:18.630> of

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
it could really it has a potential of

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.510 
it could really it has a potential of
upsetting<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.319> entire<00:01:19.619> salmon<00:01:20.039> fishery<00:01:20.369> when

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
upsetting the entire salmon fishery when

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.160 
upsetting the entire salmon fishery when
you<00:01:20.610> when<00:01:20.850> you're<00:01:20.970> talking<00:01:21.330> about<00:01:21.539> food<00:01:21.869> chain

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you when you're talking about food chain

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.550 
you when you're talking about food chain
issues<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.789> large<00:01:24.270> critter<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.319> this

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
issues and a large critter like this

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.499 
issues and a large critter like this
that<00:01:25.799> consumes<00:01:26.190> a<00:01:26.340> lot<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.640> food<00:01:26.850> with<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
that consumes a lot of food with a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.419 
that consumes a lot of food with a
tremendous<00:01:27.990> biomass<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.860> takes<00:01:29.069> a<00:01:29.220> a

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
tremendous biomass that takes a a

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.070 
tremendous biomass that takes a a
tremendous<00:01:30.299> amount<00:01:30.569> of<00:01:30.659> food<00:01:30.750> out<00:01:30.929> of<00:01:30.959> the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
tremendous amount of food out of the

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.930 
tremendous amount of food out of the
water<00:01:31.319> and<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:32.190> has<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.399> come<00:01:32.580> from<00:01:32.759> somewhere

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
water and it has to come from somewhere

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.850 
water and it has to come from somewhere
and<00:01:33.709> with<00:01:34.709> natural<00:01:35.130> reproduction<00:01:35.580> being

and with natural reproduction being

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.199 
and with natural reproduction being
probably<00:01:37.860> way<00:01:38.549> more<00:01:38.810> prolific<00:01:39.810> than<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
probably way more prolific than the

probably way more prolific than the

about<00:04:34.560> 8<00:04:34.740> million<00:04:34.949> dollars<00:04:35.490> it's<00:04:35.759> a<00:04:35.820> lot<00:04:35.940> of

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
about 8 million dollars it's a lot of

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.850 
about 8 million dollars it's a lot of
money<00:04:36.330> but<00:04:36.780> when<00:04:36.960> you<00:04:37.050> weigh<00:04:37.259> that<00:04:37.409> against

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
money but when you weigh that against

money but when you weigh that against
what<00:04:38.039> the<00:04:38.159> impact<00:04:38.639> would<00:04:38.849> be<00:04:38.909> on<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.240> Great

20 years we were looking at trying to

20 years we were looking at trying to

and<00:05:11.580> now<00:05:12.330> these<00:05:12.510> things<00:05:12.840> come<00:05:13.080> along<00:05:13.350> and<00:05:13.620> we

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
and now these things come along and we

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.250 
and now these things come along and we
got<00:05:13.950> us<00:05:14.070> a<00:05:14.190> second<00:05:15.090> think<00:05:15.270> all<00:05:15.420> that<00:05:15.630> it's

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
got us a second think all that it's

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.870 
got us a second think all that it's
possible<00:05:16.530> in<00:05:16.890> time<00:05:17.070> that<00:05:17.280> these<00:05:17.370> would<00:05:17.640> sort

possible in time that these would sort
of<00:05:17.940> settle<00:05:18.330> back<00:05:18.540> into<00:05:19.970> the<00:05:20.970> background<00:05:21.570> if

of settle back into the background if

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.960 
of settle back into the background if
you<00:05:21.900> will<00:05:22.110> and<00:05:22.320> be<00:05:22.500> more<00:05:23.040> like<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.460> common

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
you will and be more like the common

you will and be more like the common
carpet<00:05:24.510> for<00:05:25.140> the<00:05:25.230> rest<00:05:25.410> of<00:05:25.530> our<00:05:25.770> natural

lifetime these things are going to be a

lifetime these things are going to be a
