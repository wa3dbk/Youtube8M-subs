okay<00:00:00.960> so<00:00:01.380> the<00:00:01.530> first<00:00:01.740> step<00:00:02.070> in<00:00:02.929> detailing<00:00:03.929> the

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
okay so the first step in detailing the

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.290 
okay so the first step in detailing the
window<00:00:04.350> is<00:00:04.790> to<00:00:05.870> determine<00:00:07.880> as<00:00:08.880> we<00:00:09.059> talked

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
window is to determine as we talked

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.450 
window is to determine as we talked
about<00:00:09.420> earlier<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.110> determine<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.980> interface

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
about earlier to determine the interface

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.870 
about earlier to determine the interface
between<00:00:11.700> your<00:00:12.030> cladding<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:13.070> your<00:00:14.070> trim<00:00:14.670> work

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
between your cladding and your trim work

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.560 
between your cladding and your trim work
and<00:00:15.350> once<00:00:16.350> you've<00:00:16.500> done<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:16.910> to<00:00:17.910> determine

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
and once you've done that to determine

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.830 
and once you've done that to determine
your<00:00:19.560> head<00:00:19.890> flashing<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:21.000> I've<00:00:21.180> previously

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
your head flashing so I've previously

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.890 
your head flashing so I've previously
made<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.560> tip<00:00:22.740> flashing<00:00:23.310> up<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:24.119> extends<00:00:24.689> past

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
made the tip flashing up it extends past

that region put the the flashing on

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.459 
that region put the the flashing on
while<00:00:47.789> it's<00:00:47.940> still<00:00:48.180> wet<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.750> then<00:00:49.260> put

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
while it's still wet and then put

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.110 
while it's still wet and then put
another<00:00:49.500> band<00:00:49.980> over<00:00:50.340> top<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.789> we'll<00:00:50.910> go<00:00:51.090> ahead

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
another band over top so we'll go ahead

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.180 
another band over top so we'll go ahead
and<00:00:51.449> do<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.809> now<00:00:54.590> do<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.070> get<00:00:56.250> rid<00:00:56.489> of

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
and do that now do I have to get rid of

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.050 
and do that now do I have to get rid of
previous<00:00:59.190> plug<00:01:00.379> hardened<00:01:01.379> plug<00:01:03.589> this<00:01:04.589> stub

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
previous plug hardened plug this stub

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.090 
previous plug hardened plug this stub
this<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.210> now<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:07.110> know<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.710> won't<00:01:07.830> seem<00:01:08.070> like

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
this is now I know it won't seem like

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.840 
this is now I know it won't seem like
this<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> videos<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.450> day<00:01:10.850> three

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
this on the videos but this is day three

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.000 
this on the videos but this is day three
that<00:01:12.210> I've<00:01:12.330> been<00:01:12.450> working<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.200> open

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
that I've been working with this open

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.219 
that I've been working with this open
basically<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:14.970> forming<00:01:15.540> about<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> quarter

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
basically it's forming about a quarter

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.730 
basically it's forming about a quarter
of<00:01:16.409> inch<00:01:16.560> plug<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.790> edge<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.110> then<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
of inch plug on the edge and then the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.520 
of inch plug on the edge and then the
rest<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.220> completely<00:01:21.060> usable<00:01:21.810> still<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.350> it's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
rest is completely usable still so it's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.160 
rest is completely usable still so it's
it's<00:01:23.400> pretty<00:01:23.580> nice<00:01:23.850> from<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.689> point<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.990> view

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
it's pretty nice from that point of view

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.350 
it's pretty nice from that point of view
at<00:01:25.610> last<00:01:26.610> quite<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.939> while<00:01:28.880> very<00:01:29.880> little<00:01:30.240> of

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
at last quite a while very little of

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.230 
at last quite a while very little of
this<00:01:30.450> left<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.079> I'm<00:01:31.170> putting<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.710> sparingly

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.580 

at<00:01:38.240> this<00:01:38.450> point<00:01:38.810> this<00:01:38.960> is<00:01:39.020> just<00:01:39.170> to

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
at this point this is just to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.640 
at this point this is just to
demonstrate<00:01:40.300> this<00:01:41.300> is<00:01:41.360> already<00:01:41.870> a<00:01:42.050> water<00:01:42.350> and

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
demonstrate this is already a water and

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:54.370 
demonstrate this is already a water and
airtight<00:01:42.980> assembly<00:01:45.190> okay<00:01:46.190> I<00:01:52.180> can<00:01:53.180> see<00:01:53.450> without

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
airtight assembly okay I can see without

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.790 
airtight assembly okay I can see without
splash<00:01:55.010> anything<00:01:55.550> out<00:01:55.670> from<00:01:55.940> behind<00:01:56.800> the

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
splash anything out from behind the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.220 
splash anything out from behind the
perfect<00:01:58.520> we<00:01:58.820> don't<00:01:58.850> want<00:01:59.120> to<00:01:59.210> over<00:01:59.660> squeeze<00:01:59.990> it

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
perfect we don't want to over squeeze it

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.950 
perfect we don't want to over squeeze it
but<00:02:00.640> obviously<00:02:01.640> we<00:02:02.030> want<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.240> make<00:02:02.390> contact

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
but obviously we want to make contact

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.920 
but obviously we want to make contact
and<00:02:03.650> then<00:02:04.100> we<00:02:04.310> would<00:02:04.460> just<00:02:04.520> trawl<00:02:04.970> or<00:02:05.360> some

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
and then we would just trawl or some

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.740 
and then we would just trawl or some
caulk<00:02:06.170> on<00:02:06.380> some<00:02:07.280> fast<00:02:07.580> flash<00:02:08.920> over<00:02:09.920> top<00:02:10.750> and

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
caulk on some fast flash over top and

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.000 
caulk on some fast flash over top and
trawl<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:12.950> out<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:15.250> we'd<00:02:16.250> have<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.459> nice

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
trawl that out and we'd have a nice

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:26.490 
trawl that out and we'd have a nice
watertight<00:02:19.010> scene<00:02:22.930> I'm<00:02:23.930> coming<00:02:24.260> down<00:02:24.560> Oh

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
watertight scene I'm coming down Oh

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.780 
watertight scene I'm coming down Oh
about<00:02:27.500> an<00:02:27.800> inch<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.280> half<00:02:28.310> two<00:02:28.760> inches

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
about an inch and a half two inches

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
having been taking a building envelope

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.130 
having been taking a building envelope
course<00:02:34.940> at<00:02:35.900> BCIT<00:02:36.470> it's<00:02:36.950> actually<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.340> lab<00:02:38.140> where

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
course at BCIT it's actually a lab where

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.670 
course at BCIT it's actually a lab where
we<00:02:39.170> have<00:02:39.530> been<00:02:39.769> detailing<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:41.170> wall<00:02:42.170> using

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
we have been detailing a wall using

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.280 
we have been detailing a wall using
traditional<00:02:42.890> sheathing<00:02:43.730> materials<00:02:44.390> like<00:02:44.720> tie

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
traditional sheathing materials like tie

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.600 
traditional sheathing materials like tie
back<00:02:45.590> type<00:02:45.920> are<00:02:46.480> I<00:02:47.500> can<00:02:48.500> tell<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.130> is<00:02:49.400> a

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
back type are I can tell you this is a

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:57.160 
back type are I can tell you this is a
lot<00:02:50.030> faster<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:51.170> lot<00:02:52.130> easier<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:54.110> believe<00:02:56.170> it

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
lot faster a lot easier and I believe it

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.970 
lot faster a lot easier and I believe it
does<00:02:57.830> a<00:02:58.190> much<00:02:58.280> easier<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.660> better<00:03:00.560> job

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
does a much easier and better job

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.160 
does a much easier and better job
there's<00:03:01.340> as<00:03:02.060> I've<00:03:02.600> been<00:03:02.690> saying<00:03:02.959> all<00:03:03.110> along

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
there's as I've been saying all along

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.990 
there's as I've been saying all along
there's<00:03:03.650> no<00:03:03.800> such<00:03:04.070> thing<00:03:04.400> as<00:03:04.610> reverse

this<00:03:49.670> wasn't<00:03:50.090> thinking<00:03:50.450> for<00:03:50.660> a<00:03:50.690> second<00:03:52.960> okay

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960

thought<00:04:12.500> you'll<00:04:13.220> remember<00:04:13.550> we<00:04:13.850> doubled<00:04:14.240> up

the trim I'm not going to actually
finish<00:05:58.400> the<00:05:58.639> trim<00:05:58.879> because<00:05:59.840> I<00:06:00.020> want<00:06:00.229> to<00:06:00.259> be

flashing<00:06:28.909> I've<00:06:29.840> only<00:06:30.110> demonstrated<00:06:30.979> the

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:31.129 
flashing I've only demonstrated the

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:33.760 
flashing I've only demonstrated the
installation<00:06:31.940> of<00:06:32.150> the<00:06:32.659> bottom<00:06:33.169> of<00:06:33.319> the<00:06:33.409> two

installation of the bottom of the two
flashings<00:06:34.520> that<00:06:34.879> I<00:06:35.210> would<00:06:35.539> recommend<00:06:35.870> about

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
flashings that I would recommend about

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.140 
flashings that I would recommend about
the<00:06:37.279> window<00:06:38.889> this<00:06:39.889> is<00:06:39.949> obviously<00:06:40.580> a<00:06:40.669> shorter

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
the window this is obviously a shorter

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.850 
the window this is obviously a shorter
window<00:06:41.360> i<00:06:42.789> shorter<00:06:43.789> wall<00:06:44.000> height<00:06:44.689> I<00:06:45.050> did<00:06:45.650> this

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
window i shorter wall height I did this

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.619 
window i shorter wall height I did this
so<00:06:46.039> that<00:06:46.069> I<00:06:46.250> could<00:06:46.460> make<00:06:46.610> this<00:06:46.669> mock-up<00:06:47.300> out<00:06:47.509> of

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:47.629 
so that I could make this mock-up out of

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:51.070 
so that I could make this mock-up out of
one<00:06:47.779> sheet<00:06:48.020> of<00:06:48.080> plywood<00:06:49.569> normally<00:06:50.569> you'd<00:06:50.750> have

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 
one sheet of plywood normally you'd have

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.990 
one sheet of plywood normally you'd have
put<00:06:51.319> a<00:06:51.379> bit<00:06:51.529> of<00:06:51.620> wall<00:06:51.800> above<00:06:52.190> the<00:06:52.370> window<00:06:52.759> and

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
put a bit of wall above the window and

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.659 
put a bit of wall above the window and
you<00:06:53.810> would<00:06:53.960> be<00:06:54.139> installing<00:06:54.590> a<00:06:54.919> second

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:55.669 
you would be installing a second

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:59.159 
you would be installing a second
flashing<00:06:56.589> that<00:06:57.589> extended<00:06:58.339> out<00:06:58.490> an<00:06:58.759> inch

00:06:59.159 --> 00:06:59.169 
flashing that extended out an inch

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:03.519 
flashing that extended out an inch
beyond<00:07:00.169> each<00:07:00.680> side<00:07:01.250> of<00:07:01.610> the<00:07:02.259> actually<00:07:03.259> doesn't

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:03.529 
beyond each side of the actually doesn't

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:07.600 
beyond each side of the actually doesn't
have<00:07:03.680> to<00:07:03.860> it<00:07:03.979> can<00:07:04.190> be<00:07:04.219> flush<00:07:04.870> with<00:07:05.870> the<00:07:06.610> jamb

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
have to it can be flush with the jamb

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.200 
have to it can be flush with the jamb
the<00:07:08.000> trim<00:07:08.830> or<00:07:09.830> you<00:07:10.129> can<00:07:10.310> have<00:07:10.520> it<00:07:10.639> extend<00:07:11.029> out<00:07:11.150> a

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210 
the trim or you can have it extend out a

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.719 
the trim or you can have it extend out a
little<00:07:11.449> bit<00:07:11.690> and<00:07:12.020> what<00:07:12.800> it's<00:07:12.979> doing<00:07:13.190> is<00:07:13.520> it's

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:13.729 
little bit and what it's doing is it's

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:16.869 
little bit and what it's doing is it's
shedding<00:07:14.029> water<00:07:14.449> away<00:07:14.750> from<00:07:14.930> the<00:07:15.169> trim<00:07:15.879> to

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:16.879 
shedding water away from the trim to

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:19.749 
shedding water away from the trim to
protect<00:07:17.779> the<00:07:17.900> trim<00:07:18.229> from<00:07:18.500> damage<00:07:18.979> and<00:07:19.159> extend

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 
protect the trim from damage and extend

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:22.480 
protect the trim from damage and extend
the<00:07:19.879> trims<00:07:20.270> life<00:07:21.039> flashing<00:07:22.039> is<00:07:22.129> fairly<00:07:22.339> cheap

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.490 
the trims life flashing is fairly cheap

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.629 
the trims life flashing is fairly cheap
the<00:07:22.969> labor<00:07:23.210> to<00:07:23.569> continuously<00:07:24.379> repaint<00:07:24.979> trim

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 
the labor to continuously repaint trim

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:27.700 
the labor to continuously repaint trim
because<00:07:26.330> waters<00:07:26.690> flowing<00:07:26.990> along<00:07:27.349> it<00:07:27.589> is

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:27.710 
because waters flowing along it is

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.369 
because waters flowing along it is
actually<00:07:28.190> quite<00:07:28.370> expensive<00:07:28.900> it<00:07:29.900> would<00:07:30.169> go<00:07:30.349> on

00:07:30.369 --> 00:07:30.379 
actually quite expensive it would go on

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:33.550 
actually quite expensive it would go on
top<00:07:31.039> of<00:07:31.339> this<00:07:31.460> dropping<00:07:32.060> so<00:07:32.569> it<00:07:32.690> would<00:07:33.319> not<00:07:33.500> be

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:33.560 
top of this dropping so it would not be

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.879 
top of this dropping so it would not be
across<00:07:34.099> cavity<00:07:35.289> flashing<00:07:36.289> it<00:07:36.409> would<00:07:36.529> just<00:07:36.740> be

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:36.889 
across cavity flashing it would just be

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:39.129 
across cavity flashing it would just be
a<00:07:36.919> surface<00:07:37.250> flashing<00:07:37.909> and<00:07:38.810> it<00:07:38.990> would

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:39.139 
a surface flashing and it would

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:41.159 
a surface flashing and it would
basically<00:07:39.289> go<00:07:39.800> something<00:07:40.279> like<00:07:40.310> this

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:41.169 
basically go something like this

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.740 
basically go something like this
and<00:07:42.169> and<00:07:42.680> attach<00:07:43.159> to<00:07:43.550> the<00:07:43.639> strapping<00:07:44.240> above

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:44.750 
and and attach to the strapping above

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.320 
and and attach to the strapping above
and<00:07:45.050> then<00:07:45.560> you<00:07:45.860> would<00:07:46.069> continue<00:07:46.729> on<00:07:47.270> with<00:07:47.599> your

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.330 
and then you would continue on with your

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.290 
and then you would continue on with your
your<00:07:50.330> layering<00:07:50.750> of<00:07:51.110> your<00:07:51.440> clotting<00:07:52.310> on<00:07:52.520> top<00:07:52.760> to

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:53.300 
your layering of your clotting on top to

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.980 
your layering of your clotting on top to
provide<00:07:54.230> that<00:07:54.530> sight<00:07:54.830> line<00:07:54.860> but<00:07:55.790> this<00:07:56.480> with<00:07:56.780> in

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:56.990 
provide that sight line but this with in

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.840 
behind and more importantly it provides
a<00:08:01.760> drip<00:08:02.060> edge<00:08:02.270> so<00:08:02.930> that<00:08:03.139> this<00:08:03.440> top<00:08:04.190> trim<00:08:04.550> piece

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:04.850 
a drip edge so that this top trim piece

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.620 
a drip edge so that this top trim piece
the<00:08:05.090> header<00:08:05.300> trim<00:08:06.050> does<00:08:06.320> not<00:08:06.500> get<00:08:07.340> a<00:08:07.910> lot<00:08:08.510> of

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:08.630 
the header trim does not get a lot of

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.440 
the header trim does not get a lot of
moisture<00:08:09.290> activity<00:08:09.860> okay<00:08:10.639> thank<00:08:11.060> you<00:08:11.210> for

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:11.450 
moisture activity okay thank you for

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.810 
moisture activity okay thank you for
watching
