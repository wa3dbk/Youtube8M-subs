00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the start to the very end not that I've

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.900 
the start to the very end not that I've
seen<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.230> end<00:00:55.440> even<00:00:56.340> though<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.730> game<00:00:56.879> is

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
seen the end even though the game is

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.150 
seen the end even though the game is
simple<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:58.020> kind<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.350> addictive<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.039> I

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
simple it is kind of addictive and I

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.010 
simple it is kind of addictive and I
really<00:00:59.460> wanted<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.820> play<00:00:59.940> through<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.989> that

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
really wanted to play through but that

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.820 
really wanted to play through but that
was<00:01:01.350> not<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:02.989> graphics<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.170> really<00:01:04.500> not<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
was not to be graphics is really not the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.039 
was not to be graphics is really not the
point<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.460> game<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.510> galaxy<00:01:06.930> map

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
point in this game so the galaxy map

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.260 
point in this game so the galaxy map
looks<00:01:07.350> informative<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> same<00:01:08.970> time

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
looks informative and at the same time

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.810 
looks informative and at the same time
quite<00:01:09.630> dull<00:01:09.990> really<00:01:10.530> seeing<00:01:11.250> as<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.610> don't

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
quite dull really seeing as you don't

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.030 
quite dull really seeing as you don't
really<00:01:12.240> play<00:01:12.479> any<00:01:12.510> economy<00:01:13.320> game<00:01:13.530> or<00:01:13.740> build

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.100 
trying to turn around or two
the<00:04:22.580> problem<00:04:23.030> is<00:04:23.180> there's<00:04:23.450> no<00:04:23.690> way<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:23.960> know

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
the problem is there's no way to know

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.260 
the problem is there's no way to know
what<00:04:24.440> to<00:04:24.650> plan<00:04:24.680> against<00:04:25.400> other<00:04:25.610> time<00:04:25.940> to<00:04:26.090> meet

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
what to plan against other time to meet

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.140 
what to plan against other time to meet
the<00:04:26.510> enemy<00:04:26.660> plate<00:04:27.020> and<00:04:27.290> play<00:04:27.530> necessary<00:04:28.310> but

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
the enemy plate and play necessary but

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.970 
the enemy plate and play necessary but
then<00:04:29.420> you<00:04:29.570> can't<00:04:29.810> retrofit<00:04:30.440> you're<00:04:30.650> already

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
then you can't retrofit you're already

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.060 
then you can't retrofit you're already
build<00:04:31.340> ships<00:04:31.610> with<00:04:31.910> more<00:04:31.940> fitting<00:04:32.510> systems

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
build ships with more fitting systems

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.010 
build ships with more fitting systems
what<00:04:34.070> ended<00:04:34.340> up<00:04:34.490> happening<00:04:34.550> is<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.360> spam<00:04:35.780> my

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
what ended up happening is I spam my

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.440 
what ended up happening is I spam my
previously<00:04:36.620> designed<00:04:36.830> ship<00:04:37.340> types<00:04:37.640> and<00:04:37.910> that

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
previously designed ship types and that

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.320 
previously designed ship types and that
mostly<00:04:38.780> works<00:04:39.080> I<00:04:39.520> happen<00:04:40.520> to<00:04:40.550> like<00:04:40.790> missile

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330

in the game for some reason you might

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
optimize the need for group because I

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.820 
optimize the need for group because I
