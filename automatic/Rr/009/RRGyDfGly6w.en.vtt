00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:02.280
 hello my name is yummy 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.240
 Alexander 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.430
 today we will talk about one thing 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.540
 very relevant equipment which 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.959
 allowed hundreds of excellent businesses 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:11.610
 three four or more times 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.790
 reduce corporate costs 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.799
 cellular communication 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.800
 I want to emphasize that more correctly 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.519
 use exactly the words combination and 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.150
 reduce costs they save on communication 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.130
 because saving means you 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.939
 you have to give up something and something 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:25.720
 sacrifice 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.750
 in our case, the company is not only 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.220
 Lose nothing but acquire new ones 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.249
 opportunities 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.300
 and those in which even before 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.200
 did not think 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.200
 equipment that will be discussed today 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.700
 called cell gateway 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.580
 cell gateway related categories 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.290
 gateway gateways 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.220
 This device is intended for 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.190
 data transfer between different networks 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.850
 types 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.310
 what happens is the gateway transmission as possible 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.079
 to guess 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.300
 conducted between cellular networks 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.770
 and traditional telephony networks 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.700
 at the same time can be transmitted as a voice 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.470
 as data 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.150
 today's presentation we will 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.140
 talk about ji em gateways so how is 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.150
 the most popular variety in Russia 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.340
 cellular gateways 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.950
 however, gsn also says 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.300
 topical applicable to others 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.520
 kind of cellular gateways 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.030
 ji em voip gateways we sit and gateway 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.890
 surviving the gateway and others 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.040
 varieties 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.690
 first big part of this presentation 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.720
 is dedicated to the questions that the same gateway itself 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.570
 and how it helps reduce costs 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.440
 mobile communication 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.830
 here we look at the main 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.790
 moments are connected with the connection that 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.390
 the law itself is the press as well 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.100
 which jess will prevail 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.010
 applying jess gateways like i already 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.240
 noted will bring itself not only a decrease 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.360
 cellular costs but also reducing 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.830
 costs in a number of cases 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.460
 minimize the costs in which 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.509
 not previously submitted 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.020
 possible 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.030
 in the second part of our presentation we are like 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.330
 time and talk about such 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.520
 most sought after 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.140
 applications and these devices 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.950
 in the second part you for example you know 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.710
 what is the services manager in touch 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.900
 guaranteeing that none of your calls 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.990
 customers will not be lost even if 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.690
 call manager 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.579
 went on a business trip or went out for lunch 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.389
 you will also recognize the bodily protocol 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.159
 applications as connecting offices 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.279
 public telephone network 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:16.449
 through the gateway gesture 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:17.629
 the need for such a connection 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.710
 often arises and places 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.010
 where the operator is traditional 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.210
 telephony of such a service is not 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.539
 provides 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.239
 or require and not too much money 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.340
 you will learn how using jess stockings 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.840
 can be organized multichannel 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.760
 lines without resorting to operator services 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.149
 connections 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:34.589
 how the gateway allows you to implement 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:36.339
 economical connection between mobile 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:38.689
 office staff 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.229
 how to organize corporate 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:41.979
 gems and even 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:43.549
 how to use these devices for 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.819
 telephone installation of cottages 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.519
 but let's do everything in order so well 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.469
 the same center is narrow as it reduces 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:51.119
 communication expenses
