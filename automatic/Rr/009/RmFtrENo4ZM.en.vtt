enticing some few simple things nothing

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.079 
enticing some few simple things nothing
too<00:00:19.150> complex<00:00:19.689> I'm<00:00:20.499> preparing<00:00:21.460> for<00:00:21.609> the<00:00:21.730> season

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:22.089 
too complex I'm preparing for the season

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.390 
too complex I'm preparing for the season
to<00:00:22.210> open<00:00:22.539> tomorrow<00:00:22.800> quite<00:00:23.800> excited<00:00:24.310> because

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
to open tomorrow quite excited because

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.939 
to open tomorrow quite excited because
we've<00:00:24.640> been<00:00:24.699> doing<00:00:24.999> very<00:00:25.179> well

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
we've been doing very well

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.149 
we've been doing very well
but<00:00:27.699> this<00:00:27.909> is<00:00:28.060> what<00:00:28.179> I<00:00:28.210> normally<00:00:28.300> use<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.859> grub

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:30.159 
but this is what I normally use the grub

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.060 
but this is what I normally use the grub
a<00:00:30.899> simple<00:00:31.899> technique<00:00:32.259> that<00:00:32.290> you<00:00:32.560> can<00:00:32.590> use<00:00:32.739> is

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
a simple technique that you can use is

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.620 
a simple technique that you can use is
make<00:00:33.250> sure<00:00:33.280> you're<00:00:33.610> using<00:00:33.760> a<00:00:34.000> loop<00:00:34.210> not<00:00:34.420> with

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
make sure you're using a loop not with

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.889 
make sure you're using a loop not with
these<00:00:34.810> grubs<00:00:35.820> disable<00:00:36.820> this<00:00:37.210> enables<00:00:37.629> it<00:00:37.870> to

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
these grubs disable this enables it to

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.150 
these grubs disable this enables it to
give<00:00:38.260> full<00:00:38.949> motion<00:00:39.750> movement<00:00:40.750> and<00:00:41.160> therefore

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
give full motion movement and therefore

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.689 
give full motion movement and therefore
lets<00:00:42.640> off<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:43.000> most<00:00:43.149> vibration<00:00:44.640> now<00:00:45.640> the

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
lets off the most vibration now the

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.479 
lets off the most vibration now the
other<00:00:45.879> thing<00:00:46.149> is<00:00:46.329> sound<00:00:47.039> although<00:00:48.039> this<00:00:48.219> does

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
other thing is sound although this does

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.340 
other thing is sound although this does
give<00:00:48.699> off<00:00:48.820> a<00:00:48.879> little<00:00:49.210> sound<00:00:49.449> and<00:00:49.660> vibration

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
give off a little sound and vibration

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.569 
give off a little sound and vibration
you<00:00:50.949> can<00:00:51.129> actually<00:00:51.899> heighten<00:00:52.899> the<00:00:53.679> sound<00:00:54.210> with

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
you can actually heighten the sound with

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.639 
you can actually heighten the sound with
little<00:00:57.579> bitty<00:00:57.730> rattles<00:00:58.239> yeah<00:00:59.230> these<00:00:59.469> little

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
know it's not a huge difference in sound

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.150 
know it's not a huge difference in sound
but<00:01:19.540> it<00:01:19.690> gives<00:01:19.870> off<00:01:20.080> just<00:01:20.410> a<00:01:20.560> little<00:01:20.800> bit<00:01:20.950> more

any way and since this one is fairly

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.570 
any way and since this one is fairly
clear<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:24.170> may<00:02:24.319> be<00:02:24.380> able<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.739> see<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.069> right

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
clear you may be able to see it right

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.940 
clear you may be able to see it right
under<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:28.450> right<00:02:29.450> under<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.870> surface<00:02:30.739> here

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
under the right under the surface here

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.870 
under the right under the surface here
so<00:02:32.560> now<00:02:33.560> when<00:02:33.800> this<00:02:33.920> thing<00:02:34.130> is<00:02:34.160> down<00:02:34.640> they're

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
so now when this thing is down they're

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.540 
so now when this thing is down they're
shaking<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.810> moving<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.860> making<00:02:37.310> all<00:02:37.430> that

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
shaking and moving and making all that

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.120 
shaking and moving and making all that
noise<00:02:37.810> it's<00:02:38.810> got<00:02:38.989> a<00:02:39.020> little<00:02:39.260> bit<00:02:39.440> extra<00:02:39.500> sound

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
noise it's got a little bit extra sound

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.280 
noise it's got a little bit extra sound
I<00:02:40.489> don't<00:02:41.269> think<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:41.600> can<00:02:41.780> hear<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:42.140> because

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
I don't think you can hear that because

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.740 
I don't think you can hear that because
I'm<00:02:42.500> using<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.920> GoPro<00:02:43.850> camera<00:02:44.060> today<00:02:44.480> instead

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
I'm using the GoPro camera today instead

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.410 
I'm using the GoPro camera today instead
of<00:02:44.840> one<00:02:45.019> of<00:02:45.110> my<00:02:45.170> other<00:02:45.290> two<00:02:45.590> but<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:47.030> does<00:02:47.239> make

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
of one of my other two but it does make

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.020 
of one of my other two but it does make
that<00:02:47.600> extra<00:02:47.989> sound<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:49.580> might<00:02:49.730> just<00:02:49.940> be

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
that extra sound and it might just be

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.440 
that extra sound and it might just be
enough<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.569> get<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.980> entice<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.280> bite<00:02:52.640> that

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
enough to get to entice a bite that

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.520 
enough to get to entice a bite that
otherwise<00:02:54.290> they<00:02:54.860> may<00:02:55.069> pass<00:02:55.310> up<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:56.530> anything

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
otherwise they may pass up so anything

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.440 
otherwise they may pass up so anything
