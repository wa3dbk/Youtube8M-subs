00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:39.339 
but um I mean every 16 year old gets
their<00:06:37.550> license<00:06:38.000> and<00:06:38.240> not<00:06:38.360> every<00:06:38.630> 16<00:06:39.020> year<00:06:39.229> old

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:39.349 
their license and not every 16 year old

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:40.360 
their license and not every 16 year old
gets<00:06:39.469> to<00:06:39.680> go<00:06:39.800> to<00:06:39.830> the<00:06:40.009> olin

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
gets to go to the olin

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.820 
gets to go to the olin

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.780 
so probably have to say the Olympics but
