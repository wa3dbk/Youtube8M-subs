00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.930

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.290
 and a meter 2 not ok then I just want to 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.400
 say 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.100
 later when I grow up just like you one 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.020
 I hope I can play the drums just as well 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.209
 I will not benefit from drugs 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.830
 indeed he still rice a little bit 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.510
 in the hague 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.220
 this all from earlier gala de 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.780
 professional jury and start at stijn i'm normal 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.860
 not sure what we did rest still going 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.050
 to hear 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.870
 there is whole quality in that group 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.910
 instrumental and vocal too and as the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.890
 following numbers are as strong as this 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.590
 number then I promise with this plastic 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.640
 that I buy the first album from trust 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.630
 oh I do sometimes what 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.510
 all right 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.540
 yes yes I yes I'm going to say that you 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.000
 can take both positive and negative 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.040
 but of course I mean positive 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.560
 find this not suitable to go to Rotterdam 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.740
 go because this is beyond category 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.949
 tiesto good for seniors turn or strain 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.949

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.540

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.190
 you have a beautiful song 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.650

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.650
 a beautiful music to the future beautiful 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.430
 was what do we want to add 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.680
 look I do not quite understand the de 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.550
 logic they might be too good that 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.950
 I find it strange so make your heart calm 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.360
