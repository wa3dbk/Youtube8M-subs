thanks for that question Dennis and you
are<00:00:47.309> right<00:00:47.670> when<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.390> increase<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
are right when you increase the

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.520 
are right when you increase the
frequency<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.760> your<00:00:51.390> body<00:00:51.750> prep<00:00:52.020> training<00:00:52.379> you

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
frequency of your body prep training you

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.200 
frequency of your body prep training you
can<00:00:52.649> help<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.039> speed<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.760> whole<00:00:53.940> growth

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
can help to speed up the whole growth

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.200 
can help to speed up the whole growth
process<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> strategy<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.969> I

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
process and this is a strategy that I

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.810 
process and this is a strategy that I
like<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.480> use<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:58.140> stubborn<00:00:58.980> body<00:00:59.219> parts<00:00:59.640> and

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
like to use for stubborn body parts and

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.689 
like to use for stubborn body parts and
areas<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.570> want<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.960> specialize<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.699> and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
areas that you want to specialize in and

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.700 
areas that you want to specialize in and
someone<00:01:03.210> more<00:01:03.510> popular<00:01:04.080> training<00:01:04.559> programs

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
someone more popular training programs

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.310 
someone more popular training programs
such<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.760> blaster<00:01:06.270> bench<00:01:06.450> program<00:01:07.049> and

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
such as the blaster bench program and

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.640 
such as the blaster bench program and
the<00:01:07.830> blaster<00:01:08.220> biceps<00:01:08.640> program<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.990> basis<00:01:10.439> of

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
the blaster biceps program the basis of

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.490 
the blaster biceps program the basis of
those<00:01:10.920> programs<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.909> higher<00:01:12.720> frequency

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
those programs is higher frequency

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.100 
those programs is higher frequency
workouts<00:01:14.060> now<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.119> thing<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.600> when<00:01:15.990> you

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
workouts now the thing is when you

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.410 
workouts now the thing is when you
increase<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> frequency<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.000> training

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
increase the frequency of the training

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.749 
increase the frequency of the training
session<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.380> need<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.740> balance<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:20.400> with

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
session you need to balance it out with

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.060 
session you need to balance it out with
also<00:01:21.420> reducing<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.049> training<00:01:22.680> volume

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
also reducing the training volume

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.609 
also reducing the training volume
because<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:23.909> can't<00:01:24.150> keep<00:01:24.619> increasing

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
because you just can't keep increasing

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.219 
because you just can't keep increasing
the<00:01:26.220> same<00:01:26.610> volume<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.299> simply<00:01:27.630> be<00:01:27.810> doubling

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
the same volume and simply be doubling

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.440 
the same volume and simply be doubling
up<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.799> training<00:01:29.070> frequency<00:01:29.850> because

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
up on the training frequency because

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.999 
up on the training frequency because
eventually<00:01:30.659> that's<00:01:30.990> gonna<00:01:31.140> lead<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.380> burnout

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
eventually that's gonna lead to burnout

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.219 
eventually that's gonna lead to burnout
and<00:01:32.340> overtraining<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.930> can

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
and overtraining but if you can

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.819 
and overtraining but if you can
manipulate<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:36.060> volume<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.750> increase<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
manipulate the volume and increase the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.830 
manipulate the volume and increase the
frequency<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.520> can<00:01:38.850> speed<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.390> growth

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
frequency you can speed up the growth

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.510 
frequency you can speed up the growth
process<00:01:40.200> or<00:01:40.530> get<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> little<00:01:40.890> mini<00:01:41.189> growth

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
process or get a little mini growth

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.789 
process or get a little mini growth
spurts<00:01:41.880> multiple<00:01:42.780> times<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.140> week<00:01:43.200> rather<00:01:43.590> than

spurts multiple times a week rather than

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.160 
spurts multiple times a week rather than

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
just one big workout per week which is

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.620 
just one big workout per week which is
what<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.350> lot<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.530> people<00:01:46.710> do<00:01:47.420> so

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
what a lot of people do so

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.139 
what a lot of people do so
that<00:01:49.259> definitely<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:49.920> work<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.549> when<00:01:51.030> it

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
that definitely can work and when it

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.300 
that definitely can work and when it
comes<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.509> leg<00:01:51.750> training<00:01:52.110> one<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.009> best

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
comes to leg training one of the best

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.539 
comes to leg training one of the best
programs<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.990> uses<00:01:55.649> higher<00:01:55.890> frequency

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
programs that uses higher frequency

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.910

programs been around for most of the
20th<00:02:07.649> century<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:09.030> works<00:02:09.269> like

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
20th century and it works like

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.420 
20th century and it works like
gangbusters<00:02:09.690> for<00:02:10.229> packing<00:02:10.679> on<00:02:10.800> muscular<00:02:11.069> body

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
gangbusters for packing on muscular body

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.729 
gangbusters for packing on muscular body
weight<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.209> how<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.480> works<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:13.019> you<00:02:13.050> start<00:02:13.260> off

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
weight and how it works is you start off

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.460 
weight and how it works is you start off
each<00:02:14.130> training<00:02:14.819> session<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.599> work<00:02:16.260> your<00:02:16.410> way

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
each training session and work your way

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.100 
each training session and work your way
up<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.950> one<00:02:17.220> all-out<00:02:17.519> set<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.300> 20<00:02:18.599> reps<00:02:18.720> squats

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
up to one all-out set of 20 reps squats

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.259 
up to one all-out set of 20 reps squats
and<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.430> foundation<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.209> your

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
and that is the foundation of your

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.449 
and that is the foundation of your
workout<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.930> then<00:02:22.470> after<00:02:22.769> that<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.190> go<00:02:23.340> on

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
workout and then after that you go on

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.699 
workout and then after that you go on
with<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.060> rest<00:02:24.269> of<00:02:24.480> your<00:02:24.780> training<00:02:25.319> session

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
with the rest of your training session

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.100 
with the rest of your training session
so<00:02:26.160> each<00:02:26.430> workout<00:02:26.940> which<00:02:27.360> will<00:02:27.510> be<00:02:27.599> done<00:02:27.750> three

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
so each workout which will be done three

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.650 
so each workout which will be done three
days<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.290> week<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:29.640> would<00:02:29.790> start<00:02:30.269> with<00:02:30.360> the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
days a week you would start with the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.900 
days a week you would start with the
squats<00:02:30.989> now<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:31.950> low<00:02:32.190> volume<00:02:32.640> because

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
squats now it's low volume because

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.300 
squats now it's low volume because
you're<00:02:33.450> really<00:02:33.599> only<00:02:33.720> doing<00:02:34.080> one<00:02:34.500> working<00:02:34.950> set
