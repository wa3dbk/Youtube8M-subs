00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.220
 yes the tcs meant pronounced startup 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.080
 mentality where everyone is invited 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.090
 to tackle topics 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.529
 through the growth we have 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.840
 a lot of possibilities for 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.740
 to develop the individual and that 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.740
 makes fun ultimately 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.260
 i did a internship in india 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.149
 I got so ccs 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.010
 I'll tell you the experience you get 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.649
 it has been collected by the stay 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.210
 of course, for life, a so-called 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.800
 buddy program so everyone 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.659
 newbie assigned a body 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.979
 gets as a mentor of those 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.600
 just take a little bit by the hand 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.619
 in the everyday questions here in the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.149
 simply give up 

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:04.979
 personally, the company has me very much 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.020
 much further brought the handling with 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.240
 a new culture to the viewing angle 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.070
 extremely extended and one on the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.780
 professional life really optimally prepared 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.130
 and technically I would say that is 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.130
 every day a new wisdom with 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.590
 The working hours are what I would say 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.509
 very flexible i am active in sales 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.969
 that means counting results 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.130
 and it's a very big kind of 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.990
 flexibility for example, too 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.420
 I also need a family 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.899
 career with children at home 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.610
 tcs for women means that we 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.280
 Equal rights are the same 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.270
 pay that we have the same 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.329
 Above all, there are opportunities for promotion 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.000
 in a male domain like the it industry 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.069
 So personally it is very important that 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.720
 Employees Employees We are open 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.489
 are very international company 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.170
 with indian roots that you 

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:01.200
 Employees employees themselves in others 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.189
 cultures can empathize professionally 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.020
 it is very important that in the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.869
 basically well qualified are one 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.729
 graduate bring the 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.500
 typical work process over 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.900
 Working at tata consultancy 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.819
 services are not there for that 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.569
 tasks and areas much too 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.980
 differently 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.269
 but that's fun they over the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.069
 young people should consult ccs 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.959
 they can advertise a dynamic 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.030
 looking for an environment where you can tackle things and 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.260
 can move and where they too 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.400
 have development options 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.200
 ultimately not necessarily with 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.040
 ready to go away but also 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.040
 to find her way
