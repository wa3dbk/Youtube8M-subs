00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
positions I kept trying to get it right

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.179

and<00:00:16.800> about<00:00:17.010> how<00:00:17.279> hard<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.760> tried<00:00:19.010> it<00:00:20.010> would

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
and about how hard I tried it would

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.130 
and about how hard I tried it would
never<00:00:20.430> really<00:00:20.789> sound<00:00:21.060> like<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.390> song<00:00:21.630> by

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
off but I didn't realize how it should

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.120 
off but I didn't realize how it should
be<00:00:31.560> -<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:33.239> tuned<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.500> way<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.680> could

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
be - so I just tuned it the way I could

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.150 
be - so I just tuned it the way I could
to<00:00:35.370> get<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.550> song<00:00:35.850> out<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.890> my<00:00:37.890> mom's

all<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.809> sudden<00:00:58.170> these<00:00:58.739> positions<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.550> I

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
all of a sudden these positions that I

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.580 
all of a sudden these positions that I
had<00:00:59.820> been<00:00:59.969> practicing<00:01:00.210> over<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.260> over<00:01:01.500> and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
had been practicing over and over and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.359 
had been practicing over and over and
over<00:01:01.859> again<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.180> diligently<00:01:03.890> once<00:01:04.890> he<00:01:05.129> tuned

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
over again so diligently once he tuned

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.789 
over again so diligently once he tuned
the<00:01:05.519> guitar<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:06.150> me<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.479> was<00:01:06.720> easy<00:01:07.080> as<00:01:07.560> pie

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the guitar for me it was easy as pie

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.399 
the guitar for me it was easy as pie
because<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.729> didn't<00:01:09.630> realize<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.260> was

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
because I didn't realize that I was

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.520 
because I didn't realize that I was
learning<00:01:10.590> Barre<00:01:11.070> chords<00:01:11.729> which<00:01:12.450> -<00:01:12.780> early

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
learning Barre chords which - early

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.380 
learning Barre chords which - early
guitar<00:01:13.950> players<00:01:14.250> are<00:01:14.490> pretty<00:01:14.700> hard<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.210> do

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
guitar players are pretty hard to do

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.730 
guitar players are pretty hard to do
because<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.320> build<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
because you have to build up the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.300 
because you have to build up the
strength<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:17.970> kept<00:01:18.479> trying<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:20.070> play

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
strength so I kept trying to just play

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.249 
strength so I kept trying to just play
harder<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.970> harder<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.450> harder<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.930> get<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
harder and harder and harder to get the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.440 
harder and harder and harder to get the
thing<00:01:22.439> right<00:01:22.650> by<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.340> time<00:01:23.700> he<00:01:23.970> tuned<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
thing right by the time he tuned the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.999 
thing right by the time he tuned the
guitar<00:01:24.500> for<00:01:25.500> me<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.310> play<00:01:27.439> to<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.680> pick<00:01:28.860> up<00:01:28.950> my

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
guitar for me to play to just pick up my

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.910 
guitar for me to play to just pick up my
guitar<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.610> go<00:01:30.020> there's<00:01:31.020> nothing<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.829> I

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
guitar and go there's nothing to it I

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.420 
guitar and go there's nothing to it I
couldn't<00:01:32.220> believe<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:36.680> it<00:01:37.680> was<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
couldn't believe it I it was like the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.160 
couldn't believe it I it was like the
easiest<00:01:38.790> thing<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.119> world<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.630> when

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
easiest thing in the world and when

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.380 
easiest thing in the world and when
you're<00:01:40.320> when<00:01:41.250> your<00:01:41.400> guitar<00:01:41.759> player<00:01:42.000> starting

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
you're when your guitar player starting

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.290 
you're when your guitar player starting
off<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.229> practice<00:01:43.770> this

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.820 

after<00:01:50.300> about<00:01:50.450> 20<00:01:50.870> minutes<00:01:51.170> your<00:01:51.380> fingers

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
after about 20 minutes your fingers

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.700 
after about 20 minutes your fingers
you're<00:01:52.130> dying<00:01:52.490> but<00:01:52.910> at<00:01:53.450> that<00:01:53.660> point<00:01:53.990> I<00:01:54.260> had

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
you're dying but at that point I had

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.650 
you're dying but at that point I had
already<00:01:54.800> put<00:01:55.250> in<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.460> hard<00:01:55.640> work<00:01:55.760> and<00:01:56.180> I

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
already put in the hard work and I

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.750 
already put in the hard work and I
remember<00:01:57.500> playing<00:01:58.450> palm<00:01:59.450> I<00:02:00.170> read<00:02:01.160> the<00:02:01.490> news

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
remember playing palm I read the news
