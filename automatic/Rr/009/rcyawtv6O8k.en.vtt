00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
to make them a little bit brighter next

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.650

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
throughout the design and this would

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:07.610 
throughout the design and this would
look<00:06:05.070> great<00:06:05.460> in<00:06:05.760> a<00:06:05.849> fine<00:06:06.270> but<00:06:07.050> if<00:06:07.169> you<00:06:07.320> want<00:06:07.500> to
