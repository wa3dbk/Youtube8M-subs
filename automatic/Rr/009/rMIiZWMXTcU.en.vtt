00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 to the girls where they are welcome a 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.060
 more time to my channel today I have to 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.460
 you a new video and this time I want 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.590
 tell them three options to be able to 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.240
 naturally flavor the water because 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.910
 good as you know we have to 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.830
 consume between 2 and 3 liters of water 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.359
 newspapers obviously taking into account 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.520
 all the amount of fluids that 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.100
 we consume in the day not only water 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.650
 but the majority obviously so that 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.140
 be as natural should be water 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.390
 only but I do not know if any if 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.190
 you happen the same as me and it's 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.110
 that bores me to drink simple water with nothing 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.210
 all day and does not consume much water 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.829
 when it is one of the first things that 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.590
 I should consume to be able to have more 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.780
 hydrated the skin the hair in short everything 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.420
 because the water obviously does a lot 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.160
 good but good if ok I confess I have 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.129
 many problems to consume it 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.010
 so then obviously reading in 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.199
 magazines and watching some accounts 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.010
 instagram so of fitness people I do not know that 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.519
 I usually add little things to the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.170
 then like the things that to me more 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.850
 they like the fruits that to me more 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.640
 they like to 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.460
 put them to my water I know different 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.350
 and be able to consume it much more so the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.299
 first option that I have you to do 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.600
 A flavored water is to put a little 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.820
 lemon cucumber and mint confesses that by the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.280
 cucumber I thought I was going to know horrible 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.560
 that if you're going to see how vegetables I do not know 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.259
 I thought it was going to be like a salad 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.229
 but without so much flavor to salads but 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.479
 well you understand me total I put 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.180
 some slices of cucumber some slices of 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.420
 lemon and some mint leaves over there and 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.830
 really that I liked quite not 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.560
 I put so much selling because he did not want 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.090
 outside the water as it 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.909
 it felt like a little more the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.130
 cucumber and lemon and I really like 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.810
 quite an important fact these waters 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.429
 flavored natural is that you do not 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.289
 you can consume immediately because 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.080
 obviously you will not feel any flavor 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.659
 but you have to wait a while for the 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.549
 vegetable the fruit that you are using 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.289
 release is a natural flavor and if you're 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.580
 using some aromatic soon 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.039
 also like mint obviously 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.230
 it will also jump like all its smell and 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.510
 its flavor then 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.659
 you should leave it for a while the other option 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.030
 what I have to flavor the water is 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.220
 use mulberry instead of cucumber 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.420
 then he took a little bit of arrears a 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.950
 little lemon 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.440
 obviously the lemon cut into slices 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.959
 so that all its flavor can come out and 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.480
 apply also mint if you do not like 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.910
 the mint as you can obviously skip and 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.670
 do not put it on and only consume the 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.150
 dwell with the lemon in the water and ready 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.739
 to stay super well is super rich 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.480
 this is the key I like the most and for the 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.940
 third option then I opted for 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.620
 use a pill or watermelon I do not know 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.720
 how they tell you in the place where you 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.280
 live if you're not in Colombia but if 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.079
 use a watermelon pin because 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.269
 I like also that they themselves 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.430
 they have their sugars then it is given 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.620
 like that taste different from water 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.420
 but without being too sweet and you throw 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.670
 ice to the water then it will be 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.040
 much colder and you can eat it and it's 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.780
 delicious and good these fruits is that 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.980
 many of them are diuretic then 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.470
 if you have problems to eliminate 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.569
 liquids that will help a lot 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.340
 very much very much because for example 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.510
 if you use pineapple that is also another 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.489
 option that although not 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.709
 with cold water but I do it with water 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.810
 hot and this could be said to be 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.599
 rather a pineapple tea and really that 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.400
 It's delicious, what you do is 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.200
 take a little hot water they put 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.140
 the cut pineapple pieces and leave it 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.200
 to release its flavor and is really very 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.659
 very very rich I am like very difficult with 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.870
 the theme of flavors but in this case 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.849
 is to choose the fruit that we like the most 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.400
 the fruit that best suits to use 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:49.069
 with water there are people who use strawberries 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.840
 there are people who use kiwi but if these 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.849
 they are like the options that I am 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.319
 using at the moment and good those 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.269
 were the tips for today's video 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.950
 I hope you liked it 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.049
 up and share it in your networks 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.000
 social with all the people who 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.709
 want and if you want you can also
