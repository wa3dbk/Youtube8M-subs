00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.120
 I beg you, listen to me because today I have nothing at all I have more family, no shelter, I lost everything in my career 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.414
 A cool father, a quiet mother and a little sister I loved so much A dirty story that hurts me and I even have more countries at the same time 

00:00:49.414 --> 00:00:55.340
 Kill me, I'm dead when? I have more strength to continue I can not live in the dark even if the light stays on 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.555
 To be outside, to live a cold, the cold does not erase what I see Why complain? We do not hear, nobody will live just once 

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:07.973
 A woman, a love, at this time you say that I abuse Tell me why it falls on me, on my forehead there is written "I accuse myself"? 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.500
 No, go ahead, I stop there, I'm going too far, I'm sorry I need help listen to me, I'll count on you if I'm expelled We can not change the time, neither the direction of the tanks 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.140
 We can not change the plan, who will press on the relaxation? Oh, who will be squeezing the trigger? 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.940
 Nobody because ... 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:34.800
 [Chorus] We can not change the time, nor the direction of the tanks We can not change the plan, who will press the trigger? Who will press on the relaxation? 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.440
 Salam Oualeikum, I'm nine years old, my name is Mounir, Palestinian I have more family, no shelter, I'm always afraid of whoever comes 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.000
 I have no school, no friends, no, I'm old I do not know any cartoon, at home I hear the sounds of Kalash 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.800
 I pull off the tears and the dams, we search my bag in the checkpoints Yet I never had to taste, ah if I just the drops that fall 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.880
 I want peace, just listen to me Okay, everyone is driving no matter how homeless, no food, yeah the TV is driving you away 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:12.520
 In my class, all our tables were taken for hospital beds Do not have chills when I talk to you, hold me back if you can Let's say ... when I approached the barbed wire 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:21.880
 [Chorus] We can not change the time, nor the direction of the tanks We can not change the plan, who will press the trigger? Who will press on the relaxation? 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.060
 Need help 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.940
 From Palestine to Burma
