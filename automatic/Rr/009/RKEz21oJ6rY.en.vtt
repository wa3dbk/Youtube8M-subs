00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
as a overview of the design and kind of

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.250 
as a overview of the design and kind of
get<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.150> guys<00:00:21.359> opinion<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.020> what<00:00:22.140> do<00:00:22.199> you

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260

get you guys opinion on what do you
think<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:22.890> i<00:00:23.039> think<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.340> looks

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
think of this but i think it looks

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.040 
think of this but i think it looks
really<00:00:23.550> good<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:23.939> red<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.359> person<00:00:24.810> with<00:00:24.900> those

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
really good in red in person with those

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.009 
really good in red in person with those
black<00:00:25.350> rims<00:00:25.680> looks<00:00:26.340> really<00:00:26.880> sharp<00:00:27.240> love<00:00:27.750> that

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
black rims looks really sharp love that

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.290 
black rims looks really sharp love that
front<00:00:28.320> splitter<00:00:28.619> there<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.970> one<00:00:30.119> thing

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
front splitter there and the one thing

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.150 
front splitter there and the one thing
you<00:00:30.420> know<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> GTS<00:00:31.109> are<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.590> only<00:00:31.740> ones<00:00:32.009> that

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
you know the GTS are the only ones that

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.830 
you know the GTS are the only ones that
get<00:00:32.250> those<00:00:32.460> bars<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> grill<00:00:33.450> there<00:00:33.690> which

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
get those bars in the grill there which

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.840 
get those bars in the grill there which
I<00:00:33.989> think<00:00:34.230> really<00:00:34.320> sets<00:00:35.100> off<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.309> front<00:00:35.610> end

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
I think really sets off the front end

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.670 
I think really sets off the front end
whenever<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.570> saw<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.809> first<00:00:37.170> few<00:00:37.350> pictures

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
whenever you saw the first few pictures

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.590 
whenever you saw the first few pictures
that<00:00:37.829> leaked<00:00:38.040> online<00:00:38.250> they<00:00:38.760> didn't<00:00:39.120> have<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
that leaked online they didn't have the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.959 
that leaked online they didn't have the
GT<00:00:39.930> version<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> base<00:00:40.770> four-cylinder<00:00:41.460> or

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
GT version is the base four-cylinder or

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.729 
GT version is the base four-cylinder or
the<00:00:42.120> 6-cylinder<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.960> they<00:00:43.079> don't<00:00:43.320> have<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.710> I

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the 6-cylinder and they don't have it I

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.170 
the 6-cylinder and they don't have it I
think<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.190> really<00:00:44.219> completes<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> girl

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
think that really completes the girl

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.779 
think that really completes the girl
obviously<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:46.079> an<00:00:46.200> easy<00:00:46.379> swap<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.340> I

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
obviously that be an easy swap but I

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.060 
obviously that be an easy swap but I
think<00:00:48.239> I'd<00:00:48.390> prefer<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> GT<00:00:49.440> over<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
think I'd prefer to have a GT over the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.420 
think I'd prefer to have a GT over the
four-cylinder<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:51.120> intriguing<00:00:51.600> as<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.960> sounds

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
four-cylinder as intriguing as it sounds

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.979 
four-cylinder as intriguing as it sounds
four-cylinder<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.550> me<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:54.030> think<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.719> does

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
four-cylinder to me I think just does

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.779 
four-cylinder to me I think just does
not<00:00:55.260> fit<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.530> character<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> Mustang<00:00:56.520> but

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
not fit the character of the Mustang but

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:57.770 
not fit the character of the Mustang but
let<00:00:56.969> me<00:00:57.000> know<00:00:57.149> what<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.360> think<00:00:57.480> about<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
let me know what you think about the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.900 
let me know what you think about the
four-cylinder<00:00:58.320> version<00:00:58.680> anyway<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.520> coming

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
four-cylinder version anyway so coming

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.520 
four-cylinder version anyway so coming
along<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> side<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.870> car<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.230> one

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
along to the side of this car I one

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.830 
along to the side of this car I one
thing<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.800> noticed<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.250> just<00:01:02.579> how<00:01:02.760> big<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.359> car

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
thing I noticed is just how big this car

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.679 
thing I noticed is just how big this car
is<00:01:03.989> they<00:01:04.140> had<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.369> 2014<00:01:05.369> Mustang<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.420> floor

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
is they had a 2014 Mustang on the floor

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.450 
is they had a 2014 Mustang on the floor
and<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.869> was<00:01:06.990> comparing<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.530> two<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.220> I

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
and I was comparing the two and this I

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.609 
and I was comparing the two and this I
mean<00:01:08.729> they<00:01:08.850> say<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.180> wider<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.260> looks

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
mean they say it's wider and it looks

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.130 
mean they say it's wider and it looks
wider<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.100> mean<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.520> thought<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> 2014<00:01:12.780> Mustang

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
wider I mean I thought the 2014 Mustang

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.230 
wider I mean I thought the 2014 Mustang
was<00:01:13.260> already<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> pretty<00:01:13.920> big<00:01:14.100> car<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:15.000> one's

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
was already a pretty big car this one's

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.940 
was already a pretty big car this one's
even<00:01:15.420> bigger<00:01:15.750> I'd<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.200> concerned<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.830> this

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
even bigger I'd be concerned that this

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.499 
even bigger I'd be concerned that this
would<00:01:17.100> be<00:01:17.189> kind<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.490> hard<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.729> drive<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.210> small

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
would be kind of hard to drive on small

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.109 
would be kind of hard to drive on small
streets<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.080> urban<00:01:19.380> areas<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:20.340> i<00:01:20.400> really<00:01:20.970> want

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
streets in urban areas but i really want

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.399 
streets in urban areas but i really want
to<00:01:21.180> test<00:01:21.360> drive<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.780> see<00:01:21.900> how<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.170> feels

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
to test drive one and see how it feels

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.679 
to test drive one and see how it feels
but<00:01:22.560> i<00:01:22.680> like<00:01:22.860> those<00:01:23.009> black<00:01:23.430> side<00:01:24.299> skirts

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
but i like those black side skirts

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.840 
but i like those black side skirts
they're<00:01:24.960> very<00:01:25.470> cool<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.159> side<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.640> rear

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
they're very cool the side and rear

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.280 
they're very cool the side and rear
profile<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.330> part<00:01:27.570> kind<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.780> reminds<00:01:28.049> me<00:01:28.170> of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
profile this part kind of reminds me of

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.080 
profile this part kind of reminds me of
the<00:01:28.439> f12<00:01:28.950> berlinetta<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.670> little<00:01:29.880> bit<00:01:29.970> by

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the f12 berlinetta a little bit by

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.210 
the f12 berlinetta a little bit by
Ferrari<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.439> angle<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> car

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
Ferrari I like this angle the car

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.069 
Ferrari I like this angle the car
because<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.579> can<00:01:32.790> see<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.329> know<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.689> way<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
because you can see you know the way the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.499 
because you can see you know the way the
deck<00:01:34.619> lid<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.430> rear<00:01:35.820> panel<00:01:36.060> there<00:01:36.390> is

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
deck lid and the rear panel there is

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.390 
deck lid and the rear panel there is
recessed<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.470> those<00:01:37.890> taillights<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
recessed and so those taillights and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.859 
recessed and so those taillights and
everything<00:01:38.820> are<00:01:38.970> kind<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.210> recessed<00:01:39.630> into

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
everything are kind of recessed into

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.600 
everything are kind of recessed into
that<00:01:40.110> panel<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:41.070> think<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.340> looks<00:01:41.369> really

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
that panel and I think it looks really

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.270 
that panel and I think it looks really
good<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.630> those<00:01:43.500> taillights<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.130> can

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
good and those taillights you can

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.219 
good and those taillights you can
actually<00:01:44.430> fit<00:01:44.909> your<00:01:45.090> hand<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.689> between<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
actually fit your hand in between the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.899 
actually fit your hand in between the
slots<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.619> those<00:01:46.770> taillights<00:01:47.040> kind<00:01:47.850> of

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
slots and those taillights kind of

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.639 
slots and those taillights kind of
reminds<00:01:48.180> me<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.479> 69<00:01:48.960> Mustang<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.530> I

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
reminds me of the 69 Mustang and I

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.080 
reminds me of the 69 Mustang and I
really<00:01:50.159> like<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> way<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.850> looks

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.719 

and<00:01:55.090> then<00:01:55.930> you<00:01:56.020> have<00:01:56.229> this<00:01:56.590> rear<00:01:57.130> diffuser

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
and then you have this rear diffuser

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.280 
and then you have this rear diffuser
there<00:01:58.150> which<00:01:58.330> is<00:01:58.360> painted<00:01:58.780> body<00:01:58.960> color<00:01:59.229> I

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
there which is painted body color I

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.539 
there which is painted body color I
think<00:01:59.470> that's<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.680> only<00:02:00.040> thing<00:02:00.250> i<00:02:00.369> don't<00:02:00.430> like

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
think that's the only thing i don't like

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.219 
think that's the only thing i don't like
about<00:02:00.640> this<00:02:00.940> back<00:02:01.150> end<00:02:01.420> that<00:02:01.840> would<00:02:01.930> be<00:02:02.049> better

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
about this back end that would be better

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.020 
about this back end that would be better
i<00:02:02.350> think<00:02:02.560> it<00:02:02.619> was<00:02:02.710> painted<00:02:03.040> black<00:02:03.310> or<00:02:03.610> if<00:02:03.909> it

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
i think it was painted black or if it

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.270 
i think it was painted black or if it
was<00:02:04.090> just<00:02:04.150> black<00:02:04.509> plastic<00:02:04.840> instead<00:02:05.530> but<00:02:06.190> you

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
was just black plastic instead but you

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.770 
was just black plastic instead but you
can<00:02:06.430> always<00:02:06.520> plasti<00:02:07.000> dip<00:02:07.030> that<00:02:07.270> that's<00:02:07.509> a<00:02:07.600> very

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
can always plasti dip that that's a very

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:16.330 
can always plasti dip that that's a very
easy<00:02:08.050> fix

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.059 

and<00:02:16.849> I<00:02:16.940> love<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.390> lines<00:02:17.840> there<00:02:18.440> around<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
and I love the lines there around the

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.220
