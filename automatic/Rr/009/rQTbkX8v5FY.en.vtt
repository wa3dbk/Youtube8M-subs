thing<00:00:27.740> of<00:00:27.859> course<00:00:28.039> we<00:00:28.250> need<00:00:28.400> to<00:00:28.430> do<00:00:28.609> plug<00:00:29.480> in

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
thing of course we need to do plug in

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.670 
thing of course we need to do plug in
that<00:00:29.840> signal<00:00:30.380> cable<00:00:32.110> it<00:00:33.110> just<00:00:33.320> snaps<00:00:33.559> back

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
that signal cable it just snaps back

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.869 
that signal cable it just snaps back
into<00:00:33.860> place<00:00:35.860> then<00:00:36.860> we<00:00:37.280> can<00:00:37.309> install<00:00:37.820> the

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
into place then we can install the

monitor or the power supply board back

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:50.069 
monitor or the power supply board back
in<00:00:45.940> this<00:00:46.940> slides<00:00:47.300> it<00:00:47.449> back<00:00:47.540> into<00:00:47.690> place

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.200 

put<00:00:51.079> our<00:00:51.199> screws<00:00:51.589> back<00:00:51.920> in<00:00:52.190> you<00:00:52.850> do<00:00:52.970> want<00:00:53.180> to

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
put our screws back in you do want to

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.600 
put our screws back in you do want to
make<00:00:53.300> sure<00:00:53.440> even<00:00:54.440> before<00:00:54.559> you<00:00:54.860> if<00:00:55.190> you're<00:00:55.430> just

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
make sure even before you if you're just

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.549 
make sure even before you if you're just
testing<00:00:56.090> it<00:00:56.210> you<00:00:56.960> still<00:00:57.170> want<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.379> make<00:00:57.530> sure

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
testing it you still want to make sure

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.099

that<00:00:57.829> you<00:00:57.949> have<00:00:58.070> all<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:58.520> screws<00:00:58.850> back<00:00:59.840> in

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
that you have all the screws back in

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.210 
that you have all the screws back in
because<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.800> board<00:01:01.039> uses<00:01:01.489> some<00:01:02.359> of<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:03.220> screw

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
because the board uses some of the screw

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
to provide return paths for the power

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.290 
to provide return paths for the power
and<00:01:12.979> if<00:01:13.970> you<00:01:14.060> don't<00:01:14.210> have<00:01:14.390> them<00:01:14.509> all<00:01:14.600> installed

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
and if you don't have them all installed

and if you don't have them all installed
the<00:01:17.300> board<00:01:17.570> is<00:01:18.170> not<00:01:18.350> properly<00:01:18.770> grounded<00:01:18.860> and

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
the board is not properly grounded and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.240 
the board is not properly grounded and
could<00:01:19.850> cause<00:01:20.090> an<00:01:20.300> electrical<00:01:21.220> shock<00:01:22.220> hazard

could cause an electrical shock hazard

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.120 
could cause an electrical shock hazard
for<00:01:22.940> you<00:01:23.090> so<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:23.720> do<00:01:23.840> want<00:01:24.020> to<00:01:24.050> make<00:01:24.140> sure<00:01:24.320> that

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
got our four screws back in now we'll

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.559 
got our four screws back in now we'll
just<00:01:38.090> rotate<00:01:38.360> this<00:01:38.750> back<00:01:38.959> around<00:01:43.239> lift<00:01:44.239> up<00:01:44.420> the

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
does not matter which one goes into

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.309 
does not matter which one goes into
which<00:02:08.989> of<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.259> two<00:02:09.379> connectors<00:02:10.540> they<00:02:11.540> all<00:02:11.989> put

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
which of the two connectors they all put

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
back into place this little board comes

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.500 
back into place this little board comes
out<00:02:32.260> probably<00:02:33.459> 80%<00:02:34.459> of<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:34.910> time<00:02:35.150> when<00:02:35.420> you're
