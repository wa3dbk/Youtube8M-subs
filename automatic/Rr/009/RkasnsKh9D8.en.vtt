00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 reus and antoine louis for second 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.049
 tutorial on our plates 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.330
 if tutorial will be based on dexterity 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.250
 Charlie dribbles basic basketball 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:33.180
 well, we hope you enjoy it and 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:34.890
 that you will leave volunteers for 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.809
 the change of which in fact 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.980
 take for example wanted to borrow at 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.190
 right for right we have right 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.039
 where is it 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.070
 good that's it is easy to Basel in 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:01:01.370
 under the knees good care and lyon 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:01:13.760
 basket here and there you go hop a month 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:16.409
 crossed the crossing 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.540
 so in fact the poison tomorrow is a 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.520
 little change of hands but if you 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.200
 when the pack brand under the legs so 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.140
 as antoine explained it all to 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.090
 the time the change of hands is that 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.990
 so we 're going to go right we do that and 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.390
 this is the inverted 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.369
 in fact we're going to leave we'll put his 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.920
 right foot but then we will put his 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.930
 left foot ahead and we will pass it in 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.930
 underneath it gives that 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.070
 that's actually it's often practical 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.869
 to pass the players daddy exceeds 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.909
 leader I think it's serious 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.140
 convenient 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:01.590
 beaten for example you have held by 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.429
 defender who you this is left 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.530
 so that's how I wanted to make a 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:11.920
 feint of changes tomorrow left this 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:27.730
 but put the right foot ahead and it's going 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:30.220
 like the right so dribble project is 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:35.260
 in the back and that makes you go 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:40.450
 do your defenders and get the 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:49.989
 ball in the back then to the basket so 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:03:03.310
 that's what it gives and you shoot for the 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:03:04.840
 wines for the left and his ears so 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.250
 here is an exercise to train you to 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:32.160
 small dribble various games for 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:38.670
 small streets we begin the complicated 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:42.659
 like that you put yourself missed 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.659
 then we get hired 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.860
 so here are all the exercises that you 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.409
 watch it's for better the future is going 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.030
 better like that in maths you lose months 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.860
 often the ball 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.120
 so there is that too you take your 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.579
 ball and turn around our 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:08.019
 days since it is growing 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:12.540
 after you can mount people 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:37.090
 around the waist direction of the exchange 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:39.610
 otherwise thank you for watching this 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.039
 tutorial these new tools honey the 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.539
 second but I can just do 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.370
 that you are going to think about leaving 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:48.120
 comments and see you soon for a 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.120
