00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:08.400
 live and sounding the fire we're going 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.670
 to make some spinach cannelloni 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.630
 stuffed ricotta ham thorn a 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.750
 Galician we started with with the filling 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.500
 There in a pan saucepan let 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:27.019
 start sautÃ©ing a little bit of flavor 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.019
 a lot of olive oil 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:38.480
 good amount of onion a great note 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:44.120
 or Medianite synods chopped well over or 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.120
 less big or very big I have for 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.980
 the good 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.460
 the black way but because what is the 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:01:00.510
 problem with reality 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:00.510
 then the weather 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:20.010
 one thing then for family cannelloni 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.470
 repairman 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.840
 and here we were with the video since 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.790
 we are all men and I am not is and I 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.200
 notice where it is 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.200
 an individual who had vacated a 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.050
 railing wardrobe a thing like that a glass 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.980
 of letter we can take the meetings of 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.980
 a ping pong match 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.520
 exactly with mass for a little while 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.920
 but we started by skipping then 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.860
 a spoonful of oil an onion well 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.530
 big cut so be big enough 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.560
 with a little bit of salt and about that 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.780
 notice that we come with this sheet of 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.119
 spinach that can actually also 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.610
 be of chard you chosen as it comes 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.340
 better the soybeans are washed well 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.560
 certain leaf by leaf is almost all the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.870
 tenderly rinse the well is clean 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.020
 well and see that without 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.120
 previous boil by the single contact with 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.860
 the heat and steam that emanate from the 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.720
 onion 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.050
 this is going to pachuca is not pulling 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.110
 shrinking 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:35.720
 and the most we do a little bit and myself 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.580
 we are going to add ham because now 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.560
 of savoy 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.600
 the baby as she is talking 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.820
 swollen this now that we're alone 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.120
 men and for women not as always 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.870
 because when we do not when we meet 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.100
 males because they think we talk 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.040
 we talk about bonn 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.469
 we can not live without the woman nobody 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.549
 and now I do for women as is 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.549
 we do it all 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.519
 the baker today 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:29.020
 and we are also going to make a region 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:32.170
 because many people who kill with the same 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.730
 both things for the same price I would 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.880
 I write down then with this because to me 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.110
 I like life very much 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.110
 these are the bizcochitos 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.490
 very well 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.530
 notice that after a slight 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.590
 sauteed the onion with the corner 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.520
 raw we put is that if you want 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.770
 he puts pepper we add the ricotta 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.350
 and now we are mixing all this 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.570
 because it's going to be the filling 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.670
 fill that is already ready that I give them 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.990
 I recommend that you do so this way 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.820
 way he mixes it with ricotta and then 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.480
 he's going to try it and there's no need to 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.480
 put him to this 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.400
 you do not have to put what to me is 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.800
 liking very much and the other then 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.810
 bowles 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.430
 recipients and we want to thank 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.430

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.159
 this if all is well I have the heifer 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.780
 because it is a little bit like it 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:55.950
 that is a bit past located in 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.720
 serious 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.880
 there are things that I do not share now 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.470
 rom and call it fads to the bad 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.540
 customs calls her to the lack of 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.400
 I respect other fashion so now what 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:16.660
 they have caught are fashionable 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:18.400
 At the scale of things here has the 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.500
 stuffing and I'm going to let him rest 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.590
 to lower the temperature a little 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.350
 we're not going to a tiny break our 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.270
 town that I promise to do the 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.520
 continent the continent the content 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.910
 the cannelloni itself is the 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.910
