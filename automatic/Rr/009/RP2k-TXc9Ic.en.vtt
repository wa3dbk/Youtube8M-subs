 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.630
 another video of me my mother her 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.540
 be with betfair keyboard this is 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.150
 a video about the news game call of duty 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.279
 black ops 2 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.590
 yes it so that this game now 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.180
 either already got an update 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.669
 or will still get depending on how 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.590
 this video is coming up in the the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.210
 weapons were changed a bit 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.580
 that is not changed worlds 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.350
 news about the rumors but the fact 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.320
 how to deal with this news 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.760
 the npd as with the reactions to this 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.690
 news is handled fairly 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:53.010
 disturbed and that has the lead designer 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.110
 The balance was found in the game 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.210
 several death threats collected so 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.400
 because a few weeks have been changed 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.559
 we are talking about changes in the 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.390
 seconds remain after la 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.129
 revolution was in the order of 1.2 seconds 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.380
 interrogated at them and 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.060
 immediately filled the whole cdu the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.590
 kiddies from the reaction the news 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.329
 has caused, however, are not 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.729
 that understand the disturbing of mine 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.859
 opinion is not the twelve year old 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.140
 kids on sugar shock any 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:24.450
 death threats express but that the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.920
 people there completely germany act 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.570
 according to motto, everything happens with everyone 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.670
 play all the same 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.619
 every model will jump or pet 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.030
 otherwise something turns people through 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.030
 I'm the only one of the six 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.159
 I find my little children stowed away 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.630
 gamble video game know all this 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.890
 people know the whole thing 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.020
 Voluntary self-control where to do it 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.909
 the games are infected or otherwise 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.649
 even those who know that call of duty 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.439
 played mainly by twelve-year-olds 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.329
 It's just that way but I think so 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.310
 crass that in the five stitches 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.100
 adult making money from it 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.310
 since so completely schillig rinse 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.979
 every now and then happens to nuts 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.600
 do not go around to the problem on 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.170
 one that threatens people's deaths 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.720
 say 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.180
 but they do not work on them either 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.790
 problematic that it is not finite 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.050
 Location are but fanboys and the and 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.930
 then make sure that the game works 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.690
 I do not change my talk about it 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.110
 the core problem of this news go 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.430
 we do not want to 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.230
 greasy soiled normal 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.210
 Part of the whole problem 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.370
 namely the twelve year old children's choir hats 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.680
 play but the core problem are 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.270
 the fanboys at every game if not 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.440
 only piano and I would everytime 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.600
 Get death threats if I 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.500
 any game he would still balance 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.270
 never at all 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.950
 you never know how to change me 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.070
 Whatever the people are talking about 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.890
 anyway from bamboo are a problem no matter 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.440
 regardless of whether in the discussion 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.940
 apple vs windows no matter if in the 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:01.480
 discussion mac against laptop no matter where 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:05.680
 iphone or android phone at gamestop 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.320
 now the playstation gay box as well 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.340
 always 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.770
 fanboys are a problem i remember 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.560
 me still at the times of m 64 against 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.750
 playstation 1 at that time something against 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.700
 Persian 1 or 60 away has said 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.739
 where you automatically as a fanboy the 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.290
 other parties to sting 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.270
 no matter what you said where then 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.600
 even among colleagues as soon as I get theirs 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.670
 I know I'm a huge fan of the n64 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.160
 when I play my 20 favorite games 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.739
 List role during four or five 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.480
 of it on 5 on the n64 as simply one 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.280
 But the ingenious console was the controller 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.959
 shit but puke 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.580
 the controller was the bad one 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.790
 controller I've ever seen there 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:50.890
 worse than the control of the katari 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:53.380
 2 260 2600 whoever was 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.209
 worse the controller what to puke 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.160
 but every time you say that 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.040
 people did not react 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:04.390
 is just that fanboy attitude that 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.920
 you do not want to hear what sort of that 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.660
 own favorite felt their own 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.100
 favorite control the favorite mobile phone 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.650
 favorite platform anyway 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.180
 criticizes that it is a problem 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.220
 not that so many little children 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.440
 on sugar shock the death threat 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.329
 mediate it is about that just this 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.010
 12 4 to small children on sugar shock 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.200
 Furthermore, that the technology continues or 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.760
 The game continues from call of duty 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.770
 has just got stuck 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.360
 Let's face it, honestly 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.310
 Do not play as sides or weapons 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.880
 really changed 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:36.240
 It is not the fault of the 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.240
 whole 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:42.620
 The chiefs of indignation are something 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:44.449
 to change is the debt fanboys me 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.389
 my man has seen 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.969
 we have changes from one 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.280
 second installed at 23 weapons and 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:53.599
 Immediately are all crazy what 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.719
 then you should play the game 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:58.340
 completely rebuilt again 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:59.659
 People just want to have that 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.719
 were you used to 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:04.280
 and although they all say we want us 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:07.729
 want change want innovative 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:11.330
 Ideas do not buy these innovative ideas 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.939
 And nobody drew the innovative games 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.129
 go to blame are also 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:19.759
 That's why I almost want to for the following 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:21.919
 crazy idea that you have a game and 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:23.900
 I really know it's a revolutionary one 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:27.319
 ideas revolutionary thought that one 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.199
 each game individually evaluated is the 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:33.379
 not outrageous is not absolute 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:36.919
 be shit if the successor horny 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:38.719
 it is the successor just as much elsewhere 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.240
 bet with you i bet with you 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:45.949
 if we bring out a game now 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:48.379
 that would somehow be the farm 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:50.690
 simulator 2017 will be the wishes 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:54.110
 which helped life 3 call the people 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:56.599
 would give the evaluation everywhere 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.169
 why was half life 2 simply defensive? 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:01.759
 was just an ultra awesome game 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:05.060
 he has nothing to do with it if that 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:06.110
 shit shit shit, or shit 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.370
 shit, shit 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.310
 should we actually say that you 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.199
 shit is therefore my question to you 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.990
 Here is my question from every news question 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:17.180
 I you always some what do you think that 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.039
 the whole fanboys the actual 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.099
 thinks unfold development of games 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:24.349
 that's why call of duty as well 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:25.849
 stagnant as it just stagnates 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:27.319
 absolutely no further development 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:29.960
 just for the may not know 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:32.750
 It's worth developing a game because of it 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.120
 More keeps generating than positive feedback 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.589
 these are fan bus to blame that the 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.960
 gaming industry just really 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:41.060
 is deadlocked or I see the whole 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.770
 is wrong your opinion in any case 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.849
 otherwise ask us until the next one 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.849
 times and ciao
