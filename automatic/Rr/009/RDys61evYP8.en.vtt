00:00:15.778 --> 00:00:18.079
Berola is going to debut today!

00:00:18.258 --> 00:00:19.821
That's right!

00:00:19.822 --> 00:00:21.666
Look at the camera,
say hello!

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:22.645
Take a look at my side profile!

00:00:24.404 --> 00:00:25.594
Dude, seriously now,

00:00:26.388 --> 00:00:29.946
are you going to grow out your hair
to look like David Luiz?

00:00:29.947 --> 00:00:32.253
- It'll be awesome!
- Don't you do that!

00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:36.197
- There's also a surprise coming!
- Don't do that, dude!

00:00:36.198 --> 00:00:38.768
- Wait for my surprise!
- Don't do that!

00:00:39.297 --> 00:00:44.441
- That won't work out for you!
- Wait for my surprise, guys!

00:00:44.442 --> 00:00:47.694
He managed to make money
with that hairstyle,

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:49.762
but that hairstyle
won't work out for you!

00:00:49.763 --> 00:00:52.985
My hair is better,
it will look even better!

00:00:53.496 --> 00:00:55.253
He's really stubborn, dude!

00:03:13.702 --> 00:03:15.717
We can't miss any more passes,

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:19.568
we must be aware of the fact
that we can't miss any more passes.

00:03:19.891 --> 00:03:21.163
We can't miss any more passes.

00:03:21.278 --> 00:03:22.229
Besides,

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:23.462
we must play collectively.

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:53.853
We'll keep working hard,

00:03:53.854 --> 00:03:56.041
we've been suffering goals
that could had been avoided.

00:03:56.263 --> 00:03:57.456
We need to improve ourselves,

00:03:57.457 --> 00:03:58.874
we didn't win, unfortunately,
but...

00:03:59.355 --> 00:04:01.435
we'll keep working, we'll dispute
an important match on Wednesday.

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:05.687
We'll keep working to play against
AtlÃ©tico and, God willing, win.

00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:06.693
We must move forward,

00:04:06.694 --> 00:04:08.863
we need our fans
to keep supporting us,

00:04:08.864 --> 00:04:10.314
they are extremely important.
