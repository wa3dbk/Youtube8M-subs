outstanding<00:02:09.330> individuals<00:02:10.140> both<00:02:10.740> on<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
outstanding individuals both on the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.710 
outstanding individuals both on the
court<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> classroom<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.060> personally

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
court in the classroom and personally

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.860 
court in the classroom and personally
you<00:02:13.260> know<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.620> players<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.100> good<00:02:14.340> character

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
you know the players a good character

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.780 
you know the players a good character
they<00:02:15.870> they<00:02:16.650> truly<00:02:17.069> care<00:02:17.100> about<00:02:17.340> one<00:02:17.760> another

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.550 
and I think that shows up on their play
on<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.370> court
