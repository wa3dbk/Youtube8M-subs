00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and each bag costs one pound so that's a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.719 
and each bag costs one pound so that's a

hanging there's a soil where maybe it's
not<00:05:33.990> much<00:05:34.470> so<00:05:36.020> maybe<00:05:37.020> get<00:05:37.260> away<00:05:37.380> without

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
not much so maybe get away without

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:50.370 
not much so maybe get away without
washing<00:05:37.860> it

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.920 

so<00:05:50.830> even<00:05:51.010> when<00:05:51.190> it<00:05:51.220> to<00:05:51.400> make<00:05:51.550> big<00:05:52.360> thick<00:05:52.690> best

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
so even when it to make big thick best

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.380 
so even when it to make big thick best
so<00:05:53.260> you<00:05:53.650> choose<00:05:54.520> your<00:05:54.580> handles<00:05:55.060> it<00:05:55.180> really

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
so you choose your handles it really

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:14.220 
so you choose your handles it really
well

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:29.589 

Oh

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:33.159 

maybe<00:06:30.199> this<00:06:30.619> is<00:06:30.740> a<00:06:30.800> masticating<00:06:31.219> juicer<00:06:32.169> it's

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169 
maybe this is a masticating juicer it's

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:37.659 
maybe this is a masticating juicer it's
still<00:06:33.529> making<00:06:33.740> fun<00:06:35.919> on<00:06:36.919> the<00:06:37.039> top<00:06:37.249> of<00:06:37.399> the<00:06:37.460> tail

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:37.669 
still making fun on the top of the tail

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:42.159 
still making fun on the top of the tail
juice

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.169 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.930 

okay<00:06:42.740> sort<00:06:42.979> of

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
okay sort of

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.210 
okay sort of
now<00:06:45.930> this<00:06:46.110> will<00:06:46.230> let<00:06:46.410> this<00:06:46.530> run<00:06:46.770> for<00:06:46.800> a<00:06:47.070> bit

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
now this will let this run for a bit

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.930 
now this will let this run for a bit
longer<00:06:47.400> just<00:06:47.850> until<00:06:48.180> the<00:06:48.240> stop<00:06:48.570> is<00:06:48.690> ejecting

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
longer just until the stop is ejecting

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.580 
longer just until the stop is ejecting
cold<00:06:50.940> though<00:06:51.150> the<00:06:51.330> end<00:06:51.480> the<00:06:52.050> fact<00:06:52.290> that<00:06:52.410> was

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
cold though the end the fact that was

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.070 
cold though the end the fact that was
still<00:06:52.800> ejecting<00:06:53.340> all<00:06:53.580> means<00:06:54.000> that<00:06:54.240> is<00:06:54.750> still

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
still ejecting all means that is still

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:02.269 
still ejecting all means that is still
actually<00:06:55.290> teasing<00:06:56.570> inside

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:02.279 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:04.069 

and<00:07:02.369> you<00:07:02.909> can<00:07:03.059> see<00:07:03.269> then<00:07:03.449> the<00:07:03.539> bottom<00:07:03.839> is<00:07:03.929> still

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:04.079 
and you can see then the bottom is still

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:11.379 
and you can see then the bottom is still
dripping<00:07:04.919> out

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:11.389 

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.230

the<00:07:49.159> worst<00:07:49.340> part<00:07:49.699> about<00:07:49.789> it<00:07:54.939> but<00:07:55.939> that's

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 
the worst part about it but that's

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.050 
the worst part about it but that's
