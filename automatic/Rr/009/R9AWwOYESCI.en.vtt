 Monday if everything goes out on Tuesday and it 's that 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.170
 I was really out of my house and in 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.510
 how much I found out that the trailer came out 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.130
 dlc and by two legendary weapons and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.689
 He took the car and I entered my life 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.760
 had run so much really so 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.070
 guys in this video we started with a 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.930
 analysis of the fourth recording trailer 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.449
 dlc of call of duty advanced warfighter 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.690
 well that record and it would come out on August 4 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.250
 Tuesday that comes first in xbox live and 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.380
 guys this is going to be the last 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.210
 times we say this first on xbox 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.340
 live because later 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.460
 we'll start with the exclusivity of play 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.530
 station in targets 3 includes four 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.590
 new multiplayer maps fracture over 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.590
 load quarantine is one and of course the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.780
 last exo zombies map of this in 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.670
 that without a doubt is always what I most 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.480
 hai pea de los dlcs exo map 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.770
 zombies 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.989
 at first sight guys you see that no 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.579
 include no new weapon which under 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.129
 my point of view is a little 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.930
 disappointing since the previous one of the f 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.880
 or that included none has been then 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.310
 when it came to my head 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.409
 any of these maps could be a 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.360
 remake of some old love map 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.130
 you very special team like for example 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.770
 you remember the easter &amp; company of 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.899
 previous dlc with the map of rus ok 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.909
 Well let's get out of doubt we start 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.829
 with the fracture map is set 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.720
 in the Arctic another snow map 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.520
 we start here with the power to 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.380
 clips the truth very well medium large in 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.630
 this witch city so that work 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.670
 kill if I did not know if we do 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.409
 here used again my mother like 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.450
 laterally and it's good that neither is 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.360
 triple fit and attention dynamic element 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.530
 then it's theater since it puts 475 in its 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.689
 trailers but good dynamic element 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.399
 this great map is that the ice is 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.049
 breaks and clear the people who are there then 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.119
 it can not be uncle the water is very cold and 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.250
 you will not survive next dad over 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.110
 load such a luxury complex is 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.340
 beautiful administration and that yes that 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.229
 I liked how you kill a line of 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.640
 the m-14 not friend friend of you kill if 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.409
 they want to use rocket launchers in the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.700
 password because I think it's good 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.319
 week guys that in a video convinced 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.579
 that is set in new battle and 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.470
 the truth that the well chosen complex 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.390
 it's pretty cool and the element 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.590
 dynamic are the plasma towers that 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.790
 We can use in our favor you 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.210
 we shoot and the enemies that are 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.800
 around 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.540
 we melted them I did not know I could 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.950
 speak so fast really quarantine 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.840
 map set in what's around 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.730
 of the state of freedom I do not know if I know 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.670
 have invented or is this really that 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.150
 attention to the fabric joke although it's going to 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.950
 load the frame with the shotgun edge 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.720
 it's like that or good the truth the joke and that 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.400
 dynamic element is that the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.140
 ground and I'm not kidding you see how it 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.580
 is sinking the ground attention that louse 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.620
 of the legendary father costume sneaks the 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.000
 pineapple by the wheel and life bursts 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.460
 and then there are those who had given us 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.110
 a lot of mind that they sneak around 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.390
 finalized multiplayer half or in Seoul 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.430
 shuar that guys in this at least 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.230
 they have gotten fuck gusts that in 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.540
 no map we have a special streak 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.190
 so nothing hidden that can be obtained with 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.230
 the package that gives him enough I lived there 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.330
 and here he will use it after this 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.040
 clip with the m1 irons show a lot 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.140
 the new weapons and here we stop the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.400
 image to see what is the flotilla of 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.020
 the new weapon that we have complicated of 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.010
 the new weapon forgiveness of the new streak 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.710
 that have complicated us a lot simply 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.780
 he puts his find like a lot of 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.430
 drones and in every shot so I see 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.630
 they shoot like six drones the truth 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.520
 it seems a streak that may be 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.310
 pretty good so this map is the 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.780
 what more desire do I get to play it before 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.790
 to spend connected zombies 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.890
 Wishing to spend with them because there are in 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.350
 the previous image already sees a new type 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.720
 of exo zombie kite the guys who do not 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.360
 we have no remake of any map 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.160
 old we do not have rus back in 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.290
 colombia ' pance warfare the truth for the 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.540
 theme of the multiplayer maps has me 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.030
 disappointed enough this dlc me 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.700
 I was expecting something more special uncle that is 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.160
 your last dlc the fourth of call of 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.069
 duty advanced warfighter and you put four 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.470
 maps with no more that neither seem to be 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.030
 very spectacular, I do not know, it's better 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.650
 that the gameplay is incredible but 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.820
 then it will happen where always two maps the 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.500
 playability will be medium well and the 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.600
 others because maybe he vomited when the 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.209
 judge but now yes yes guys we passed 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.760
 with those zombies last chapter from 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.440
 in the presentation it starts right where 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.840
 we leave it in the kinematics that 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.360
 showed at the end of the inss térek of 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.700
 carrier and that was believed dead is a 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.769
 zombie and suddenly the ship starts to 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.450
 sink I can tell you guys that the 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.519
 new map of exo zombies from stem goes to 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.430
 be set in a city under the 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.470
 water made by the crystals can be 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.910
 see that we are at the bottom of the sea to 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.410
 start do not see any news 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.600
 amazing only that the blunderbuss 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.420
 there will also be the exodus in bis I hope 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.530
 sincerely that is 32 times so 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.090
 less better than in the multiplayer 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.890
 because if not the truth that I'm going to 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.860
 write a bogey on the new time 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.390
 of exodus me with a lilac armor here 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.450
 so we can see it teleports 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:45.360
 it is already but if this is what the 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.190
 zombie with the blue armor in carrier yo 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.410
 I think he will have some ability 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.150
 special that is not shown in this 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.400
 trailer attention because it comes what 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.830
 interesting we have a new station 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.960
 apart from the exo that is the station 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.610
 of the trident later what 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.530
 we will understand and we also see how they have 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.930
 incorporated the armor to goliat to the 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.600
 exons that I suppose will come through 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.300
 help packages guys here we have yes 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.040
 the special weapon in the trident and so 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.050
 it looks like it's not going to get out of the box 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.030
 but of the station that I have shown you 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.890
 I liked the idea of 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.540
 how it works pulls a ray of light a 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.000
 laser beam that starts to bounce and to 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.150
 kill until it deviates last we 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.700
 they show a new special boss that will be 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.610
 the strongest zombie seen to date 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.080
 did not rule out that zombie is today in 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.280
 already doped mega plan because some 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.230
 outcome must have 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.900
 story with that character that I guess 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.720
 that we will discover with interest and 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.820
 end of the trailer a quick overview guys 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.560
 the true multiplayer maps is me 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.840
 they attract what is being shit 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.130
 dry except the swan with the streak that of 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.020
 the drones that attracts me a bit to 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.970
 try it and give what I'm pretty 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.650
 hype as always are with the sexes 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.790
 zombies because the truth lately 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.680
 I was getting a lot of little things 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.540
 new in the maps in carrer I took 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.970
 a lot of surprises the interest was 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.770
 very complicated and I feel like everything 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.870
 of discovering the secrets and of 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.120
 make the easter egg more things than you 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.430
 I have to comment although this dlc is not 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.830
 include new weapons on the blog in the 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:15.300
 that schleck know announced the arrival of 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:17.190
 stg nsv or ogre and the blunderbuss too 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.230
 they said who I do this would come new 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.000
 weapons to colombia warfare fans so they 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.460
 I calculate that after the vélez airways 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.680
 with and even after the call beta 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.630
 of duty black 23 would come new weapons 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.970
 legendary and others to ass beauty to 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.950
 password farc and finally guys but 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.020
 no less important at all 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.270

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.190
