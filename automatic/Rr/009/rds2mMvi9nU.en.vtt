00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.290
 you remember the other day I wanted to look 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.090
 direct sowing in the seedbed of 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.789
 pepper and tomato well now let's go 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.390
 to make a sow the taco in a 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.189
 tray of tomato alveoli so that 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.609
 you see the difference in this era 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.650
 can go sowing and in tacos that the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.570
 how will the taco make more temperature? 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.970
 they will heat up and it will germinate more 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.010
 easy then the first thing we do is 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.010
 fill the baking tray 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.090
 with the land that we have left over from all 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.230
 the operations do not need to 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.050
 let's change there are specific substrates for 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.200
 the hacienda but let's take advantage of what 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.200
 what we have 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.670
 that works just like 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.690
 brazil the leftover we leave well 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.720
 these tomato seeds is kind 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.470
 barbantes is rav type then it is a 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.290
 rib tomato or a slightly wide 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.659
 tau and red with a lot of flavor what we're going 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.920
 to do is to catch with the hand they separate 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.909
 seville and one by one 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.909
 we are going to plant 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.620
 you can plant 2 of 12 the in each 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.530
 can be planted two seeds per 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.860
 If anything, it fails that always 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.860
 let's have 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.970
 the covered cue we're going to do it like that in 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.460
 half of the alveoli for you to see 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.940
 how is it germinating and the possibilities 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.940
 what we have 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.170
 once 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.420
 all that we take the safety pin with the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.490
 that we have made the holes 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.880
 and what we do is 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.719
 sink the seed a little 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.719
 cover it 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.690
 so it does not dry out and so I do not know 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.700
 I carried 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.700
 the sparrow on duty 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.940
 and then the next step that I imagine 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.020
 that you will know what is 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:31.250
 what is the irrigation we take our sprinkler 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.250
 seedbed 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.330
 of wetting a little the tablecloth 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.580
 just a little 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.180
 and we already have the tomato seedbed 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.980
 marvÃ¡n del este this was a week of 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.830
 difference still did not start to germinate 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.470
 I was losing they start to look a little bit 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.320
 it said good because it is for today we have 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.930
 finished we have made a planter with 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.240
 pepper and with rocket seeds we have 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.860
 prepared a tomato seedbed and we have 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.240
 transplanted since it was a terrace 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.240
 an aloe vera plant
