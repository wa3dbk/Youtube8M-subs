00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello my name is thiago and I want to do 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.570
 this brief presentation to convince 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.540
 You never buy anything else in Brazil. 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.880
 I get pissed off with the absurd prices that 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.779
 the stores charge us Brazilians 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.840
 does not make the slightest sense to pay 400 500 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.180
 real by a nike sneaker or 300 reais 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.039
 and an adidas jacket I already had the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.050
 privilege of going to the United States and 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.160
 I was scared of the difference 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.019
 prices 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.890
 For example, I bought a nike sneaker. 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.780
 for $ 40, which is equivalent to 80 reais and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.200
 when I arrived in Brazil 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.160
 I saw this same shoe being sold 400 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.940
 real or is five times more expensive than 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.649
 worse 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.870
 I bought this sneaker in an alternative 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.660
 which are those famous 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.690
 settlement or while in the states 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.570
 together this model was already outdated 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.309
 I was out of the official stores in Brazil. 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.199
 was sold as if it were the last 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.379
 of the brand what was a 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.939
 true lie 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.570
 unfortunately this is the reality here in the 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.590
 Brazil 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.750
 the Brazilian only fucks because he gets bad 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.040
 and have to pay much more for 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.950
 almost everything 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.610
 so the best way to spend your 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.280
 money and make it pay more 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.530
 important these clothing accessories 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.810
 directly from overseas companies 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.450
 some should think poxa but this is not 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.850
 very difficult that I see that people 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.740
 they think that import business a lot 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.820
 complicated that involves a lot of 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.530
 bureaucracy 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.509
 but the truth is that the whole process is 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.509
 as simple as buying at any 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.520
 website in brazil many purchases from 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.250
 intermediaries for example in the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.320
 free in virtual stores because they know 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.920
 someone you trust or do not know 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.560
 English well know that you are paying 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.180
 much more expensive for the same product 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.790
 because they put a profit margin 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.969
 high on this resale 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.820
 in summary it's not worth buying from these 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.560
 sellers and the best deal is to import 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.959
 directly from brands 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.960
 there are a few for what pre 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.480
 requirements for this is first 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.610
 to tap into basic English the least 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.640
 just do a search on the website of the 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.850
 companies and search jacket t-shirt 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.640
 shoes and closing and closing the order is 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.080
 after that you need to have a 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.420
 international credit 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.030
 but today most of the cards 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.830
 already issued international then that does not 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.070
 it's no big barrier 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.630
 now the big balcony in this process is 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.870
