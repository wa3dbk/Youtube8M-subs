as<00:00:17.340> compared<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.880> last<00:00:18.000> few<00:00:18.240> years

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
as compared to the last few years

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.140 
as compared to the last few years
silvers<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.470> fifa<00:00:19.800> 10<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.220> 11<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.580> was<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:20.939> much

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
silvers on fifa 10 and 11 it was so much

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.700 
silvers on fifa 10 and 11 it was so much
better<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.660> ridiculous<00:00:22.260> how<00:00:22.289> much<00:00:22.529> better

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
better it's ridiculous how much better

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.800 
better it's ridiculous how much better
they<00:00:22.859> were<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.580> i'll<00:00:23.670> start<00:00:23.939> with<00:00:24.029> fifa<00:00:24.300> 10<00:00:24.510> and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
they were so i'll start with fifa 10 and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.019 
they were so i'll start with fifa 10 and
probably<00:00:25.470> free<00:00:25.590> 411<00:00:25.769> as<00:00:26.070> well<00:00:26.220> as<00:00:26.609> silvers

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
probably free 411 as well as silvers

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.609 
probably free 411 as well as silvers
weren't<00:00:27.269> as<00:00:27.359> commonly<00:00:27.660> used<00:00:27.900> back<00:00:28.080> then<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.590> a

weren't as commonly used back then so a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.050 
weren't as commonly used back then so a

the fenders midfielders then forwards I

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.420
