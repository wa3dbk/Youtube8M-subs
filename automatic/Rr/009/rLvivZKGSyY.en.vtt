00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.860
 Older team will soon be two years old 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.269

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.880

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.820
 there we have to ask and there we have 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:39.620
 Explanation what I am this monster 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.079
 as they came out for xs monster 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.399
 just got out of the new 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.199
 Need to have instructions there of course 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.859
 we have our promos and we have five 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:51.260
 pécs we have a generation ahead 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:53.359
 as a first pack and still doubt the 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.750
 once pack extremely victory and storm of 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:01:00.710
 ragnarok ok now look at the promos 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.789
 we are not really like that 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:09.590
 bad bonus for the time 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:12.610
 we've been freeing the cards from inside 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.680
 plastic we have there once 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:21.100

 very nice card photons deck itself 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.010
 again meet eight teams which 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.940
 but there are not so many good ones yet 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.990
 Eight, that's why the map is so well 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.479
 since the razors are already a lot 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.110
 better and then we have a lot too 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.880
 good card fossil lot give away the 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.840
 pronounces very good maps with mountain where 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.570
 you can use it quite the opponent 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.890

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.390
 I believe in the legendary connection 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.100
 three normal ended 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.140
 also a very interesting card 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.900
 you can determine later if 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.950
 you do not have a monster in the cemetery then 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.450

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.700
