00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.059
 when reversing 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.400
 the car is much more maneuverable than 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.590
 when moving forward this is due to 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.119
 that control takes place backwards 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.980
 wheel travel 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.869
 remember machines running 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.009
 limited space car 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.910
 loaders 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.529
 they are all driven by the rear wheels 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.140
 the front of the car is actually worth 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.380
 in place and the back of the car is spinning 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.829
 around her, too, comes from the car 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.180
 when she moves in reverse 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.460
 so the first rule when moving 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.010
 in reverse 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:52.500
 low speed extra care and 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:55.410
 accurate steering movements second 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.630
 rule where to go there 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.550
 the driverâ€™s gaze is directed and there 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:04.500
 twist the wheel the third rule is impossible 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.340
 try to correct a trajectory error 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.780
 vehicle movement increasing speed 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.509
 it is better to stop to think 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.270
 understand where to go and where to turn 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.030
 the steering wheel was and even in place unscrew the steering wheel 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.140
 right direction and only after that 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.700
 slowly start moving 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.069
 fourth rule when maneuvering 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.499
 reversing limited space 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.569
 minimum speed required 

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:36.869
 and the most intense and rotation 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:38.130
 driving and finally the fifth rule when 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.020
 reversing 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.499
 look back to a complete stop 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.499
 the car 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.590
 blood 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.020
 because to achieve the minimum 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.880
 vehicle speed when maneuvering 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.480
 both forward and reverse 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.800
 proper clutch operation is necessary 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.260
 release the clutch pedal before starting 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.190
 working code starting moment 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.310
 again press her car will drive 5-10 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.440
 centimeters and this maneuver will stop 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.250
 necessarily performed with a click 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.250
 gas pedal 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.500
 when reversing on 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.010
 car having visibility through the rear 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.110
 glass 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.410
 need on 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.350
 different down 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.840
 direction drivers without rear 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:03.740
 review as needed use 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:06.200
 no rear view mirrors 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.600
 can not start or continue to move 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.580
 reversing if you don't see 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.670
 obstacles that need an object 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.310
 or unsure of his position 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.630
 sometimes you need to get out of the car to make sure 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.550
 security maneuver 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.030
 as well as the exact position of the obstacle 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.700
 which must be traveled do not forget 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.739
 that a child may come from behind or 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.800
 animals that are not visible because of the height 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.810
 car not accidentally handled before 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.430
 there were requirements for the truck driver 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.989
 car was required to file 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.300
 beep before driving 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.090
 in reverse 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.980
 It is a pity that this rule is canceled although 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.410
 army well and left before the start 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:51.410
 reversing served double 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:53.569
 beep learning to rear movement 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.060
 course, we recommend starting with 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.989
 elementary exercise 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.989
 turn align 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:10.020
 with this basic recommendation you should 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.150
 look direction 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.690
 and the steering wheel turns to the other side 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.690
 want to 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:54.729
 the next exercise that follows 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.729
 master this so-called square 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.260
 the third exercise back snake 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.270
 doing this exercise try 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.160
 move as slowly as possible 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.160
 and driving as fast as possible 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.950
 pay attention to the work of the steering 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.950
 wheels 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.970
 fourth exercise corridor 

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:59.729
 this exercise is necessary to prepare 

00:07:54.569 --> 00:07:59.729
 next parking item
