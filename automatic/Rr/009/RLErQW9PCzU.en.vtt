00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.690
 another 8 eggs welcome one more 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.400
 are videos of male 4 in which today 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.350
 I'm bringing a small test video 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.820
 nothing more to see exactly how it's going 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.619
 to watch on youtube so that you 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.450
 count also that they present the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.130
 resolution is that youtube has done 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.900
 a few small changes lately the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.180
 system and the main change that to me 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.940
 I like there are actually two changes 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.100
 major that is not lately I 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.720
 it looks like it looks really good it's number one 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.970
 the number of frames per second that is 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.160
 they can upload that before was limited to 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.740
 29 nash 30 frames per second you want 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.620
 than in the quality of the repeated image 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.620
 frames almost every 30 times in a 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.790
 second instead of higher quality than 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.140
 we can record with that 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.590
 we play in video games 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.180
 for example in male that in general by 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.920
 the specifications of my pc I'm 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.950
 almost always playing around 70 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.630
 frames per second and visual quality 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.610
 of what I'm never seeing in the 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.810
 life because of the compression that it makes 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.150
 on youtube you can see exactly 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.890
 just like how omar illustrating can 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.110
 see as well as it would move even if 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.909
 uploaded in 1080p video or if uploaded 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.280
 in any 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.409
 resolution always failed the amount 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.009
 of programs because like I 'm not 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.840
 Watching how I'm playing in 1900 x 1080 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.959
 at 60 frames per second which is like 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.990
 you are really made the resolution of 

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:31.520
 in my pc for this game in fact is the 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.590
 same reduction resolution of which 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.259
 I'm playing too 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.740
 what is it called only with a tour 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.530
 and it's played in the xbox man and has a 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.819
 little less than the cost of 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.990
 customization inside the game 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.750
 so I wanted to do a little test 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.490
 for you to tell me how is this 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.930
 small that implemente continued playing 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.910
 utility machine 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:00.000
 a duel to death for teams if so 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.950
 I am always on the operation map 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.900
 local and I wanted to see that you guys 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.540
 tell how it looks like this uploaded to 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.750
 1080p with 60 garments per second I know that 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.850
 it's a lot on the internet apology for 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.380
 see 1080p you can also see 720 at 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.240
 end of accounts is high definition 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.570
 but the important thing is frames by 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.970
 second that the flame rate that 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.350
 cool the screen is much greater 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.780
 because we are talking about double 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.910
 frames every second inclusive when 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.680
 is playing in 60 frames you could do 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.450
 better slow cameras but good is that 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.550
 we will try it another day with different 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.230
 plugins 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.880
 what is the decision program called 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.410
 right now what I want to try 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.300
 is this resolution 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.390
 by the way playing brownfield has 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.160
 past satisfaction I was playing 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.330
 with the 3 is split took so many 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.330
 hours of playing followed 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.240
 1 the sensitivity of the male had no 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.850
 loans much greater than what 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.500
 this one of code tour and then he did 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.210
 feel like at the beginning I stayed 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.280
 thinking like that the goals came down 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.840
 sensitivity for a better with the 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.960
 high sensitivity and I do not know is also 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.700
 because I 've played several of 14 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.170
 many phrases of the year has been my 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.700
 main game you bloody am 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.320
 much more of suris than any 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.610
 another type of game except for the 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.010
 driving flights that have always had me 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.350
 looked for the other thing that I felt that I 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.900
 gave too much laughter is how many times 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.970
 try to make a double jump in several 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.090
 trying to activate it sexually and list 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.950
 ex or ex jets or non-sex skills 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.840
 skills can be called ex 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.750
 skills and nothing else for that to 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.610
 to get out of the dilemma sex 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.550
 country and dance work skills 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.860
 that become such a game dynamic 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.910
 different obviously but realistic in 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.520
 comparison with what you can not do 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.140
 more because ball film has more sodas 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.800
 and that feels a bit more real all 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.390
 why 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.220
 because it has always felt more real 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.310
 to communicate that is not different 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.360
 because the game is futuristic but 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.060
 advanced world has this new dynamic 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.520
 of game that changes a lot the the 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.700
 type of fights you're going to have in the 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:09.720
 speeds the height the capacity of 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.190
 dodge enemies like I am 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.070
 starting to feel strongly about 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.470
 everything right now playing balance 14 his 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.910
 comments to see what they think about the 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.080
 new resolution and if you like like 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.150
 favorites and what they do not leave the 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.150
 bitch wins and even passion is goodbye
