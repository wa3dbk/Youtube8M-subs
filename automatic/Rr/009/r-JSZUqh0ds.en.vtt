00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
that fast even though the fire rate is

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.940 
that fast even though the fire rate is
pretty<00:01:30.240> average<00:01:30.509> for<00:01:30.900> any<00:01:31.140> other<00:01:31.350> dala<00:01:31.560> pistol

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
pretty average for any other dala pistol

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.380 
pretty average for any other dala pistol
but<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.460> makes<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.790> kind<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.000> feel<00:01:33.119> fast

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
but it makes you kind of feel fast

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.730 
but it makes you kind of feel fast
because<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:33.840> such<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> little<00:01:34.290> weapon<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
because it's such a little weapon and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.380 
because it's such a little weapon and
you<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.040> move<00:01:35.189> around<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.610> lot<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:36.119> course

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
you can just move around a lot of course

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.390 
you can just move around a lot of course
the<00:01:36.570> teapot<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> download<00:01:37.530> weapon<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.280> is

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
the teapot is a download weapon so it is

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.340 
the teapot is a download weapon so it is
a<00:01:38.430> burst<00:01:38.850> fire<00:01:39.090> when<00:01:39.329> aim<00:01:39.540> down<00:01:39.720> sights<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
a burst fire when aim down sights and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.469 
a burst fire when aim down sights and
when<00:01:40.560> hip<00:01:40.740> firing<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.400> semi-automatic<00:01:41.790> and

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
when hip firing it is semi-automatic and

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.270 
when hip firing it is semi-automatic and
one<00:01:42.990> thing<00:01:43.200> that's<00:01:43.229> weird<00:01:43.590> about<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.920> weapon

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
one thing that's weird about this weapon

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.609 
one thing that's weird about this weapon
is<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.000> only<00:01:45.030> pistol<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.049> I'm<00:01:46.290> aware

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
of that has a two-round burst just a

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.109 
of that has a two-round burst just a
two-round<00:01:49.470> burst<00:01:49.619> when<00:01:50.430> aim<00:01:50.610> down<00:01:50.790> sight

which<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> bit<00:01:51.659> weird<00:01:51.689> now<00:01:52.439> let's<00:01:52.619> get<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.799> to

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
which is a bit weird now let's get on to

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.710 
which is a bit weird now let's get on to
the<00:01:53.100> main<00:01:53.369> special<00:01:53.790> attributes<00:01:54.240> about<00:01:54.540> this

corrosive<00:02:03.630> prefix<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.409> teapot<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.799> i'm

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
corrosive prefix on this teapot that i'm

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.830 
corrosive prefix on this teapot that i'm
using<00:02:05.280> right<00:02:05.310> now<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.880> that's<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.719> one

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
using right now but that's just one

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.630 
using right now but that's just one
prefix<00:02:07.439> there<00:02:07.649> are<00:02:07.740> plenty<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.129> other<00:02:08.250> prefix

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640

prefix there are plenty of other prefix
that<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.090> get<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.569> not<00:02:09.810> just

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
that you can get and it's not just

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.479 
that you can get and it's not just
corrosive<00:02:10.500> because<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.830> have<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.099> corrosive

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
corrosive because I have the corrosive

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.040 
corrosive because I have the corrosive
prefix<00:02:11.879> just<00:02:12.120> want<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.360> clear<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.690> up<00:02:12.750> if

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
prefix just want to clear that up if

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.559 
prefix just want to clear that up if
that's<00:02:13.260> what<00:02:13.379> you

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
that's what you

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.479 
that's what you
been<00:02:13.659> thinking<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.170> teapot<00:02:14.530> has<00:02:14.799> a<00:02:15.069> pretty

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
been thinking the teapot has a pretty

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.429 
been thinking the teapot has a pretty
large<00:02:15.819> explosive<00:02:16.390> effect<00:02:16.780> as<00:02:16.959> you<00:02:17.079> can<00:02:17.200> see<00:02:17.319> if

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
large explosive effect as you can see if

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:18.899 
large explosive effect as you can see if
I'm<00:02:17.590> shooting<00:02:17.799> the<00:02:18.010> enemies<00:02:18.280> right<00:02:18.459> now<00:02:18.609> these

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
I'm shooting the enemies right now these

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.270 
I'm shooting the enemies right now these
compared<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:20.049> other<00:02:20.319> corrosive<00:02:20.620> weapons<00:02:21.129> this

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
compared to other corrosive weapons this

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.429 
compared to other corrosive weapons this
has<00:02:21.489> a<00:02:21.519> pretty<00:02:22.030> large<00:02:22.389> splash<00:02:22.840> radius<00:02:23.079> and

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:23.439 
has a pretty large splash radius and

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.440 
has a pretty large splash radius and
this<00:02:23.560> nice<00:02:24.219> when<00:02:24.639> you're<00:02:24.760> using<00:02:24.909> the<00:02:25.090> siren

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
this nice when you're using the siren

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.119 
this nice when you're using the siren
because<00:02:25.749> when<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:25.989> face<00:02:26.170> lock<00:02:26.439> in<00:02:26.590> enemy<00:02:26.920> and

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
because when you face lock in enemy and

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.830 
because when you face lock in enemy and
if<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:27.549> have<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.849> convert<00:02:28.239> skill<00:02:28.540> on<00:02:28.689> you

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
if you have the convert skill on you

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.539 
if you have the convert skill on you
bunch<00:02:29.049> them<00:02:29.290> all<00:02:29.379> together<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.829> you<00:02:30.159> can<00:02:30.310> just

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
bunch them all together and you can just

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.640 
bunch them all together and you can just
hit<00:02:30.969> all<00:02:31.239> of<00:02:31.269> them<00:02:31.569> you<00:02:31.719> can<00:02:31.840> corrode<00:02:32.170> all<00:02:32.469> of

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
hit all of them you can corrode all of

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.129 
hit all of them you can corrode all of
the<00:02:32.739> enemies<00:02:33.069> with<00:02:33.250> just<00:02:33.489> one<00:02:33.760> shot<00:02:34.000> as<00:02:34.269> I<00:02:34.959> say

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:35.139 
the enemies with just one shot as I say

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.140 
the enemies with just one shot as I say
with<00:02:35.349> all<00:02:35.590> other<00:02:35.859> corrosive<00:02:36.129> weapons<00:02:36.760> i<00:02:36.969> would

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
with all other corrosive weapons i would

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.910 
with all other corrosive weapons i would
definitely<00:02:37.450> recommend<00:02:37.719> the<00:02:38.079> teapot<00:02:38.439> only

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
definitely recommend the teapot only

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.649 
definitely recommend the teapot only
