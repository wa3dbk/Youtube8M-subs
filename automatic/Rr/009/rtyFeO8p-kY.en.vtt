him I went on the market to check a few
other<00:02:05.070> players<00:02:05.399> then<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.180> went<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.360> check<00:02:06.600> his

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
other players then I went to check his

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.449 
other players then I went to check his
price<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.320> market<00:02:07.350> then<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.099> found<00:02:08.340> this

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
price on the market then I found this

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.750 
price on the market then I found this
one<00:02:08.580> here<00:02:08.940> for<00:02:09.179> 72<00:02:09.690> k<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.280> then<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.400> sold<00:02:11.670> him

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
one here for 72 k so and then I sold him

one here for 72 k so and then I sold him
for<00:02:11.819> 84<00:02:12.480> 500

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
for 84 500

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.080 
for 84 500
so<00:02:13.830> basically<00:02:14.220> double<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.640> profit<00:02:14.820> that<00:02:15.000> I

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
so basically double the profit that I

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.030 
so basically double the profit that I
was<00:02:15.240> going<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.450> make<00:02:15.570> on<00:02:15.750> one<00:02:15.960> auto<00:02:16.140> on<00:02:16.620> two

was going to make on one auto on two
novels<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.610> this<00:02:18.090> definitely<00:02:18.210> happens<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.900> me

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
novels and this definitely happens to me

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.880 
novels and this definitely happens to me
a<00:02:19.230> lot<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.800> times<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.660> it's<00:02:21.660> just<00:02:21.960> if<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.710> keep

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
a lot of times so it's just if you keep

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.260 
a lot of times so it's just if you keep
going<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.310> checking<00:02:23.400> place<00:02:23.850> on<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.150> market

moth-eaten oh but for 11 thought for 13
to<00:03:18.570> 15<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.620> I've<00:03:19.709> set<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.100> a<00:03:20.130> bunch<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.459> times

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
to 15 and I've set is a bunch of times

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.430 
to 15 and I've set is a bunch of times
before<00:03:20.880> but<00:03:21.330> these<00:03:21.630> cheap<00:03:21.840> in<00:03:21.990> firms<00:03:22.260> around

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
before but these cheap in firms around

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.740 
before but these cheap in firms around
10k<00:03:22.920> or<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.459> think<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.300> can<00:03:24.360> quite

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
10k or so I think you can quite

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.620 
10k or so I think you can quite
consistently<00:03:25.350> get<00:03:25.709> them<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.130> make<00:03:26.880> about<00:03:27.150> 23

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
consistently get them and make about 23

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.020 
consistently get them and make about 23
k<00:03:27.780> proper<00:03:28.170> so<00:03:28.470> which<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.160> really<00:03:29.430> good<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:29.970> you

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
k proper so which is really good and you

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.360 
k proper so which is really good and you

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
not end with a bank this is actually the

not end with a bank this is actually the
lowest<00:03:46.830> profit<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.120> episode<00:03:48.510> but<00:03:49.670> you

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
lowest profit of the episode but you

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.980 
lowest profit of the episode but you
know<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.910> was<00:03:51.030> just<00:03:51.209> one<00:03:51.420> of<00:03:51.450> those<00:03:51.540> kids<00:03:51.840> that

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
know it was just one of those kids that

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.050 
know it was just one of those kids that
i<00:03:52.110> can<00:03:52.410> describe<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.890> guy<00:03:52.980> for<00:03:53.040> amar<00:03:53.400> so<00:03:54.030> I

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
i can describe the guy for amar so I

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.720 
i can describe the guy for amar so I
don't<00:03:54.360> see<00:03:54.510> why<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:54.660> shouldn't<00:03:54.990> pick<00:03:55.230> him<00:03:55.440> up<00:03:55.730> so

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
don't see why I shouldn't pick him up so

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.060 
don't see why I shouldn't pick him up so
to<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.060> total<00:03:57.240> stats<00:03:57.510> here<00:03:57.780> we<00:03:58.530> spent<00:03:58.830> almost

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
to the total stats here we spent almost

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.970 
to the total stats here we spent almost
500<00:03:59.640> k<00:03:59.820> cut<00:04:00.450> back<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.690> little<00:04:00.990> bit<00:04:01.170> over<00:04:01.380> six<00:04:01.530> and

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
500 k cut back a little bit over six and

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.130 
500 k cut back a little bit over six and
ok<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:02.880> in<00:04:03.090> 13<00:04:03.450> trades<00:04:03.750> made<00:04:04.410> 86<00:04:04.980> k<00:04:05.220> coins<00:04:06.110> so<00:04:07.110> I

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
ok so in 13 trades made 86 k coins so I

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.600 
ok so in 13 trades made 86 k coins so I
think<00:04:07.260> that's<00:04:07.560> pretty<00:04:07.680> good<00:04:07.920> didn't<00:04:08.310> read<00:04:08.430> as

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
think that's pretty good didn't read as

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
think that's pretty good didn't read as
much<00:04:08.820> as<00:04:08.970> much<00:04:10.670> players<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:12.120> some<00:04:12.420> of<00:04:12.570> the

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
much as much players and some of the

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.860 
much as much players and some of the
other<00:04:13.430> prophet<00:04:14.430> sessions<00:04:14.790> but<00:04:15.390> i<00:04:15.450> think<00:04:15.690> it

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
other prophet sessions but i think it

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.490 
other prophet sessions but i think it
was<00:04:15.959> still<00:04:16.200> a<00:04:16.230> pretty<00:04:16.590> good<00:04:17.270> session<00:04:18.470> so<00:04:19.470> i

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
was still a pretty good session so i

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.110 
was still a pretty good session so i
hope<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:19.770> enjoy<00:04:20.040> this<00:04:20.190> i<00:04:20.430> actually<00:04:21.030> already
