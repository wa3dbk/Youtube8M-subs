game<00:01:32.549> played<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:33.000> because<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.810> ops

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
game played just because it is that ops

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.690 
game played just because it is that ops
arcade<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:35.220> isn't<00:01:35.490> really<00:01:35.579> much

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
arcade and there isn't really much

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.780 
arcade and there isn't really much
strategy<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.780> one<00:01:37.320> main<00:01:37.860> tip<00:01:38.220> i<00:01:38.369> guess<00:01:38.549> you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
strategy to it one main tip i guess you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.179 
strategy to it one main tip i guess you
could<00:01:39.000> say<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.420> always<00:01:39.750> keep<00:01:40.140> moving<00:01:40.500> but

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
could say is always keep moving but

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.469 
could say is always keep moving but
right<00:01:41.340> now<00:01:41.490> i<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.759> since<00:01:42.030> i<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.329> death

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
right now i have since i have the death

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.050 
right now i have since i have the death
machine<00:01:42.630> or<00:01:43.079> power<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.560> I'm<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:44.250> stayed<00:01:45.030> there

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
machine or power up I'm I stayed there

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.240 
machine or power up I'm I stayed there
for<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.420> little<00:01:45.540> bit<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:45.899> i'd<00:01:46.470> recommend<00:01:46.979> keep

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
for a little bit but i'd recommend keep

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.249 
for a little bit but i'd recommend keep
moving<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:48.270> try<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> rape<00:01:49.049> train

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
moving you can try to do a rape train

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.020 
moving you can try to do a rape train
but<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.619> pretty<00:01:49.860> tough<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.130> because<00:01:50.700> they

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
but it's pretty tough to because they

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.420 
but it's pretty tough to because they
come<00:01:51.210> from<00:01:51.240> all<00:01:51.509> different<00:01:51.540> angles<00:01:52.310> but<00:01:53.310> you

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
come from all different angles but you

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.590 
come from all different angles but you
could<00:01:53.579> definitely<00:01:53.700> kind<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.299> pull<00:01:54.450> them

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
could definitely kind of pull them

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.149 
could definitely kind of pull them
toward<00:01:54.810> one<00:01:54.960> direction<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.530> go<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> other

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
toward one direction and go the other

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.830 
toward one direction and go the other
direction<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:56.909> pretty<00:01:57.180> tough<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.450> it

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
direction but it's pretty tough and it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.480 
direction but it's pretty tough and it
and<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.259> higher<00:01:58.469> rounds<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.920> gets<00:01:59.040> very<00:01:59.100> very

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and this higher rounds it gets very very

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.060 
and this higher rounds it gets very very
hard<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.270> starts<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> get<00:02:01.110> more<00:02:01.290> difficult<00:02:01.740> at

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
hard it starts to get more difficult at

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.649 
hard it starts to get more difficult at
the<00:02:02.399> point<00:02:02.670> when<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.000> start<00:02:03.240> facing<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the point when you start facing the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.120 
the point when you start facing the
novogratz<00:02:03.930> crawlers<00:02:04.380> because<00:02:04.409> those<00:02:04.920> guys

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
novogratz crawlers because those guys

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.910 
novogratz crawlers because those guys
those<00:02:05.880> little<00:02:06.149> bitches<00:02:06.390> run<00:02:06.930> pretty<00:02:07.200> fast<00:02:07.320> and

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
those little bitches run pretty fast and

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.380 
those little bitches run pretty fast and
they're<00:02:08.009> pretty<00:02:08.129> hard<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.459> see<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.759> those<00:02:08.879> ruin

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
they're pretty hard to see in those ruin

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.110 
they're pretty hard to see in those ruin
ruins<00:02:10.050> on<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.920> area<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.430> map

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
ruins on the area of the map

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.890 
ruins on the area of the map
and<00:02:13.489> it<00:02:14.489> does<00:02:14.700> get<00:02:14.909> pretty<00:02:14.970> tough<00:02:15.360> thankfully

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and it does get pretty tough thankfully

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.020 
and it does get pretty tough thankfully

I'm<00:02:20.879> not<00:02:21.030> sure<00:02:21.120> what<00:02:21.239> you<00:02:21.269> call<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.480> but<00:02:21.840> i

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
I'm not sure what you call that but i

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.630 
I'm not sure what you call that but i
think<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.769> uses<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:22.980> left<00:02:23.159> trigger<00:02:23.280> right

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
think it uses a left trigger right

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.610 
think it uses a left trigger right
trigger<00:02:23.670> i<00:02:24.150> think<00:02:24.659> right<00:02:24.810> triggers<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.440> nuke

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
trigger i think right triggers the nuke

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.470 
trigger i think right triggers the nuke
and<00:02:25.890> lunch<00:02:26.099> triggers<00:02:26.400> for<00:02:26.670> like<00:02:26.909> the<00:02:27.060> electric

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
and lunch triggers for like the electric

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.420 
and lunch triggers for like the electric

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
and um kind of made Trek famous for that

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.189 
and um kind of made Trek famous for that
reason<00:04:08.760> just<00:04:09.060> for<00:04:09.209> zombies<00:04:09.569> so<00:04:09.870> I'm<00:04:09.989> really

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
reason just for zombies so I'm really

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.509 
reason just for zombies so I'm really
thinking<00:04:10.410> they<00:04:10.620> should<00:04:10.650> make<00:04:10.799> a<00:04:10.949> zombies<00:04:11.280> game

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
thinking they should make a zombies game

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.819 
thinking they should make a zombies game
and<00:04:12.090> call<00:04:12.359> it<00:04:12.599> like<00:04:12.810> call<00:04:13.049> duty<00:04:13.230> zombies<00:04:13.680> or

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
and call it like call duty zombies or

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.170 
and call it like call duty zombies or
something<00:04:14.069> related<00:04:14.400> that<00:04:14.579> and<00:04:14.819> I'm<00:04:14.940> sure

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
something related that and I'm sure

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.839 
something related that and I'm sure
they'd<00:04:15.480> probably<00:04:15.750> make<00:04:15.900> huh<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.680> great<00:04:17.190> a<00:04:17.459> great

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
they'd probably make huh a great a great

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.219 
they'd probably make huh a great a great
amount<00:04:18.180> of<00:04:18.269> money<00:04:18.479> just<00:04:18.570> on<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:18.870> alone

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
amount of money just on that alone

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.750 
amount of money just on that alone
because<00:04:19.500> everyone<00:04:19.949> loves<00:04:20.070> zombies<00:04:20.310> I'm

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
because everyone loves zombies I'm

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.270 
because everyone loves zombies I'm
pretty<00:04:21.000> sure<00:04:21.180> that's<00:04:22.019> like<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.800> big<00:04:22.979> reason

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
pretty sure that's like the big reason

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.310 
pretty sure that's like the big reason
why<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.430> lot<00:04:23.520> of<00:04:23.669> people<00:04:23.760> bought<00:04:24.120> blood<00:04:25.020> black

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
why a lot of people bought blood black

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.879 
why a lot of people bought blood black
ops

was kind of hoping for a better story
line<00:05:19.650> ending<00:05:20.430> so<00:05:21.389> hopefully<00:05:21.750> they<00:05:21.839> make<00:05:21.930> a

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
line ending so hopefully they make a

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.399 
line ending so hopefully they make a
game<00:05:22.259> which<00:05:22.529> will<00:05:22.740> maybe<00:05:23.520> wrap<00:05:23.819> it<00:05:23.969> up<00:05:24.060> better

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409

because I don't really follow that well

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:44.899 
because I don't really follow that well
but<00:05:42.149> I<00:05:42.210> do<00:05:42.330> know<00:05:42.899> what's<00:05:43.259> going<00:05:43.500> on<00:05:43.620> and<00:05:43.909> and

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
then and ended up the world was blown up

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.740 
then and ended up the world was blown up
and<00:05:48.649> that<00:05:49.649> other<00:05:49.860> planet<00:05:50.430> where<00:05:50.939> the<00:05:51.479> peg

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
and that other planet where the peg

crunch<00:05:51.990> machine<00:05:52.139> was<00:05:52.409> on<00:05:52.560> was<00:05:53.399> no<00:05:53.699> man's<00:05:53.909> land

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
crunch machine was on was no man's land

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.730 
crunch machine was on was no man's land
but<00:05:54.389> I'm<00:05:54.539> not<00:05:54.719> sure<00:05:54.750> that<00:05:54.960> that<00:05:55.289> was

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
but I'm not sure that that was

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.899 
but I'm not sure that that was
definitely<00:05:55.919> a<00:05:56.099> different<00:05:56.370> planet<00:05:56.580> because

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:56.909 
definitely a different planet because

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:58.100 
definitely a different planet because
you<00:05:57.089> can<00:05:57.180> go<00:05:57.270> on<00:05:57.360> no<00:05:57.449> man's<00:05:57.599> land<00:05:57.750> and<00:05:57.990> you

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
you can go on no man's land and you

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.409 
you can go on no man's land and you
would<00:05:58.199> see<00:05:58.349> earth<00:05:58.560> in<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:58.830> sky<00:05:59.120> so<00:06:00.120> it's

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
would see earth in the sky so it's

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:01.490 
would see earth in the sky so it's
definitely<00:06:00.750> a<00:06:00.810> different<00:06:01.050> planet<00:06:01.229> and<00:06:01.439> I'm

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
definitely a different planet and I'm

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.360 
definitely a different planet and I'm

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.980 
sure they're going to extend it
somewhere<00:06:02.729> somehow<00:06:03.120> because<00:06:03.629> they<00:06:03.779> can't

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
somewhere somehow because they can't

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.439 
somewhere somehow because they can't
leave<00:06:04.139> you<00:06:04.259> hanging<00:06:04.560> like<00:06:04.589> that<00:06:04.680> so<00:06:05.360> what<00:06:06.360> I'll
