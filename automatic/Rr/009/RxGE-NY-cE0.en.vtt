00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
I'm a massive fan of Lancome mascara

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.940 
I'm a massive fan of Lancome mascara
simply<00:03:32.810> because<00:03:33.080> I<00:03:33.110> don't<00:03:33.440> really<00:03:33.500> have<00:03:33.650> any

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
simply because I don't really have any

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.880 
simply because I don't really have any
lashes<00:03:34.370> at<00:03:34.730> all<00:03:35.180> they're<00:03:35.840> just<00:03:35.870> really<00:03:36.290> curly

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
lashes at all they're just really curly

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.730 
lashes at all they're just really curly
and<00:03:37.100> they're<00:03:38.000> not<00:03:38.150> really<00:03:38.330> meant<00:03:38.660> thinning<00:03:38.960> so

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
and they're not really meant thinning so

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.280 
and they're not really meant thinning so
I<00:03:40.130> decided<00:03:40.550> to<00:03:40.700> try<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.060> new<00:03:41.360> Lancome

I decided to try the new Lancome
grandiose<00:03:43.130> mascara<00:03:43.610> and<00:03:44.360> I'm<00:03:45.320> quite<00:03:46.160> excited

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
grandiose mascara and I'm quite excited

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.650 
grandiose mascara and I'm quite excited
because<00:03:46.670> I've<00:03:46.820> never<00:03:46.850> tried<00:03:47.210> this<00:03:47.420> one<00:03:47.630> before

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
because I've never tried this one before

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.490 
because I've never tried this one before
but<00:03:48.470> let's<00:03:48.830> just<00:03:48.920> see<00:03:49.220> how<00:03:49.490> it<00:03:49.820> works<00:03:50.630> on<00:03:51.020> tiny

next I'm just going to add a bit of

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.660 
next I'm just going to add a bit of

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
this eyeshadow looks a little bit worse

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.500 
this eyeshadow looks a little bit worse
for<00:04:12.190> wear<00:04:12.460> because<00:04:13.150> it's<00:04:13.650> crumbled<00:04:14.650> in<00:04:14.920> pieces

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
for wear because it's crumbled in pieces

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.470 
for wear because it's crumbled in pieces
