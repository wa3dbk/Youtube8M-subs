frantically trying to fix it I will show
you<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.319> wiring<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.299> come<00:02:31.299> with<00:02:31.450> me<00:02:31.510> everybody

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:32.219 
you the wiring so come with me everybody

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.559 
you the wiring so come with me everybody
followed<00:02:33.219> following<00:02:33.790> me<00:02:33.909> down<00:02:34.060> here<00:02:34.120> into<00:02:34.420> the

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
followed following me down here into the

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.809 
followed following me down here into the
basement<00:02:34.750> area<00:02:35.670> it's<00:02:36.670> not<00:02:36.819> very<00:02:36.939> dark<00:02:37.209> but<00:02:37.599> um

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
basement area it's not very dark but um

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.459 
basement area it's not very dark but um
yeah<00:02:39.819> this<00:02:40.209> is<00:02:40.299> a<00:02:40.329> lot<00:02:40.569> of<00:02:40.659> coding<00:02:40.930> i'll<00:02:41.169> try<00:02:41.409> to

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:41.469 
yeah this is a lot of coding i'll try to

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:45.300 
yeah this is a lot of coding i'll try to
explain<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.069> bit<00:02:42.099> and<00:02:43.650> basically<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:44.919> uses

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
explain it a bit and basically this uses

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.270 
explain it a bit and basically this uses
the<00:02:45.489> oh<00:02:46.109> jesus<00:02:47.109> what<00:02:47.139> is<00:02:47.439> the<00:02:47.590> word<00:02:47.769> for<00:02:47.799> it<00:02:48.069> oh

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
the oh jesus what is the word for it oh

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.379 
the oh jesus what is the word for it oh
my<00:02:48.579> god<00:02:48.730> x<00:02:49.859> RS<00:02:50.859> and<00:02:51.569> RS<00:02:52.569> nor<00:02:52.870> latch<00:02:54.389> something

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
my god x RS and RS nor latch something

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.270 
my god x RS and RS nor latch something
like<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.569> RS<00:02:56.049> nor<00:02:56.409> latch<00:02:56.469> I'll<00:02:56.980> put<00:02:57.099> in<00:02:57.189> the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
like that RS nor latch I'll put in the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.929 
like that RS nor latch I'll put in the
description<00:02:57.449> but<00:02:58.449> yeah<00:02:58.599> that's<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:59.109> there<00:02:59.349> and

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
description but yeah that's it there and

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.399 
description but yeah that's it there and
because<00:03:00.939> it<00:03:01.090> resets<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:01.659> actually<00:03:02.019> called<00:03:02.260> a

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
because it resets is actually called a

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.470 
because it resets is actually called a
monostable<00:03:02.829> circuit<00:03:03.609> so<00:03:03.790> it's<00:03:03.939> a<00:03:03.969> RS<00:03:04.299> nor

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
monostable circuit so it's a RS nor

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.099 
monostable circuit so it's a RS nor
latch<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:05.049> a<00:03:05.169> monostable<00:03:05.469> circuit<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:07.109> then

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
latch and a monostable circuit and then

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.860 
latch and a monostable circuit and then
this<00:03:08.290> is<00:03:08.439> wearing<00:03:08.889> it<00:03:09.040> resets<00:03:09.639> this<00:03:10.030> using

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
this is wearing it resets this using

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.509 
this is wearing it resets this using
this<00:03:10.989> where's<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.769> bottom<00:03:12.040> I'll<00:03:12.370> show<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:13.500> so

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
this where's the bottom I'll show you so

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.300 
this where's the bottom I'll show you so
sets<00:03:15.519> it<00:03:15.669> off<00:03:15.870> resets<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:17.109> could<00:03:17.889> just<00:03:18.069> look<00:03:18.189> at

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
sets it off resets I could just look at

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.499 
sets it off resets I could just look at
the<00:03:18.400> Pistons<00:03:19.199> open<00:03:20.199> and<00:03:20.790> they<00:03:21.790> come<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.150> reset

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:22.509 
the Pistons open and they come to reset

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:25.469 
the Pistons open and they come to reset
so<00:03:22.720> resets<00:03:23.199> closes<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:23.859> again<00:03:24.150> or<00:03:25.150> turns<00:03:25.359> the

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:25.479 
so resets closes it again or turns the

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:28.080 
so resets closes it again or turns the
Pistons<00:03:25.810> on<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:25.959> mean<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:27.370> yeah<00:03:27.639> this<00:03:27.790> took<00:03:27.970> a

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
Pistons on I mean so yeah this took a

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.939 
Pistons on I mean so yeah this took a
while<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.299> set<00:03:28.629> up<00:03:28.750> it's<00:03:29.139> not<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.560> difficult

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:29.949 
while to set up it's not that difficult

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:31.909 
while to set up it's not that difficult
if<00:03:30.459> you<00:03:30.669> have<00:03:30.879> good<00:03:31.120> knowledge<00:03:31.269> of<00:03:31.509> redstone

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
if you have good knowledge of redstone

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:35.759 
if you have good knowledge of redstone

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
you can see here we actually have a

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.050 
you can see here we actually have a
visitor<00:04:11.349> so<00:04:11.680> this<00:04:12.069> guy's<00:04:12.310> has<00:04:12.519> come<00:04:12.759> to<00:04:12.879> see

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
visitor so this guy's has come to see

visitor so this guy's has come to see
what<00:04:13.239> the<00:04:13.389> fuss<00:04:13.569> is<00:04:13.599> all<00:04:13.780> about<00:04:13.959> what's<00:04:14.530> the

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
what the fuss is all about what's the

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.550 
what the fuss is all about what's the
file<00:04:15.000> he's<00:04:16.000> come<00:04:16.239> from<00:04:16.389> his<00:04:16.539> little<00:04:16.780> water
