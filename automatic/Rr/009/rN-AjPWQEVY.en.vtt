it comes to rail response training we're
not<00:00:57.629> going<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:57.960> all<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.260> information

very rare scenario of a derailment with
chemical<00:01:35.430> leaks<00:01:36.320> there's<00:01:37.320> nothing

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
chemical leaks there's nothing

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.069 
chemical leaks there's nothing
well<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> scenarios<00:01:39.450> here<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.840> they're

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
well the scenarios here is they're

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.200 
well the scenarios here is they're
pretty<00:01:40.409> realistic<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.250> yes<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.729> does<00:01:41.850> hit<00:01:42.030> your

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
pretty realistic so yes it does hit your

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.670 
pretty realistic so yes it does hit your
high<00:01:42.329> school<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.780> yes<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.170> do<00:01:43.320> get<00:01:43.470> some

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
high school and yes you do get some

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.980 
high school and yes you do get some
mobility<00:01:44.119> at<00:01:45.119> first<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.630> looks<00:01:45.840> very

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
mobility at first it looks very

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.660 
mobility at first it looks very
overwhelming<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:46.890> what<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.220> teach<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
overwhelming but what we teach the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.789 
overwhelming but what we teach the
students<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
students is to

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.190 
students is to
good<00:01:49.430> hazard<00:01:49.820> risk<00:01:50.060> assessment<00:01:50.659> and<00:01:50.960> then

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
good hazard risk assessment and then
