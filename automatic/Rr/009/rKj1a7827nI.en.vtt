line of the night before basically to

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.370 
line of the night before basically to
get<00:00:24.250> it<00:00:24.400> empty<00:00:24.730> so<00:00:25.000> only<00:00:25.090> show<00:00:25.360> up<00:00:25.540> to<00:00:25.779> begin

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
get it empty so only show up to begin

get it empty so only show up to begin
the<00:00:26.500> job<00:00:27.840> we<00:00:28.840> can<00:00:28.990> have<00:00:29.079> a<00:00:29.140> little<00:00:29.259> more<00:00:29.470> time

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
the job we can have a little more time

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.970 
the job we can have a little more time
and<00:00:30.880> also<00:00:31.300> something<00:00:32.020> we<00:00:32.200> must<00:00:32.380> do<00:00:32.619> is<00:00:32.740> find

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
and also something we must do is find

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.410 
and also something we must do is find
your<00:00:33.130> blind<00:00:33.370> drain<00:00:33.730> this<00:00:33.940> is<00:00:34.000> a<00:00:34.120> drain<00:00:34.180> that

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
your blind drain this is a drain that

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.290 
your blind drain this is a drain that
goes<00:00:34.720> underneath<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:36.520> pool<00:00:36.700> bottom<00:00:37.180> that

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
goes underneath the pool bottom that

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.420 
goes underneath the pool bottom that
allows<00:00:37.540> us<00:00:37.570> to<00:00:37.780> pump<00:00:38.050> the<00:00:38.230> earth<00:00:38.350> out<00:00:38.650> right

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
allows us to pump the earth out right

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.150 
allows us to pump the earth out right
now<00:00:39.610> we're<00:00:39.880> in<00:00:39.970> a<00:00:40.030> pretty<00:00:40.270> high<00:00:41.079> water<00:00:41.739> table

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
now we're in a pretty high water table

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.700 
now we're in a pretty high water table
area<00:00:42.449> and<00:00:43.449> without<00:00:43.719> finding<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.140> blind<00:00:44.410> drain

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
area and without finding the blind drain

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.400 
area and without finding the blind drain
this<00:00:45.100> could<00:00:45.340> be<00:00:45.460> a<00:00:45.629> cave-in<00:00:46.629> or<00:00:46.690> something

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
this could be a cave-in or something

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.520 
this could be a cave-in or something
worse<00:00:47.530> could<00:00:47.680> happen<00:00:47.829> so<00:00:49.140> basically<00:00:50.140> this

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
worse could happen so basically this

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.849 
worse could happen so basically this
liner<00:00:50.800> had<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.280> big<00:00:51.519> hole<00:00:51.760> in<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.359> bottom<00:00:52.859> it's

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 
liner had a big hole in the bottom it's

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.229 
liner had a big hole in the bottom it's
aged<00:00:54.390> apparently<00:00:55.390> ten<00:00:55.629> years<00:00:55.840> old<00:00:56.109> and<00:00:57.239> we're

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
aged apparently ten years old and we're

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.500

about getting the mix wrong and it a

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.070 
about getting the mix wrong and it a

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
reason why they use that is it's

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.259 
reason why they use that is it's
permeable<00:03:59.680> meaning<00:04:00.580> that<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.790> water<00:04:00.970> can<00:04:01.150> go

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
permeable meaning that the water can go

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.420 
permeable meaning that the water can go
through<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.690> floor<00:04:01.900> of<00:04:01.989> this<00:04:02.049> pool<00:04:02.340> if<00:04:03.340> you

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
ever have a hole in the liner if you

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.479 
ever have a hole in the liner if you

have a concrete shell your liner floats

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.850 
have a concrete shell your liner floats
once<00:04:10.450> you've<00:04:10.600> sealed<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.959> hole<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.680> liner

once you've sealed the hole the liner
will<00:04:12.100> always<00:04:12.400> flow<00:04:12.640> so<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.269> purpose<00:04:13.570> of

the corners identify your corners first
make<00:05:18.040> sure<00:05:18.070> there's<00:05:18.430> two<00:05:18.640> shallow<00:05:19.030> end

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
make sure there's two shallow end

hanging<00:05:21.490> that's<00:05:21.580> what<00:05:21.760> we're<00:05:21.850> gonna<00:05:22.000> do<00:05:22.090> now

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
hanging that's what we're gonna do now

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.930 
hanging that's what we're gonna do now
okay<00:05:23.590> the<00:05:23.860> first<00:05:24.010> thing<00:05:24.280> we've<00:05:24.430> done<00:05:24.610> is

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
okay the first thing we've done is

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.610 
okay the first thing we've done is
identify<00:05:25.120> this<00:05:25.690> to<00:05:25.840> be<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.050> shallow<00:05:26.260> end<00:05:26.500> of

identify this to be the shallow end of

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.030 
identify this to be the shallow end of
the<00:05:26.680> liner

the liner

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.810 
the liner
now<00:05:27.910> they're<00:05:28.090> gonna<00:05:28.180> stretch<00:05:28.510> the<00:05:28.720> liner<00:05:28.930> out

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
now they're gonna stretch the liner out

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.520 
now they're gonna stretch the liner out
the<00:05:30.820> liner<00:05:31.060> has<00:05:31.270> been<00:05:31.450> stored<00:05:31.750> in<00:05:31.870> a<00:05:31.960> box<00:05:32.230> and

the liner has been stored in a box and

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.670 
the liner has been stored in a box and
this<00:05:32.620> is<00:05:32.740> a<00:05:32.770> 20<00:05:33.130> by<00:05:33.220> 40<00:05:33.640> so<00:05:33.790> it's<00:05:33.910> quite<00:05:34.150> heavy

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
this is a 20 by 40 so it's quite heavy

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.000 
this is a 20 by 40 so it's quite heavy
so<00:05:36.720> if<00:05:37.720> you<00:05:37.810> stretch<00:05:38.140> it<00:05:38.170> out<00:05:38.410> and<00:05:38.590> let<00:05:38.680> the<00:05:38.770> Sun

nothing you can do about it it just gets
real<00:06:00.430> elastic<00:06:00.940> and<00:06:01.060> you<00:06:01.120> end<00:06:01.270> up<00:06:01.330> with<00:06:01.480> too

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
real elastic and you end up with too

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.500 
real elastic and you end up with too
much<00:06:02.050> vinyl<00:06:02.850> the<00:06:03.850> next<00:06:04.060> step<00:06:04.240> they're<00:06:04.420> gonna

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
much vinyl the next step they're gonna

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.780 
much vinyl the next step they're gonna
do<00:06:04.660> is<00:06:04.750> identify<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:05.380> corner<00:06:05.860> in<00:06:05.980> each<00:06:06.100> of<00:06:06.640> the

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
do is identify the corner in each of the

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.240 
do is identify the corner in each of the
shallow<00:06:07.060> end<00:06:07.330> get<00:06:08.230> their<00:06:08.410> feet<00:06:08.650> tucking<00:06:09.130> it

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
shallow end get their feet tucking it

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.740 
shallow end get their feet tucking it
into<00:06:09.490> the<00:06:09.580> corner<00:06:09.880> before<00:06:10.150> we<00:06:10.240> begin<00:06:10.420> to<00:06:10.540> hang

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
into the corner before we begin to hang

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.450 
into the corner before we begin to hang
because<00:06:11.140> the<00:06:11.290> key<00:06:11.500> to<00:06:11.740> hanging<00:06:11.980> the<00:06:12.160> vinyl

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
because the key to hanging the vinyl

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.930 
because the key to hanging the vinyl
liner<00:06:12.870> is<00:06:13.870> having<00:06:14.530> the<00:06:14.710> corners<00:06:15.100> in<00:06:15.310> place<00:06:15.340> if
