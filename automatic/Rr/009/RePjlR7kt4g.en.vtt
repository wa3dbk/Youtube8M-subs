the boom beach update that is right
around<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.260> corner<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:11.040> time<00:00:11.219> around

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
around the corner and this time around

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.879 
around the corner and this time around
it<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:11.910> called<00:00:12.150> operations<00:00:13.110> let's<00:00:13.679> actually

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
it is called operations let's actually

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.770 
it is called operations let's actually
grab<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.730> picture<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.150> show<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.450> off<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.599> you

guys hit them where it hurts it all
makes<00:00:18.090> sense<00:00:18.390> now<00:00:18.539> really<00:00:19.140> basically<00:00:19.800> what

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
makes sense now really basically what

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.519 
makes sense now really basically what
you're<00:00:20.189> doing<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:21.029> collect<00:00:21.420> Intel<00:00:21.990> by

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
you're doing is you collect Intel by

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.040 
you're doing is you collect Intel by
attacking<00:00:22.890> bases<00:00:23.519> on<00:00:23.640> your<00:00:23.910> map<00:00:24.119> everybody<00:00:24.779> is

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
attacking bases on your map everybody is

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.589 
attacking bases on your map everybody is
collecting<00:00:25.680> Intel<00:00:26.160> for<00:00:26.400> themself<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.420> it's

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
collecting Intel for themself but it's

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.419 
collecting Intel for themself but it's
going<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:27.990> added<00:00:28.349> towards<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.859> giant

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
going to be added towards this giant

you to do operations the way it works is

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.530 
you to do operations the way it works is
you'll<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.399> use<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.760> task<00:00:42.000> force<00:00:42.360> in

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
you'll have to use the task force in

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.500 
you'll have to use the task force in
cell<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.050> launch<00:00:43.290> operations<00:00:44.120> only<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> task

getting<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.470> Intel<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.159> then<00:01:32.520> thirdly<00:01:32.850> of

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
getting that Intel and then thirdly of

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.270 
getting that Intel and then thirdly of
course<00:01:33.180> use<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.049> Intel<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.619> help<00:01:34.860> out<00:01:35.070> your

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
course use that Intel to help out your

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.789 
course use that Intel to help out your
task<00:01:35.520> force<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.090> take<00:01:36.119> down<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.229> blackguard

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
task force to take down the blackguard

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.710
