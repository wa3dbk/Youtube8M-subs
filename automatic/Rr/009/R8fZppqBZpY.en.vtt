00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello how are you hello to all then today 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.610
 I wanted to tell you about a topic that 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.940
 maybe it doesn't really interest everyone is one 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.440
 something a little frivolous because it is addressed 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.660
 for lovers of false eyelashes 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.609
 I love the false eyelashes I am 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.350
 a lover of false eyelashes and ne 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.130
 I will have at least twenty straw 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:30.510
 different at home for me really is a 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.460
 interesting topic then why 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.329
 this video because I found a glue 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.160
 which is absolutely great for eyelashes 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.710
 fake as it contains none 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.180
 crap unlike the famous 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:48.390
 with the duo for the false eyelashes it is 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.820
 own the glue for the cells funds for 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.010
 antonomasia that is the hill that is useful 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.510
 they use make up artists then there 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.460
 they are obviously of other types though 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.680
 let's say this is easy here 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.280
 available in stores but easily 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.390
 find around anyway and I can 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.900
 however 10 euros has a flaw one flaw 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:17.610
 very bad, a very serious one 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:20.670
 that is to say that to formaldehyde if you know it 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.560
 great if you don't know the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.500
 formaldehyde is a substance that however 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.700
 it is used both in cosmetics as 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.439
 preservative etc. and be in the 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:36.710
 the pharmacological field in the medical field 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:38.740
 and it is a bad ingredient for how much 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.130
 it concerns health precisely because 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:46.700
 could indeed be 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.549
 a carcinogen is a glue that that 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:55.069
 precisely it contains it in the last place 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:57.500
 of cnr with the latex base 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.420
 this is a glue that goes anyway 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.189
 very well for the false eyelashes I have it 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:08.989
 used until I discovered 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:11.480
 precisely the damage point we say so of 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.220
 but I have this ingredient 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.500
 I have not used for a long time 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.959
 But I never had problems ok now not 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.750
 I use more because I've tried others 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.400
 glues without formaldehyde, etc. 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.860
 for example, there is that of make up for 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.069
 never that it does not contain it however it is 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.290
 really dear caruccia that I am other 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.780
 etc. but now I'll show you 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.049
 if we arrive after all this 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.389
 Pappardella of stuff I said is 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:42.109
 finally managed to find some 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:44.239
 eyelash glue for false eyelashes like 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.889
 eco bio in short for the covers of cted that 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.579
 don't want to have crap they love 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:53.660
 Fake eyelashes 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:57.319
 here it is here, this is the video here 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.290
 of beauty chamber I put it by some 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.170
 part I do not know if I will load it see and 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:07.730
 I bought it immediately for 4 euros and 99 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.700
 so it is a glue that does not contain a 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.040
 brand and beautiful and one thing that does not 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.660
 it contains crap and you do it too 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:23.090
 economic that I'll show you it here it is 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:29.870
 here linci and this therefore we have water 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:33.470
 a synthetic alcohol decs polymer 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.290
 trin and tocopherol so we say that 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.569
 it is obviously not a glue from 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.299
 consider are 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:44.159
 consider it eco bio however it is one 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.159
 glue from the point of view 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:49.569
 of health and so on is something that is 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.090
 can safely use precisely 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:56.260
 I can tell you that other sites are not available here 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:04:02.079
 I know maybe I write below and note 4 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:05.019
 99 pounds of greenhouses 78 euros 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:08.189
 however much cheaper cagni 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:11.010
 economic to move to the practical side 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:15.639
 all messing up 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:18.130
 then heaven up today is a glue that 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.840
 however, I give 10 votes in any case 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.479
 before giving any opinion 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.550
 because the cost just crap 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.099
 little and then precisely enough 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.259
 well not so good as this one's 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:32.080
 this is the top of the top because when 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:34.330
 one applies it truly and flexibly 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.060
 containing latex remains there for everything 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.830
 the day does not move wonderfully yes 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.050
 it takes away everything well 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.169
 this one at a bit of difficulty ad 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:47.020
 attacking at the beginning though having done 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:51.280
 that made her impression like this e 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.789
 small product contains 5 billion products 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.039
 the same thing is done with a small brush 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:00.009
 nice thing that just is convenient for 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:02.680
 this born here and when it is applied 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:05.470
 maybe she didn't stick it didn't 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.539
 joined well are the lines not joined 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.479
 well precisely an eyelash you can go to 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:13.180
 touch up maybe there is a tac ad little hole 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.710
 fix it well and it really is 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.449
 really comfortable with my cousin who 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:22.389
 explains how the brush is so necessary 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.970
 insist a little, maybe you think of 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:27.370
 having touched it after two minutes it is 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:31.120
 then detached these tt roofs and a little 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:34.240
 however, the eyelashes are more laborious 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.860
 all the lashes remain stuck 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.009
 day 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.610
 the new astra pro is really a glue 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:44.800
 I recommend it for those who love the 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.320
 bio mineral makeup because they have precisely 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.090
 natural makeup and for those who want to point 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.009
 use with false eyelashes but does not want 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:55.410
 use the line if you have understood something 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.410
 yes I hope yes to this that you have 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.849
 eliminate it because of the form allen e 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.410
 then ok it's not that I say to throw it away of 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:09.759
 don't use it anymore because I still have it 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:14.710
 used not only dead look for shelter 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:15.940
 I also want to say that the glue duo does not 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.180
 must be used more 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.220
 categorically, oh, it hurts makes me die 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.680
 no no no no I'm not just saying that for whom 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:28.169
 loves organic cosmetics for those who are 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.909
 fixed as if it wants a good eyelash 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.949
 head to the false eyelash glue this one 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:35.770
 how to make a very good compromise 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:37.599
 I repeat, I was bold, I also had contrast 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.150
 it long on the beauty chamber site also 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:42.820
 these are these fake eyelashes that yes 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:46.659
 they call bayliss black that practically 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:50.320
 the said that they don't go on all 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:51.909
 perimeter of the packaging are a 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.770
 little smaller because I eyes more 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:55.539
 little balls and I often owe them 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.409
 cut the eyelashes instead these are 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:07:01.690
 even these 4 euro 99 small with 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:04.870
 that hard ellen good brand sell 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:07.360
 also packs with glue 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:10.820
 incorporated it undergoes shadows if interested 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:13.130
 so I greet you 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:18.770
 today I did a little more makeup 

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:21.650
 disparate so long I have fun 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:24.530
 I used the snow crown make up 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:27.310
 which is a really wonderful pencil only 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:31.280
 that does not last a chip on the eye 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:33.260
 you have to apply an umbrella over it 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.560
 I have an umbrella of the essence they have 

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:38.510
 in food wine and man I go to apply 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.280
 which provides the same same color 

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:43.490
 same metal itself all goes well 

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.250
 anything 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.840
 we send you a big good kiss 

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.880
 false eyelashes to everyone if you don't put them on 

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.420
 it doesn't matter, I greet you anyway, bye 

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.420
 bye Bye
