00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.620
 I give van basten ask what is the best 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.960
 way is to take music with it 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.780
 running a piece a legitimate question 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.940
 thereby converted three options of cheap 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.730
 but fairly expensive 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.910
 it is a solution yes that yes that is 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.920
 reasonable 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.750
 because is a head phone call with 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.859
 caps that can fall out of your ears 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.180
 the running 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.800
 so you can be loose and petrus 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.689
 little player 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.029
 head apart for it had hope 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.550
 but of course choose the one 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.770
 By default you set with headphones 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.600
 how far is it nice and small 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.219
 so you don't need a phone with buckets of it 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.260
 but you can run music on it 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.969
 turn and then expand shoes 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.170
 matchday ticket 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.469
 you can also opt for a headband 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.570
 then you have this and this is mp3 player one 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.000
 headphones in one because here you can get the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.670
 cells card and apple and this bracket 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.050
 almost everything you can use with 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.360
 the running 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.520
 well this is a bluetooth headset 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.520
 and that connectis with your phone 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.510
 and that we make it very easy for you 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.750
 so on your phone on your iphone or 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.479
 Android phone via Bluetooth 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.970
 are you going to search for one 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.270
 a bluetooth device after a seat this 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.939
 bluetooth headset to twitter 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.920
 button and preferences per de and then 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.119
 herds celebrated this bluetooth 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.710
 headphones 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.990
 listening to the music and the handy thing 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.880
 I find smithy useful is you 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.100
 just with these buttons 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.460
 hard and soft and also the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.900
 can rewind and fast forward tracks and 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.270
 can take a break 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.829
 it also can call you can do it 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.130
 almost never just like it 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.450
 really really not your nivola need 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.740
 something must be standard 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.570
 but they are eating ways that I like 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.210
 use when I start walking 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.899
 I walk the most with the neighborhood or 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.180
 headphones 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.560
 but there are so cheap option bull 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.909
 want to show 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.909
