00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.590 
I'm going to UM perhaps be sorry that I
asked<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.800> question<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.940> my<00:00:36.480> oil<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.260> at

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:47.090 
asked that question but my oil is at
right<00:00:39.600> about<00:00:39.980> 350<00:00:40.980> degrees<00:00:42.020> so<00:00:45.860> I'm<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:47.039> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
right about 350 degrees so I'm going to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.200 
right about 350 degrees so I'm going to
go<00:00:47.280> ahead<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.969> go<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:49.550> you<00:00:50.550> guys<00:00:50.789> are<00:00:51.000> here

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210

go ahead and go for it you guys are here
to<00:00:51.239> watch

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.490 

technically<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.569> not<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.780> poached<00:01:37.170> egg

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
technically it's not a poached egg

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.999 
technically it's not a poached egg
because<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:39.390> oil<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.869> way<00:01:40.200> way<00:01:40.409> hotter<00:01:40.679> than

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
because the oil is way way hotter than

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.730 
because the oil is way way hotter than
for<00:01:41.220> poaching<00:01:41.459> it<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.840> frying<00:01:43.409> temperature

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
for poaching it is a frying temperature

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.880 
for poaching it is a frying temperature
so<00:01:45.830> you<00:01:46.830> know<00:01:46.920> what<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.280> think<00:01:48.229> I'm<00:01:49.229> fine<00:01:49.590> with
