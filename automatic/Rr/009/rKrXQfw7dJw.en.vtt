00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.110
One of the most interesting birds that Iâ€™ve
ever photographed is the Acorn woodpecker.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.920
And I found a population of woodpeckers in
a suburban park in southern California.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:34.160
I noticed this tree with thousands and thousands
of holes in it, each of which had got an acorn

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.000
stuffed into it.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.000
Acorn woodpeckers, I think, are among the busiest birds.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.899
And what this tree's called is granary tree.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.270
This is where the group of Acorn woodpeckers that lives together,

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.320
this is where they store their winter food supply.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.040
It's a tree that's been used over the generations.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.710
Multi-generations of these woodpeckers have
been using the same tree, adding to the number

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.060
of holes over the years.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.040
So they don't drill them all at once, each
winter they drill a few more and add some

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.300
more acorns to them.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.220
No other woodpeckers in North America will
have this special method of storing in specifically

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.830
drilled holes.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.950
So that makes Acorn woodpeckers pretty special
in the bird world.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.060
Many people describe Acorn woodpeckers as
having a clown-like look.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.049
They're very colorful woodpeckers - they've
got glossy blue-black back, they've got red

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.560
and pale-yellow and black markings

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.700
around their heads and faces, and their eyes
are, in fact, kind of a pale whitish color,

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.310
they really stand out.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.409
And you can tell the males from the females
by the fact that the females have a little

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.580
band of black between the red
and the pale-yellow and in the males the red

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.460
and yellow are next to each other.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.600
So when you find one Acorn woodpecker you're
most likely going to find a group of them,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.020
because their highly social birds.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.980
They live in social groups year-round, up
to a dozen individuals or more.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.840
And one of the commonest sounds you're likely
to hear when a group gets together is the

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.170
wacka wacka call.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.269
And often they're also displaying at the same
time, making this dramatic and very, very

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.700
wonderful wing spread display.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.790
So you'll get one bird landing on the granary tree
then others will join it and they'll be displaying

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.650
and calling away.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.099
There's nothing more fun than heading out
to some park and hang out and wait for some

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.560
Acorn woodpeckers to show up at their tree.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.159
You're bound to be entertained, it's one of
the funniest things I like to do.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.680
I really like to go and watch them and photograph
them.
