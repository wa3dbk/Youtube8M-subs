00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.550
 First, a short comparison between 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.009
 two flagships and once the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.500
 google nexus 5 which is made by lg 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.320
 was and once on the left side 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.430
 the lg two holes as the name 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.810
 already reveals about lg in things 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.250
 hardware, the two differ 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.710
 equipment a bit we have here 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:34.140
 namely the nexus 55 inch display 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.210
 while on a ski tour 1 52 inches 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.820
 Display have under the hood 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:45.120
 both the snapdragon 800 with 2.26 ghz 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:50.640
 quad core processor solve both displays 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:54.270
 with 1920 x 1080 pixels on and both 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.850
 the nexus 5 as well as the joojoo feature 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.960
 over 2 gb of RAM and are in 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.250
 variants to have 16 and 32 gigabytes 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.439
 make a difference 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.200
 in the other equipment namely at 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:13.229
 Battery The Nexus 5 has a brand of 2.300 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.600
 Milliampere while the lg to with his 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.770
 three 1000 milliampere com and neat 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.409
 steam has blogger one and a half days of power 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.360
 but also in the processing 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.759
 or the arrangement of the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.340
 of course you have something different 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.650
 made that lg looks different 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.780
 for example by the fact that the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.670
 Buttons on the back attached 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.860
 are up here once you have the 3 10 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.200
 Megapixel strong camera too 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.229
 optical image stabilizer like the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:48.840
 nexus 5 which only with 8 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:52.799
 megapixel on the way is the front 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.470
 camera has lg 2 1 megapixel 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.700
 here you have 1 3 megapixel nonetheless 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.869
 one should not distinguish that is 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.700
 Of course, a price difference is 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.230
 the lg to gets for the moment 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.880
 approximately 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:08.860
 450 euro while you for a brand new one 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:12.100
 nexus 5 349 euro paid and four by 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.660
 the advantage that her naked android 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.970
 which of course always gets very much 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.700
 good for it is fast 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.060
 updates get otherwise alike 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.210
 The appliances did not look great 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.850
 said in the just mentioned 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.370
 details like battery camera 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.750
 processing and display size and the same 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.850
 Let's leave the devices in the next part 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.340
 again in the benchmark against each other 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.120
 I will thank you for that until then 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.120
 watch and see you then
