00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.869

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.760
 Here I flew on the figure too 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.050

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.930

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.800
 caught up with the city for a while 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.260

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.180

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.320

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.350
 were but specifically today even 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.960
 wait for some impressions 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.330
 but here they are always just mad 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.340

 this season may be a little bit further 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.140
 look well I think that now is the most 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.870
 the main thing is not to lose the series even more precisely 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.860
 don't jump just win and of course 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.170

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.460
 plundering everyone 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.160
 rivals 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.800
 you can not lose points especially 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.510

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.450

 wait for you in Moscow when we play 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.060
 based on whether there is a chance to see you there 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.849
 if if we are from the moment in Moscow then 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.340

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.780

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.579
