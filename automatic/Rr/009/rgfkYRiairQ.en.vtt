or flat irons work differently so um as
far<00:04:51.360> as<00:04:51.569> the<00:04:51.780> actual<00:04:51.990> arm<00:04:52.710> I<00:04:54.560> suppose<00:04:55.560> the

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
far as the actual arm I suppose the

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.439 
far as the actual arm I suppose the
actions<00:04:56.370> of<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.520> temperature<00:04:56.939> second<00:04:57.270> side

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
actions of the temperature second side

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.719
