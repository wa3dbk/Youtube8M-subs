00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 the cells can have changes in their shape size number 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.940
 those that can be adaptive sounded adaptive 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.760
 adaptive changes are qualitative cellular changes 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.889
 quantitative 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.750
 or a combination of both that occur in response to conditions 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.900
 adverse events in the body in order to restore normal function of a 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.320
 organ a tissue 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.109
 these changes involve cell survival 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.249
 and hypertrophy hyperplasia or metaplasia may manifest as atrophy 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.149
 atrophy is the decrease in the size of an organ or tissue that had 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.480
 developed normally due to a reduction mainly in size 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.600
 although also in the number of cells that constitute it is a 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.920
 acquired inhibition of growth 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.700
 the atrophic organ is small and of lesser weight 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.780
 although sometimes the lost parenchyma is partially replaced by 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.760
 fibrous adipose tissue 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.390
 the atrophies can be physiological or pathological 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.110
 Physiological atrophies are the closure of the ductus arteriosus in newborns or the 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.950
 Skeletal muscle loss in elderly people due to lower demand for 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.440
 muscle activity 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.540
 the pathological are a consequence of nutritional deficiency lack of 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.670
 endocrine pathology innervation 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.550
 decreased blood flow 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.820
 extrinsic compression of tissues therapeutic immobilization 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.840
 hypertrophy leads to an increase in the volume of an organ or a tissue 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.250
 as a consequence of the increase in size of stable or permanent cells as 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.840
 muscle cells 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.800
 in them there is an increase of all its cytoplasmic components as 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.680
 Endoplasmic reticulum smooth and rocky mitochondria and plasma proteins 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.490
 with the exception of the nucleus 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.240
 cell hypertrophy can be hormonal adaptive and can result 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.480
 physiological or pathological 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.510
 an example of physiological hypertrophy is the one that has the skeletal muscle 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.690
 when there is an increase in physical activity, on the contrary, hypertrophy 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.250
 of the heart muscle will be pathological in response 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.010
 for example 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.200
 to the increase in blood pressure in the individual 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.039
 hyperplasia is the enlargement of an organ of a tissue as 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.839
 result of an increase in the number of cells that compose them 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:13.569
 occurs in organs or tissues whose cells have mitogenic capacity 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.939
 it can also be hormonal adaptive 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.479
 and it can also be physiological or pathological 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:24.079
 An example of physiological hyperplasia is what occurs during breastfeeding in 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.989
 that the mammary gland increases its cell going 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.370
 an example of pathological hyperplasia is what happens in the deficit and intake 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.900
 of iodine in which the cells of the thyroid gland increase in number 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.279
 to compensate for this deficiency 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:41.099
 periban do in an enlarged thyroid or peak goiter devised 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.969
 the placid goal is the replacement of a variety of mature cells by 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.499
 another type of cells also mature 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.329
 of the same embryonic origin 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.579
 and it can occur in tissues of epithelial origin mesenchymal 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:57.840
 a classic example of metaplasia is the one that occurs in the esophagus as a result 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:58.739
 of hyper gastric acidity
