and secure and going nowhere

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.979 
and secure and going nowhere
put<00:02:19.360> some<00:02:19.480> cross<00:02:19.750> beams<00:02:20.049> top<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.310> bottom<00:02:21.989> so

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
put some cross beams top and bottom so

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:30.410 
put some cross beams top and bottom so
these<00:02:23.140> batteries<00:02:23.590> ain't<00:02:24.010> going<00:02:24.430> nowhere<00:02:27.989> sir

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
these batteries ain't going nowhere sir

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.930 
these batteries ain't going nowhere sir
so<00:02:31.420> this<00:02:31.750> is<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.989> update<00:02:32.400> we<00:02:33.400> just<00:02:33.610> finished

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
so this is the update we just finished

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.560 
so this is the update we just finished
doing<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:35.200> frame<00:02:35.530> for<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.890> doors<00:02:36.570> for

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
doing the the frame for the doors for

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:44.250 
doing the the frame for the doors for
the<00:02:37.660> speakers<00:02:40.440> it's<00:02:41.440> kind<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.709> hard<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:43.260> see

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
the speakers it's kind of hard to see

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.199 
the speakers it's kind of hard to see
what's<00:02:44.500> going<00:02:44.739> on<00:02:44.829> here<00:02:45.100> but<00:02:45.310> pretty<00:02:46.030> much

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
what's going on here but pretty much

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.530 
what's going on here but pretty much
straightforward<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.859> we<00:02:48.519> created<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.239> frame

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
straightforward the we created a frame

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.380 
straightforward the we created a frame
every<00:02:50.350> monster<00:02:50.530> speaker<00:02:50.890> on<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.280> door<00:02:51.970> itself

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
every monster speaker on the door itself

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.819 
every monster speaker on the door itself
so<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.350> this<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.850> door<00:02:55.060> is<00:02:55.269> just<00:02:55.450> one<00:02:55.829> and

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
so the this and the door is just one and

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.509 
so the this and the door is just one and
here's<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.820> door<00:02:58.000> panel<00:02:59.040> the<00:03:00.040> door<00:03:00.190> panels

beauty board something nice so will be

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.000 
beauty board something nice so will be
separate<00:03:09.940> or<00:03:10.090> so<00:03:10.269> in<00:03:10.510> order<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.840> reach<00:03:11.799> the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
separate or so in order to reach the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.259 
separate or so in order to reach the
speaker<00:03:12.370> we<00:03:12.609> need<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.819> take<00:03:12.970> out<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.150> door
