00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.390
 hello let's prepare a dough for 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:20.080
 make a pizza we will need half 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.630
 small glass of water 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.570
 we will also need half a tablet of 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.230
 baker's yeast water better than 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.169
 be a little warm for 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.350
 that way 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.890
 so that the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.920
 yeast will live much better 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.079
 we will add two teaspoons of oil 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.910
 you can use olive oil or the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.329
 oil that you usually use in the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.269
 kitchen 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.899
 the tablespoons would be a size of 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.899
 soup spoon 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:01:00.989
 we also add a little salt 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.989
 if you will be short of salt , nothing happens 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.700
 the coverage of the pizza surely that 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.600
 gives us a more powerful flavor and we start 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.610
 to add the flour 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.320
 let's add flour to make a 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.490
 first elevated 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.610
 we're going to remove it until we get 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.610
 the 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.150
 the amount of flour enough as 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.750
 to leave it fermented we throw a 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.750
 a little more 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.380
 at this point of thickness let's leave 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.380
 that rests for about half 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.979
 time we will put covered with a cloth 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.979
 cooking 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.280
 the higher beyond we can see that 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.770
 already has bubbles and now what we're going 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.010
 to make is to knead it we are going to place 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.090
 flours 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.490
 on the surface of the marble and now 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.300
 let's pour it over and the 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.920
 we will pass with our hands 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.920
 let's go kneading 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.700
 I have put a lot of flour surely not the 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.590
 will accept all but we will remove this 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:21.790
 Kneading should last about 15 to 20 minutes 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.579
 once we have it well kneaded 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.950
 we can also do it with a 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.810
 electric mixer but I prefer 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.329
 do it with our hands now we will leave it 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.689
 over the flour and we will cover it 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:37.090
 with a cloth and let it rest half 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:40.690
 hour or one hour more 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.849
 the mass and has increased in volume as 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.430
 I have opened it before I have downloaded a 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.430
 little but now we can extend it 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.239
 and and we will place on the tray 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.450
 from the oven we will join with a little bit of 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.450
 oil 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.950
 and we're also going to put a little bit of 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.950
 flour 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.950
 now we place it and with our hands the 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:11.049
 we are going to adapt to the shape of the 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.400
 tray then when we have already the 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.010
 shape of the tray 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.599
 we will only have to fill it with the 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.599
 ingredients that we like
