 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:21.090
 the company is a lazy kebab and I will tell 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:25.189
 you about the grill a thermos consists of a bath 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.869
 barbecue four legs and 4 bolts and 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.679
 intended for cooking 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.340
 on the coals is going to grill a thermos very 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.010
 simply 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:41.809
 four legs are inserted into the grooves and 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.950
 bolted bowl brazier 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.110
 made from the outside 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.230
 2 thick heat resistant steel 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.600
 millimeter and internal food 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.449
 8th tenths stainless steel 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.199
 millimeter brazier consists of two layers 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.109
 this is exterior made of heat resistant 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.019
 two millimeter steel bend from four 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.409
 sides and it has a total of 4 welds 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:12.080
 two handles on the sides that help 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.430
 carry brazier and latches at the edges 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.759
 for air supply 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.540
 inner layer is food grade stainless steel 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.380
 8 tenths of a millimeter thick across 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.590
 surface 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.380
 barbecue there are small holes for 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.680
 improve air circulation between 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.170
 inner and outer layers have 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.890
 distance so-called air 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.229
 pillow when we move the flap 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.320
 air gets inside 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.689
 brazier kindling coals and thereby 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.140
 keep the temperature in the inner bowl 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.500
 and the air bag and outer layer 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.380
 barbecues do not give heat to leave the brazier and 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.990
 thereby achieving the effect of a thermos and 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.930
 at the same time the outer layer of the grill is not 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.460
 warmed up on the outer edges of the barbecue 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.490
 I have a place 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.580
 Mantures and all these qualities make 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.509
 grill thermos strong and durable 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.509
 goodbye
