 that we are really interested because good 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.579
 as you can see the mouse is a design the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.859
 really quite ergonomic the psoe is 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.290

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.329
 which is a mouse slides perfectly 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.829
 on any surface something that I 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.450
 liked is that the cable is not enough 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.659
 appreciate but the cable as you can see 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.970
 brings this coverage which is good 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.469
 to give quite enough lifespan without 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.120
 that it gets damaged as they 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:24.209
 commented we have what is the terminal 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.919

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:31.019
 appreciate has what are the 17 buttons 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.719
 these buttons here that are two 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.090
 completely customizable buttons already 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:38.750
 that if for example they are playing messes 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.640
 laws can customize them to 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.350
 each button can make an action 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.850
 different in a way we have the 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.250

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.620

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.260

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.790
