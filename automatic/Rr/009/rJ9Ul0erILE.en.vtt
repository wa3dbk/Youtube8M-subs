Halo and well Microsoft did something

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.380 
Halo and well Microsoft did something
that<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.470> think<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:28.980> needed<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.150> game

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
that I think was needed on this game

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.950 
that I think was needed on this game
they<00:00:31.199> created<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.980> lite<00:00:32.399> version<00:00:32.850> which<00:00:33.780> is

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960

they created a lite version which is
totally<00:00:34.500> free<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.070> lets<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.850> play<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:38.129> first

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
few levels of the game itself so if you

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
this is great because they now added the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.090

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.029 
lite version of the game for those that
bought<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.640> game<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:54.629> me<00:00:54.870> what's<00:00:55.680> cool<00:00:56.010> is

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
bought the game like me what's cool is

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.360 
bought the game like me what's cool is
that<00:00:56.250> they've<00:00:56.969> also<00:00:57.270> updated<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.320> app<00:00:58.590> which

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
that they've also updated that app which

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.610 
that they've also updated that app which
means<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.820> now<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.359> more<00:01:00.840> levels

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
means that now we have more levels

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.270 
means that now we have more levels
I<00:01:02.370> think<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:02.850> 5<00:01:03.090> or<00:01:03.270> 6<00:01:03.799> more<00:01:04.799> levels

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
I think it's 5 or 6 more levels

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.630 
I think it's 5 or 6 more levels
available<00:01:05.519> now<00:01:06.140> for<00:01:07.140> Spartan<00:01:08.010> assault<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
available now for Spartan assault the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.820 
available now for Spartan assault the
full<00:01:08.909> version<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.479> if<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.320> ever<00:01:10.500> bought

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
full version if you if you ever bought

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.090 
full version if you if you ever bought
it<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.760> that's<00:01:12.420> cool<00:01:14.090> I<00:01:15.090> think<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:16.500> reason<00:01:16.920> why

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
it so that's cool I think the reason why

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.249 
it so that's cool I think the reason why
they<00:01:17.369> wanted<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.180> do<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> live<00:01:18.659> version<00:01:18.930> is

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
they wanted to do a live version is

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.429 
they wanted to do a live version is
probably<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.009> try<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.180> more<00:01:21.720> sales<00:01:22.170> of

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
probably to try and have more sales of

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.940 
probably to try and have more sales of
the<00:01:22.530> app<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> game<00:01:23.400> itself<00:01:24.950> Spartan

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
the app of the game itself Spartan

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.740 
the app of the game itself Spartan
assault<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.670> great<00:01:27.119> game<00:01:27.390> I've<00:01:27.720> been
