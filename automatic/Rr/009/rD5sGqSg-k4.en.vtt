00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
today we're going to do some hacking on

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.930 
today we're going to do some hacking on
the<00:00:16.410> Samsung<00:00:16.830> Galaxy<00:00:17.039> camera<00:00:17.460> jiz<00:00:17.789> what

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
you're watching me on right now you're

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.080 
you're watching me on right now you're
looking<00:00:19.590> at<00:00:19.800> me<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.039> Samsung<00:00:20.520> Galaxy<00:00:20.939> camera

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
looking at me on a Samsung Galaxy camera

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.519 
looking at me on a Samsung Galaxy camera
so<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> first<00:00:21.689> hack<00:00:21.900> we're<00:00:22.080> going<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.380> talk

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
so the first hack we're going to talk

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.830 
so the first hack we're going to talk
about<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.949> inception<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.640> mean<00:00:23.910> remote

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
about is inception I mean remote

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.290 
about is inception I mean remote
viewfinder<00:00:25.279> now<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.340> way<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.640> do<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.029> is

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
viewfinder now the way you do this is

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.240 
viewfinder now the way you do this is
you<00:00:27.420> have<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.599> have<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.810> VNC<00:00:28.199> server<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
you have to have a VNC server on the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.790 
you have to have a VNC server on the
device<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.960> this<00:00:30.960> works<00:00:31.170> for<00:00:31.320> just<00:00:31.500> about<00:00:31.560> any

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
device and this works for just about any

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.709 
device and this works for just about any
Android<00:00:32.219> device<00:00:32.250> out<00:00:32.669> there<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.510> have<00:00:33.690> a

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
Android device out there so you have a

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.110 
Android device out there so you have a
remote<00:00:34.050> viewfinder<00:00:34.649> on<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.399> device<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> remote

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
remote viewfinder on the device a remote

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.639 
remote viewfinder on the device a remote
VNC<00:00:36.420> server<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.809> VNC<00:00:39.809> viewer<00:00:40.020> on

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
VNC server and you have a VNC viewer on

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.069 
VNC server and you have a VNC viewer on
the<00:00:41.160> client<00:00:41.579> device<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.510> case<00:00:42.690> I'm<00:00:42.899> using

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
the client device in this case I'm using

about<00:01:02.699> adding<00:01:03.120> an<00:01:03.210> external<00:01:03.629> microphone<00:01:04.250> now

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
about adding an external microphone now

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.530 
about adding an external microphone now
as<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.610> see<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:06.060> I've<00:01:06.240> got<00:01:06.420> this

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
as you can see here I've got this

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.149 
as you can see here I've got this
directional<00:01:07.049> microphone<00:01:07.530> hooked<00:01:07.799> up<00:01:07.979> and

directional microphone hooked up and

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.160 
directional microphone hooked up and
it's<00:01:08.549> pretty<00:01:08.580> useful<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.210> filtering<00:01:10.049> out

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
it's pretty useful for filtering out

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.250 
it's pretty useful for filtering out
unwanted<00:01:10.590> noise<00:01:11.479> it<00:01:12.479> does<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.750> pretty<00:01:12.930> good<00:01:13.110> job

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
unwanted noise it does a pretty good job

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.380 
unwanted noise it does a pretty good job
now<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.770> make<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.220> connection<00:01:14.520> between<00:01:15.060> the

microphone and the camera you need to

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.730 
microphone and the camera you need to
have<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> Samsung<00:01:17.939> headset<00:01:18.479> capable<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.290> using

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
have a Samsung headset capable of using

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.800 
have a Samsung headset capable of using
external<00:01:20.220> audio<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.000> ones<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.689> know

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
external audio the ones that you know

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.300 
external audio the ones that you know
they<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> earbuds<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.680> go<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:22.979> your<00:01:23.100> ear

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
they have the earbuds to go in your ear

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.429 
they have the earbuds to go in your ear
and<00:01:23.520> then<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> microphone<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
and then you have a microphone on the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.499 
and then you have a microphone on the
side<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.890> talk<00:01:26.100> into<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.360> cut

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
side to talk into it you can just cut

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.810 
side to talk into it you can just cut
that<00:01:27.659> connection<00:01:28.080> off<00:01:28.229> determine<00:01:28.799> which<00:01:29.460> pins

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
that connection off determine which pins

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.020 
that connection off determine which pins
by<00:01:30.360> using<00:01:30.689> maybe<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.140> multimeter<00:01:31.710> or<00:01:31.909> just<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
by using maybe a multimeter or just the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.370 
by using maybe a multimeter or just the
color<00:01:33.210> code<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.689> I've<00:01:33.750> got<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> link<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
color code so I've got a link in the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.840 
color code so I've got a link in the
description<00:01:34.829> down<00:01:34.860> below<00:01:35.009> as<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.490> how<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.610> can

description down below as to how you can
build<00:01:36.060> with<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.420> only<00:01:37.020> cost<00:01:37.229> $10<00:01:37.740> worth<00:01:37.979> parts

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
build with it only cost $10 worth parts

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.850 
build with it only cost $10 worth parts
and<00:01:38.520> it's<00:01:39.180> pretty<00:01:39.509> darn<00:01:39.780> effective<00:01:40.290> next<00:01:40.740> up

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
and it's pretty darn effective next up

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.350 
and it's pretty darn effective next up
we'll<00:01:41.130> talk<00:01:41.310> about<00:01:41.430> hooking<00:01:41.700> up<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.000> UART

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
is another hack on its own so next up

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.830 
is another hack on its own so next up
I'll<00:02:16.980> show<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.610> how<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.850> disable<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.450> emmc

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
I'll show you how to disable the emmc

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.420 
I'll show you how to disable the emmc
now<00:02:19.380> there's<00:02:19.560> these<00:02:19.680> two<00:02:19.740> points<00:02:20.220> right<00:02:20.280> here

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
now there's these two points right here

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.030 
now there's these two points right here
and<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:21.390> can<00:02:21.570> simply<00:02:21.840> just<00:02:22.170> bridge<00:02:22.470> those<00:02:22.770> up

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
and you can simply just bridge those up

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.260 
and you can simply just bridge those up
and<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.400> can<00:02:23.550> do<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.820> with<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:23.970> beat<00:02:24.150> of

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
and you can do that with a beat of

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.680 
and you can do that with a beat of
solder<00:02:24.540> or<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.980> can<00:02:26.280> use<00:02:27.000> some<00:02:27.180> needles<00:02:27.510> like

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
solder or you can use some needles like

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.449 
solder or you can use some needles like
I<00:02:27.870> use<00:02:28.080> just<00:02:28.410> simply<00:02:28.800> touch<00:02:29.190> these<00:02:29.430> two

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
I use just simply touch these two

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.130 
I use just simply touch these two
needles<00:02:29.940> they're<00:02:30.120> soldered<00:02:30.330> together<00:02:30.630> and

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
needles they're soldered together and

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.230 
needles they're soldered together and
just<00:02:31.830> simply<00:02:32.190> touch<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.400> needle<00:02:32.700> stick<00:02:33.060> to

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
just simply touch the needle stick to

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.150 
just simply touch the needle stick to
the<00:02:33.390> two<00:02:33.540> points<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.170> that's<00:02:34.740> all<00:02:34.980> there<00:02:35.130> is

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
the two points and that's all there is

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.140 
the two points and that's all there is
to<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:36.270> disables<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.930> emmc<00:02:37.700> now<00:02:38.700> when

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
to it that disables the emmc now when

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.570 
to it that disables the emmc now when
you<00:02:39.300> disable<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.810> emmc<00:02:40.370> galaxy<00:02:41.370> camera

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
you disable the emmc galaxy camera

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.940 
you disable the emmc galaxy camera
galaxy<00:02:42.209> s3<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.780> several<00:02:43.140> other<00:02:43.320> devices<00:02:43.650> will

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
galaxy s3 and several other devices will

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.460 
galaxy s3 and several other devices will
automatically<00:02:44.640> fail<00:02:44.940> over<00:02:45.480> into<00:02:46.200> booting

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
automatically fail over into booting

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.590 
automatically fail over into booting
from<00:02:46.500> sd<00:02:46.920> card<00:02:47.060> allowing<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.330> dual<00:02:48.480> boot

from sd card allowing you to dual boot

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.530 
from sd card allowing you to dual boot
so<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.739> case<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.160> galaxy<00:02:50.550> camera<00:02:50.760> I've

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
so in the case of the galaxy camera I've

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.540 
so in the case of the galaxy camera I've
added<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:52.020> switch<00:02:52.350> so<00:02:52.770> if<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:52.950> press<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.220> switch

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
added a switch so if I press the switch

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.430 
added a switch so if I press the switch
and<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.090> press<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.570> power<00:02:54.780> button<00:02:54.840> at<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.290> same

and I press the power button at the same
time<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:56.310> device<00:02:56.580> will<00:02:56.760> automatically<00:02:57.270> boot

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
time the device will automatically boot

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.810 
time the device will automatically boot
from<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.630> SD<00:02:58.020> card<00:02:58.260> now<00:02:58.800> if<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.220> don't<00:02:59.489> press

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
from the SD card now if I don't press

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.030 
from the SD card now if I don't press
the<00:03:00.390> switch<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:00.959> I<00:03:01.050> just<00:03:01.260> press<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.800> power
