00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.010 
easy and another use I don't know what
number<00:05:08.600> this<00:05:08.840> is<00:05:08.900> but<00:05:09.790> saving<00:05:10.790> clean<00:05:11.210> I've

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
number this is but saving clean I've

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.280 
number this is but saving clean I've
used<00:05:12.470> this<00:05:12.830> before<00:05:13.690> shaving<00:05:14.690> cream<00:05:14.900> to<00:05:15.080> test

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
used this before shaving cream to test

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.280 
used this before shaving cream to test
it<00:05:15.440> out<00:05:15.530> and<00:05:16.000> out<00:05:17.000> of<00:05:17.210> 5<00:05:17.450> stars<00:05:17.960> I<00:05:18.260> would

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
it out and out of 5 stars I would

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.890 
it out and out of 5 stars I would
probably<00:05:18.560> give<00:05:18.830> it<00:05:18.860> three<00:05:19.220> so<00:05:19.910> it<00:05:20.150> works<00:05:20.510> and

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
probably give it three so it works and

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.410 
probably give it three so it works and
it<00:05:21.080> works<00:05:21.110> pretty<00:05:21.650> good<00:05:21.800> but<00:05:22.550> it's<00:05:22.730> it's<00:05:23.300> not

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
it works pretty good but it's it's not

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.240 
it works pretty good but it's it's not
going<00:05:23.720> to<00:05:23.780> be<00:05:23.900> as<00:05:24.050> good<00:05:24.290> as<00:05:24.770> something<00:05:25.070> you'd

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
going to be as good as something you'd

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.840 
going to be as good as something you'd
