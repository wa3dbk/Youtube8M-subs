00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.690
 took this contribution so 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.810
 but because I saw it 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.450
 not really the 500 fans came in 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.440
 a cold is verified as a second 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.440
 works out 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.820
 until the end 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.160
 dear bad plan 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.160
 now the inconsiderate 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.370
 a school to say 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.540
 all 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.210
 mario a derogation lists said that for 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.430
 crazy there is nothing broken 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.540
 and there is very little confusion 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.520
 do you too 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:50.640
 rooting for the madman to play there 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.640
 cellona four core tier one 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.780
 indeed which thing from all now 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.780
 the life 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.460
 good team like us always serves 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.210
 i do it i can tell if it was one 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.740
 team of firefighters did not have it always 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.800
 what's this 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.120
 this 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.120
 really 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.990
 mario a month of about a month 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.600
 here as you are finding yourself the ti 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.310
 expecting an approach to the team in 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.590
 this way you expected it six 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.970
 entered a team that was already going e 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.750
 helped a bit of performance between 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.750
 shows 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.740
 in general your approach in general 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.350
 to the team to join this team 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:50.280
 you don't know but you have scored 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:50.280
 five negative goals 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.420
 five goals 5 goals 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.090
 what a feeling they gave you this thing 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.770
 you did not mark from somewhere 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:10.399
 some time in england is found 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:13.569
 immediately five goals and still delicate for 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.569
 those opportunities against lines 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.100
 you have heard the statements of left-handed people 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.230
 a few days ago he said balotelli is 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.270
 so you have to take it this way maybe at 30 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.040
 years will still be so electric 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.840
 his comment told me to do 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.330
 otherwise this newspaper seemed 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.180
 written incredible said that I am 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:39.640
 I'm always getting myself 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.040
 he said that mistakes like everyone else 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.200
 they are so tied 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.579
 did not mean that I am a number from 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.079
 little girl 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:51.150
 so what makes now as 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:55.760
 milan fan as this sediment 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.760
 eve of the match with barcelona 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.220
 if you don't need it 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.520
 the appointees and the companions if maybe 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.260
 that this interesting players 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.150
 I hope a good game lacks nothing 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.220
 to live as many days as we can 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.520
 withdraw 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.520
 we are from sky
