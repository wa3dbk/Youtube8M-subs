00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
just start with your 50 pounds shock

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.670 
just start with your 50 pounds shock
you're<00:00:12.809> 17<00:00:13.200> pound<00:00:13.469> tests<00:00:14.120> run<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.269> line<00:00:15.680> what

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
you're 17 pound tests run in line what

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.450 
you're 17 pound tests run in line what
you<00:00:16.770> do<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.070> you'll<00:00:17.220> actually<00:00:19.010> get<00:00:20.010> your<00:00:20.070> shark

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
you do is you'll actually get your shark

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.070 
you do is you'll actually get your shark
line<00:00:22.279> and<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:24.240> want<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.449> fold<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.810> over<00:00:24.900> like

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
line and you want to fold it over like

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.730 
line and you want to fold it over like
so<00:00:25.470> with<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> loop<00:00:26.779> then<00:00:27.779> you'll<00:00:27.900> get<00:00:28.109> your<00:00:28.289> 17

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
so with the loop then you'll get your 17

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.009 
so with the loop then you'll get your 17
pound<00:00:29.010> test<00:00:29.250> line<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.849> run<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.840> back<00:00:30.990> through

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
pound test line and run it back through

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.490 
pound test line and run it back through
the<00:00:31.349> whole<00:00:31.470> life<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:33.110> then<00:00:34.110> once<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.380> do<00:00:34.500> that

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
the whole life so then once you do that

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.889 
the whole life so then once you do that
you<00:00:37.500> want<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.770> hold<00:00:38.899> the<00:00:39.899> shock<00:00:40.260> together<00:00:40.829> and

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
you want to hold the shock together and

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.779 
you want to hold the shock together and
the<00:00:42.899> process<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.530> doing<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.550> want<00:00:44.730> to

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
the process of doing that you want to

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.600 
the process of doing that you want to
get<00:00:44.940> your<00:00:45.120> 17<00:00:45.629> pound<00:00:45.930> test<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:47.399> want<00:00:47.550> to

get your 17 pound test and you want to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.810 
get your 17 pound test and you want to
start<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.969> wrap<00:00:48.800> around<00:00:49.800> both<00:00:50.340> parts<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:52.820> your

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
start to wrap around both parts of your

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.189 
start to wrap around both parts of your
shock<00:00:54.350> about<00:00:55.350> 5<00:00:56.010> times<00:00:56.399> 6<00:00:56.820> times<00:00:56.940> will<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.600> so

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
shock about 5 times 6 times will do so

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.200 
shock about 5 times 6 times will do so
it<00:00:58.350> looks<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.980> here<00:01:00.530> once<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.680> do<00:01:01.829> that

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
you want to get your 17 pound test and

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.980 
you want to get your 17 pound test and
run<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.180> right<00:01:06.450> back<00:01:06.750> through<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.260> same<00:01:07.530> hole

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
run it right back through the same hole

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.590 
run it right back through the same hole
once<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.140> do<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.729> grab<00:01:11.810> pull<00:01:12.810> both<00:01:13.049> sides<00:01:14.600> so

fairly<00:02:04.240> easy<00:02:04.600> not<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:05.080> time<00:02:06.330> you<00:02:07.330> just

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
fairly easy not the time you just

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.050 
fairly easy not the time you just
basically<00:02:07.720> get<00:02:08.350> your<00:02:08.470> 70<00:02:08.890> pound<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.520> your<00:02:09.729> 50

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
basically get your 70 pound and your 50

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:20.449 
basically get your 70 pound and your 50
pound<00:02:10.980> cross<00:02:11.980> them<00:02:12.160> over<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:16.650> rep<00:02:17.650> one<00:02:18.489> side

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
pound cross them over and rep one side

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.160 
pound cross them over and rep one side
then<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:21.670> wrap<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.090> other<00:02:22.269> side<00:02:24.750> about<00:02:25.750> 5

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
then you wrap the other side about 5

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:34.270 
then you wrap the other side about 5
times<00:02:26.560> 6<00:02:27.040> times<00:02:28.739> then<00:02:29.739> once<00:02:29.950> you've<00:02:30.130> done<00:02:30.340> that

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.520 

you<00:02:34.790> would<00:02:34.940> pull<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.180> loop<00:02:37.810> in<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.200> middle<00:02:39.500> like

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
you would pull a loop in the middle like

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.720 
you would pull a loop in the middle like
so<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:40.459> then<00:02:41.380> you'll<00:02:42.380> get<00:02:42.590> both<00:02:42.860> ends<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:43.700> the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
so and then you'll get both ends of the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.290 
so and then you'll get both ends of the
tag<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:45.370> run<00:02:46.370> them<00:02:46.520> through<00:02:48.490> the<00:02:49.490> hole<00:02:49.700> or<00:02:50.270> the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
tag and run them through the hole or the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.920 
tag and run them through the hole or the
loop<00:02:50.660> itself<00:02:55.090> then<00:02:56.090> you'll<00:02:56.270> grab<00:02:56.510> these<00:02:56.690> two

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
loop itself then you'll grab these two

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.440 
loop itself then you'll grab these two
tad<00:02:57.170> your<00:02:57.560> teeth<00:02:57.739> and<00:02:57.950> pull<00:02:58.280> outward<00:03:01.450> alright

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
tad your teeth and pull outward alright

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.310 
tad your teeth and pull outward alright
so<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:04.300> then<00:03:05.300> it'll<00:03:05.510> tighten<00:03:05.750> up<00:03:05.959> just<00:03:06.170> like

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
so and then it'll tighten up just like

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:19.120 
so and then it'll tighten up just like
that<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.840> then<00:03:12.350> you<00:03:13.750> trim<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.780> tabs<00:03:18.130> alright

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
that and then you trim the tabs alright

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.280 
that and then you trim the tabs alright
so<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:19.970> that's<00:03:20.090> two<00:03:20.269> types<00:03:20.569> of<00:03:20.720> shock<00:03:20.989> nuts

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
so so that's two types of shock nuts

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.770 
so so that's two types of shock nuts
I've<00:03:21.530> just<00:03:21.709> showed<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:22.180> now<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.239> next<00:03:23.330> one<00:03:23.660> is

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
I've just showed you now the next one is

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.590 
I've just showed you now the next one is
basically<00:03:24.560> a<00:03:24.800> way<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.370> can<00:03:25.640> make<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:26.060> bottom

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
basically a way you can make a bottom

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.860 
basically a way you can make a bottom
rig<00:03:26.840> it's<00:03:27.019> called<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.410> figure-eight<00:03:27.980> luton<00:03:28.489> not

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
rig it's called a figure-eight luton not

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.309 
rig it's called a figure-eight luton not
by<00:03:29.870> doing<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:31.450> you'll<00:03:32.450> be<00:03:32.630> separated<00:03:33.319> again<00:03:35.319> as

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
by doing so you'll be separated again as

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.039 
by doing so you'll be separated again as
you're<00:03:36.590> running<00:03:36.739> line<00:03:37.600> you<00:03:38.600> would<00:03:38.750> want<00:03:38.930> to

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
you're running line you would want to

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:47.140 
you're running line you would want to
fold<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.470> over<00:03:39.650> like<00:03:41.170> so<00:03:42.170> and<00:03:42.530> then<00:03:42.850> just

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.880 

sorry<00:03:48.150> did<00:03:48.300> that<00:03:48.330> backwards<00:03:48.840> fold<00:03:49.710> it<00:03:49.800> over

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
sorry did that backwards fold it over

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.890 
sorry did that backwards fold it over
like<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:51.830> double<00:03:52.830> your<00:03:52.980> lineup<00:03:53.400> again<00:03:56.900> put

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
like so double your lineup again put

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.770 
like so double your lineup again put
your<00:03:58.050> tags<00:03:58.290> on<00:03:58.530> one<00:03:58.680> in<00:03:59.270> wrap<00:04:00.270> it<00:04:00.540> two<00:04:01.440> times

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
your tags on one in wrap it two times

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.720 
your tags on one in wrap it two times
grab<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.960> loop<00:04:04.200> in<00:04:04.500> here<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:07.460> pull<00:04:08.460> tight

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
grab the loop in here and pull tight

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.210 
grab the loop in here and pull tight
that's<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.870> little<00:04:10.080> big<00:04:10.350> lube<00:04:10.680> that<00:04:10.890> I<00:04:10.950> didn't

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
that's a little big lube that I didn't

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.260 
that's a little big lube that I didn't
make<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:11.400> little<00:04:11.550> bit<00:04:11.700> easier<00:04:11.790> to<00:04:12.030> show<00:04:12.240> you

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
make this little bit easier to show you

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.200 
make this little bit easier to show you
but<00:04:12.420> you<00:04:12.540> can<00:04:12.780> make<00:04:12.990> them<00:04:13.170> smaller<00:04:13.790> which<00:04:14.790> does

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
but you can make them smaller which does

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.620 
but you can make them smaller which does
your<00:04:15.420> loop<00:04:15.660> nut<00:04:16.520> and<00:04:17.520> by<00:04:17.700> doing<00:04:17.970> so<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.300> can

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
your loop nut and by doing so you can

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.320 
your loop nut and by doing so you can
tie<00:04:18.900> your<00:04:19.170> weight<00:04:19.410> onto<00:04:19.650> here<00:04:20.190> your<00:04:20.910> hook<00:04:21.120> to

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
tie your weight onto here your hook to

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.420 
tie your weight onto here your hook to
hear<00:04:21.720> this<00:04:22.170> is<00:04:22.350> your<00:04:22.500> main<00:04:22.680> line<00:04:22.920> running<00:04:23.190> here

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
hear this is your main line running here

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.770 
hear this is your main line running here
so<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.640> actually<00:04:23.790> have<00:04:23.970> a<00:04:24.090> loop<00:04:24.330> in<00:04:24.450> your<00:04:24.600> line

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
so you actually have a loop in your line

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.600 
so you actually have a loop in your line
as<00:04:25.050> I<00:04:25.470> just<00:04:25.650> called<00:04:25.800> a<00:04:25.860> figure<00:04:26.190> eight<00:04:26.340> loop

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
as I just called a figure eight loop

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.680 
as I just called a figure eight loop
which<00:04:26.820> is<00:04:26.970> a<00:04:27.000> lot<00:04:27.150> of<00:04:27.180> talk<00:04:27.480> fishermen<00:04:27.990> use<00:04:28.520> and

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
which is a lot of talk fishermen use and

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.430 
which is a lot of talk fishermen use and
actually<00:04:30.690> if<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:30.870> want<00:04:30.990> to<00:04:31.050> build<00:04:31.200> your<00:04:31.410> own

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
actually if you want to build your own

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.080 
actually if you want to build your own
bottom<00:04:31.890> ready<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.190> save<00:04:32.370> yourself<00:04:32.730> a<00:04:32.820> couple

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
bottom ready to save yourself a couple

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.150 
bottom ready to save yourself a couple
