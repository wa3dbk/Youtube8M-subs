hello um I got a new PC some HP vector V

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.830 
hello um I got a new PC some HP vector V
L<00:00:05.700> it<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.839> designed<00:00:07.290> for<00:00:07.470> Windows<00:00:07.799> 98<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.840> it

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
L it is designed for Windows 98 and it

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.339 
L it is designed for Windows 98 and it
had<00:00:10.280> 128<00:00:11.280> megabytes<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.880> RAM<00:00:12.150> which<00:00:12.389> was

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
had 128 megabytes of RAM which was

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.410 
had 128 megabytes of RAM which was
insufficient<00:00:13.980> for<00:00:14.009> Windows<00:00:14.460> XP<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.389> I

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
insufficient for Windows XP so I

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.090 
insufficient for Windows XP so I
upgraded<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.289> have<00:00:16.699> 256<00:00:17.699> megabytes<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:19.100> RAM

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
upgraded it to have 256 megabytes of RAM

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.730 
upgraded it to have 256 megabytes of RAM
so<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:22.699> so<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.970> stopped<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.779> upgraded<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.500> from

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
so and I so I stopped I upgraded it from

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.620 
so and I so I stopped I upgraded it from
Windows<00:00:26.010> 2000<00:00:26.699> which<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.939> originally<00:00:27.570> had<00:00:28.519> to

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
Windows 2000 which it originally had to

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.060

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
windows xp service pack 1 and then

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.940 
windows xp service pack 1 and then
upgraded<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.910> from<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.230> Windows<00:00:34.620> XP

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
upgraded it from that to Windows XP

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.229

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.480

which I like then I set up this custom
theme<00:02:29.190> here<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:31.910> upgrade<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.750> got<00:02:34.080> from

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
theme here the upgrade that I got from

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.729 
theme here the upgrade that I got from
my<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:35.250> downloaded<00:02:35.940> from<00:02:36.239> either<00:02:36.480> computer<00:02:37.170> so

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
my I downloaded from either computer so

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.020 
my I downloaded from either computer so
now<00:02:37.980> let's<00:02:38.310> check<00:02:38.400> out<00:02:38.730> their<00:02:39.150> properties<00:02:39.900> a

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
now let's check out their properties a

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:49.860 
now let's check out their properties a
me<00:02:42.030> me<00:02:42.390> me<00:02:42.450> me

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.150 

and<00:02:50.050> still<00:02:50.410> loading<00:02:50.800> it's<00:02:50.950> stupid<00:02:51.580> Java<00:02:52.180> files

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
and still loading it's stupid Java files

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:01.130 
and still loading it's stupid Java files
like<00:02:54.160> that

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:12.770 

let's<00:03:01.650> try<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.070> again

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:21.160 

anyway

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.230 

see<00:03:22.069> the<00:03:22.490> performance

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
see the performance

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:35.000 
see the performance
right<00:03:25.810> now<00:03:26.100> loading<00:03:27.100> up<00:03:27.610> all<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.180> items

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010
