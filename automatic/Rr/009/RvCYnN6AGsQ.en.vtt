way<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.420> found<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:11.020> do<00:02:11.230> these<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:13.319> there's<00:02:14.319> a

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
way I found to do these is there's a

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.460 
way I found to do these is there's a
funnel<00:02:14.650> really<00:02:15.580> really<00:02:15.970> small<00:02:16.209> tip<00:02:16.510> it's<00:02:17.349> an

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
funnel really really small tip it's an

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.220 
funnel really really small tip it's an
MSR<00:02:18.150> cleaning<00:02:19.150> funnel<00:02:19.480> it's<00:02:19.690> got<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:19.840> cap<00:02:20.080> on

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
MSR cleaning funnel it's got a cap on

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
MSR cleaning funnel it's got a cap on
the<00:02:20.349> end<00:02:20.380> of<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.650> so<00:02:20.800> when<00:02:20.920> you're<00:02:21.040> done<00:02:21.190> you

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
the end of it so when you're done you

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.890 
the end of it so when you're done you
put<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.640> cap<00:02:21.849> on<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.209> turn<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.540> over<00:02:22.690> you're

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
put the cap on you turn it over you're

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.880 
put the cap on you turn it over you're
done<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:24.130> go<00:02:24.610> ahead<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.590> you'll<00:02:26.590> have<00:02:26.769> to

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
done so go ahead and you'll have to

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.030 
done so go ahead and you'll have to
still<00:02:27.130> hold<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:27.880> is<00:02:28.209> very<00:02:28.480> difficult

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.729 

unfortunately<00:02:33.040> other<00:02:33.310> than<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.730> paper<00:02:34.060> filter

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
unfortunately other than a paper filter

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.490 
unfortunately other than a paper filter
which<00:02:35.739> would<00:02:35.920> be<00:02:36.040> probably<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.610> best<00:02:36.700> thing

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
which would be probably the best thing

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.130 
which would be probably the best thing
we're<00:02:38.500> gonna<00:02:38.620> have<00:02:38.799> to<00:02:38.890> use<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:39.220> for<00:02:39.400> now<00:02:40.140> and

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
we're gonna have to use this for now and

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.520 
we're gonna have to use this for now and
we're<00:02:41.650> gonna<00:02:41.739> be<00:02:41.920> using<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.310> Lucas<00:02:42.930> 10<00:02:43.930> w<00:02:44.170> 40

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
we're gonna be using the Lucas 10 w 40

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.580 
we're gonna be using the Lucas 10 w 40
this<00:02:45.100> is<00:02:45.310> semi<00:02:45.640> synthetic<00:02:45.910> I<00:02:46.690> don't<00:02:47.290> ask<00:02:47.440> me

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
this is semi synthetic I don't ask me

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.509 
this is semi synthetic I don't ask me
why<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.709> I<00:02:47.890> just<00:02:48.040> didn't<00:02:48.280> want<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.430> go

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
why that I just didn't want to go

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.150 
why that I just didn't want to go
synthetic<00:02:49.440> I'm<00:02:50.440> gonna<00:02:50.620> change<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.069> oil

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
synthetic I'm gonna change the oil

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.280 
synthetic I'm gonna change the oil
probably<00:02:51.610> every<00:02:51.940> other<00:02:52.060> ride<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.870> figured

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
probably every other ride so I figured

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.729 
probably every other ride so I figured
you<00:02:53.440> know<00:02:53.500> why<00:02:54.630> why<00:02:55.630> you<00:02:55.690> synthetic<00:02:56.470> I<00:02:56.590> mean

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
you know why why you synthetic I mean

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.140 
you know why why you synthetic I mean
I'm<00:02:56.890> gonna<00:02:57.250> have<00:02:57.370> fresh<00:02:57.580> soil<00:02:57.819> and<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.060> all

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
I'm gonna have fresh soil and it all

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.840 
I'm gonna have fresh soil and it all
just<00:02:58.180> all<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.569> time<00:02:58.600> so<00:02:59.170> if<00:03:00.160> I<00:03:00.340> was<00:03:00.489> waiting<00:03:00.790> a

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
just all the time so if I was waiting a

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.759 
just all the time so if I was waiting a
little<00:03:00.970> bit<00:03:01.120> longer<00:03:01.209> I<00:03:01.810> probably<00:03:02.080> would<00:03:02.470> use

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
little bit longer I probably would use

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.820 
little bit longer I probably would use
something<00:03:03.519> in<00:03:04.120> between<00:03:04.420> rides<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:05.530> may<00:03:05.650> end

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
something in between rides and I may end

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.250 
something in between rides and I may end
up<00:03:05.890> change<00:03:06.190> than<00:03:06.370> that<00:03:06.519> but<00:03:06.819> we'll<00:03:07.299> see<00:03:07.569> and

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
up change than that but we'll see and

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.259 
up change than that but we'll see and
we're<00:03:08.349> gonna<00:03:08.470> just<00:03:09.430> hold<00:03:09.549> it<00:03:09.730> in<00:03:09.790> here<00:03:10.060> and

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
we're gonna just hold it in here and

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.360 
we're gonna just hold it in here and
start<00:03:11.170> pulling<00:03:11.470> them<00:03:11.590> all<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:11.920> hopefully<00:03:12.160> it

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
start pulling them all and hopefully it

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.390 
start pulling them all and hopefully it
doesn't<00:03:12.519> get<00:03:12.700> all<00:03:12.790> over<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.090> bike<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:15.220> got<00:03:15.340> a

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
doesn't get all over the bike you got a

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.259 
doesn't get all over the bike you got a
little<00:03:15.640> bit<00:03:15.760> out<00:03:15.790> there

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
little bit out there

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.030 
little bit out there
so<00:03:16.750> anyway<00:03:16.989> I'm<00:03:17.079> gonna<00:03:17.230> fill<00:03:17.410> this<00:03:17.500> up<00:03:17.739> and

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
so anyway I'm gonna fill this up and

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.970 
so anyway I'm gonna fill this up and
we'll<00:03:18.970> come<00:03:19.150> back<00:03:19.329> and<00:03:19.480> I'll<00:03:19.570> show<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:19.980> what

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
we'll come back and I'll show you what

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.349 
we'll come back and I'll show you what
levels<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.579> want<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.090> have<00:03:22.209> on<00:03:22.329> the

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
levels that you want to have on the

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.670 
levels that you want to have on the
dipstick<00:03:22.660> stay<00:03:23.260> tuned<00:03:23.470> okay<00:03:25.200> for<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.230> new<00:03:26.410> motor

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
dipstick stay tuned okay for a new motor

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.220 
dipstick stay tuned okay for a new motor
rebuilt<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.190> calls<00:03:27.370> for<00:03:27.459> one<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.900> a<00:03:28.959> quarter

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
rebuilt it calls for one and a quarter

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.920 
rebuilt it calls for one and a quarter
quarts<00:03:29.560> 1.26<00:03:30.430> something<00:03:30.700> like<00:03:30.790> that<00:03:31.030> I've<00:03:31.690> put

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
quarts 1.26 something like that I've put

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.340 
quarts 1.26 something like that I've put
a<00:03:31.959> cord<00:03:32.260> in<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:33.690> seems<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.780> be<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:34.930> fool<00:03:35.170> to

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
a cord in and it seems to be a fool to

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.220 
a cord in and it seems to be a fool to
me<00:03:35.500> if<00:03:36.100> you<00:03:36.220> can<00:03:36.370> see<00:03:36.549> that<00:03:36.760> Lucas<00:03:37.150> is<00:03:37.299> pretty

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
me if you can see that Lucas is pretty

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.720 
me if you can see that Lucas is pretty
clear<00:03:40.079> it's<00:03:41.079> definitely<00:03:41.530> full<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:42.100> I<00:03:42.340> don't

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
clear it's definitely full so I don't

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.400 
clear it's definitely full so I don't
want<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:42.880> overfill<00:03:43.359> it<00:03:43.390> what<00:03:43.720> I'll<00:03:43.810> do<00:03:44.019> is<00:03:44.200> I'll

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
want to overfill it what I'll do is I'll

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.750 
want to overfill it what I'll do is I'll
start<00:03:44.440> it<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.220> then<00:03:47.160> after<00:03:48.160> I<00:03:48.220> start<00:03:48.519> at<00:03:48.639> all

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
start it and then after I start at all

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.670 
start it and then after I start at all
I'll<00:03:49.180> check<00:03:49.630> it<00:03:49.750> again<00:03:49.840> along<00:03:50.290> with<00:03:50.350> the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
I'll check it again along with the

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.500 
I'll check it again along with the
coolant<00:03:51.069> the<00:03:51.579> last<00:03:51.790> thing<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.060> do<00:03:52.239> is<00:03:52.299> we're

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
coolant the last thing to do is we're

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.479 
coolant the last thing to do is we're
gonna<00:03:52.600> put<00:03:52.840> some<00:03:53.049> fuel<00:03:53.470> in<00:03:53.500> it<00:03:53.739> I'm<00:03:54.100> not<00:03:54.280> gonna

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
gonna put some fuel in it I'm not gonna

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:55.890 
gonna put some fuel in it I'm not gonna
show<00:03:54.609> that<00:03:54.790> it's<00:03:55.030> just<00:03:55.269> putting<00:03:55.420> fuel<00:03:55.750> in

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
show that it's just putting fuel in

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.220 
show that it's just putting fuel in
there's<00:03:56.859> the<00:03:57.069> fuel<00:03:57.280> tank<00:03:57.519> just<00:03:58.150> running<00:03:58.420> 94

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
there's the fuel tank just running 94

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.860 
there's the fuel tank just running 94
