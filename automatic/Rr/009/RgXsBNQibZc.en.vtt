00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:24.189

 where you live and are you happy 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:41.070
 what you promised me seems like a story 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.070
 I only believe but I listen to what he says 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:49.880

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.810

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.850
 but she is your wife and she is with you 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.710
 that I continue alone and wait for you that I do not 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.290

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.780

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.110

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.689
 They told me it 's a lie 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:37.609
 that you leave her 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:42.850
 still that are couples that you live 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:42.850
 where you live and are you happy 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.270
 if what you promised me seems like a story 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.240
 also my luck 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.040

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.100

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.910
 but I would be your wife and we're 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.849
 and what 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.519
 and that I remain alone and wait and finally 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.340

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.080
 It hurts 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.969
 I hope 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.420

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.730
 it depends exclusively on the public 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.940

 that they were or if that was me I could 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:30.220

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.069

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:24.610
