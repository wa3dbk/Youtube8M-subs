00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello happy today I come to talk about 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.500
 king of heart 3 and its possible worlds 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.369
 actor comments date of 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.500
 launch and other things good to start 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:20.020
 with the worlds among what stands out 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.270
 of the ice kingdom forum but as what 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.000
 is there between a fan has 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.590
 mixed the music of the game and the 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.270
 movie and he has created something quite 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.599
 interesting you can see it on the internet 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.960
 and also Atlantis is that neither 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.000
 it has been heard a lot or almost nothing but 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.470
 that they may include since 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.090
 it could be one of the most 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.580
 spectacular that he has been able to do 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.680
 square enix to part of the most worlds 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.450
 that they have reserved us 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.750
 well here you are seeing the graphics 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.730
 that are impressive and spectacular 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.950
 among those who are using a new 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.380
 technique called kingdom hearts 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.690
 sader 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.000
 and that's what the director said, but not 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.090
 has an official final name as you wish 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.030
 call it now you can see the graphics 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.980
 Look, although you have already seen it too 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.900
 the director wanted to mention 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.690
 enough about that have improved 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.780
 artificial intelligence or the guide as 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.820
 he calls him among those who the five 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.920
 hours will sound smarter things 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.920
 they will have the same attack pattern 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.189
 finally this for this to start 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.590
 there is also one thing that has 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.480
 worried enough that is the inclusion 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.050
 of 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.880
 the inclusion of star world and marvel 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.340
 which is something that in my opinion is a 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.340
 ally is something that should not have 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.260
 done not even have raised it not 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.990
 we know if they are doing it they do not forgive 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.020
 the mistake 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.060
 I think that's a lie that does not hit 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.270
 is incoherent does not follow with the story 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.270
 no not worth it can first of all 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.450
 what you are seeing is the location fan 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.159
 I do not know which country is the language numbers 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.250
 about who to browse 3 is what would be the 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.259
 menu 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.910
 here is what you see has been drawn and 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.670
 everything is not he is now that is drawn 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.920
 Japan looks good 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.610
 one of the things that I could paste in 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.680
 kingdom hearts 3 is pixar but clear 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.569
 to include it let's see what they put 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.200
 I do not know anything about toy story and I do not know 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.819
 I see more little things 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.030
 there is also the release date 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:36.830
 something that has surprised me a lot is 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.660
 say announce a video game as soon as 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.959
 two years before three years go out 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.950
 will be to raise the morale but I do not know 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.110
 I see it very soon but before continuing 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.170
 for the video there is a comment on the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.350
 director who missed me a lot when 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.310
 they asked him a question in which he says 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.849
 in which he says 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.250
 it is possible are you aware that 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.739
 Kim Jong Gear 3 are waiting for you more 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.400
 everyone apart from japan many more 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.209
 people this one answers if I'm aware 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.340
 that we are overcoming the mountain but 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.480
 I have full faith in my team something that 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.480
 he has left me a little 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.670
 missed because it's as if 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.550
 they probably could not throw him out 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.320
 other countries like Spain that we already know 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.240
 what they did with kingdom hearts 3d 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.490
 that I had to do it when I pushed 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.410
 that is not valid or not worth it 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.040
 me not because I had not understood na 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.130
 to look at everything I had to look a whole 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.510
 yogurt subtitled good we follow what 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.570
 you are seeing here is something that 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.570
 found recently is the gameplay the 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.220
 kingdom hearts 3 that I have here 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.950
 downloaded that is patched to Spanish 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.200
 although real is everything here you know 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.330
 perfectly what it says about the other 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.819
 video game but the other things a 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.870
 bit strange today saying 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.870
 immediately the video 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.830
 attack magic object invocation of 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.830
 forever 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.959
 good i still 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.520
 I also do not think they do the same 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.500
 exit not to take it out in Spain because 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:24.100
 they have easily removed the compilation 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.290
 of 1.5 and 2 and 2.5 of which are going to 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.030
 to take out still nothing is known at 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.950
 respect although I hope that they take it out 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.610
 I really want it to come out 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.610
 to be honest 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.980
 here is a 15 shots hop show 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:42.849
 evasive and get off if you do not see it you see 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:45.399
 pretty bad I'm sorry but it's a mobile 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.590
 good and lastly and finishing the 

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:49.140
 video 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.610
 kingdom hearts 3 in my opinion will come to 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:56.340
 end of 2015 beginning of 2016 already 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.260
 mid and as you are seeing these are 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.720
 the graphics that I already told you that this 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.520
 they are not even the endings I hope 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.980
 come out I want to leave 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.009
 it is already impressive we are going as it is 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:12.110
 watching is spectacular 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.110
 and well the video is already ending 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.650
 in the final attack 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.990
 and this is the development by which it is 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.060
 good in the end 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.790
 thank you very much for seeing the 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.530
 video this is this is how little I know 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.800
 so far I hope to be able to tell you 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.560
 later, I'm very sorry for the 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.200
 images the video looks pretty bad 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.880
 because what I'm doing with my mobile is 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.680
 the first time I make a video in all 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.780
 my life and I would like very much so 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.730
 less comment and subscribe is a 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.260
 sign of support and it will come quite well 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.000
 in the future for when it's going to be done 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.740
 better the video and others 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.920
 thank you very much goodbye and even the 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.920
 next
