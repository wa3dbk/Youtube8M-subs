00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:27.380
 in 1915 'Diego Rivera' takes five years 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.150
 in europe and the situation is very difficult 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.510
 it is the second year of the first war 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.510
 world 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.500
 in that situation he comes to visit him in 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.750
 paris martín luis guzmán 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.239
 and martín luis guzmán tells him stories 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.470
 from a country that is also immersed in 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.470
 violence in the civil war 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.170
 in 1915 it 's a very difficult year too 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.690
 for Mexico 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.640
 have fallen since the Victorian regime 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.559
 garden and all the factions 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.559
 revolutionaries are confronted 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.450
 the stories that tell Martin Luis 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:11.140
 guzmán have in germ something that ribera 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.390
 it captures very well that they are the elements of 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.030
 what is going to be the nationalism of the 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.030
 Mexican culture of the postrevolution and 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.049
 ribera thinks after those talks 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.630
 that his painting should no longer be just the 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.130
 cutting - edge painting that has been 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.740
 similar to that of your colleagues who live 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.409
 in paris that come mostly from 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.600
 different countries of europe also has 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.270
 have to have any reference to a 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.830
 Mexican national identity must be 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.440
 understand that until 1914 you can travel 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.080
 between St. Petersburg and Lisbon without 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.869
 passport a situation that is not going to 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.759
 repeat until it is constituted 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.370
 really the european union community 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.350
 policy then 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.220
 the world in which diego rivero lives 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.340
 until that moment it is quite 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.010
 cosmopolitan and that there is painting 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.140
 nationalist cubist is a bit a 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.590
 novelty, a novelty that falls a lot 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.040
 critics wrong at that time lead 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.580
 the baton as pierre reverdy and this 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.950
 Zapatista landscape painting begins 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.620
 call Zapatista landscape in the 20s 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.930
 when he ribera pint does not put that 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.780
 Title 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.900
 sometimes he appears as the guerrilla and 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.689
 ribera refers to him as my trophy 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.569
 Mexican that is a trophy a trophy is 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.670
 the following the old generals 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.909
 Romans when they won a campaign 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.209
 military took the arms of the defeated and 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:46.109
 they built with the ice with the armor 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:49.260
 with the helmet with their weapons a kind 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:51.870
 Monigote who walked in triumph 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.579
 when they came back to break that, that was 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.409
 a trophy is a very ambivalent picture 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.939
 because he uses some of the 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.430
 characteristics of cubism 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:02.579
 particularly the falsetto ado these are 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.919
 geometric figures cut to 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.169
 arrange all the figures on the 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:09.689
 flat without generating an illusion of 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:12.629
 space for that illusion in this case if 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:15.900
 exists exists in the background landscape and 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.130
 there exists here in this little paper that 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.770
 is 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:25.330
 let's say as if it were nailed is in 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:28.570
 reality a trompe l'oeil an illusion what 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:32.740
 that what in French is called a spin 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.930
 law and precisely what is here is a 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.330
 system made of contradictions the 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.580
 painting is figurative because here is a 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.710
 hat and a serape and a rifle supported 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.680
 on a stone that is also carved 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.390
 in cubic form and there is also a landscape 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.130
 and at the same time it's not figurative 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.680
 because the figures are not so easy to 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.080
 recognize are cut in different 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.760
 proportions and everything is made to 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.880
 tell the viewer you have to 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.680
 form a rational idea of ​​what you 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.569
 I'm proposing because I'm not going to give you 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.659
 the complete image 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:08.769
 in that sense it is a manifesto of 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:11.349
 ribera on problems faced by its 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.620
 paint that were really difficult to 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.620
 solve
