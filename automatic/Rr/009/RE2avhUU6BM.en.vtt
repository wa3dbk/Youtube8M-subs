00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:11.160
Okay so right here, I don't take these pieces
and pull them apart I just leave them like

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.840
this, and um, eventually I end up making one
big braid on this side.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.900
But here for example, I haven't taken this
one out, I did take this one out yesterday,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.160
and I put some shea butter and I braided it
back up but um, these have stayed and, and

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.000
I have to be really careful when I take it
out 'cause right now... ...dry to the touch

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.430
um but I know that it is still moist on the
inside, moisturized and everything on the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.550
inside, like there is still water on the inside
of my hair because it hasn't been that long

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.130
since I have washed it.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.280
I am just really careful.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:57.310
The ends, all of the ends already have shea
butter because I did that yesterday.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.899
and um, I kind of left my hair in braids like
just a little bit longer I normally would

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:07.960
have taken them out yesterday evening but
I decided to leave them until today so again

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.190
I am really careful.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:19.440
What I am getting is basically three chunks
you know the three strands of hair it's very

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.250
compressed it is exceptionally compressed
because I took the braids and I braided the

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.260
braids and it flattened my hair out further
so.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.400
It's really compressed and it starts to loosen
up and kind of the volume of my hair starts

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.630
to increase as the days go on.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.330
So again I just, my main thing here is see
there are strands of hair that I am watching

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.890
out for so that I don't um damage them I don't
tear them.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.700
Okay.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:39.319
So the 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.669
hard feeling from the gel goes away the shea
butter is just going on top of everything

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:50.870
I've already added to my hair I added while
my hair was wet, okay.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.049
And.

00:02:52.049 --> 00:03:02.870
I am going to make a braid here, and really
I haven't separated even I am just grabbing

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:11.159
sections..like some pieces you know, and I
am just going to make... spread the shea butter

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:19.969
on my hands or the oil whatever it is that
I am using and I try to coat as much as possible

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:22.049
okay.

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:29.450
Check out this side here and these are the
pieces.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.860
Again I haven't separated it will start separating
on its own see like here it is starting to

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.859
separate on it's own that is fine.

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:44.529
So I like to keep my hair together and heavily
coated as much as possible.

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:50.999
If I want my hair to be lighter and fluffier
I used a lighter oil.

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:57.170
Right now I am using shea butter which is
quite heavy for my hair and I enjoy it and

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:05.499
I enjoy what it does very much.

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:15.651
I am letting the curls be curly hair I am
not going for, I'm not going for length, but

00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:20.980
I can at this time I mean if I wanted to stretch
my hair out more I could do that but right

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:29.810
now I want it to sit for a bit with some shea
butter in it and um just allow the shea butter

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:36.250
to do what it does. ..and a little while later
like a half hour or so, I don't have to leave

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:44.630
in, these braids for a half hour it's not
necessary but um, yeah.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.010
So here I am just taking out my hair.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.360
The sections from the braids are present you
know.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:05:07.300
They start to separate and even with them
not separated I like the look of it.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:19.190
Just leave it, you know like a braid and a
braid and then after a little while just take

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.810
it out and my hair will have more volume so..

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:29.091
I add a little bit of shea butter and tomorrow
and the next day my hair will start to you

00:05:29.091 --> 00:05:32.530
know getting longer and longer, the curls
will start stretching out a little bit more

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.220
but this is like freshly washed and just freshly
taken out of the braids.
