00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.830 

I<00:00:00.260> think<00:00:01.260> that<00:00:01.380> a<00:00:01.410> lot<00:00:01.560> of<00:00:01.589> my<00:00:01.740> subscribers

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:02.840 
I think that a lot of my subscribers

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.570 
I think that a lot of my subscribers
have<00:00:03.840> come<00:00:04.259> through<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.620> TARDIS<00:00:04.980> video<00:00:05.339> and

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
have come through the TARDIS video and

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.789 
have come through the TARDIS video and
so<00:00:06.089> it's<00:00:06.390> only<00:00:06.600> fair<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.020> tell<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:07.500> what<00:00:07.649> to

so it's only fair to tell you what to

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.009 
so it's only fair to tell you what to
expect<00:00:08.160> what<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.730> really<00:00:08.940> expect<00:00:09.059> on<00:00:09.750> this

course<00:04:53.050> she<00:04:53.320> couldn't<00:04:53.500> materialize<00:04:54.160> I<00:04:54.520> just

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
course she couldn't materialize I just

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.190 
course she couldn't materialize I just
like<00:04:55.780> carrying<00:04:56.440> around<00:04:56.620> running<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.900> look

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
like carrying around running and look

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.110 
like carrying around running and look
the<00:04:59.470> lamp<00:04:59.680> is<00:05:00.040> broken<00:05:01.230> again<00:05:02.730> see<00:05:03.730> this<00:05:03.880> is<00:05:04.000> the

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
the lamp is broken again see this is the

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.960 
the lamp is broken again see this is the
fourth<00:05:04.390> time<00:05:04.540> or<00:05:04.900> something<00:05:05.200> like<00:05:05.290> that<00:05:05.970> this

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
fourth time or something like that this

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.410 
fourth time or something like that this
is<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:07.690> base<00:05:08.430> it's<00:05:09.430> the<00:05:09.550> biggest<00:05:09.880> part<00:05:10.120> of<00:05:10.270> the

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
is the base it's the biggest part of the

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
is the base it's the biggest part of the
TARDIS<00:05:10.980> it's<00:05:11.980> also<00:05:12.160> heavy<00:05:12.520> and<00:05:13.210> quite<00:05:14.110> awful

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
TARDIS it's also heavy and quite awful

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.560 
TARDIS it's also heavy and quite awful
to<00:05:14.530> carry<00:05:14.740> okay<00:05:15.700> this<00:05:15.910> is<00:05:16.060> where<00:05:16.270> it<00:05:16.360> gets

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
to carry okay this is where it gets

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:30.120 
to carry okay this is where it gets
tricky<00:05:28.050> will<00:05:29.050> you<00:05:29.170> be<00:05:29.290> making<00:05:29.440> more<00:05:29.710> TARDIS

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
tricky will you be making more TARDIS

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.910 
tricky will you be making more TARDIS
videos<00:05:30.520> I<00:05:30.790> will<00:05:31.540> show<00:05:31.930> you<00:05:32.200> the<00:05:32.470> interior<00:05:32.680> of

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
videos I will show you the interior of

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.320 
videos I will show you the interior of
the<00:05:33.010> TARDIS<00:05:33.160> I<00:05:33.460> have<00:05:33.670> to<00:05:33.790> finish<00:05:34.000> it

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
the TARDIS I have to finish it

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.930 
the TARDIS I have to finish it
but<00:05:34.690> now<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:34.900> TARDIS<00:05:35.350> is<00:05:35.560> moving<00:05:36.220> again<00:05:36.550> and

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
but now the TARDIS is moving again and

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.530 
but now the TARDIS is moving again and
being<00:05:37.900> a<00:05:38.290> family<00:05:38.770> I<00:05:39.010> can<00:05:39.430> finish<00:05:39.760> the<00:05:40.090> interior

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
being a family I can finish the interior

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.900 
being a family I can finish the interior
and<00:05:40.720> then<00:05:40.990> show<00:05:41.590> you<00:05:41.620> this<00:05:42.070> is<00:05:42.220> one<00:05:42.550> video

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
and then show you this is one video

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.400 
and then show you this is one video

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
which will be coming up yes yeah but is

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.180 
which will be coming up yes yeah but is
it<00:05:47.650> big<00:05:47.830> on<00:05:48.040> the<00:05:48.190> inside<00:05:49.260> yeah<00:05:50.260> obviously<00:05:50.470> it's

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
it big on the inside yeah obviously it's

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.400 
it big on the inside yeah obviously it's
a<00:05:51.310> TARDIS<00:05:51.700> you<00:05:51.940> know<00:05:52.450> that<00:05:52.630> technically<00:05:53.050> you

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
a TARDIS you know that technically you

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.870 
a TARDIS you know that technically you
build<00:05:53.650> a<00:05:53.890> police<00:05:54.190> phone<00:05:54.490> box

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
build a police phone box

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:03.090 
build a police phone box
I<00:05:56.730> built<00:05:57.730> the<00:05:58.150> TARDIS<00:05:58.900> I<00:06:01.020> know<00:06:02.020> the<00:06:02.500> TARDIS's

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
I built the TARDIS I know the TARDIS's

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:09.240 
I built the TARDIS I know the TARDIS's
are<00:06:03.280> grown<00:06:03.580> I<00:06:05.820> I<00:06:06.820> build<00:06:07.420> the<00:06:07.780> the<00:06:08.170> shell<00:06:08.440> for<00:06:09.190> it

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
are grown I I build the the shell for it

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.839 
are grown I I build the the shell for it
like<00:06:09.640> the<00:06:09.850> pot<00:06:11.160> containing

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.099 

there<00:06:15.629> we're<00:06:16.409> gonna<00:06:16.529> say<00:06:16.740> no<00:06:16.889> huh
