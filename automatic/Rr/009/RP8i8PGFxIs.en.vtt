00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.549 
router or modem so don't worry if it
looks<00:00:59.539> completely<00:00:59.899> different<00:01:00.140> to<00:01:00.440> this<00:01:00.999> then

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
looks completely different to this then

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.680 
looks completely different to this then
along<00:01:03.559> here<00:01:03.920> on<00:01:04.160> the<00:01:04.610> side<00:01:04.880> you<00:01:05.239> need<00:01:05.390> to<00:01:05.480> find

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
along here on the side you need to find

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.560 
along here on the side you need to find
NAT<00:01:05.960> or<00:01:06.470> port<00:01:07.040> forwarding<00:01:07.460> either<00:01:07.850> one<00:01:10.570> port

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.270 
NAT or port forwarding either one port
forwarding<00:01:11.930> right<00:01:12.440> and<00:01:12.680> then<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:13.010> want<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:13.190> go

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
forwarding right and then you want to go

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.450 
forwarding right and then you want to go
add<00:01:15.160> and<00:01:16.160> then<00:01:17.060> you<00:01:17.180> want<00:01:17.300> to<00:01:17.360> make<00:01:17.450> a<00:01:17.480> random

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
add and then you want to make a random

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.560 
add and then you want to make a random
custom<00:01:19.460> server<00:01:19.700> name<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.030> you<00:01:20.090> can<00:01:20.120> call<00:01:20.330> it

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
custom server name so you can call it

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:29.560 
custom server name so you can call it
black<00:01:20.960> ops<00:01:21.230> to<00:01:24.460> not<00:01:25.460> open<00:01:26.060> or<00:01:27.880> woo<00:01:28.910> whatever

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
black ops to not open or woo whatever

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.560 
black ops to not open or woo whatever
you<00:01:29.660> want<00:01:30.160> and<00:01:31.160> then<00:01:31.370> you<00:01:32.150> want<00:01:32.300> to<00:01:32.330> find<00:01:32.510> your

you want and then you want to find your

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.390 
you want and then you want to find your
server<00:01:32.780> IP<00:01:32.930> address<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:33.650> find<00:01:34.010> this<00:01:34.160> right

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
server IP address so to find this right

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.470 
server IP address so to find this right
you<00:01:34.940> press<00:01:35.180> windows<00:01:35.990> R<00:01:36.490> then<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.820> then<00:01:38.210> write

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
you press windows R then it then write

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.540 
you press windows R then it then write
CMD<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.260> press<00:01:39.290> ok<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:41.200> then<00:01:42.730> type<00:01:44.290> ipconfig

press<00:01:46.550> enter<00:01:47.140> then<00:01:48.140> you<00:01:48.230> want<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.500> ipv4

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
press enter then you want the ipv4

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.370 
press enter then you want the ipv4
address<00:01:50.120> so<00:01:50.390> it's<00:01:50.540> ten<00:01:50.750> point<00:01:50.990> one<00:01:51.050> point<00:01:51.290> one

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
address so it's ten point one point one

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.200 
address so it's ten point one point one
point<00:01:51.620> two<00:01:51.740> for<00:01:52.010> me<00:01:52.100> right<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:53.000> i'm<00:01:53.060> going<00:01:53.150> to

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
point two for me right so i'm going to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.520 
point two for me right so i'm going to
chuck<00:01:53.420> that<00:01:53.450> in<00:01:53.660> the<00:01:53.720> server<00:01:53.930> IP<00:01:54.110> address

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
chuck that in the server IP address

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.310 
chuck that in the server IP address
there<00:01:54.980> wherever<00:01:55.310> it<00:01:55.460> says<00:01:55.610> on<00:01:55.730> your<00:01:55.760> screen

for<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.010> protocol<00:02:04.460> you<00:02:04.550> want<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.730> all<00:02:04.940> make<00:02:05.180> it

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
for the protocol you want to all make it

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.680 
for the protocol you want to all make it
TCP<00:02:06.260> UDP<00:02:07.000> so<00:02:09.490> I'll<00:02:10.490> just<00:02:10.670> go<00:02:10.789> back

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
TCP UDP so I'll just go back

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.080 
TCP UDP so I'll just go back
a<00:02:11.780> step<00:02:12.470> there<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.160> are<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:13.760> that's<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:16.090> the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
a step there you are so that's the the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.150 
a step there you are so that's the the
start<00:02:17.390> port<00:02:17.630> in<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.810> import<00:02:18.170> for<00:02:18.800> each<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.100> one

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
start port in the import for each of one

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.660 
start port in the import for each of one
