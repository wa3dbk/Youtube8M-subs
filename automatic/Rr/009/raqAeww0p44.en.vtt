00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.900 
an analysis of Chanukah so actually it
was<00:00:18.650> all<00:00:18.770> the<00:00:18.920> talk<00:00:19.100> that's<00:00:19.340> been<00:00:19.460> going<00:00:19.669> on<00:00:19.789> at

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
was all the talk that's been going on at

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.790 
was all the talk that's been going on at
the<00:00:19.970> moment<00:00:20.150> and<00:00:20.359> I<00:00:20.480> believe<00:00:20.750> players<00:00:21.560> like

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
the moment and I believe players like

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.019 
the moment and I believe players like
full<00:00:22.039> war<00:00:22.220> coming<00:00:22.519> out<00:00:22.640> and<00:00:22.789> saying<00:00:22.970> that

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
full war coming out and saying that

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.310 
full war coming out and saying that
South<00:00:23.269> African<00:00:23.599> players<00:00:23.810> are<00:00:23.990> really<00:00:24.080> going

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
South African players are really going

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.829 
South African players are really going
to<00:00:24.410> suffer<00:00:24.740> with<00:00:25.490> the<00:00:25.820> new<00:00:25.999> interpretation<00:00:26.720> of

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:26.839 
to suffer with the new interpretation of

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:28.120 
to suffer with the new interpretation of
the<00:00:26.900> law<00:00:27.019> because<00:00:27.349> of<00:00:27.410> course<00:00:27.650> it's<00:00:27.800> not<00:00:27.829> a<00:00:27.980> new

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
the law because of course it's not a new

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.279 
the law because of course it's not a new
law<00:00:28.339> it's<00:00:29.179> just<00:00:29.419> that<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:29.749> referees<00:00:30.140> have

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
law it's just that the referees have

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.490 
law it's just that the referees have
been<00:00:30.439> asked<00:00:30.800> to<00:00:30.829> police<00:00:31.279> it<00:00:31.490> a<00:00:31.640> lot<00:00:31.789> stricter

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:18.450 
it why the wrong way I think there's no

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.360 
it why the wrong way I think there's no
reason<00:07:18.479> at<00:07:18.900> all<00:07:19.020> that<00:07:19.290> they're<00:07:19.410> desperate<00:07:19.770> off

the game should be penalized I think in

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.029 
the game should be penalized I think in
fact<00:07:23.400> that<00:07:24.240> got<00:07:24.810> with<00:07:25.200> hundreds<00:07:25.590> kills<00:07:25.830> over
