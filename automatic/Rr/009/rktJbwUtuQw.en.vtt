00:00:13.052 --> 00:00:19.638
Make sure your image has the right size and rotation.

00:00:22.044 --> 00:00:29.625
Let's place some registration marks so that the vinyl can be peeled off more easily later on.

00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:35.852
First, select a color.

00:00:36.464 --> 00:00:42.583
In this case, a couple of weeding lines could be useful.

00:00:46.457 --> 00:00:48.902
Insert the vinyl.

00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:54.180
Start the cut out!

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:12.761
Time for the second color.

00:01:20.395 --> 00:01:22.868
Cut out!

00:01:39.407 --> 00:01:41.844
Peel off the vinyl.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.560
Put on the application tape.

00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:41.635
Attach the image to the sign.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.811
Remove the application tape.

00:02:58.457 --> 00:03:03.849
Use the registration marks to get the right placement!

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.351
Remove the registration marks and you're done!

00:03:22.248 --> 00:03:24.851
Good luck!
