although da feed is darth vader and he

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.600 
although da feed is darth vader and he
suits<00:02:22.050> any<00:02:22.170> purpose<00:02:22.590> for<00:02:22.770> me<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.250> just

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
suits any purpose for me this is just

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.010 
suits any purpose for me this is just
one<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:23.940> those<00:02:24.410> all-purpose<00:02:25.410> darth<00:02:25.740> vader's

one of those all-purpose darth vader's

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.510 
one of those all-purpose darth vader's
so<00:02:28.020> let's<00:02:28.140> take<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.380> look<00:02:28.590> at<00:02:28.680> him<00:02:28.800> analyst<00:02:29.220> as

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
so let's take a look at him analyst as

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.310 
so let's take a look at him analyst as
always<00:02:29.850> do<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.360> 1080<00:02:30.960> p<00:02:31.200> HD<00:02:31.500> zoom<00:02:32.190> on<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.490> one

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
always do a 1080 p HD zoom on this one

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.650 
always do a 1080 p HD zoom on this one
so<00:02:34.320> I<00:02:34.350> said<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.730> best<00:02:36.000> Vader<00:02:36.330> ever

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
so I said this is the best Vader ever

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.990 
so I said this is the best Vader ever
made<00:02:37.050> in<00:02:37.230> my<00:02:37.260> opinion<00:02:37.700> it'll<00:02:38.700> be<00:02:38.760> interesting

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
made in my opinion it'll be interesting

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.090 
made in my opinion it'll be interesting
to<00:02:39.330> see<00:02:39.480> whether<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.870> 6-inch<00:02:40.350> version<00:02:40.770> tops

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
to see whether the 6-inch version tops

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.880 
to see whether the 6-inch version tops
it<00:02:42.170> first<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.320> formost

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
it first and formost

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.310 
it first and formost
that<00:02:44.220> helmet<00:02:44.550> sculpt<00:02:45.380> that<00:02:46.380> is<00:02:46.620> just<00:02:47.520> awesome

some brand new sculpting but for the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.390 
some brand new sculpting but for the
