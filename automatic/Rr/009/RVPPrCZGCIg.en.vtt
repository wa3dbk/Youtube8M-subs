this<00:00:07.960> is<00:00:08.170> the<00:00:08.349> fixture<00:00:08.860> old<00:00:09.280> mountain<00:00:09.760> helmet

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:10.269 
this is the fixture old mountain helmet

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.890 
this is the fixture old mountain helmet
specially<00:00:11.260> made<00:00:11.410> for<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:12.730> new<00:00:12.940> generation<00:00:13.840> of

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
specially made for the new generation of

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.269 
specially made for the new generation of
mountain<00:00:14.200> bikes<00:00:14.379> where<00:00:14.740> you<00:00:14.830> have<00:00:14.980> a<00:00:15.010> lot<00:00:15.250> of

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:15.279 
mountain bikes where you have a lot of

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.460 
mountain bikes where you have a lot of
suspension<00:00:15.910> travel<00:00:15.940> and<00:00:16.449> you<00:00:16.570> tend<00:00:17.050> to<00:00:17.230> grow<00:00:17.440> a

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
suspension travel and you tend to grow a

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.920 
suspension travel and you tend to grow a
lot<00:00:17.650> faster<00:00:17.710> than<00:00:18.430> you<00:00:18.580> used<00:00:18.730> to<00:00:18.910> do<00:00:19.029> so<00:00:19.810> this

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
lot faster than you used to do so this

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.080 
lot faster than you used to do so this
is<00:00:19.960> basically<00:00:20.199> what's<00:00:20.710> in<00:00:21.010> between<00:00:21.130> a<00:00:21.400> regular

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
is basically what's in between a regular

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.560 
is basically what's in between a regular
mount<00:00:22.630> bike<00:00:22.840> helmet<00:00:23.230> and<00:00:23.380> the<00:00:23.590> download<00:00:24.570> it

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
mount bike helmet and the download it

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.640 
mount bike helmet and the download it
has<00:00:25.720> a<00:00:26.140> bladder<00:00:26.440> molded<00:00:26.920> carbon<00:00:27.910> fiber<00:00:28.150> shell

has a bladder molded carbon fiber shell

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.930 
has a bladder molded carbon fiber shell
which<00:00:29.650> is<00:00:29.800> super<00:00:29.949> strong<00:00:30.280> it's<00:00:30.490> basically<00:00:30.820> the

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:30.940 
which is super strong it's basically the

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.319 
which is super strong it's basically the

surface area in critical areas you also
have<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.100> MIPS<00:01:03.600> system<00:01:04.600> which<00:01:04.930> is<00:01:05.079> this

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
have the MIPS system which is this

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.789 
have the MIPS system which is this
system<00:01:07.210> right<00:01:07.390> here<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:08.350> what<00:01:08.560> it<00:01:08.649> does<00:01:08.680> is

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
system right here and what it does is

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.880 
system right here and what it does is
that<00:01:09.100> it<00:01:09.159> will<00:01:09.750> reduce<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:10.930> strain<00:01:11.320> on<00:01:11.560> your
