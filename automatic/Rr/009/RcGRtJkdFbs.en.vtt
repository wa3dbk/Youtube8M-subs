really that was awkward I really like
both<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.650> textures<00:00:26.430> it's<00:00:26.730> like<00:00:26.939> it's<00:00:27.689> got<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.209 
used before and I recognize um I think
I'll<00:00:33.210> freely<00:00:33.510> craft<00:00:33.989> or<00:00:34.260> read<00:00:34.649> craft<00:00:35.010> is

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
I'll freely craft or read craft is

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.729 
I'll freely craft or read craft is
included<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.660> some<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
included in this like some of the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.610 
included in this like some of the
textures<00:00:38.219> because<00:00:38.370> they<00:00:38.610> seem<00:00:38.820> pretty<00:00:38.940> summer

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
textures because they seem pretty summer

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.729 
textures because they seem pretty summer
then<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.710> could<00:00:40.860> oak<00:00:41.960> spruce<00:00:42.960> perch<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
then we could oak spruce perch and

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.319 
then we could oak spruce perch and
jungle<00:00:44.309> wood<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.120> same

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
jungle wood and we have it in the same

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.229 
jungle wood and we have it in the same
water<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:46.070> with<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.399> Wolves<00:00:47.850> which<00:00:48.120> I

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
water here with the Wolves which I

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
didn't put down every color because you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.740 
didn't put down every color because you
could<00:00:50.399> just<00:00:50.550> imagine<00:00:50.820> what<00:00:51.180> each<00:00:51.300> guy<00:00:51.570> let's

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750

could just imagine what each guy let's
go<00:00:51.930> look<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.350> um<00:00:53.239> he's<00:00:54.239> all<00:00:54.620> zeros<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.980> I'm<00:00:56.309> I

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
go look like um he's all zeros and I'm I

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.080 
go look like um he's all zeros and I'm I
really<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.360> how<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.770> know<00:00:58.920> lapis<00:00:59.489> has<00:00:59.699> more

but<00:04:38.660> that's<00:04:38.780> what<00:04:39.020> it<00:04:39.110> looks<00:04:39.320> like<00:04:39.530> when<00:04:40.190> you

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
but that's what it looks like when you

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.830 
but that's what it looks like when you
place<00:04:40.520> it<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:42.560> that's<00:04:42.770> what<00:04:42.890> the<00:04:43.840> apparently

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
place it and that's what the apparently

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.100 
place it and that's what the apparently
I<00:04:44.900> just<00:04:45.110> duplicated<00:04:45.770> my<00:04:45.920> level<00:04:46.930> that's<00:04:47.930> what

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
I just duplicated my level that's what

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:57.040 
I just duplicated my level that's what
the<00:04:48.230> lava<00:04:48.590> looks<00:04:48.890> like<00:04:49.100> I<00:04:50.290> yeah<00:04:55.870> Dorian<00:04:56.870> did

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
the lava looks like I yeah Dorian did

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.780 
the lava looks like I yeah Dorian did
that<00:04:57.200> on<00:04:57.830> purpose<00:04:57.860> um<00:05:00.010> these<00:05:01.010> swords<00:05:01.490> they

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
that on purpose um these swords they

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.420 
that on purpose um these swords they
look<00:05:02.030> kind<00:05:02.660> of<00:05:02.780> like<00:05:02.870> default<00:05:03.410> but<00:05:03.830> just<00:05:04.310> like

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
look kind of like default but just like

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.570 
look kind of like default but just like
the<00:05:04.580> books<00:05:04.790> cleaned<00:05:05.240> up<00:05:06.250> I'm<00:05:07.250> pretty<00:05:07.490> sure

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
the books cleaned up I'm pretty sure

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.460 
the books cleaned up I'm pretty sure
they<00:05:07.700> might<00:05:07.940> be<00:05:08.090> a<00:05:08.120> little<00:05:08.270> bit<00:05:08.450> thinner<00:05:11.470> can't

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
they might be a little bit thinner can't

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.560 
they might be a little bit thinner can't
exactly<00:05:12.710> tell<00:05:13.250> without<00:05:13.940> looking<00:05:14.420> at<00:05:14.450> the

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
exactly tell without looking at the

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.200 
exactly tell without looking at the
default<00:05:14.870> ones<00:05:15.080> but<00:05:15.320> this<00:05:15.500> is<00:05:15.620> what<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:16.210> bow

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
default ones but this is what the bow

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.650 
default ones but this is what the bow
looks<00:05:17.420> like<00:05:17.660> fully<00:05:18.050> drawn<00:05:18.760> it<00:05:19.760> doesn't<00:05:20.180> like<00:05:20.480> I

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
looks like fully drawn it doesn't like I

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.960 
looks like fully drawn it doesn't like I
like<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:21.140> PvP<00:05:21.770> browse<00:05:22.100> where<00:05:22.430> they<00:05:22.550> like<00:05:22.760> have

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
like the PvP browse where they like have

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.810 
like the PvP browse where they like have
like<00:05:23.470> different<00:05:24.470> colors<00:05:24.980> with<00:05:25.220> the<00:05:25.250> users

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
like different colors with the users

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.640 
like different colors with the users
still<00:05:26.150> like<00:05:26.450> this<00:05:26.600> one's<00:05:26.840> really<00:05:27.050> cool<00:05:27.320> and

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
still like this one's really cool and

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.140 
still like this one's really cool and
when<00:05:27.800> you<00:05:27.890> saw<00:05:28.100> the<00:05:28.160> arrows<00:05:28.610> should<00:05:28.820> offer<00:05:28.970> had

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
when you saw the arrows should offer had

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.750 
when you saw the arrows should offer had
like<00:05:29.330> a<00:05:29.360> bull<00:05:29.690> ooh<00:05:30.460> um<00:05:32.620> what's<00:05:33.620> icon<00:05:34.010> will<00:05:34.580> that

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
like a bull ooh um what's icon will that

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.950 
like a bull ooh um what's icon will that
be<00:05:34.850> cool<00:05:35.000> I'm<00:05:35.150> not<00:05:35.270> sure<00:05:35.330> what<00:05:35.570> that's<00:05:35.660> cool

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
be cool I'm not sure what that's cool

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.550 
be cool I'm not sure what that's cool
but<00:05:36.169> yeah<00:05:37.040> that's<00:05:37.340> most<00:05:38.090> of<00:05:38.390> the<00:05:38.540> blocks<00:05:39.050> and

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
but yeah that's most of the blocks and

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.880 
but yeah that's most of the blocks and
you<00:05:39.950> know<00:05:40.850> you've<00:05:41.000> got<00:05:41.169> and<00:05:42.169> I<00:05:42.410> creative

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
you know you've got and I creative

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:50.980 
you know you've got and I creative
anymore<00:05:45.130> we've<00:05:46.130> got<00:05:46.960> food<00:05:48.220> like<00:05:49.220> these<00:05:50.180> I'm

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
anymore we've got food like these I'm

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.580 
anymore we've got food like these I'm
pretty<00:05:51.260> sure<00:05:51.350> that<00:05:51.710> is<00:05:52.070> so<00:05:52.940> the<00:05:53.590> default

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
pretty sure that is so the default

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.230 
pretty sure that is so the default
because<00:05:54.800> I<00:05:54.980> don't<00:05:55.280> think<00:05:55.490> the<00:05:55.700> texture<00:05:56.060> pack

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
because I don't think the texture pack

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.980 
because I don't think the texture pack
is<00:05:56.419> updated<00:05:56.990> to<00:05:57.040> 1.7<00:05:58.040> besides<00:05:58.460> the<00:05:58.990> clave

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
is updated to 1.7 besides the clave

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.439 
is updated to 1.7 besides the clave
looks<00:06:01.030> yeah

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:04.449 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:06.689 

so<00:06:05.169> pretty<00:06:05.349> much<00:06:05.469> if<00:06:05.770> you<00:06:06.099> want<00:06:06.340> to<00:06:06.430> see<00:06:06.580> the

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
so pretty much if you want to see the

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:07.890 
so pretty much if you want to see the
texture<00:06:06.969> pack<00:06:07.150> you<00:06:07.270> can<00:06:07.300> try<00:06:07.599> it<00:06:07.659> out<00:06:07.779> for

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
texture pack you can try it out for

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.379 
texture pack you can try it out for
yourself<00:06:07.990> and<00:06:08.469> you<00:06:08.529> can<00:06:08.680> just<00:06:08.889> see<00:06:09.099> you<00:06:09.400> know

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
yourself and you can just see you know

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:16.339 
yourself and you can just see you know
like<00:06:10.419> you've<00:06:10.809> got<00:06:11.879> pretty<00:06:12.879> cool<00:06:14.460> particles

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
like you've got pretty cool particles

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:20.070 
like you've got pretty cool particles
that<00:06:17.349> sounds<00:06:17.770> annoying<00:06:17.949> um<00:06:18.779> see<00:06:19.779> that's

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
that sounds annoying um see that's

that sounds annoying um see that's
probably<00:06:20.710> the<00:06:20.979> end<00:06:21.159> of<00:06:21.339> this<00:06:22.169> dad<00:06:24.330> hang<00:06:25.330> up<00:06:25.449> I
