00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
three other pairs of scarp us in the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.190 
three other pairs of scarp us in the
same<00:02:39.100> size<00:02:39.400> so<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:40.030> I<00:02:40.090> had<00:02:40.240> some<00:02:40.540> faith<00:02:40.840> in<00:02:40.870> that

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
same size so so I had some faith in that

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.790 
same size so so I had some faith in that
and<00:02:41.470> they<00:02:42.250> do<00:02:42.310> fit<00:02:42.700> well<00:02:43.200> when<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.230> first<00:02:44.290> got

and they do fit well when I first got

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.420 
and they do fit well when I first got
them<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:45.310> felt<00:02:45.850> like<00:02:45.940> they're<00:02:46.270> really<00:02:46.660> long<00:02:47.020> and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
them I felt like they're really long and

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.740 
them I felt like they're really long and
I<00:02:48.430> felt<00:02:48.730> like<00:02:48.820> there's<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.060> lot<00:02:49.209> of<00:02:49.270> toe<00:02:49.510> room

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
I felt like there's a lot of toe room

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.690 
I felt like there's a lot of toe room
and<00:02:49.930> I'm<00:02:49.990> as<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.770> kind<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.040> broke<00:02:51.220> in<00:02:51.430> some

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
and I'm as it kind of broke in some

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.490 
and I'm as it kind of broke in some
that's<00:02:51.910> gone<00:02:52.120> away<00:02:52.390> I've<00:02:52.959> heard<00:02:53.200> some

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
that's gone away I've heard some

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.780 
that's gone away I've heard some
complaints<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.070> you<00:02:54.160> can't<00:02:54.340> really<00:02:54.550> get<00:02:54.670> the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
complaints that you can't really get the

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.370 
complaints that you can't really get the
laces<00:02:55.240> tight<00:02:55.450> enough<00:02:55.720> or<00:02:55.959> when<00:02:56.080> you're<00:02:56.200> going

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
laces tight enough or when you're going

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.180 
laces tight enough or when you're going
downhill<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:58.510> guess<00:02:59.200> I<00:02:59.350> could<00:02:59.530> see<00:02:59.740> that<00:02:59.920> I

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
downhill I guess I could see that I

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.060 
downhill I guess I could see that I
haven't<00:03:00.640> had<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:00.880> trouble<00:03:01.180> yet<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.709> for<00:03:02.920> me

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
haven't had that trouble yet and for me

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.560 
haven't had that trouble yet and for me
these<00:03:03.310> are<00:03:03.370> pretty<00:03:03.790> light<00:03:03.970> food<00:03:04.209> I<00:03:04.239> wouldn't

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
these are pretty light food I wouldn't

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.479 
these are pretty light food I wouldn't
really<00:03:04.660> carry<00:03:04.959> more<00:03:05.140> than<00:03:05.200> 35<00:03:05.709> 40<00:03:06.040> pounds<00:03:06.370> with

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
really carry more than 35 40 pounds with

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.870 
really carry more than 35 40 pounds with
these<00:03:07.680> so<00:03:08.680> I<00:03:08.709> imagine<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.459> know<00:03:09.550> if<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:09.760> had<00:03:09.850> a

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
these so I imagine you know if you had a

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.240 
these so I imagine you know if you had a
heavier<00:03:10.209> pack<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.660> whatnot<00:03:11.080> you<00:03:11.680> could<00:03:12.130> run

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
heavier pack and whatnot you could run

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.280 
heavier pack and whatnot you could run
into<00:03:12.400> some<00:03:12.640> problems<00:03:12.670> but<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.600> don't<00:03:13.989> foresee

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
into some problems but I don't foresee

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.660 
into some problems but I don't foresee
any<00:03:14.320> problem<00:03:14.860> with<00:03:14.950> these<00:03:15.070> in<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.370> future<00:03:15.570> I

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
any problem with these in the future I

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.640 
any problem with these in the future I
like<00:03:18.670> all<00:03:18.910> my<00:03:19.209> boots<00:03:19.450> have<00:03:19.720> pulled<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.200> super

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
feet pulled out the inserts fact I'll

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.390 
feet pulled out the inserts fact I'll
kind<00:03:23.410> of<00:03:23.470> show<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.830> other<00:03:23.950> inserts<00:03:24.310> that

were<00:03:24.580> in<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:27.989> as<00:03:28.989> is<00:03:29.230> common<00:03:29.650> in<00:03:29.739> most<00:03:29.890> boot

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
were in it and as is common in most boot

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.690 
were in it and as is common in most boot
companies<00:03:30.700> they<00:03:31.030> have<00:03:31.209> something<00:03:31.660> like<00:03:31.810> this

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
companies they have something like this

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.100 
companies they have something like this
yeah<00:03:33.700> I<00:03:33.730> imagine<00:03:33.850> it's<00:03:34.330> they<00:03:34.780> can't

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110
