this that tiles nicely I also need to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.770 
this that tiles nicely I also need to
add<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.100> roughness<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:39.149> well<00:00:39.390> placed

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
add in this roughness it's well placed

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.110 
add in this roughness it's well placed
but<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> bricks<00:00:40.440> themselves<00:00:41.100> are<00:00:41.250> maybe<00:00:41.850> not

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
but the bricks themselves are maybe not

give<00:05:57.340> me<00:05:57.490> when<00:05:57.610> I<00:05:57.639> fill<00:05:58.030> it<00:05:58.180> a<00:05:58.300> slightly

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
give me when I fill it a slightly

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.839 
give me when I fill it a slightly
different<00:05:59.200> feel<00:05:59.979> to<00:06:00.280> these<00:06:00.490> particular

different feel to these particular

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:03.450 
different feel to these particular
bricks<00:06:01.330> I'll<00:06:02.260> also<00:06:02.530> add<00:06:02.830> in<00:06:02.979> more<00:06:03.130> color

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
bricks I'll also add in more color

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.700 
bricks I'll also add in more color
variation<00:06:04.020> so<00:06:05.020> we<00:06:05.080> look<00:06:05.289> at<00:06:05.410> a<00:06:05.440> wall

slightly offset from each other
vertically<00:06:46.990> as<00:06:47.110> well<00:06:48.060> I've<00:06:49.060> gone<00:06:49.330> through<00:06:49.390> my

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
vertically as well I've gone through my

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.840 
vertically as well I've gone through my
brick<00:06:49.930> wall<00:06:50.110> selecting<00:06:51.010> each<00:06:51.190> color<00:06:51.520> on<00:06:51.730> the

brick wall selecting each color on the
background<00:06:52.300> layer<00:06:52.390> and<00:06:53.100> refining<00:06:54.100> the<00:06:54.340> edge

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
background layer and refining the edge

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.460 
background layer and refining the edge
and<00:06:54.760> then<00:06:55.030> filling<00:06:55.360> that<00:06:55.630> selection<00:06:56.110> with

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
and then filling that selection with

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.830 
and then filling that selection with
clouds<00:06:56.860> phasing<00:06:57.850> between<00:06:58.150> various<00:06:58.600> brick

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
clouds phasing between various brick

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.570 
clouds phasing between various brick
colors<00:06:59.200> from<00:06:59.500> actually<00:06:59.830> fairly<00:07:00.100> dark<00:07:00.430> to

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
colors from actually fairly dark to

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.070 
colors from actually fairly dark to
fairly<00:07:00.790> light<00:07:01.090> so<00:07:01.420> have<00:07:01.510> some<00:07:01.690> good<00:07:01.810> variation

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 
fairly light so have some good variation

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.590 
fairly light so have some good variation
on<00:07:02.380> the<00:07:02.470> wall<00:07:02.620> I've<00:07:03.400> also<00:07:03.670> used<00:07:03.910> my<00:07:04.090> arrow<00:07:04.300> keys

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:04.600 
on the wall I've also used my arrow keys

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.170 
on the wall I've also used my arrow keys
to<00:07:04.630> nudge<00:07:05.020> the<00:07:05.260> bricks<00:07:05.500> up<00:07:05.710> and<00:07:06.010> down<00:07:06.190> that<00:07:06.970> way

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180 
to nudge the bricks up and down that way

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.780 
to nudge the bricks up and down that way
I<00:07:07.210> get<00:07:07.570> a<00:07:07.750> little<00:07:08.140> bit<00:07:08.260> of<00:07:08.410> odds<00:07:08.710> facing<00:07:09.490> they

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:09.790 
I get a little bit of odds facing they

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.610 
I get a little bit of odds facing they
weren't<00:07:10.000> put<00:07:10.180> in<00:07:10.300> as<00:07:10.450> nicely<00:07:10.960> they<00:07:11.200> still<00:07:11.440> work

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:11.620 
weren't put in as nicely they still work

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.680 
weren't put in as nicely they still work
just<00:07:11.650> fine<00:07:12.100> but<00:07:12.370> they<00:07:12.790> slip<00:07:13.150> a<00:07:13.270> little<00:07:13.390> bit

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:13.690 
just fine but they slip a little bit

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.380 
just fine but they slip a little bit
lastly<00:07:14.650> I'll<00:07:15.250> put<00:07:15.610> in<00:07:15.730> a<00:07:15.820> mortar<00:07:16.180> layer

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:16.390 
lastly I'll put in a mortar layer

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.900 
lastly I'll put in a mortar layer
underneath<00:07:17.050> all<00:07:17.350> my<00:07:17.530> other<00:07:17.680> layers<00:07:18.010> filling

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:18.910 
underneath all my other layers filling

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.210 
underneath all my other layers filling
this<00:07:19.030> mortar<00:07:19.420> in<00:07:19.660> probably<00:07:20.470> just<00:07:20.680> a<00:07:20.770> decent

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:21.220 
this mortar in probably just a decent

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.780 
this mortar in probably just a decent
concrete<00:07:21.700> gray<00:07:22.740> fairly<00:07:23.740> warm<00:07:24.010> my<00:07:24.400> hue<00:07:24.640> will

concrete gray fairly warm my hue will

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.610 
concrete gray fairly warm my hue will
swing<00:07:25.060> actually<00:07:25.480> into<00:07:25.720> the<00:07:25.810> red<00:07:25.990> oranges<00:07:26.440> and

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:26.620 
swing actually into the red oranges and

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:31.890 
swing actually into the red oranges and
a<00:07:26.830> very<00:07:27.040> low<00:07:27.250> saturation<00:07:28.060> I<00:07:30.510> fill<00:07:31.510> that<00:07:31.540> in

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:31.900 
a very low saturation I fill that in
