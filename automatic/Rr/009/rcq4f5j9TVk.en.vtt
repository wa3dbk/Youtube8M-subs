00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.509
Hi, through this video
&nbsp;I'll show you how to have a

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.179
current version of the system
android operating

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.749
&nbsp;in an old cell

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.559
in this case I will

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:15.939
show you how

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.179
to use or to

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:23.060
install an updated version of android
in a telephone captivate

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.730
the first thing you have to do is
go to the page

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.339
xda developers

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.710
more explicitly to this forum
page

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.970
and go to the tab "All"

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.970
the it will appear to us all the
devices

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.950
within this tab

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.710
let's find our device

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.110
In the example I'm going to show
for the captivate SGH-I897.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.220
Select

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.920
this tab and go to

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.810
what is the

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.360
Captivate Android Development page
0:01:07.360,0:01:10.520
Once you click on this tab

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.960
it will now appear the next

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.940
window.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.920
I'll show you one version
I've had more stable

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.740
For new

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.100
android versions, which is the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.980
CyanogenMod

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.050
They are already referring v10.1
what is the android 4.2.2

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.830
and

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.030
Well with that version is

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.730
With which I have been tested

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.440
So we go to the following link,
we click in that

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.330
and we are going to look the following window.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.250
In this window

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.940
we have

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.050
two links to download

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.560
the first is the software itself and the
second is the Google apps.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.740
We click on the two windows to
download.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.199
Then it will appear the following tabs

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.069
and always

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.870
as the first link will appear the
latest version

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.449
of android that they have
developed,

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:21.229
so proceed to download

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:22.939
the file

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.849
in this case weighs 157.45 MB

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.130
and what is the Google Apps so
proceed to download

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.219
If it doesn't download automatically

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.109
We click

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.349
this link,

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.139
and will proceed to download

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.369
the application of Google

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:45.999
for that version of android.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.559
Once we

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:52.529
have the files

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:56.309
in the computer,

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.219
what we have to do is to

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.649
Copy these files

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:03.640
in the internal memory

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.389
of the cellphone.

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:12.559
Once we copy the files in the
Internal memory of the cellphone;

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.409
Through

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.709
an application called AirDroid

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.859
I'll show my cellphone screen.

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.769
Through this application

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.219
I will be able to show what is
the screen

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:53.219
of the cellphone in which I'm doing the test.

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.899
Then we have to download the application called "Rom Manager"

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:06.509
known also as ClockworkMod,

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:11.029
we click on this application for
restart the phone

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:13.869
In recovery mode.

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:16.499
This is important to install

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:20.709
the. zips that you downloaded.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.939
We click reboot into recovery

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:29.590
And we will accept.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.090
Once we have done that

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.849
it will appear

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.180
Several options

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.020
we have to pay in English

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.259
to do whatever we want with the phone.

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:48.550
One option is to install .zip files

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.729
within

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.389
cellular telephone.

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.210
What we will do is to seek first the
. zip file that references the version 10.1 of the cyanogenmod

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.050
and we will proceed to install it.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.300
Then We will proceed to restart the cellphone again

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.449
That is, we first have to clean both cachÃ©s,

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:14.309
an do a full wipe of the phone,

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:18.620
so that there is no error
and proceed with the installation

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.180
the application that I mentioned is
the cyanogenmod.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.949
once we have installed it, we will
ask for a reboot, this is normal

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.150
And be lifted

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.889
all the android operating system in the cell.

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.249
Once we have done that

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:42.309
let's go back to the Rom Manager application

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:44.400
And we will

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.529
Reboot the phone in recovery mode once again.

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:51.539
Then we will proceed to install the applications of
Google.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.979
Normally

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.839
you have to do that to make it work
perfectly

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:03.059
the applications of google for this
android version is amended,

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:07.629
because I have been tested with earlier versions,
and sometimes can not run or

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:09.469
there are some flaws in the system.

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.869
So better to download the two files and

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:16.490
install them on the phone.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.810
Later I'll give you a link
so all I'm saying they

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.599
writing appears

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:24.400
and having

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.379
a clearer understanding of everything

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:30.520
I mean in this video.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.610
Sorry for

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.870
Talking a little slow and lock me sometimes,
but it is the first time I make

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.279
a video like this.

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:41.389
I hope this serve you

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:44.309
and it helps to have more knowledge about it

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.300
And spread all this. Thank you.
