out of these times we take the children
of<00:03:42.560> our<00:03:43.560> enemy<00:03:44.070> which<00:03:44.460> is<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.790> white<00:03:45.000> lace<00:03:45.270> and

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
of our enemy which is the white lace and

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.170 
of our enemy which is the white lace and
we<00:03:46.710> bring<00:03:46.980> them<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.460> basements<00:03:47.970> in<00:03:48.060> the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
we bring them to the basements in the

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.940 
we bring them to the basements in the
synagogue's<00:03:48.720> where<00:03:49.620> we<00:03:50.060> drain<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.090> blood<00:03:51.420> and

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
synagogue's where we drain the blood and

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.980 
synagogue's where we drain the blood and
watch<00:03:52.950> them<00:03:53.190> die<00:03:53.430> there<00:03:53.730> it's<00:03:54.270> very<00:03:54.450> similar

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
watch them die there it's very similar

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.440 
watch them die there it's very similar
to<00:03:55.140> how<00:03:55.440> we<00:03:55.500> do<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:58.910> sacrifices<00:03:59.910> that<00:03:59.940> we<00:04:00.240> do

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
to how we do the sacrifices that we do

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.040 
to how we do the sacrifices that we do
with<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.870> kosher<00:04:01.500> butchering<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.690> so<00:04:03.690> we<00:04:03.870> do

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
with the kosher butchering and so we do

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.200 
with the kosher butchering and so we do
that<00:04:04.320> and<00:04:04.740> then<00:04:05.190> now<00:04:05.460> we<00:04:05.520> mix<00:04:05.820> it<00:04:05.970> with<00:04:06.180> a

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
that and then now we mix it with a

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.690 
that and then now we mix it with a
Passover<00:04:06.900> bread<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.590> so<00:04:07.890> eat<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.340> blood<00:04:08.550> of

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
Passover bread and so eat the blood of

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.900 
Passover bread and so eat the blood of
our<00:04:08.850> enemies<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:10.260> bodies<00:04:10.700> were<00:04:11.700> not

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
our enemies and the bodies were not

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.080 
our enemies and the bodies were not
cannibals<00:04:12.480> so<00:04:13.320> what<00:04:13.860> we<00:04:14.070> do<00:04:14.280> is<00:04:14.310> we<00:04:14.610> take<00:04:14.820> those

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
cannibals so what we do is we take those

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.210 
cannibals so what we do is we take those
because<00:04:15.390> we<00:04:15.540> can<00:04:15.720> make<00:04:15.870> some<00:04:16.080> shekels<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:16.800> we

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220
