00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello you love today I show you 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.580
 due to lacking tsl as i missed you 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.519
 created this look with one 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.840
 Zipper latex and a lot of blood 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.269
 let's start time to 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.040
 First I have the dacian and powder 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.089
 Applied to a smooth skin 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.440
 to obtain 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.529
 then I have a zipper 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.020
 Taken the cut and on my 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.779
 left eye adapted to then the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.910
 Tantalum pen rimmed the other eye 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.250
 probably not the zipper should be 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.510
 I then make-up with smokey eyes 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.510
 you can see that here now 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.330
 I then have my eyelet on 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.150
 end with gray emphasizes this 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.190
 to make it a bit more intense 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.610
 say a little bit darker 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.610
 it's like this 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.510
 then I have everything beautifully blinded 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.510
 with a bright tone 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.090
 I still have my eyebrows 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.580
 then I have my eyelashes 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.810
 showered and black kohl on mine 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.810
 Waterline applied 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.610
 but of course not missing 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.160
 He has the eyes even then has the eye 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.030
 so outlined and the look for that eye 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.030
 done perfectly 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.830
 so now comes the interesting part i 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.850
 I brought glue in writing and 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.220
 have him on my eyebrows 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.790
 applied and then dried it 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.619
 left and then with a 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.360
 clear brother saved that must 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.340
 you definitely do because otherwise 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.650
 So this is where you come from 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.479
 latex and the latex would you guys like that 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.790
 tear out the hairs of the eyebrow 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.130
 please do not so please two to 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.690
 apply three layers of glue and 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.570
 then always from brother then looks like this 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.009
 the funny but rather after 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.289
 the make-up tutorial one more 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.930
 Eyebrow have as small looks 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.259
 stupid out but i know for sure 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.869
 for sure 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.420
 then I have paper tissues and 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.610
 cotton pads bit torn that comes 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.120
 then step on with latex 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.790
 this area of wm where the 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.260
 zipper and now comes one 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.959
 I then applied a little latex 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.850
 and that with an old brushing everywhere 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.150
 spread that is a bit right now 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.220
 Soja is still important, the brush 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.860
 The brush you can completely gone 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.750
 just throw cheap so take brush 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.519
 So packing for an application is only 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.340
 so not the most expensive now 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.470
 Use sigma brush as you see 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.410
 I can then the handkerchief of 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.970
 applied and since then more about it 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.360
 a layer of latex made that way 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.360
 gets hard 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.840
 it looks a bit strange then 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.370
 but that's all I have then 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.750
 Taken a pair of tweezers and 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.610
 then a scissor where I am 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.560
 then a few increases 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.920
 have cleansed in which I as the mood 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.220
 have done and pulled a little bit 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.220
 you see there 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.340
 then I have mine 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.560
 black color so theatrical make-up 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.240
 taken and my eye edged that must 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.010
 not perfect now that's all 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.570
 still afterwards I have my foundation 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.940
 taken again that also a swam 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.910
 done and the white area practically 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.320
 in the color of my skin adapted so 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.060
 now the step comes naturally 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.400
 my camera did not record what 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.920
 I'm incredibly sorry but I have 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.760
 black eyeshadow taken red 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.910
 eyeshadow brown eyeshadow 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.470
 black lipstick last longer bright 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.670
 red lipstick and double 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.910
 lipsticks I have everything there 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.810
 still spread a little art blood 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.730
 everything on it I would say 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.200
 does not have to be perfect like that 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.510
 zipper thereby lashes glue 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.140
 on it and pasted on now 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.730
 I still have a black one 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.590
 Eyeshadow on a blender brush 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.530
 done and thus the transitions to mine 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.430
 skin to blind so that such a 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.430
 looks a little older 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.360
 As I said, that's not all 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.230
 neat but a wound is too 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:20.380
 not and that's how you see it 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:22.720
 everything on it then of course for a long time 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.490
 eyelash but only for the part of the well-being 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.820
 make- up that are incredible 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.340
 long and very funny so the eye on 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.840
 keep it open but it works and 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:37.350
 I am the eyelashes complete the look 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.750
 so it would look from the batting 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.040
 then the lower eyelashes are showered 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.040
 and went through the upper again 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.330
 I am very sorry that I am with this 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.750
 the song did not record that is 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.919
 actually the most important but if they are 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.240
 you still ask me can you like 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.340
 Write now we come to the last 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.870
 step and that is lipstick to it 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.860
 I first applied concealer and 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.080
 then a nude color 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.240
 lipstick i have chosen for a very 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.050
 bright and he dead lip decided one 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.970
 would like to watch 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.280
 that was actually already the case 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.680
 Look that will come soon 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.669
 even the hair combed a hat 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.510
 set up and a bit there august 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.370
