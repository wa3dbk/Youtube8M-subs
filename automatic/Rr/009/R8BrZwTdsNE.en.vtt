 the circle of sand land is what he 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.810
 makes for his redemption of 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.899
 remembering the childhood traumas and to 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.259
 all the inner monsters and this is a 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.469
 Papicu father neighborhood is already taken to 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.729

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.590
 So I'll show you this one in Italy. 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.209
 parent in a track that the why is the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.060
 second in the series and we already have a 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:12.299
 second personal looks is very good game 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.090
 next you with all that you play is 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:18.989
 online mail was died 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:23.099
 take all your advancement is the game itself 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:26.700
 sister if you pick up the truck 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:30.599
 that I have a complicated situation with the 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.170
 pump boot still ran for everything and 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:38.519
 everybody advances I have nothing then 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:42.120
 needed complicated'm already on the threshold alan 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:48.560
 I never saw that they did this. 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:51.000
 No woman can read all sad 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.420
 because I lost a consolation goal for 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.269
 each one that I have never seen in what 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.060
 over 6 it was to get to this level 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.489
 streak neighborhood thing you're giving to 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.319
 You think I'm a boçal because 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.170
 everything was very simple on your screen 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:11.609
 only the hard game expensive throw you 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.889
 singing not trying is catching and has 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.510
 new and improve you will actually 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.310
 better not confirm the change will 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.790
 meeting the music and sport game 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.010
 It was difficult and I would go down opening to you. 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.419
 becomes the new thing can even 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.989
 use the key here 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:33.299
 but let that oil boy 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:41.269
 The player's bid is the boy's father. 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:46.470
 you have a team on top of it open 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:48.720
 saying that this monster is weak 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.680
 display to the port will give a certain 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.720
 narrative here 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.840
 they do not pay for anything, not only because 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.950
 if you put money and magic always good 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.810
 but for now the 1 rising uphill 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:11.090
 for the first crop of the first phase 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:27.139
 Glênio Ours I came to stay like this 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:34.600
 blood is famous ballet on his head 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:34.600
 the style believing that it was working again 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.389
 my people do not work what they are 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:45.710
 going on a letter for nothing 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:48.620
 and in exchange asks for a postiga Sunday 31 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.410
 to say no politician at home 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.280
 I think it will not give normality as 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:05:00.500
 Continue 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:05:02.840
 Certainly hope is on the cover but 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.419
 now it's over, it was not more peaceful 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:12.889
 when you win the calm can not good 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:14.260
 team well for this was too much a 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.760
 band 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.440
 the first episode will have several vain 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.229
 to put others there the idea is to have a video 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.990
 every day on the channel from today 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.280
 so if you liked short and talk low 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.800
 Do you like to see who will do another? 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.810
 thing your life had social life posted 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.560
 the video is a little happier 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.389
 comic books 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.840
 're in the countryside but not short to not do anything 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:38.210
 I only saw a little happier 5 1% more 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.840
 happiness in your day-to-day and legal 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.840
 work okay
