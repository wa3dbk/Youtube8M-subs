00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.390
 to see is good we will learn the three 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:25.210
 chords that we will use during 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.210
 the whole song these are without major 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:36.430
 to major and minor 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:40.690
 the first chord to the major and the 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:43.850
 next the biggest we do 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.549
 we continue in the position as it is higher 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.710
 and finally we move to remember everything 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:55.420
 sharp minor that seville in the room 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.420
 fret at a lower rate than we are going to do 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:12.330
 we are saying first we play the bass 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.960
 we do bottom up by the thumb 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.510
 and now we do 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:22.410
 we talk with these three the three doors 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.410
 and then we touch the ball 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:40.390
 shot the finances strings and I go back to 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:43.530
 play the bass and slowly already 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.530
 doing the fast schedules
