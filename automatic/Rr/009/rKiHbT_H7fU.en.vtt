00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.970
 general developmental exercises either in 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.890
 as an additional board on 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.159
 already tired muscles such as the regime 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.990
 lying it may well 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.710

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.479
 run then there are two options so 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.090

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.140
 version of pushups in the formidable version of my 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.759
 servants look to the sides and not brush when 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.640
 this can be arbitrary eyes not 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.200
 music forward packs both sides ie 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.140
 choose the option for which you 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.030
 most comfortable somewhere 5 and that is, you 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.920
