00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
we have got this hat model named Jane

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.120 
we have got this hat model named Jane
but<00:00:03.540> she<00:00:03.689> still<00:00:03.929> looked<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.259> bit<00:00:04.290> pale<00:00:04.770> and

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760 
scary let's look at the model this is

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.830 
scary let's look at the model this is
Jane<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:10.759> we<00:00:11.759> are<00:00:12.030> going<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.420> apply<00:00:12.750> some

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
Jane and we are going to apply some

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.829 
Jane and we are going to apply some
textures<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.219> her<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:15.059> make<00:00:15.089> her<00:00:15.269> look<00:00:15.780> a

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
textures to her to make her look a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.439 
textures to her to make her look a
little<00:00:16.139> bit<00:00:16.320> more<00:00:16.529> healthy<00:00:17.150> first<00:00:18.150> we're

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
little bit more healthy first we're

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.420 
little bit more healthy first we're
going<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.630> get<00:00:18.720> rid<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:18.930> these<00:00:19.140> scary<00:00:19.920> blank

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
going to get rid of these scary blank

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.269 
going to get rid of these scary blank
eyes<00:00:21.289> and<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.949> see<00:00:23.130> them<00:00:23.279> better<00:00:23.460> we'll<00:00:23.880> select

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
eyes and to see them better we'll select

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.259 
eyes and to see them better we'll select
the<00:00:26.279> head<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.720> hit<00:00:27.720> ctrl<00:00:28.380> H<00:00:28.849> to<00:00:29.849> make<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.150> head

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the head and hit ctrl H to make the head

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.150 
the head and hit ctrl H to make the head
disappear<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.050> we're<00:00:31.199> left<00:00:31.380> with<00:00:31.619> just<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
disappear so we're left with just the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.530 
disappear so we're left with just the
eyes<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:33.090> think<00:00:34.020> any<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.350> zoom<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:35.390> let's<00:00:36.390> do

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
eyes I think any to zoom in let's do

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.310 
eyes I think any to zoom in let's do
this<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.930> first<00:00:37.940> in<00:00:38.940> order<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.570> apply<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.899> texture

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
this I first in order to apply a texture

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.069 
this I first in order to apply a texture
it<00:00:40.620> needs<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.040> shader<00:00:41.700> if<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.600> were<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> apply

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
it needs a shader if I were to apply

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.680 
it needs a shader if I were to apply
texture<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:44.010> default<00:00:44.730> shader<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.510> would

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
texture to this default shader it would

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.400 
texture to this default shader it would
show<00:00:45.840> up<00:00:45.899> everywhere<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:47.250> let's<00:00:47.730> go<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:47.969> our

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
show up everywhere so let's go to our

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.740 
show up everywhere so let's go to our
rendering<00:00:49.410> tab<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.329> choose<00:00:51.329> one<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.539> these

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
rendering tab and choose one of these

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.299 
rendering tab and choose one of these
shaders<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:53.180> we'll<00:00:54.180> go<00:00:54.329> for<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> simple<00:00:54.899> phone

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
shaders and we'll go for a simple phone

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.330 
shaders and we'll go for a simple phone
in<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.489> case<00:00:58.699> this<00:00:59.699> will<00:00:59.910> get<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
in this case this will get you the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.860 
in this case this will get you the

editor and we are first going to assign
a<00:01:08.600> texture<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> color<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.189> eye<00:01:11.220> and

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
a texture to the color of the eye and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.280 
a texture to the color of the eye and
we'll<00:01:13.380> click<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> little<00:01:14.280> check<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.580> box<00:01:15.290> which

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
we'll click the little check a box which

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.770 
we'll click the little check a box which

this case and it needs an image name you

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.050 
this case and it needs an image name you
need<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.380> select<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.950> image<00:01:53.250> click<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.000> a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
need to select the image click on a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.170 
need to select the image click on a
little<00:01:54.240> folder<00:01:54.630> icon<00:01:57.200> will<00:01:58.200> choose<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.799> eye

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
little folder icon will choose the eye

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.429 
little folder icon will choose the eye
diffuse<00:02:00.290> image<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.890> came<00:02:02.130> with<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.430> scene

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
diffuse image that came with the scene

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.270 
diffuse image that came with the scene
diffuse<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.130> usually<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.700> color<00:02:06.180> channel

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
diffuse is the usually the color channel

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.089 
diffuse is the usually the color channel
so<00:02:08.280> course<00:02:08.489> we<00:02:08.670> called<00:02:08.849> eye<00:02:09.060> color<00:02:09.979> there<00:02:10.979> it

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
so course we called eye color there it

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.620 
so course we called eye color there it
is<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.370> eye<00:02:11.720> will<00:02:12.720> see<00:02:13.110> that

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
is the eye will see that

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.350 
is the eye will see that
or<00:02:15.630> eyeball<00:02:16.110> actually<00:02:16.770> turn<00:02:16.950> black<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:18.210> is

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
or eyeball actually turn black that is

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.640 
or eyeball actually turn black that is
if<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.810> select<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.910> look<00:02:20.910> at<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.090> UV<00:02:21.270> editor

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
if I select it and look at the UV editor

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.940 
if I select it and look at the UV editor
there<00:02:22.650> are<00:02:22.830> no<00:02:23.870> movies<00:02:24.870> assigned<00:02:25.410> at<00:02:25.620> this

there are no movies assigned at this

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.320 
there are no movies assigned at this
moment<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:28.650> let's<00:02:28.950> assign<00:02:29.280> some<00:02:29.550> movies<00:02:29.970> to

planar<00:02:40.770> mapping<00:02:41.100> but<00:02:41.520> select<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.910> option<00:02:42.450> box

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
planar mapping but select the option box

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.050 
planar mapping but select the option box
to<00:02:43.580> get<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.640> options<00:02:46.520> we<00:02:47.520> want<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.820> use<00:02:47.910> the

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
to get the options we want to use the

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.699 
to get the options we want to use the
bounding<00:02:48.360> box<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.750> fits<00:02:48.930> exactly<00:02:49.080> around

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
bounding box so it fits exactly around

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.860 
bounding box so it fits exactly around
the<00:02:49.980> eye<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.670> we're<00:02:51.150> going<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.330> project<00:02:51.750> it

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
the eye and we're going to project it

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.870 
the eye and we're going to project it
along<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.260> z<00:02:52.739> axis<00:02:52.770> because<00:02:53.580> that's<00:02:53.760> the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
along the z axis because that's the

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.790 
along the z axis because that's the
access<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.420> eye<00:02:54.450> happens<00:02:55.020> to<00:02:55.140> be<00:02:55.230> looking

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
access the eye happens to be looking

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:04.000 
access the eye happens to be looking
down<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:59.720> we're<00:03:00.720> gonna<00:03:00.870> say<00:03:01.190> projects<00:03:02.510> and

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
down and we're gonna say projects and

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.140 
down and we're gonna say projects and
there<00:03:05.010> we<00:03:05.130> go<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.730> eye<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:06.239> now<00:03:07.250> textured<00:03:08.250> it's

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
there we go the eye is now textured it's

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.000 
there we go the eye is now textured it's
also<00:03:09.480> texture<00:03:10.110> on<00:03:10.320> that<00:03:10.350> back<00:03:12.739> but<00:03:13.739> that's<00:03:13.890> not

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
also texture on that back but that's not

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.350 
also texture on that back but that's not
a<00:03:14.040> big<00:03:14.190> problem<00:03:14.550> because<00:03:14.700> you're<00:03:14.970> never<00:03:15.150> going

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
a big problem because you're never going

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.830 
a big problem because you're never going
to<00:03:15.390> see<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.600> back<00:03:15.890> so<00:03:17.090> this<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.209> okay<00:03:18.480> we<00:03:18.690> got

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
to see the back so this is okay we got

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.240 
to see the back so this is okay we got
the<00:03:19.110> texture<00:03:19.410> on<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.890> eyeball<00:03:21.860> but<00:03:22.860> we<00:03:22.950> got<00:03:23.070> on

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
the texture on the eyeball but we got on

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.979 
the texture on the eyeball but we got on
one<00:03:23.519> eyeball<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.209> we<00:03:24.269> also<00:03:24.420> want<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.750> on<00:03:24.870> the

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
one eyeball and we also want it on the

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.680 
one eyeball and we also want it on the
other<00:03:25.200> one<00:03:25.850> it's<00:03:26.850> now<00:03:26.970> using<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.360> projector

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
other one it's now using the projector

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.860 
other one it's now using the projector
we<00:03:27.900> want<00:03:28.049> to<00:03:28.110> freeze<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:29.010> projection<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:29.870> we

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
we want to freeze the projection and we

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.160 
we want to freeze the projection and we
can<00:03:31.019> do<00:03:31.170> that<00:03:31.380> by<00:03:31.680> going<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.370> edit<00:03:33.019> delete<00:03:34.019> by

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
can do that by going to edit delete by

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.750 
can do that by going to edit delete by
type<00:03:34.850> normally<00:03:35.850> for<00:03:36.000> mastery<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:37.140> now<00:03:37.320> it's

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
type normally for mastery and now it's

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.990 
type normally for mastery and now it's
frozen<00:03:38.760> in<00:03:39.120> two<00:03:39.269> movies<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.799> other<00:03:41.070> eye<00:03:41.280> also

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
frozen in two movies the other eye also

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.020 
frozen in two movies the other eye also
needs<00:03:42.239> that<00:03:42.420> little<00:03:43.230> eyeball<00:03:43.590> on<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.160> notice

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
needs that little eyeball on it I notice

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.170 
needs that little eyeball on it I notice
we<00:03:45.120> didn't<00:03:45.269> give<00:03:45.390> it<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.540> name<00:03:45.570> yet<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:47.430> let's<00:03:48.030> go

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
we didn't give it a name yet so let's go

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
we didn't give it a name yet so let's go
back<00:03:48.209> select<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.200> eye<00:03:50.720> and<00:03:51.720> we<00:03:51.840> have<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.080> we

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
back select the eye and we have that we

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.229 
back select the eye and we have that we
did<00:03:52.380> put<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.650> material<00:03:53.040> on<00:03:53.330> and<00:03:56.030> you'll<00:03:57.030> see

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
did put the material on and you'll see

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.660 
did put the material on and you'll see
there's<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.600> phone<00:03:58.080> on<00:03:58.380> it<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.160> we<00:03:59.310> call<00:03:59.910> that<00:03:59.940> I

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
there's a phone on it and we call that I

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.000 
there's a phone on it and we call that I
shader

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.780 

so<00:04:07.010> when<00:04:07.489> we<00:04:07.549> go<00:04:07.700> to<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:07.909> other<00:04:08.090> I<00:04:09.519> will<00:04:10.519> switch

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
so when we go to the other I will switch

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.029 
so when we go to the other I will switch
to<00:04:10.969> object<00:04:11.599> mode<00:04:12.879> select<00:04:13.879> the<00:04:13.939> I<00:04:14.799> right<00:04:15.799> click

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
to object mode select the I right click

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.229 
to object mode select the I right click
on<00:04:16.160> it<00:04:16.310> go<00:04:16.549> to<00:04:16.850> assign<00:04:17.810> existing<00:04:18.500> material<00:04:18.919> and

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
on it go to assign existing material and

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.020 
on it go to assign existing material and
assign<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.389> eye<00:04:20.539> shader<00:04:21.259> to<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:21.759> it<00:04:22.759> again

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
assign the eye shader to it it again

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.330 
assign the eye shader to it it again
will<00:04:23.270> turn<00:04:23.449> black<00:04:23.750> because<00:04:24.259> there<00:04:24.440> are<00:04:24.650> no<00:04:24.889> UVs

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
will turn black because there are no UVs

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.900 
will turn black because there are no UVs
available<00:04:26.150> on<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.449> sphere<00:04:27.350> yet<00:04:27.759> but<00:04:28.759> we'll

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
available on the sphere yet but we'll

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.520 
available on the sphere yet but we'll
just<00:04:28.940> repeat<00:04:29.419> what<00:04:29.930> we<00:04:30.020> did<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.229> the<00:04:30.320> other<00:04:30.440> eye

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
just repeat what we did to the other eye

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.340 
just repeat what we did to the other eye
we<00:04:30.830> go<00:04:30.949> to<00:04:31.009> create<00:04:31.520> movies<00:04:32.229> playing<00:04:33.229> the

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
we go to create movies playing the

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.320 
we go to create movies playing the
mapping<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:33.889> we<00:04:34.639> can<00:04:34.759> just<00:04:34.880> hit<00:04:35.000> it<00:04:35.120> because

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
mapping and we can just hit it because

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.969 
mapping and we can just hit it because
the<00:04:35.449> options<00:04:35.810> will<00:04:35.960> it<00:04:36.410> will<00:04:36.680> keep<00:04:36.830> the

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
the options will it will keep the

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.249 
the options will it will keep the
options<00:04:37.280> from<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:37.430> last<00:04:37.610> time<00:04:37.820> and<00:04:38.360> there<00:04:39.169> we

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
options from the last time and there we

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.150 
options from the last time and there we
go<00:04:39.490> it's<00:04:40.490> on<00:04:40.669> the<00:04:40.789> I<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:42.080> freeze<00:04:42.560> these<00:04:42.740> UVs

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
go it's on the I to freeze these UVs

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.830 
go it's on the I to freeze these UVs
again<00:04:43.550> we'll<00:04:43.759> go<00:04:43.940> to<00:04:44.000> edit<00:04:45.009> delete<00:04:46.009> by<00:04:46.190> type

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
again we'll go to edit delete by type

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.860 
again we'll go to edit delete by type
and<00:04:47.840> on<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.199> form<00:04:48.410> a<00:04:48.500> history<00:04:48.830> and<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:50.690> two

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
and on the form a history and the two

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.629 
and on the form a history and the two
eyes<00:04:51.340> are<00:04:52.340> now<00:04:54.070> if<00:04:55.070> we<00:04:55.160> go<00:04:55.250> back<00:04:55.280> to<00:04:55.430> object

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
eyes are now if we go back to object

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.670 
eyes are now if we go back to object
mode<00:04:56.650> they<00:04:57.650> look<00:04:57.830> fine<00:04:58.539> well<00:04:59.539> they<00:05:00.199> look<00:05:00.380> fine

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
mode they look fine well they look fine

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.790 
mode they look fine well they look fine
but<00:05:00.949> there's<00:05:01.190> no<00:05:01.340> Jane<00:05:01.660> so<00:05:02.660> let's<00:05:02.930> get<00:05:03.440> Jane

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
but there's no Jane so let's get Jane

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.980 
but there's no Jane so let's get Jane
back<00:05:03.849> or<00:05:04.849> we<00:05:05.060> can<00:05:05.210> do<00:05:05.330> that<00:05:05.479> by<00:05:05.599> going<00:05:05.780> to

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
back or we can do that by going to

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.810 
back or we can do that by going to
