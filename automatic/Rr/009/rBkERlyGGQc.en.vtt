next<00:02:28.760> thing<00:02:28.850> we<00:02:28.970> do<00:02:29.120> is<00:02:29.150> I'm<00:02:29.390> just<00:02:29.510> going<00:02:29.600> to

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
next thing we do is I'm just going to

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.960 
next thing we do is I'm just going to
take<00:02:29.900> my<00:02:29.960> thread<00:02:30.440> back<00:02:30.740> and<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.700> that<00:02:31.850> I<00:02:31.910> don't

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
take my thread back and so that I don't

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.930 
take my thread back and so that I don't
have<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.270> worry<00:02:32.540> about<00:02:32.690> sizing<00:02:33.440> later<00:02:34.130> on<00:02:34.400> I'm

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
have to worry about sizing later on I'm

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.000 
have to worry about sizing later on I'm
going<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.180> take<00:02:35.270> a<00:02:35.330> small<00:02:36.050> set<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.440> lead<00:02:36.800> eyes

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
going to take a small set of lead eyes

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.580 
going to take a small set of lead eyes
black<00:02:37.970> nickel<00:02:38.480> I<00:02:38.840> don't<00:02:39.050> think<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.260> makes<00:02:39.410> too

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
black nickel I don't think it makes too

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:52.250 
black nickel I don't think it makes too
much<00:02:39.740> of<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:39.950> difference<00:02:40.340> on<00:02:40.490> there

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.960 

I'm<00:02:52.709> just<00:02:52.860> kind<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.069> figure<00:02:53.370> eight<00:02:53.489> those<00:02:53.730> in

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
I'm just kind of figure eight those in

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.280 
I'm just kind of figure eight those in
place<00:02:55.340> so<00:02:56.340> I've<00:02:56.459> got<00:02:56.640> this<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:57.120> EP<00:02:57.510> tarantula

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
place so I've got this the EP tarantula

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:11.740 
place so I've got this the EP tarantula
legs<00:02:58.530> in<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:59.430> tan<00:02:59.819> color

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.420 

we're<00:03:12.350> just<00:03:12.410> going<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.650> wrap<00:03:12.800> that<00:03:12.980> forward

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
we're just going to wrap that forward

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.530 
we're just going to wrap that forward
now<00:03:14.860> so<00:03:15.860> just<00:03:15.890> like<00:03:16.340> wrapping<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:16.850> hackle<00:03:17.300> you

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
now so just like wrapping a hackle you

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.760 
now so just like wrapping a hackle you
want<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:17.750> make<00:03:17.870> sure<00:03:17.900> that<00:03:18.170> it's<00:03:18.290> not<00:03:18.440> binding

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
want to make sure that it's not binding

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.500 
want to make sure that it's not binding
on<00:03:19.070> itself<00:03:19.400> it's<00:03:20.120> kind<00:03:20.300> of<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.510> critical<00:03:20.930> part

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.610 

this<00:03:26.510> stuff<00:03:26.720> is<00:03:26.840> great<00:03:27.020> it<00:03:27.200> really<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.590> really

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
this stuff is great it really it really

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.680 
this stuff is great it really it really
fished<00:03:28.130> well<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.610> didn't<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.360> didn't<00:03:31.450> know<00:03:32.450> the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
fished well it didn't it didn't know the

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.630 
fished well it didn't it didn't know the
sink<00:03:33.290> rate<00:03:33.500> was<00:03:33.860> really<00:03:34.100> good<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.520> the

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
sink rate was really good and the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.880 
sink rate was really good and the
durability<00:03:34.880> was<00:03:35.570> really<00:03:35.810> good<00:03:35.990> and<00:03:36.290> it<00:03:36.680> seems

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
durability was really good and it seems

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.860 
durability was really good and it seems
like<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.130> lifelike<00:03:37.670> action<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.120> mean<00:03:38.330> a<00:03:38.450> lot<00:03:38.720> of

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
like the lifelike action I mean a lot of

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.470 
like the lifelike action I mean a lot of
lot<00:03:39.170> of<00:03:39.200> fish<00:03:39.410> ate<00:03:39.560> at<00:03:39.709> this<00:03:39.860> spring<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:41.000> the

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
lot of fish ate at this spring and the

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.780 
lot of fish ate at this spring and the
Caribbean<00:03:41.870> at<00:03:41.990> least<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:46.100> get<00:03:46.250> as<00:03:46.340> much<00:03:46.580> as

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
Caribbean at least and get as much as

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.280 
Caribbean at least and get as much as
you<00:03:46.910> want<00:03:47.180> on<00:03:47.300> there<00:03:47.540> that's<00:03:47.959> kind<00:03:48.170> of<00:03:48.200> the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
you want on there that's kind of the

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.680 
you want on there that's kind of the
cool<00:03:48.470> thing<00:03:48.680> about<00:03:48.709> working<00:03:49.040> with<00:03:49.280> it<00:03:49.550> is<00:03:49.730> is

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
cool thing about working with it is is

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.240 
cool thing about working with it is is
that<00:03:50.989> you<00:03:51.050> can<00:03:51.200> work<00:03:51.380> directly<00:03:51.560> off<00:03:52.040> that

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
that you can work directly off that

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.060 
that you can work directly off that
piece<00:03:52.489> of<00:03:52.520> wire<00:03:52.959> as<00:03:53.959> opposed<00:03:54.410> to<00:03:54.560> Capri

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
piece of wire as opposed to Capri

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.770 
piece of wire as opposed to Capri
cutting<00:03:55.459> a<00:03:55.550> piece<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:55.970> then<00:03:56.090> like<00:03:56.270> oh<00:03:56.420> no<00:03:56.750> I

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
cutting a piece and then like oh no I

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.540 
cutting a piece and then like oh no I
ran<00:03:57.080> out<00:03:57.320> and<00:03:57.470> then<00:03:57.620> not<00:03:57.770> having<00:03:57.980> enough<00:03:58.280> space

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
ran out and then not having enough space

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:11.530 
ran out and then not having enough space
or<00:03:58.790> whatever<00:03:59.030> on<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.450> back<00:03:59.750> end<00:04:00.020> of<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.200> fly

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.630 

ok

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
ok

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.550 
ok
so<00:04:14.210> now<00:04:14.330> we've<00:04:14.450> got<00:04:14.600> essentially<00:04:14.990> a<00:04:15.110> nice<00:04:15.260> crab

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
so now we've got essentially a nice crab

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.229 
so now we've got essentially a nice crab
body<00:04:15.860> we've<00:04:16.070> got<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.310> little<00:04:16.430> kicker<00:04:16.700> legs<00:04:17.000> on

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
body we've got the little kicker legs on

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.520 
body we've got the little kicker legs on
there<00:04:18.670> to<00:04:19.670> make<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:20.000> rattle<00:04:20.450> like<00:04:20.750> I<00:04:20.870> very

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
there to make the rattle like I very

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.950 
there to make the rattle like I very
tied<00:04:21.769> in<00:04:21.950> that<00:04:22.100> piece<00:04:22.310> of<00:04:22.340> like<00:04:22.700> 25<00:04:23.270> pound<00:04:23.600> mono

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
tied in that piece of like 25 pound mono

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.380 
tied in that piece of like 25 pound mono
I'm<00:04:24.740> going<00:04:24.860> to<00:04:24.920> take<00:04:25.070> three<00:04:25.400> eighth<00:04:26.060> inch

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
I'm going to take three eighth inch

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.140 
I'm going to take three eighth inch
beads<00:04:26.980> these<00:04:27.980> are<00:04:28.190> gold<00:04:28.460> but<00:04:28.790> I<00:04:28.820> think<00:04:29.120> that

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
beads these are gold but I think that

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.670 
beads these are gold but I think that
you<00:04:29.330> could<00:04:29.420> pretty<00:04:29.660> much<00:04:29.720> use<00:04:30.020> whatever<00:04:30.260> I

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
you could pretty much use whatever I

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.409 
you could pretty much use whatever I
think<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:31.250> could<00:04:31.340> also<00:04:31.490> mess<00:04:31.850> with<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.150> sink

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
think you could also mess with the sink

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:33.760 
think you could also mess with the sink
rates<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:32.780> little<00:04:32.810> bit<00:04:33.169> if<00:04:33.290> you<00:04:33.350> wanted<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:33.650> use

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
rates a little bit if you wanted to use

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.310 
rates a little bit if you wanted to use
tungsten<00:04:34.190> beads<00:04:34.430> on<00:04:34.640> there<00:04:34.900> or<00:04:35.900> a<00:04:35.930> combination

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
tungsten beads on there or a combination

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.270 
tungsten beads on there or a combination
a<00:04:36.710> tungsten<00:04:36.919> and<00:04:37.330> brass<00:04:38.650> again<00:04:39.650> you<00:04:39.950> know<00:04:40.040> a

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
a tungsten and brass again you know a

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.250 
a tungsten and brass again you know a
lot<00:04:40.520> a<00:04:40.550> lot<00:04:40.760> of<00:04:40.910> room<00:04:41.060> to<00:04:41.090> wiggle<00:04:41.600> around<00:04:41.810> there

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
lot a lot of room to wiggle around there

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.440 
lot a lot of room to wiggle around there
and<00:04:42.400> figure<00:04:43.400> out<00:04:43.550> what's<00:04:44.030> going<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.210> work<00:04:44.300> for

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
and figure out what's going to work for

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.950 
and figure out what's going to work for
you<00:04:44.810> and<00:04:44.870> what's<00:04:45.050> not<00:04:46.660> another<00:04:47.660> cool<00:04:47.900> thing

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
you and what's not another cool thing

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.900 
you and what's not another cool thing
about<00:04:48.260> this<00:04:48.500> is<00:04:48.560> that<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:49.040> rattles

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
about this is that the rattles

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.810 
about this is that the rattles
themselves<00:04:50.419> kind<00:04:50.630> of<00:04:50.690> help<00:04:50.810> keel<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.350> fly

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
themselves kind of help keel the fly
