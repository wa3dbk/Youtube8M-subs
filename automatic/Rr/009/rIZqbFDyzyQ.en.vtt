meat I like to put it on my knee

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.290 
meat I like to put it on my knee
therefore<00:05:30.950> I<00:05:30.980> can<00:05:31.370> I<00:05:31.610> can<00:05:31.760> press<00:05:31.940> it<00:05:32.060> to<00:05:32.180> my

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
therefore I can I can press it to my

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.320 
therefore I can I can press it to my
skin<00:05:32.630> and<00:05:32.900> get<00:05:33.350> a<00:05:33.380> accurate<00:05:34.370> cut<00:05:34.610> around<00:05:34.970> the

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
skin and get a accurate cut around the

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.730 
skin and get a accurate cut around the
hairline<00:05:35.540> so<00:05:35.870> they<00:05:35.960> don't<00:05:36.140> cut<00:05:36.350> any<00:05:36.500> of<00:05:36.620> the

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
hairline so they don't cut any of the

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.310 
hairline so they don't cut any of the
hairline<00:05:37.100> off<00:05:37.310> and<00:05:37.730> cause<00:05:37.940> shedding<00:05:38.930> from<00:05:39.200> the

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
hairline off and cause shedding from the

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.040 
hairline off and cause shedding from the
hair<00:05:39.500> so<00:05:40.130> I<00:05:40.460> like<00:05:40.850> to<00:05:40.940> do<00:05:41.060> it<00:05:41.210> that<00:05:41.360> way<00:05:41.600> I<00:05:41.900> think

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
hair so I like to do it that way I think

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.750

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
it's very easy to shoot with a small

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.270 
it's very easy to shoot with a small
pair<00:05:44.030> of<00:05:44.060> scissors<00:05:44.180> or<00:05:44.840> shears<00:05:44.870> and<00:05:45.500> you<00:05:46.160> know
