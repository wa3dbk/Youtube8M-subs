00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
gallon when he got a little bit bigger

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.310 
gallon when he got a little bit bigger
so<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.240> officers<00:00:45.570> did<00:00:45.720> harass<00:00:45.960> him<00:00:46.200> or

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
so the officers did harass him or

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.810 
so the officers did harass him or
anything<00:00:46.500> but<00:00:47.400> he's<00:00:48.060> pretty<00:00:48.420> big<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.430> say<00:00:50.430> he's

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
anything but he's pretty big I say he's

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.470 
anything but he's pretty big I say he's
a<00:00:51.500> six<00:00:52.500> maybe<00:00:52.860> seven<00:00:53.130> inches<00:00:53.850> long

a six maybe seven inches long

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.870 
a six maybe seven inches long
maybe<00:00:55.020> he<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.160> really<00:00:56.370> hard<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.580> measure<00:00:56.700> him

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
maybe he it's really hard to measure him

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.030 
maybe he it's really hard to measure him
because<00:00:57.030> he's<00:00:57.150> kind<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.390> kind<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.750> finicky<00:00:58.040> but

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040

now I'm going to try to catch him and
put<00:02:06.240> him<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.479> big<00:02:06.630> tank<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.880> my

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
put him in the big tank so this is my

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.590 
put him in the big tank so this is my
Arowana<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.869> big<00:02:10.140> tank<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:11.330> as<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.510> can

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
Arowana in the big tank and as you can

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.080 
Arowana in the big tank and as you can
see<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.810> have<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.200> divider<00:02:13.500> up<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:14.459> when<00:02:15.060> I

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
see I have the divider up and when I

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.699 
see I have the divider up and when I
took<00:02:15.209> him<00:02:15.510> out<00:02:15.600> when<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.080> was<00:02:16.230> taking<00:02:16.470> out<00:02:16.560> with

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
took him out when I was taking out with

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.390 
took him out when I was taking out with
the<00:02:16.800> net<00:02:17.150> he<00:02:18.150> actually<00:02:18.450> jumped<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:20.190> caught

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
the net he actually jumped and I caught

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.580 
the net he actually jumped and I caught
him<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.390> gave<00:02:21.510> me<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.630> quick<00:02:22.170> chance<00:02:22.410> to

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
him and that gave me a quick chance to

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.220 
him and that gave me a quick chance to
measure<00:02:22.709> him<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:24.030> said<00:02:24.240> before<00:02:24.360> he's<00:02:24.840> seven

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
measure him and I said before he's seven

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.320 
measure him and I said before he's seven
inches<00:02:25.470> he's<00:02:25.740> actually<00:02:25.920> eight<00:02:26.280> which<00:02:27.150> really

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
inches he's actually eight which really

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.960 
inches he's actually eight which really
surprised<00:02:27.690> me<00:02:27.870> because<00:02:28.280> he's<00:02:29.280> grown<00:02:29.520> quite<00:02:29.940> a

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
surprised me because he's grown quite a

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.520 
surprised me because he's grown quite a
bit<00:02:30.150> because<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.480> since<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.780> got<00:02:30.930> him<00:02:31.020> at<00:02:31.110> like<00:02:31.290> I

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
bit because I since I got him at like I

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.670 
bit because I since I got him at like I
got<00:02:32.370> him<00:02:32.520> say<00:02:32.700> four<00:02:33.000> or<00:02:33.120> five<00:02:33.270> inches<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:34.530> he's

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
got him say four or five inches and he's

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.059 
got him say four or five inches and he's
grown<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.459> eight<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.930> makes<00:02:37.110> him<00:02:37.849> almost

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
grown to eight so that makes him almost

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.720 
grown to eight so that makes him almost
big<00:02:39.310> are<00:02:40.299> bigger<00:02:41.230> than<00:02:41.560> my<00:02:41.739> smallest<00:02:42.310> Oscar

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
big are bigger than my smallest Oscar

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.929 
big are bigger than my smallest Oscar
here<00:02:42.989> which<00:02:43.989> is<00:02:44.139> pretty<00:02:44.590> good<00:02:44.739> so<00:02:45.730> I'm<00:02:45.819> gonna

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
here which is pretty good so I'm gonna

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.539 
here which is pretty good so I'm gonna
let<00:02:46.060> him<00:02:46.239> live<00:02:46.480> out<00:02:46.930> here<00:02:47.260> until<00:02:48.129> he<00:02:48.340> gotta

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
let him live out here until he gotta

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.580 
let him live out here until he gotta
gets<00:02:48.760> used<00:02:48.969> to<00:02:49.060> everything<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.749> I<00:02:50.170> could<00:02:50.349> feed

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
gets used to everything and I could feed

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.699 
gets used to everything and I could feed
him<00:02:50.769> whatever<00:02:51.549> I<00:02:51.819> want<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:55.500> then<00:02:56.500> I'll

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
him whatever I want and and then I'll

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.399 
him whatever I want and and then I'll
eventually<00:02:57.099> take<00:02:57.730> down<00:02:57.909> the<00:02:58.060> divider<00:02:58.359> let<00:02:59.319> him

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
eventually take down the divider let him

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.679 
eventually take down the divider let him
go<00:02:59.609> so<00:03:00.609> it<00:03:00.700> seems<00:03:00.879> to<00:03:00.939> be<00:03:01.030> doing<00:03:01.269> pretty<00:03:01.359> good

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:01.689 
go so it seems to be doing pretty good

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:08.270 
go so it seems to be doing pretty good
automated<00:03:02.230> him<00:03:02.859> in<00:03:03.609> a<00:03:03.730> bucket<00:03:03.879> and<00:03:04.709> he's<00:03:05.709> was

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
automated him in a bucket and he's was

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.129 
automated him in a bucket and he's was
not<00:03:09.510> not<00:03:10.889> too<00:03:11.889> bad<00:03:12.790> he's<00:03:13.269> kind<00:03:13.510> of<00:03:13.540> upset<00:03:13.900> like

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
not not too bad he's kind of upset like
