00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
thought Jack was back today doing the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.090 
thought Jack was back today doing the
things<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.200> he<00:00:34.260> does<00:00:34.410> really<00:00:34.620> well<00:00:34.770> driving

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
things that he does really well driving

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.790 
things that he does really well driving
from<00:00:35.370> midfield<00:00:35.719> and<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.960> think<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.410> thing<00:00:37.590> if

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
from midfield and I think the thing if

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.619 
from midfield and I think the thing if
we<00:00:38.370> learn<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> lesson<00:00:38.910> from<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.329> villa<00:00:39.480> go

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
we learn a lesson from the villa go

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.030 
we learn a lesson from the villa go
Merlin<00:00:39.899> season<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.379> didn't<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.620> Giroux<00:00:40.829> that

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
Merlin season we didn't have Giroux that

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.380 
Merlin season we didn't have Giroux that
day<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.399> beat<00:00:41.579> them<00:00:41.670> three<00:00:41.910> nothing<00:00:42.090> with

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
day and we beat them three nothing with

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.479 
day and we beat them three nothing with
Ozil<00:00:42.719> Welbeck<00:00:43.379> further<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.860> rosal<00:00:44.190> plan<00:00:44.370> of

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
Ozil Welbeck further on rosal plan of

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.580 
Ozil Welbeck further on rosal plan of
Welbeck<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.539> i<00:00:45.719> think<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.110> might<00:00:46.260> be<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.440> way

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
Welbeck and i think that might be a way

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.900 
Welbeck and i think that might be a way
to<00:00:46.620> go<00:00:46.890> with<00:00:47.039> theo<00:00:47.219> through<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> middle<00:00:47.879> a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
to go with theo through the middle a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.810 
to go with theo through the middle a
notable<00:00:48.239> behind<00:00:48.570> him<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.289> think<00:00:49.500> jurors

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
notable behind him and I think jurors

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.540 
notable behind him and I think jurors
lately<00:00:50.820> shown<00:00:51.030> signs<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.480> fatigue<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.500> as<00:00:52.739> one

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
lately shown signs of fatigue but as one

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.340 
lately shown signs of fatigue but as one
thing<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.730> would<00:00:53.820> say<00:00:53.879> Robbie<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.449> going

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
thing I would say Robbie is going

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.170 
thing I would say Robbie is going
forward<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:55.770> next<00:00:55.980> season<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.940> obviously

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
forward for next season and obviously

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.430 
forward for next season and obviously
it's<00:00:57.390> very<00:00:57.539> important<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:57.930> win<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> Cup<00:00:58.260> next

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
it's very important we win the Cup next

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.170 
it's very important we win the Cup next
week<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.829> think<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.250> do<00:00:59.460> need<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.789> address<00:00:59.969> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
week I think we do need to address the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.639 
week I think we do need to address the
spine<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.539> our<00:01:00.629> team<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:01.020> next<00:01:01.050> season<00:01:01.469> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
spine of our team for next season and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.770 
spine of our team for next season and
the<00:01:02.160> reason<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.430> say<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.879> because<00:01:03.000> if<00:01:03.690> you

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
the reason I say that is because if you

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.170 
the reason I say that is because if you
look<00:01:03.930> back<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.260> fingers<00:01:04.559> teams<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.040> 98<00:01:05.460> 2002

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
look back the fingers teams in 98 2002

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.390 
look back the fingers teams in 98 2002
when<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.450> won<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.840> double<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.890> spine<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.310> that

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
when we won the double the spine of that

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.390 
when we won the double the spine of that
team<00:01:08.640> was<00:01:08.820> semen<00:01:09.330> Adams<00:01:10.229> Viera<00:01:10.830> honoree

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
team was semen Adams Viera honoree

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.300 
team was semen Adams Viera honoree
they're<00:01:11.909> all<00:01:12.090> tall<00:01:12.479> imposing<00:01:13.290> players<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
they're all tall imposing players and I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.560 
they're all tall imposing players and I
think<00:01:14.490> that's<00:01:14.610> what<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.850> lack<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.150> outside<00:01:15.479> at

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
think that's what we lack in outside at

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.240 
think that's what we lack in outside at
the<00:01:15.630> moment<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.140> you're<00:01:16.650> talking<00:01:16.920> about<00:01:17.100> who

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the moment and you're talking about who

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.700 
the moment and you're talking about who
we<00:01:17.400> go<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.729> get<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:18.000> next<00:01:18.180> season<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.720> think<00:01:19.619> a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
we go and get for next season I think a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.109 
we go and get for next season I think a
spin<00:01:19.950> has<00:01:20.070> been<00:01:20.189> really<00:01:20.640> good<00:01:20.729> for<00:01:20.850> us<00:01:20.939> today

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
spin has been really good for us today

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.700 
spin has been really good for us today
but<00:01:21.450> he<00:01:21.750> was<00:01:21.900> at<00:01:22.020> fault<00:01:22.170> for<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> gold<00:01:22.560> today

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
but he was at fault for the gold today

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.109 
but he was at fault for the gold today
and<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.100> shot<00:01:23.340> worried<00:01:23.700> me<00:01:23.790> when<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:23.970> went

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
and that shot worried me when it went

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.270 
and that shot worried me when it went
through<00:01:24.240> his<00:01:24.330> fingers<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.900> think<00:01:25.770> he's<00:01:25.920> got<00:01:26.130> to

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
through his fingers I think he's got to

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.530 
through his fingers I think he's got to
go<00:01:26.400> out<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.549> try<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:26.850> get<00:01:26.970> check<00:01:27.299> or<00:01:27.509> a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
go out and try and get check or a

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.440

lackeys<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.119> think<00:01:51.329> Mertesacker<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.170> a

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
lackeys and I think Mertesacker is a

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.380 
lackeys and I think Mertesacker is a
fine<00:01:52.649> defender<00:01:53.040> club<00:01:53.369> captain<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.939> do<00:01:54.000> think

fine defender club captain I do think

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.080 
fine defender club captain I do think

that an imposing centre-half so I'm a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.990 
that an imposing centre-half so I'm a
bit<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.329> pace<00:01:57.920> abdin<00:01:58.920> or<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.729> going
