that we made under the loop just like
that<00:02:48.129> okay<00:02:50.319> so<00:02:51.319> that's<00:02:51.530> how<00:02:51.709> it's<00:02:52.159> gonna<00:02:52.370> look

hair you're gonna wrap it around the
base<00:03:26.389> of<00:03:26.449> the<00:03:26.719> loop<00:03:27.049> just<00:03:28.180> like<00:03:29.180> that<00:03:31.000> and

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
base of the loop just like that and

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.530

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:43.939 
loop and slip the little bond under just

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:52.420 
loop and slip the little bond under just
like<00:03:44.030> so<00:03:46.569> okay<00:03:47.979> no<00:03:48.979> this<00:03:49.400> is<00:03:49.519> not<00:03:49.729> gonna<00:03:51.430> fall
