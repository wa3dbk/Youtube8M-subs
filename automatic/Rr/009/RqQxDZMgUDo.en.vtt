00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
the climb up I'm not sure how many feet

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.979 
the climb up I'm not sure how many feet
I<00:00:31.500> gain<00:00:31.890> but<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.250> was<00:00:32.550> wiped<00:00:33.270> out<00:00:33.510> for<00:00:33.809> some

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
I gain but I was wiped out for some

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:34.910 
I gain but I was wiped out for some
reason<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.290> don't<00:00:34.469> know<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.800> was<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
reason I don't know if it was the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.130 
reason I don't know if it was the
elevation<00:00:35.700> or<00:00:36.000> coming<00:00:36.899> out<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.140> town<00:00:38.809> but<00:00:39.809> I

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
elevation or coming out of town but I

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.900 
elevation or coming out of town but I
was<00:00:40.680> breathing<00:00:40.980> pretty<00:00:41.250> hard<00:00:41.399> all<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.030> way<00:00:42.120> up

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
not bad a couple of views apparently on

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
a clear day you can actually see the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.749 
a clear day you can actually see the
lost<00:01:21.210> edge<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> skyline<00:01:22.340> from<00:01:23.340> here<00:01:23.580> which

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
lost edge of the skyline from here which

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.960 
lost edge of the skyline from here which
would<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:23.939> pretty<00:01:24.240> cool<00:01:25.430> it<00:01:26.430> was<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> little

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
would be pretty cool it was a little

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.469 
would be pretty cool it was a little
clearer<00:01:27.330> earlier<00:01:28.850> but<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> clouds<00:01:30.299> have

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
clearer earlier but the clouds have

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.560 
clearer earlier but the clouds have
moved<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:32.520> I've<00:01:33.030> actually<00:01:33.119> heard<00:01:33.420> a

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
moved in and I've actually heard a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.980 
moved in and I've actually heard a
little<00:01:33.689> bit<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.930> thunder<00:01:34.259> -<00:01:35.329> so<00:01:36.329> I'm<00:01:36.570> gonna<00:01:36.720> get

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
little bit of thunder - so I'm gonna get

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.130 
little bit of thunder - so I'm gonna get
moving<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.409> down<00:01:38.390> kind<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.420> cool<00:01:39.600> being<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:40.020> in

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
moving on down kind of cool being up in

the snow though and despite what it
looks<00:01:45.689> like<00:01:45.840> it's<00:01:46.049> probably<00:01:46.259> about<00:01:46.619> 3:30<00:01:47.189> in

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.730 
day got some more high elevation hiking
for<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.430> while<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.969> then<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.899> down<00:01:58.350> into<00:01:58.649> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
for a while and then on down into the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.700 
for a while and then on down into the
Mojave<00:01:59.570> should<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.689> cool<00:02:01.070> I'll<00:02:02.070> see<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.460> later

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
this is the ridge that actually leads up

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.570 
this is the ridge that actually leads up
to<00:02:06.600> baden-powell

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
to baden-powell

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.100 
to baden-powell
just<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.640> quick<00:02:08.879> look<00:02:09.090> here

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.150 

really<00:02:14.110> far<00:02:14.470> down<00:02:16.440> pretty<00:02:17.440> big<00:02:17.620> flakes<00:02:17.950> of

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
really far down pretty big flakes of

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.650 
really far down pretty big flakes of
snow<00:02:18.250> coming<00:02:18.580> in<00:02:18.819> to<00:02:19.030> blowing<00:02:19.480> up<00:02:21.569> looks<00:02:22.569> like

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
snow coming in to blowing up looks like

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.400 
snow coming in to blowing up looks like
we're<00:02:22.870> going<00:02:23.020> light<00:02:23.290> speed<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:27.040> up<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.610> way

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
we're going light speed and up that way

00:02:28.410 --> 00:03:02.220 
we're going light speed and up that way
is<00:02:33.090> goes<00:02:34.090> down<00:02:34.330> that<00:02:34.540> way

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:19.229 

I<00:03:16.890> think<00:03:17.890> this<00:03:18.040> has<00:03:18.220> been<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.459> first<00:03:18.790> day<00:03:19.180> so

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
I think this has been the first day so

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.900 
I think this has been the first day so
far<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.260> PCT<00:03:20.620> has<00:03:20.980> actually<00:03:21.489> done<00:03:21.700> like

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
far that the PCT has actually done like

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.180 
far that the PCT has actually done like
a<00:03:21.940> ridge<00:03:22.239> walk<00:03:23.069> and<00:03:24.069> this<00:03:24.400> is<00:03:24.549> what's<00:03:24.760> going<00:03:24.940> on

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
a ridge walk and this is what's going on

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.300 
a ridge walk and this is what's going on
kind<00:03:27.190> of<00:03:27.250> funny<00:03:30.000> its<00:03:31.000> own<00:03:31.209> pretty<00:03:31.510> good

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
kind of funny its own pretty good

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.470 
kind of funny its own pretty good
thought<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:33.430> was<00:03:33.519> gonna<00:03:33.640> stop<00:03:33.970> there<00:03:34.239> for<00:03:34.420> a

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
thought it was gonna stop there for a

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.789 
thought it was gonna stop there for a
while<00:03:35.019> but<00:03:35.349> it<00:03:35.500> takes<00:03:35.799> right<00:03:36.099> back<00:03:36.310> up

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
while but it takes right back up

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.559 
while but it takes right back up
hopefully<00:03:38.799> I<00:03:39.010> can<00:03:39.160> drop<00:03:39.519> some<00:03:39.819> elevation<00:03:40.209> here

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
hopefully I can drop some elevation here

00:03:40.569 --> 00:04:05.340 
hopefully I can drop some elevation here
soon

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.410 

you
