00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
kept getting dust under it the more I

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.620

tried<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:10.760> get<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:10.940> dust<00:03:11.120> out<00:03:11.269> from

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
tried to get the dust out from

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.569

just seemed to get dust in it so I

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.009 
just seemed to get dust in it so I
decided<00:03:16.519> to<00:03:16.639> leave<00:03:16.880> well<00:03:17.150> enough<00:03:17.299> alone<00:03:17.510> and

style case I was able to kind of wiggle
it<00:04:03.410> a<00:04:03.590> little<00:04:04.099> bit<00:04:04.489> and<00:04:04.670> get<00:04:04.910> it<00:04:05.030> in<00:04:05.150> there<00:04:05.420> you

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
it a little bit and get it in there you

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.020 
it a little bit and get it in there you
know<00:04:06.319> kind<00:04:06.650> of<00:04:06.709> pushing<00:04:07.069> it<00:04:07.190> out<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.459> little<00:04:07.910> bit

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
know kind of pushing it out a little bit

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.729 
know kind of pushing it out a little bit
as<00:04:08.269> I<00:04:08.419> wiggled<00:04:08.780> it<00:04:08.930> I<00:04:09.049> was<00:04:09.230> able<00:04:09.349> to<00:04:09.500> get<00:04:09.590> the

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
as I wiggled it I was able to get the

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.830 
as I wiggled it I was able to get the
check<00:04:09.980> in<00:04:10.190> there<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.400> that's<00:04:10.519> a<00:04:10.609> big<00:04:10.730> jak<00:04:10.970> 2<00:04:11.239> so

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
check in there and that's a big jak 2 so

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.360 
check in there and that's a big jak 2 so
you<00:04:12.109> shouldn't<00:04:12.290> have<00:04:12.380> any<00:04:12.470> trouble<00:04:12.620> with<00:04:12.919> any

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
with them the sleep/wake button is

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.469 
with them the sleep/wake button is
fairly<00:04:17.570> responsive<00:04:18.019> not<00:04:18.530> bad<00:04:19.359> they<00:04:20.359> are

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
fairly responsive not bad they are

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.210 
fairly responsive not bad they are
slightly<00:04:20.870> hard<00:04:21.229> to<00:04:21.349> press<00:04:21.530> but<00:04:21.769> that's<00:04:21.950> you

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
slightly hard to press but that's you

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.930

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
you know TPU style cases I find that you

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.820 
you know TPU style cases I find that you
know<00:04:27.790> quite<00:04:28.480> often<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:28.960> buttons<00:04:29.230> are<00:04:29.380> not<00:04:29.410> the

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
know quite often the buttons are not the

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.730 
know quite often the buttons are not the
easiest<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.400> press<00:04:30.640> in<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:31.180> world<00:04:31.390> but<00:04:32.320> um<00:04:32.560> it

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
easiest to press in the world but um it

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.860 
easiest to press in the world but um it
does<00:04:32.890> provide<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.190> nice<00:04:33.400> feedback<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:34.780> know

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
does provide a nice feedback you know

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.300 
does provide a nice feedback you know
you<00:04:34.930> can<00:04:35.140> feel<00:04:35.320> it<00:04:35.380> click<00:04:35.710> when<00:04:35.770> you<00:04:36.010> press<00:04:36.280> it

you can feel it click when you press it
and<00:04:36.720> you<00:04:37.720> know<00:04:37.750> because<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.230> case<00:04:38.380> is<00:04:38.440> so<00:04:38.770> thin

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
and you know because the case is so thin

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.380 
and you know because the case is so thin
you're<00:04:39.730> not<00:04:39.850> getting<00:04:40.060> a<00:04:40.090> whole<00:04:40.150> lot<00:04:40.360> of

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
being a TPU material it will actually

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.480 
being a TPU material it will actually
stretch<00:05:05.200> back<00:05:05.560> a<00:05:05.590> little<00:05:05.860> bit<00:05:06.040> to<00:05:06.220> allow<00:05:06.430> you

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
stretch back a little bit to allow you

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.760 
stretch back a little bit to allow you
to<00:05:06.670> figure<00:05:06.820> third<00:05:07.120> party<00:05:07.540> cables<00:05:07.900> in<00:05:08.020> there<00:05:08.230> so

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
to figure third party cables in there so

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.800 
to figure third party cables in there so
again<00:05:09.250> that's<00:05:09.670> not<00:05:10.000> a<00:05:10.030> big<00:05:10.210> problem<00:05:10.270> either

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810
