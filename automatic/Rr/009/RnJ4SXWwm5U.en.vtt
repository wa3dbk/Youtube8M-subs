there<00:00:06.270> are<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.870> tremendous<00:00:07.350> amount<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.589> lessons

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
there are a tremendous amount of lessons

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.830 
there are a tremendous amount of lessons
that<00:00:08.069> we've<00:00:08.250> learned<00:00:08.280> from<00:00:08.970> from<00:00:09.570> from<00:00:09.599> the

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
that we've learned from from from the

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.140 
that we've learned from from from the
crisis<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.530> one<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.460> obvious<00:00:11.580> ones<00:00:11.790> is

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
crisis and one of the obvious ones is

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.919 
crisis and one of the obvious ones is
that<00:00:12.620> working<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:14.040> silos<00:00:14.450> simply<00:00:15.450> doesn't

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
that working in silos simply doesn't

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.279 
that working in silos simply doesn't
make<00:00:16.049> sense<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:17.520> need<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:18.140> look<00:00:19.140> at

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
make sense in that we need to look at

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.710 
make sense in that we need to look at
stress<00:00:19.590> tests<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.160> are<00:00:20.400> stressing<00:00:21.359> not<00:00:21.510> just

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
stress tests that are stressing not just

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.060 
stress tests that are stressing not just
firm<00:00:21.900> specific<00:00:22.140> but<00:00:22.619> look<00:00:23.039> at<00:00:23.189> broad<00:00:23.460> macro

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
firm specific but look at broad macro

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.259 
firm specific but look at broad macro
scenarios<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.220> affect<00:00:26.519> all<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.849> us<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.240> I

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
scenarios that affect all of us so I

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.900 
scenarios that affect all of us so I
think<00:00:27.390> there'll<00:00:27.689> be<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.810> tremendous<00:00:28.289> growth<00:00:28.500> on

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
think there'll be a tremendous growth on

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.550 
think there'll be a tremendous growth on
understanding<00:00:29.910> systemic<00:00:30.480> risks<00:00:30.840> things<00:00:31.320> like

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
understanding systemic risks things like

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.370 
understanding systemic risks things like
crowded<00:00:32.399> trades<00:00:33.050> understanding<00:00:34.050> when<00:00:34.200> there

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
crowded trades understanding when there

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.170 
crowded trades understanding when there
are<00:00:34.500> economic<00:00:35.130> macroeconomic<00:00:36.000> imbalances

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
are economic macroeconomic imbalances

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.350 
are economic macroeconomic imbalances
and<00:00:36.960> looking<00:00:37.230> at<00:00:37.700> fundamentals<00:00:38.700> again<00:00:39.120> much

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and looking at fundamentals again much

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.510 
and looking at fundamentals again much
more<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.960> at<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> same<00:00:40.739> time<00:00:40.980> as<00:00:41.280> we're

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
more and at the same time as we're

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.729 
more and at the same time as we're
focusing<00:00:42.450> much<00:00:42.629> more<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.930> understanding

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
focusing much more on understanding

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.590 
focusing much more on understanding
those<00:00:43.890> major<00:00:44.190> fault<00:00:44.640> lines<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.149> structural

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
those major fault lines of structural

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600 
those major fault lines of structural
fault<00:00:45.870> lines<00:00:46.079> there's<00:00:46.890> going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.250> much

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
fault lines there's going to be much

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.270 
fault lines there's going to be much
more<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.180> an<00:00:48.750> emphasis<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.410> early<00:00:49.800> warning

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
more of a an emphasis on early warning

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.459 
more of a an emphasis on early warning
and<00:00:50.480> understanding<00:00:51.480> when<00:00:51.690> there<00:00:51.840> are<00:00:51.960> tremors

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
and understanding when there are tremors

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.799 
and understanding when there are tremors
that<00:00:53.399> are<00:00:53.550> being<00:00:53.699> felt<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> major<00:00:54.449> fault

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
that are being felt on the major fault

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.670 
that are being felt on the major fault
lines<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.340> our<00:00:56.489> view<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.680> methodology

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
lines so in our view the methodology

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.290 
lines so in our view the methodology
that<00:00:58.710> we've<00:00:58.980> come<00:00:59.190> up<00:00:59.219> with<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.059> integrate

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
that we've come up with is to integrate

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.160 
that we've come up with is to integrate
a<00:01:00.750> stress<00:01:01.410> library<00:01:02.010> where<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:02.940> source<00:01:03.329> stress

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
a stress library where we source stress

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.899 
a stress library where we source stress
scenarios<00:01:04.710> from<00:01:04.949> thought<00:01:05.280> leaders<00:01:05.670> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
scenarios from thought leaders and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.490 
scenarios from thought leaders and
actually<00:01:07.520> track<00:01:08.520> how<00:01:08.549> they<00:01:09.060> perform<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
actually track how they perform in the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.590 
actually track how they perform in the
market<00:01:10.830> place<00:01:11.010> really<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.420> can

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
market place really and so we can

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.510 
market place really and so we can
actually<00:01:12.960> see<00:01:13.200> when<00:01:13.920> there's<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.220> tipping

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
actually see when there's a tipping

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.850 
actually see when there's a tipping
point<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:15.060> those<00:01:15.270> scenarios<00:01:15.630> escalate<00:01:16.560> from

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
point in those scenarios escalate from

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.550 
point in those scenarios escalate from
being<00:01:17.400> potential<00:01:17.970> invisible<00:01:18.630> risks<00:01:18.990> to

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
being potential invisible risks to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.499 
being potential invisible risks to
actually<00:01:20.009> visible<00:01:20.820> risks<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
actually visible risks in the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.620 
actually visible risks in the
marketplace<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:23.130> think<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.580> discipline<00:01:24.420> of

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
marketplace so I think the discipline of

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.170 
marketplace so I think the discipline of
risk<00:01:25.229> management<00:01:25.409> overall<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.090> be

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
risk management overall is going to be

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.950 
risk management overall is going to be
much<00:01:27.479> more<00:01:27.890> around<00:01:28.909> integrating<00:01:29.909> both<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
much more around integrating both the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.289 
much more around integrating both the
art<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> science<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.250> subjective<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
art and the science the subjective and

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.960 
art and the science the subjective and
the<00:01:33.750> quantitative<00:01:34.670> aspect<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.820> risk

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
the quantitative aspect of risk

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.469 
the quantitative aspect of risk
management<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.320> able<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.970> look<00:01:38.970> at<00:01:39.150> stress
