I'm going to start in the back here and

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:39.880

sides and then last the top now her hair

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.610 
sides and then last the top now her hair
is<00:00:42.079> finer<00:00:42.499> it's<00:00:43.280> not<00:00:43.519> real<00:00:43.789> you<00:00:44.089> know<00:00:44.210> I<00:00:44.620> would

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
is finer it's not real you know I would

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.430 
is finer it's not real you know I would
say<00:00:45.769> it's<00:00:45.890> finer<00:00:46.129> texture<00:00:47.050> so<00:00:48.050> you<00:00:48.079> but<00:00:48.350> you

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
say it's finer texture so you but you

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.079 
say it's finer texture so you but you
still<00:00:48.499> want<00:00:48.739> to<00:00:48.920> make<00:00:49.039> sure<00:00:49.249> you<00:00:49.429> get<00:00:49.670> it<00:00:49.850> all

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
still want to make sure you get it all

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.029 
still want to make sure you get it all
in<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:50.690> don't<00:00:50.899> want<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:51.140> skip<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:51.769> finer

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
in you don't want to skip the finer

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.649 
in you don't want to skip the finer
sections<00:00:52.670> because<00:00:52.909> especially<00:00:53.239> around<00:00:53.480> the

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
sections because especially around the

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.989 
sections because especially around the
hairline<00:00:53.870> it's<00:00:54.859> real<00:00:55.069> easy<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.489> just<00:00:55.789> skip

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:55.999 
hairline it's real easy to just skip

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:58.000 
hairline it's real easy to just skip
those<00:00:56.210> finer<00:00:56.449> pieces<00:00:56.899> and<00:00:57.079> go<00:00:57.199> to<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.499> more

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
those finer pieces and go to the more

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.610 
those finer pieces and go to the more
thicker<00:00:58.760> sections<00:00:59.030> but<00:00:59.929> you<00:01:00.050> still<00:01:00.319> have<00:01:00.499> to

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
thicker sections but you still have to

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.319 
thicker sections but you still have to
really<00:01:00.920> get<00:01:01.069> in<00:01:01.219> those<00:01:01.339> finer<00:01:01.579> pieces<00:01:02.089> and

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
really get in those finer pieces and

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.240 
really get in those finer pieces and
really<00:01:02.510> foil<00:01:02.929> everything<00:01:03.139> because<00:01:04.070> that's

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
really foil everything because that's

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.490 
really foil everything because that's
what's<00:01:04.460> going<00:01:04.670> to<00:01:04.699> make<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:05.030> difference

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
what's going to make the difference

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.880 
what's going to make the difference
we're<00:01:06.500> going<00:01:06.620> to<00:01:06.680> be<00:01:06.800> weaving<00:01:07.100> everything<00:01:08.890> and

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
we're going to be weaving everything and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.319 
we're going to be weaving everything and
I'm<00:01:10.070> going<00:01:10.219> to<00:01:10.280> take<00:01:10.430> pieces<00:01:10.820> very<00:01:10.969> close

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
I'm going to take pieces very close

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.190 
I'm going to take pieces very close
together<00:01:12.549> we're<00:01:13.549> going<00:01:13.640> to<00:01:13.729> take<00:01:13.880> very<00:01:14.200> small

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
together we're going to take very small

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.289 
together we're going to take very small
sections<00:01:15.799> I'm<00:01:16.040> going<00:01:16.340> to<00:01:16.399> weave<00:01:16.579> everything

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
sections I'm going to weave everything

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.609 
sections I'm going to weave everything
because<00:01:17.570> our<00:01:17.689> goal<00:01:17.869> is<00:01:18.049> to<00:01:18.079> make<00:01:18.409> this<00:01:18.560> look

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
because our goal is to make this look

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.840 
because our goal is to make this look
very<00:01:19.430> bland<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.060> very<00:01:20.390> blended

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.170 

I<00:01:24.880> did<00:01:25.600> mix<00:01:26.380> my<00:01:26.590> bleach<00:01:26.920> pretty<00:01:27.340> thick<00:01:27.640> as<00:01:28.090> I

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
I did mix my bleach pretty thick as I

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.340 
I did mix my bleach pretty thick as I
didn't<00:01:28.450> want<00:01:28.600> it<00:01:28.659> to<00:01:28.690> get<00:01:28.870> into<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.229> other

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
didn't want it to get into the other

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:50.030 
didn't want it to get into the other
hairs

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.680 

when<00:01:51.040> I<00:01:51.070> get<00:01:51.220> it<00:01:51.340> as<00:01:51.430> close<00:01:51.790> to<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:52.150> scalp<00:01:52.450> as

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
when I get it as close to the scalp as

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.770 
when I get it as close to the scalp as
possible

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.340 

and<00:01:57.440> I<00:01:57.530> kind<00:01:57.770> of<00:01:57.830> start<00:01:58.220> it<00:01:58.420> here<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.630> then

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
and I kind of start it here and then

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.490 
and I kind of start it here and then
I'll<00:02:00.470> kind<00:02:00.740> of<00:02:00.860> lightly<00:02:01.760> brush<00:02:02.210> it<00:02:02.240> on<00:02:02.570> closer

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
I'll kind of lightly brush it on closer

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.200 
I'll kind of lightly brush it on closer
to<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.890> scalp<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.460> don't<00:02:04.640> want<00:02:04.760> to<00:02:04.820> put<00:02:05.030> like

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
to the scalp you don't want to put like

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.330 
to the scalp you don't want to put like
a<00:02:05.240> whole<00:02:05.510> bunch<00:02:05.900> of<00:02:06.200> color<00:02:06.440> right<00:02:06.950> at<00:02:07.190> the

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
a whole bunch of color right at the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.240 
a whole bunch of color right at the
scalp<00:02:07.610> because<00:02:08.270> it<00:02:08.479> could<00:02:08.660> lose<00:02:08.840> out<00:02:12.190> for<00:02:13.190> the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
scalp because it could lose out for the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.460 
scalp because it could lose out for the
end<00:02:13.400> pieces<00:02:13.700> where<00:02:14.090> it's<00:02:14.209> too<00:02:14.420> long<00:02:14.630> I'll<00:02:15.260> just

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
end pieces where it's too long I'll just

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.760 
end pieces where it's too long I'll just
flip<00:02:15.740> it<00:02:15.860> on<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.130> foil<00:02:16.459> like<00:02:16.610> that<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:18.590> can

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
flip it on the foil like that you can

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.860 
flip it on the foil like that you can
actually<00:02:18.980> make<00:02:19.430> your<00:02:19.580> foils<00:02:19.940> longer<00:02:20.450> if<00:02:20.690> you

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
actually make your foils longer if you

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.930 
actually make your foils longer if you
if<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.830> like<00:02:22.010> if<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.370> have<00:02:22.520> someone<00:02:22.820> with

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
if you like if you have someone with

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:49.390 
if you like if you have someone with
really<00:02:23.180> long<00:02:23.480> hair<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:24.020> probably<00:02:24.380> suggest<00:02:24.770> that

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
biome now I'm going to remix and finish

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.500 
biome now I'm going to remix and finish
up<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:28.330> top<00:05:28.510> with<00:05:28.810> 30<00:05:29.050> volume<00:05:30.330> first<00:05:31.330> I'm

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
up the top with 30 volume first I'm

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.150 
up the top with 30 volume first I'm
going<00:05:31.630> to<00:05:31.690> do<00:05:31.810> the<00:05:31.930> bang<00:05:32.110> area<00:05:32.440> I'm<00:05:32.950> going<00:05:33.100> to

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160

going to do the bang area I'm going to
do<00:05:33.280> at<00:05:33.370> least<00:05:33.430> two<00:05:33.760> going<00:05:34.330> this<00:05:34.510> way<00:05:34.800> because

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
do at least two going this way because

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:52.219 
do at least two going this way because
we<00:05:36.040> want<00:05:36.220> to<00:05:36.310> get<00:05:36.430> that<00:05:36.580> real<00:05:36.790> close

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:01.989 
all different places so you don't have

00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:05.459 
all different places so you don't have
to<00:06:02.169> do<00:06:03.099> it<00:06:03.219> this<00:06:03.399> way<00:06:03.689> this<00:06:04.689> is<00:06:04.839> the<00:06:04.989> way<00:06:05.110> I<00:06:05.139> like

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:05.469 
to do it this way this is the way I like

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:08.059 
to do it this way this is the way I like
to<00:06:05.619> do<00:06:05.769> it<00:06:05.919> I<00:06:06.129> like<00:06:07.119> to<00:06:07.149> do<00:06:07.329> the<00:06:07.449> top<00:06:07.659> last

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:08.069 
to do it I like to do the top last

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:11.609 
to do it I like to do the top last
because<00:06:09.069> that's<00:06:09.819> really<00:06:10.110> usually<00:06:11.110> the<00:06:11.439> most

00:06:11.609 --> 00:06:11.619 
because that's really usually the most

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:14.819 
because that's really usually the most
damaged<00:06:12.009> part<00:06:12.279> of<00:06:12.369> the<00:06:12.459> hair<00:06:13.079> because<00:06:14.079> that's

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:14.829 
damaged part of the hair because that's

00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:16.859 
damaged part of the hair because that's
where<00:06:15.219> we<00:06:15.399> would<00:06:15.579> rank<00:06:15.909> the<00:06:16.089> most<00:06:16.269> and<00:06:16.569> curl<00:06:16.749> at

00:06:16.859 --> 00:06:16.869 
where we would rank the most and curl at

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:19.559 
where we would rank the most and curl at
the<00:06:16.899> most<00:06:17.339> and<00:06:18.339> that's<00:06:18.759> where<00:06:18.969> we<00:06:19.089> style<00:06:19.389> at

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:19.569 
the most and that's where we style at

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:22.859 
the most and that's where we style at
the<00:06:19.599> most<00:06:20.610> so<00:06:21.610> I<00:06:21.639> usually<00:06:21.969> like<00:06:22.179> to<00:06:22.419> do<00:06:22.629> that

00:06:22.859 --> 00:06:22.869 
the most so I usually like to do that

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:24.899 
the most so I usually like to do that
part<00:06:23.199> last<00:06:23.379> because<00:06:23.889> I<00:06:23.919> said<00:06:24.219> it's<00:06:24.519> probably

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:24.909 
part last because I said it's probably

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:25.889 
part last because I said it's probably
where<00:06:25.029> you're<00:06:25.119> going<00:06:25.239> to<00:06:25.300> want<00:06:25.479> the<00:06:25.599> collar<00:06:25.809> on

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:25.899 
where you're going to want the collar on

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:30.179 
where you're going to want the collar on
the<00:06:26.139> least<00:06:26.319> amount<00:06:26.559> of<00:06:26.679> time<00:06:28.979> I'm<00:06:29.979> going<00:06:30.129> to

00:06:30.179 --> 00:06:30.189 
the least amount of time I'm going to

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:32.309 
the least amount of time I'm going to
take<00:06:30.339> the<00:06:30.489> rest<00:06:30.639> of<00:06:30.759> this<00:06:30.909> top<00:06:31.119> section<00:06:31.419> coming

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 
take the rest of this top section coming

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:34.469 
take the rest of this top section coming
sideways<00:06:32.709> because<00:06:33.489> she<00:06:33.819> parts<00:06:34.119> her<00:06:34.149> hair<00:06:34.239> on

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 
sideways because she parts her hair on

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:36.659 
sideways because she parts her hair on
the<00:06:34.569> side<00:06:34.809> and<00:06:35.199> I<00:06:35.469> just<00:06:36.159> like<00:06:36.309> the<00:06:36.459> way<00:06:36.489> it

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:36.669 
the side and I just like the way it

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:48.260 
the side and I just like the way it
comes<00:06:36.879> out

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.659 

now<00:06:49.169> that<00:06:49.349> her<00:06:49.530> hair<00:06:49.770> is<00:06:49.800> thicker<00:06:50.160> on<00:06:50.370> the<00:06:50.400> top

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
now that her hair is thicker on the top

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.640 
now that her hair is thicker on the top
part<00:06:50.910> of<00:06:50.970> her<00:06:51.090> hair<00:06:51.300> and<00:06:51.599> in<00:06:51.900> some<00:06:52.110> sections<00:06:52.500> on

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
part of her hair and in some sections on

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.020 
part of her hair and in some sections on
the<00:06:52.740> crown<00:06:52.949> you<00:06:53.310> want<00:06:53.460> to<00:06:53.520> make<00:06:53.639> sure<00:06:53.669> that

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
the crown you want to make sure that

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.540 
the crown you want to make sure that
you're<00:06:54.210> using<00:06:54.240> enough<00:06:54.750> bleach<00:06:55.110> to<00:06:56.009> saturate

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
you're using enough bleach to saturate

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.610 
you're using enough bleach to saturate
the<00:06:56.699> hair<00:06:56.930> because<00:06:57.930> if<00:06:58.139> you're<00:06:58.289> not<00:06:58.319> using

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 
the hair because if you're not using

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.589 
the hair because if you're not using
enough<00:06:58.860> bleach<00:06:59.310> it's<00:06:59.580> not<00:06:59.789> going<00:07:00.000> to<00:07:00.090> process

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:00.599 
enough bleach it's not going to process

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:03.950 
enough bleach it's not going to process
evenly<00:07:01.639> when<00:07:02.639> it<00:07:02.729> add<00:07:02.880> more<00:07:02.910> bleach<00:07:03.599> to<00:07:03.870> the

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 
evenly when it add more bleach to the

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.839 
evenly when it add more bleach to the
thicker<00:07:04.199> sections<00:07:04.470> or<00:07:04.979> more<00:07:05.160> color<00:07:05.370> periods

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:05.849 
thicker sections or more color periods

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:10.460 
thicker sections or more color periods
in<00:07:06.030> color<00:07:06.270> okay<00:07:07.819> now<00:07:08.819> she's<00:07:09.060> off<00:07:09.270> boiled<00:07:09.780> and

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:10.470 
in color okay now she's off boiled and

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:11.839 
in color okay now she's off boiled and
