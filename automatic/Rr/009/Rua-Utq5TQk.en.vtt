00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.590
 One of today's centerpiece of our new video on guts but pull it out there is one hear 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.590
 my doctor cooler and immediately in HD 40 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:09.709
 VAT 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.709
 b 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:16.289
 open is still whether Eck Lauper proposal 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.290
 and to give it away 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.230
 Of course, I have nothing against it 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.130
 Coleman's approach I would have shown you here animals like the EU on board 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.410
 Then there's my three weeks stuck with an Intel i7 2600k 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.789
 and after the test psychic just fine to rebuild and then to the 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:40.109
 Nieminen go on he writes under this video team whose comment 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:44.100
 and thus best explained Prof just had the left 14 had 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.270
 would like to 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.190
 so with Inter and you see I have again replenishment and legally everything 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.160
 do it once 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.040
 around 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.100
 first time 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.590
 the packaging of the Sioner d14 the whole as well as the NRC percent 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.600
 Goose wonderfully packed and partner 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.820
 So also environmentally friendly 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.480
 and now look at the boxing 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.800
 Broßmann Boxing could do a few things 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.720
 the name of the warrior still Perrin has the 14 price sugar 65 euros 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.220
 Total weight Hausen 2 to 40 grams 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.580
 for all standard Intel and Office - if he is synonymous for fm1 or the eleventh and 50th 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.850
 Varieties suitable 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.850
 so and now make these peculiarities the last time the and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.900
 Have facts 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.190
 we come to board 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.810
 to the wine NRC 14 up here the little box with those 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.579
 Ingredients in quotation marks which you can use to install content anyway 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:41.870
 need 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.720
 now can search 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.690
 Plaschg unloads that clearly from the Cayenne, CVC has not lain down, I come deep 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.200
 others are around here 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.119
 There are two different festivals set for sign up for the office 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.120
 he dead in these and the beginning of the film felt fat 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.730
 and why the city is assumed to be automatic 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.960
 Revenues covered Red has just not quite simple yet before some 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.450
 cities 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.679
 and although referees charge 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:09.920
 their own account 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.850
 and at one offers Red who is stable enough to keep these mistakes 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:19.849
 here we go now Coleman Parkes for him has the 14 behind 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:20.609
 small 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:25.169
 Dopfer Weaknesses out announces the list contains in Tirana 1 the 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:27.349
 Internet presence of Ochtrup 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.840
 Occasionally you also have your rights Omen reviewing the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.169
 in-laws 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:34.829
 around I can still only open missing 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:35.870
 so that Sinti 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.509
 Of course, there are extra ingredients in wholesale and retail 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.509
 if I have the glasses until the 19 the 7 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.439
 and now we come to the same 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.999
 Monster or in quotation marks Borken 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:53.489
 Weckelt the nh-d14 is really massive 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:57.359
 a thousand and twenty we also have a whole lot you can afford 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.659
 Imagine that he will choose a whole lot more world 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.690
 Internet about what everything can do 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.359
 and you can with meadows 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.689
 Köhler really a the 7 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.499
 Super overclock 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:14.249
 and that fits for example the box Köhler of departments does not create 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.249
 Nature is in Haiti 14 easy way 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.819
 It is very nice to see it 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.599
 Dell Köhl bodies are each connected to six Heatpipe Snow customers 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:32.289
 around the middle there is a 14 contender outside at 12 then of course 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:34.309
 hope ahead 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:38.529
 and as you can see very nicely now as a highlight packed very stable 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.409
 and please note 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:46.879
 to set for plants if and when to be freed from it 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.879
 then Prof 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.219
 By the way, the whole thing was made of aluminum and pop 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:08.849
 the whole is of course mediated 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:14.339
 around here so here on both sides sees the six heat pipes each 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:17.419
 Waste heat in the respective critics threw 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.799
 do so now 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.120
 I feel right 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.529
 exactly 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:27.229
 Here you see 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.849
 as I said the monster so he's really pretty big the measurements 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.190
 and the 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.340
 m Müller are now 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.640
 160 940 times 130 millimeters 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.650
 that means they really need space and so 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.379
 for education small had prefers lead where Zuma 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:49.180
 Ulrich Küchl or wherever he might like to understand 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.560
 it is enough for the 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.210
 in Halifax in one not 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.770
 the custom already a full-grown housing 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.900
 so I will too 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.020
 Enermax housing recently took the lead 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.219
 He will see all that in there 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.249
 how the Renner the fourteenth 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:08.249
 Unlike in Hartz IV 14 is 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:14.089
 maybe the IMK has seen it, I hinted to him Markus Manzinger 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:17.080
 also the north curve then there are two parts 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.490
 small part shows the direction of rotation of the fan 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.569
 the other case shows 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.819
 Newton's direction of the exhaust 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.000
 why should that be good then actually 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.819
 Some say you can be a city or a cooler 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:31.350
 and shopping in the direction 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.719
 that is not right 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:37.659
 if the mader board or housing is good you can leave one 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:39.389
 cooler and cpu-cooler 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.310
 if you are open in two directions 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.539
 it depends 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.869
 Wiemann the air circulation in his computer plans something so you can plan is 

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:49.260
 not God-given but 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.070
 you can really think about the cdu-faction 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.999
 in a pitch she has to look either 

00:05:55.999 --> 00:06:00.659
 fresh air is attracted from behind and then goes somewhere form if 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:01.969
 you have air cooling 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:03.409
 or the other way around 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:06.879
 Formally air is sucked in or on the side and the 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:08.450
 Exhaust air goes out the back 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.110
 these are two different choices and that's usually 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.150
 also possible 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.150
 To conclude that there are still a few impressions on board 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.760
 UBS got out of thin air by the cooler it is a little as he built with shouts 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:23.969
 too short and to do 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:25.509
 see below 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:30.069
 Regarding super processed I have space there as well without incentive deals 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:33.069
 in contrast to other cheaper ones 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:37.080
 For example, Köhler can not go on strike here 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.800
 at the us broker I think 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.309
 and while you still are 

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:46.539
 The pictures have Kurt Schramm I come back to the raffle 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.889
 Signs as I said I will block them Koller 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:52.129
 with a huge 2006 Oscar 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:56.389
 and all of this gets going two and a half to three weeks into a test system 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:58.529
 I rebuilt the whole thing again 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:01.350
 and then I will click here 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.300
 Nature in Haiti 15 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.599
 Andy Nieminen or the one who passes the majority among these 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.669
 1 comment why exactly he or she writes 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:12.180
 Thiemann is he this 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.490
 who must have this artist zol may 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.529
 again in writing the whole 

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:23.519
 - As I said under this Lucien commentary please write this up 

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:25.499
 for the second and 2011 

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:26.840
 then the winner 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.849
 we knew 

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:31.409
 thanks to Otto Frey and we will see each other 

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:34.409
 next the boy against 13 

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:36.969
