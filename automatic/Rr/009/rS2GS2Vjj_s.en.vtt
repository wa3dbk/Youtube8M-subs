00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.350
 of course the local factor and you have to 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.880
 know how to take advantage of all that bali 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.010
 but this is a match that you have to 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.690
 play with intelligence 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.129
 tranquility 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.840
 knowing that we have three points 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.850
 go ahead and what 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.920
 It can be a very important step in the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.560
 world route for us uruguay there 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.740
 to beat him with football with character 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.989
 game uruguay a selected the most 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.310
 experienced and from america and maybe that 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.010
 be one of the 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.940
 of the unique lagoon that could 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.340
 to have 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.920
 Your Dubai Process has been very long 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.079
 also know how to play these games and 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.290
 we are aware of that and 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.420
 that's why we should go 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.460
 with enough intelligence to 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.930
 win the box for us the final 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.610
 I think we 're not going to give a final with 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.190
 a great rival with who has very good 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.660
 players but we are local 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.150
 maybe we come with that thorn of not 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.010
 have achieved the victory with Bolivia and 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.550
 because we did not deserve to win and good 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.570
 Now we have to give him the rest for 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.560
 this match recover 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.650
 our who come playing we come 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.540
 showing 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.460
 those of all parties here of Venezuelans 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.260
 at home I have to be a party 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.780
 very complicated of uruguay are also 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.310
 needy and they come to play football 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.810
 as I say that a performance at the end 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.160
 for us it can be our 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.410
 virtues we are going to get a uruguay 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.070
 that is not going to despair that with the 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.040
 point for it can be good that they go 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.570
 to be waiting for counterpower 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.490
 liquidate us so we have to be very 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.510
 smart 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.130
 with the quality of players that we have 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.350
 in the front area we can surely 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.930
 unbalance so it's going to be 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.119
 fundamental to be able to maintain that 0 as 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.410
 always back and know that in the area 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.560
 in front we have players who can 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.150
 Mark has great players 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.400
 players of the highest level I think that 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.560
 with that pressure 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.380
 at that level of player I do not think that 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.429
 Affect is not a very large selection 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.770
 we know that we will have complicated 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.320
 but we have to use our our 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.709
 court in favor the fans also have 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.950
 to play a factor for our and good 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.520
 between all hard we are not 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.620
 separating for 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.350
 and good following you have to follow 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.700
 trusting in the group I think we're 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.190
 here on our own merits we depend on 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.530
 ourselves and we have to think about 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.420
 remain strong and have to be 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.610
 faithful to our style we have 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.620
 that being an intense team propose 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.299
 obviously propose to look for match 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.580
 the matches with Uruguay and lately 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:48.319
 they have been very closed and I have already 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.670
 realized that already with that with this 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.510
 way they wanted to go up 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.450
 our claw of desire and if not not 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.209
 it wins us and we have to do 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.670
 here on the cover of the team that was that 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.560
 we went against Colombia from I tell you in the 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.739
 at the level of intensity that was given 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.739
 to the match
