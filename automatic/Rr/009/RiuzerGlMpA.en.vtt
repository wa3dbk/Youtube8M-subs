00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
is on as strong as it should be it

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.190 
is on as strong as it should be it
should<00:01:46.350> look<00:01:46.770> something<00:01:47.040> like<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.540> you

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
should look something like this and you

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.929 
should look something like this and you
want<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> use<00:01:49.530> more<00:01:49.650> of<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.920> patting<00:01:50.430> motion<00:01:50.460> to

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
want to use more of a patting motion to

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.080 
want to use more of a patting motion to
put<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.270> instead<00:01:51.510> of<00:01:51.740> like<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.580> windshield

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
put on instead of like the windshield

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.149 
put on instead of like the windshield
wiper<00:01:54.299> motion<00:01:54.750> just<00:01:55.229> because<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.830> tends<00:01:56.070> to

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
wiper motion just because that tends to

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.789 
wiper motion just because that tends to
smudge<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.420> cream<00:01:57.750> shadow<00:01:58.080> underneath<00:01:58.409> and

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
smudge the cream shadow underneath and

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.320 
smudge the cream shadow underneath and
then<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.040> doesn't<00:01:59.070> give<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.729> pop<00:02:00.090> and

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
then it doesn't give it that pop and

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.060 
then it doesn't give it that pop and
intensity<00:02:00.840> okay<00:02:01.260> now<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.409> should<00:02:01.770> look<00:02:01.890> all

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
intensity okay now I should look all

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.370 
intensity okay now I should look all
dark<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.610> raccoon<00:02:03.000> e<00:02:03.150> and<00:02:03.330> we're<00:02:03.840> gonna<00:02:03.990> take

dark and raccoon e and we're gonna take
a<00:02:04.680> black<00:02:05.310> liner<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.820> put<00:02:05.970> this<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.330> our<00:02:06.540> water

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
a black liner and put this in our water

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.370 
a black liner and put this in our water
line<00:02:07.049> just<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.380> give<00:02:07.650> it<00:02:07.680> even<00:02:08.009> more<00:02:09.380> blackness

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
line just to give it even more blackness

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.259 
line just to give it even more blackness
it's<00:02:10.860> really<00:02:11.190> hard<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.489> do<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.850> when<00:02:12.120> you

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
it's really hard to do this when you

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.830 
it's really hard to do this when you
have<00:02:12.480> no<00:02:12.720> mirror<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:15.239> you<00:02:15.330> just<00:02:15.480> want<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.690> put

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
have no mirror and you just want to put

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.930 
have no mirror and you just want to put
it<00:02:15.930> all<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.290> way<00:02:16.320> along<00:02:16.500> even<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.370> your<00:02:17.640> inner

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
it all the way along even in your inner

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.550 
it all the way along even in your inner
corner<00:02:18.269> okay<00:02:18.630> don't<00:02:18.870> push<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.049> black<00:02:19.320> liner

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
corner okay don't push a black liner

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.610 
corner okay don't push a black liner
away<00:02:19.860> quite<00:02:20.280> yet<00:02:20.579> because<00:02:20.790> we<00:02:21.690> still<00:02:21.720> have<00:02:22.019> the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
away quite yet because we still have the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.800 
away quite yet because we still have the
major<00:02:22.920> huge<00:02:23.489> intensity<00:02:24.090> part<00:02:24.299> to<00:02:24.450> do<00:02:24.570> and

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
major huge intensity part to do and

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.900 
major huge intensity part to do and
doesn't<00:02:25.500> have<00:02:25.680> anything<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.100> do<00:02:26.370> with<00:02:26.610> big

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
doesn't have anything to do with big

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.360 
doesn't have anything to do with big
black<00:02:27.239> raccoon<00:02:27.690> eyes<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.769> this<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.160> part

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
black raccoon eyes so this is the part

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.280 
black raccoon eyes so this is the part
where<00:02:29.519> we're<00:02:29.670> gonna<00:02:29.730> take<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.150> down<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:31.140> she

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
where we're gonna take it down and she

where we're gonna take it down and she
has<00:02:31.410> sort<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.739> like<00:02:32.120> streams<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.360> don't<00:02:33.660> know

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
has sort of like streams I don't know

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.910 
has sort of like streams I don't know
what<00:02:33.930> they're<00:02:34.170> supposed<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.650> be<00:02:34.770> but<00:02:34.860> I

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
getting like a thin line or starting out

this direction and then back in and you
want<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.099> start<00:02:59.250> out<00:02:59.340> short<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.849> get<00:03:00.000> longer

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
want to start out short and get longer

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.729 
want to start out short and get longer
till<00:03:00.750> about<00:03:00.840> there<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.409> then<00:03:01.500> come<00:03:01.530> back

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
till about there and then come back

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.949 
till about there and then come back
short<00:03:02.129> here<00:03:02.310> at<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.459> end<00:03:02.609> so<00:03:03.239> maybe<00:03:03.389> set<00:03:03.780> like

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
short here at the end so maybe set like

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.069 
short here at the end so maybe set like
a<00:03:04.260> point<00:03:05.040> at<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.370> end<00:03:05.400> for<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:05.909> length<00:03:06.090> about

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
a point at the end for the length about

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.940 
a point at the end for the length about
that<00:03:07.439> long<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:07.980> then<00:03:08.069> one<00:03:08.370> in<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.639> middle

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
that long and then one in the middle

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.740 
that long and then one in the middle
show<00:03:10.950> nice<00:03:11.489> long<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:12.030> then<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.359> should<00:03:12.540> put

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
show nice long and then you should put

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.179 
show nice long and then you should put
one<00:03:12.930> in<00:03:13.109> between<00:03:13.439> each<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.829> those<00:03:13.980> that's

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
one in between each of those that's

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.240 
one in between each of those that's
about<00:03:14.430> medium<00:03:14.790> length<00:03:15.620> like<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.799> said<00:03:16.859> it's

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
about medium length like I said it's

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.159 
about medium length like I said it's
really<00:03:17.579> hard<00:03:17.819> to<00:03:17.939> do<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.299> without<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.780> mirror

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
really hard to do this without a mirror

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.319 
really hard to do this without a mirror
so<00:03:19.439> I<00:03:19.470> suggest<00:03:19.980> getting<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.489> mirror<00:03:20.819> which<00:03:21.209> I

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
so I suggest getting a mirror which I

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.550 
so I suggest getting a mirror which I
don't<00:03:21.389> have<00:03:21.750> here<00:03:22.109> right<00:03:22.260> now<00:03:22.379> I'm<00:03:22.530> just

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
don't have here right now I'm just

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.159 
don't have here right now I'm just
trying<00:03:22.889> to<00:03:22.980> use<00:03:23.099> the<00:03:23.129> camera<00:03:25.579> and<00:03:26.959> then<00:03:27.959> just

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
trying to use the camera and then just

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:29.720 
trying to use the camera and then just
smooth<00:03:28.470> out<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.739> lines<00:03:28.919> by<00:03:29.129> going<00:03:29.400> over<00:03:29.489> them

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
smooth out the lines by going over them

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.610 
smooth out the lines by going over them
after<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:30.629> just<00:03:30.840> do<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.049> forward<00:03:31.560> the

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
after and you just do that forward the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.979 
after and you just do that forward the
1i<00:03:31.799> because<00:03:32.220> she<00:03:32.430> left<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:33.150> other<00:03:33.299> I<00:03:33.450> like

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
1i because she left the other I like

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.409 
1i because she left the other I like
this<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.919> even<00:03:35.280> added<00:03:35.489> one<00:03:35.879> more<00:03:35.909> over<00:03:36.389> here

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
this and I even added one more over here

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.789 
this and I even added one more over here
just<00:03:37.040> for<00:03:38.040> an<00:03:38.250> extra<00:03:38.609> line<00:03:38.760> for<00:03:39.120> fun<00:03:39.329> so<00:03:39.799> yeah

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
just for an extra line for fun so yeah

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.699 
just for an extra line for fun so yeah
as<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.340> can<00:03:41.370> tell<00:03:41.699> that's<00:03:42.120> really<00:03:43.049> sort<00:03:43.530> of

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
as you can tell that's really sort of

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.619 
as you can tell that's really sort of

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.379 
weird it looks like I'm like crying
really<00:03:45.930> heavily<00:03:46.199> on<00:03:46.440> one<00:03:46.590> side<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.739> my<00:03:46.859> face<00:03:47.010> I

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
really heavily on one side of my face I

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.439 
really heavily on one side of my face I
have<00:03:48.389> no<00:03:48.690> idea<00:03:49.019> where<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.650> would<00:03:49.769> wear<00:03:50.010> this

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:50.449 
have no idea where you would wear this

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:53.210 
have no idea where you would wear this
wherever<00:03:51.449> you<00:03:51.540> want<00:03:51.870> i<00:03:52.019> guess<00:03:52.049> to<00:03:52.769> a<00:03:52.799> party<00:03:53.190> or

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
wherever you want i guess to a party or

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.729 
wherever you want i guess to a party or
anything<00:03:53.690> so<00:03:54.690> i<00:03:55.049> guess<00:03:55.199> i<00:03:55.349> should<00:03:55.530> probably

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
anything so i guess i should probably

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.050 
anything so i guess i should probably
finish<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.310> look<00:03:56.430> there's<00:03:56.669> only<00:03:56.879> a<00:03:57.000> couple

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
finish the look there's only a couple

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.050 
finish the look there's only a couple
things<00:03:57.599> left<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.349> one<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:58.949> them<00:03:59.099> is<00:03:59.250> mascara

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
things left and one of them is mascara

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.879 
things left and one of them is mascara
now<00:04:00.659> i<00:04:00.690> have<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.930> feeling<00:04:01.199> with<00:04:01.440> this<00:04:01.530> look<00:04:01.739> she

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
now i have a feeling with this look she

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.830 
now i have a feeling with this look she
probably<00:04:02.099> actually<00:04:02.579> has<00:04:02.940> really<00:04:03.269> big<00:04:03.510> lashes

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
probably actually has really big lashes

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.050 
probably actually has really big lashes
but<00:04:04.229> it's<00:04:04.379> so<00:04:04.530> hard<00:04:04.739> to<00:04:04.799> tell<00:04:04.889> because<00:04:05.280> of<00:04:05.519> all

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
but it's so hard to tell because of all

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.149 
but it's so hard to tell because of all
of<00:04:06.120> this<00:04:06.659> black<00:04:07.079> going<00:04:07.409> on<00:04:07.620> up<00:04:07.769> there<00:04:07.919> that

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
of this black going on up there that

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.159 
of this black going on up there that
they<00:04:08.250> just<00:04:08.400> blend<00:04:08.819> right<00:04:09.120> in<00:04:09.299> so<00:04:09.989> I'm<00:04:10.079> not

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
they just blend right in so I'm not

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.869 
they just blend right in so I'm not
gonna<00:04:10.319> put<00:04:10.500> on<00:04:10.650> any<00:04:10.859> fake<00:04:11.099> lashes<00:04:11.370> I'm<00:04:11.669> just

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
gonna put on any fake lashes I'm just

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.149 
gonna put on any fake lashes I'm just
gonna<00:04:12.000> curl<00:04:12.299> them<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:12.750> put<00:04:12.870> on<00:04:12.989> mascara<00:04:13.349> it

gonna curl them and put on mascara it

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.710 
gonna curl them and put on mascara it
probably<00:04:14.579> would<00:04:14.729> have<00:04:14.819> made<00:04:15.000> sense<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.449> do

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720
