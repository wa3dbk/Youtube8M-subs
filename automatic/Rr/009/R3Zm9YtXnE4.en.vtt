all this cool maneuvering and flanking

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.060 
all this cool maneuvering and flanking
and<00:00:36.300> having<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.660> big<00:00:36.930> wall<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.500> Steel<00:00:37.829> in

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and having this big wall of Steel in

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.190 
and having this big wall of Steel in
front<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:38.879> pretty<00:00:39.090> cool<00:00:39.180> how<00:00:40.050> is

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
front of you so it's pretty cool how is

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.930 
front of you so it's pretty cool how is
it<00:00:40.350> like<00:00:40.530> changing<00:00:41.190> from<00:00:41.460> something<00:00:41.820> like

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
it like changing from something like

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.260 
it like changing from something like
close<00:00:42.090> quarters<00:00:42.660> or<00:00:42.899> something<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.379> large<00:00:43.649> i

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
close quarters or something so large i

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.639 
close quarters or something so large i
think<00:00:45.270> that's<00:00:45.719> that's<00:00:46.110> really<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.410> strength

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
think that's that's really the strength

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.900 
think that's that's really the strength
of<00:00:46.800> battlefield<00:00:47.129> i<00:00:47.190> think<00:00:47.399> because<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.760> is

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
of battlefield i think because it is

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.190 
of battlefield i think because it is
this<00:00:48.149> game<00:00:48.390> where<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:48.989> both<00:00:49.140> of

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
this game where you can have both of

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.650 
this game where you can have both of
these<00:00:49.440> really<00:00:49.890> really<00:00:50.850> strong<00:00:51.059> experiences

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
these really really strong experiences

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.750

in one so what we're trying to do with

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.520 
in one so what we're trying to do with
the<00:00:53.820> dlc<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.780> really<00:00:54.989> focus<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.410> those

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530
