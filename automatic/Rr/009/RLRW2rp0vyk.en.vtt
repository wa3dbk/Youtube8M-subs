00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 do not 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.860
 very good all keep in situ at 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.420
 gamer and this with an analysis of the 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.460
 Osiris setter for the cheese 0 al 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.650
 complete the level 42 as you know there 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.690
 a pair of armors one of level 36 and 42 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.220
 and what I have is the full 42 audi 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.080
 is a handsome team is the helmet what 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.660
 I just bought and I'm still freaking out with him 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.270
 finally we go there or a lack to put me 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.130
 this and I am already fully equipped 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.720
 with osiris I also have to do with 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.640
 the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.110
 now for you to see it I only have this 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.700
 but if I'm not wrong there are others to know 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.100
 of osiris also in order is so that what 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.510
 you see like this above I think that this one 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.850
 is a little better the other one looks 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.740
 as a little bland but they are good - looking 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.360
 both are very handsome especially 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.970
 with the helmet he does it quite 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.290
 seriously, I'm going to begin to pass the 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.690
 advantages and skills of the pieces of 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.399
 armor starting with the boots I think 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.930
 that some of the different 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.579
 advantages for example these are rifles 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.260
 automatic and special but if I do not 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.780
 wrong the titan has as ammunition 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.730
 for heavy weapons in the boots of the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.290
 level 42 sites right now what 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.910
 also reminds later on at 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.530
 I'll upload a video of the armor of 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.000
 titan completely because also the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.130
 got me missing 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.890
 the hunter gauntlets but that's 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.360
 everything and as you can see I'm having a 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.100
 bit fast because there are a lot of 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.750
 skills to teach and they are also not 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.220
 as important as that is , if these 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.580
 you want for that moment the video and what 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.040
 you can read and see quietly are 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.170
 pretty good or as we already do 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.170
 we expected are centered in crucible and 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.760
 but they are very good especially this 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.530
 from here reduces the recovery time 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.030
 of the city when collecting an orb of light 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.860
 I think this is one of the advantages that 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.630
 they came with left softworks as you know 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.910
 before there was the one who picked up an orb 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.500
 that generated health that was fine 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.720
 but basically for the inclusion of 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.910
 I think in the end it 's difficult but it 's 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.250
 the interesting link income no no what 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.170
 I've probably tried yet 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.550
 I'll probably load the pomegranate 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.020
 considerably fast and it shows in 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.000
 physicists here you have it all I'm also going 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.350
 to pass or be the band exiled to 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.300
 that you see the description also and how 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.039
 he has the truth is that to be a 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.110
 distinctive wizard that are usually 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.390
 pretty little remarkable enough 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.190
 well and it shows well 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.210
 in short guys all as I said soon 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.039
 about the abandonment of the following 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.420
 they practice at level 42 with all their 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.500
 advantages and abilities also makes 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.330
 few go up 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.040
 more main is that you can get in 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.380
 mercury which has an expert damage 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.760
 with main damage and as always 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.160
 you will have my channel below a description 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.290
 in case you want to take a look at wimer 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.430
 and hd videos of ball guys but you 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.130
 will like the video is only from heart 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.690
 like your comment there is a lot that 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.560
 you are and see you in the next video 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.560
 goodbye
