00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.069
 And then everyone will be quiet, for those who do not 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.839
 Do you know me? I'm abu. I came today to 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.840
 give some poems so you can 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.830
 improve your gameplay by remembering course 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.200
 because I'm not a professional player 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.849
 far from just platinum 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.100
 but I believe that many of you have 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.800
 some difficulties that can lead to 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.260
 help with my video so let's go 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.269
 basic congo 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.830
 It may be that many already know but I 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.949
 I think it's always good to make it clear 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.189
 How do you do that is very simple? 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.700
 you just shake it and and what almost 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.809
 at the same time this is going to cause that 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.329
 you play the network and automatically 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.129
 that as soon as the network ends animation 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.680
 Just how are you doing this almost? 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.480
 instantly 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.460
 get yours that will hit as if 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.440
 you were in the first position or 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.500
 whether it is going to be much larger than 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.500
 normal 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.100
 farm animals 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.649
 if you have against a law n boring with 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.690
 banana a load for example has to 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.430
 keep the maximum distance from the attack 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.159
 to avoid body damage as they go 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.260
 cause this is good because if the enemy 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.780
 attempt to have you will hit 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.540
 in it and even or even to your 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.310
 as it teaches before to be able to 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.229
 make him go away and then he'll think 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.530
 twice if he should or not up 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.869
 of you keep tanks 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.240
 good it is no accident that every good player 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.820
 says that the air of winning the game always 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.590
 over 75 gold purchase major says 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.549
 seriously this can keep you alive more 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.530
 time in law n 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.119
 and will ensure stronger and will ensure 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.549
 more gold so will do a lot 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.790
 Difference if you buy will only do 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.790
 good 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.460
 if you notice that users of your 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.689
 and you have not 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.240
 has no 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.680
 always try to use your darkness this 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.049
 It will make the day the enemy is 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.509
 seen before boarding 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.240
 then where you should put puts a 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.399
 on the river witch and a ship always blush 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.560
 Positioning legal for when he enters 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.829
 in the gap it has already picked up and there you go 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.010
 able to see his position in 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.320
 fight 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.510
 How do you know who has one of the 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.070
 the biggest networks of the game so 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.210
 position an ink but it is not as 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.620
 difficult 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.020
 remember that you are going to hit who 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.670
 you're closer and you're not going to kill yourself 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.220
 to be able to focus on the eternal enemy 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.250
 you'll be behind your team beating 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.020
 and whoever is in your queen 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.330
 you're probably going to have to hit the 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.310
 wall after it will pukha you locally 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.260

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.050

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.700
 you and you will not have to not hit 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.360
 be it or you'll end up dying to 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.490
