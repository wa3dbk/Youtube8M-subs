00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.539 
twisted the wire around do the same
right<00:01:13.070> there<00:01:13.420> and<00:01:14.420> then<00:01:14.869> right<00:01:15.470> there<00:01:15.770> I<00:01:15.979> just

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
through that little hole that goes right

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.480 
through that little hole that goes right
under<00:01:22.909> there<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.090> then<00:01:23.390> just<00:01:24.220> snaked<00:01:25.220> it<00:01:25.369> on

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
down to here and I just like kind of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.030 
down to here and I just like kind of
like<00:01:29.090> twisted<00:01:29.780> it<00:01:30.070> over<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:33.290> did<00:01:33.560> it<00:01:33.799> I

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
like twisted it over and it did it I

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.760 
like twisted it over and it did it I
mean<00:01:34.460> I<00:01:34.700> really<00:01:35.390> don't<00:01:35.630> want<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.840> my<00:01:35.960> body<00:01:35.990> for

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
mean I really don't want to my body for

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.420 
mean I really don't want to my body for
this<00:01:36.890> thing<00:01:37.240> one<00:01:38.240> I<00:01:38.570> mean<00:01:39.229> my<00:01:39.650> engine<00:01:40.070> always

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
this thing one I mean my engine always

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.600 
this thing one I mean my engine always
gets<00:01:40.670> super<00:01:41.060> hot<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:41.659> I<00:01:41.990> guess<00:01:42.829> just<00:01:43.130> lifts<00:01:43.490> a

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
gets super hot so I guess just lifts a

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.679 
gets super hot so I guess just lifts a
lot<00:01:43.790> of<00:01:43.880> air<00:01:44.060> in<00:01:44.240> now<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:45.040> also<00:01:46.360> now<00:01:47.360> that<00:01:47.570> I've

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
lot of air in now and also now that I've

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.310 
lot of air in now and also now that I've
got<00:01:47.930> my<00:01:48.170> baja<00:01:48.680> 5t<00:01:49.100> I<00:01:49.640> barely<00:01:50.630> drive<00:01:50.960> this<00:01:51.110> thing

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
got my baja 5t I barely drive this thing

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.870 
got my baja 5t I barely drive this thing
anymore<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:52.930> so<00:01:54.100> another<00:01:55.100> money<00:01:55.399> bid<00:01:55.670> is

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
anymore and so another money bid is

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.899 
anymore and so another money bid is
right<00:01:56.360> in<00:01:58.509> there

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.889 

right<00:02:03.909> in<00:02:04.030> there<00:02:04.149> I<00:02:04.210> don't<00:02:04.509> know<00:02:04.570> if<00:02:04.659> you<00:02:04.780> can

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
right in there I don't know if you can

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.550 
right in there I don't know if you can
see<00:02:05.049> that<00:02:05.200> but<00:02:05.320> it's<00:02:05.469> like<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.799> little<00:02:05.950> mesh<00:02:06.250> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
see that but it's like a little mesh and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.750 
see that but it's like a little mesh and
on<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.679> aluminum<00:02:09.160> one<00:02:09.190> of<00:02:09.489> like<00:02:10.360> this<00:02:10.690> engine

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
on the aluminum one of like this engine

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.130 
on the aluminum one of like this engine
like<00:02:12.760> thing<00:02:13.030> where<00:02:13.209> like<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.599> angel<00:02:13.900> screws

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
like thing where like the angel screws

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.339 
like thing where like the angel screws
into<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.800> stock<00:02:15.340> was<00:02:15.519> plastic<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.360> there's

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
into the stock was plastic and there's

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.589 
into the stock was plastic and there's
no<00:02:17.410> hole<00:02:17.769> in<00:02:17.890> there<00:02:18.069> but<00:02:18.760> since<00:02:18.970> this<00:02:19.090> is<00:02:19.239> metal

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
no hole in there but since this is metal

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.020 
no hole in there but since this is metal
it<00:02:20.080> like<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.709> guess<00:02:20.920> he<00:02:21.069> gets<00:02:21.220> worse<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.879> gets

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
it like I guess he gets worse it gets

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.080 
it like I guess he gets worse it gets
hotter<00:02:22.299> so<00:02:22.629> they<00:02:23.620> had<00:02:23.799> this<00:02:24.400> stupid<00:02:24.730> little

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
hotter so they had this stupid little

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.970 
hotter so they had this stupid little
hole<00:02:25.269> right<00:02:25.299> here<00:02:25.510> let's<00:02:26.319> all<00:02:26.500> this<00:02:26.950> in

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
hole right here let's all this in
