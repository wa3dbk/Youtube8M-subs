00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
being her and that's where the WWE is

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.730 
being her and that's where the WWE is
wrong<00:01:57.540> they<00:01:57.719> should<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.960> given<00:01:58.079> CM<00:01:58.380> Punk<00:01:58.619> a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
wrong they should have given CM Punk a

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.440

I<00:02:00.719> think<00:02:00.750> CM<00:02:01.170> Punk<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.619> being<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.979> little

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
I think CM Punk is being a little

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.940 
I think CM Punk is being a little
immature<00:02:02.670> as<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.360> as<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.570> pertains<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.259> CM
