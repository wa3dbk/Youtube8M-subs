something like that

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.760 
something like that
hey<00:02:45.400> maybe<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:46.540> anyways<00:02:46.959> I<00:02:47.080> think<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.530> one

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
hey maybe so anyways I think the one

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.400 
hey maybe so anyways I think the one
recipe<00:02:48.660> works<00:02:49.660> well<00:02:49.959> for<00:02:50.260> two<00:02:52.140> for<00:02:53.140> two<00:02:53.260> of

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
recipe works well for two for two of

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.280 
recipe works well for two for two of
these<00:02:56.640> upside-down<00:02:57.640> cakes<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:58.720> we<00:02:58.900> open<00:02:59.200> the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.250 
these upside-down cakes so we open the
door<00:02:59.500> I<00:03:00.300> feel<00:03:01.300> like<00:03:01.480> this<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:01.750> like<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:01.989> know

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
door I feel like this is like you know

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.979 
door I feel like this is like you know
one<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.440> those<00:03:02.590> Easy<00:03:03.220> Bake<00:03:03.580> Oven<00:03:03.820> things<00:03:04.390> and

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
one of those Easy Bake Oven things and

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.820 
one of those Easy Bake Oven things and
we<00:03:05.590> put<00:03:05.830> it<00:03:05.920> in<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:06.519> it's<00:03:06.940> at<00:03:07.090> 350<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.230> I've

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
we put it in and it's at 350 and I've

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.160 
we put it in and it's at 350 and I've
been<00:03:09.010> heating<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.400> up<00:03:09.489> for<00:03:09.820> quite<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.030> while<00:03:10.239> put

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
been heating it up for quite a while put

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.110 
been heating it up for quite a while put
it<00:03:11.290> in<00:03:11.500> make<00:03:12.220> sure<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.459> blue<00:03:12.610> buttons<00:03:12.910> on

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
it in make sure the blue buttons on

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.800 
it in make sure the blue buttons on
because<00:03:13.630> it<00:03:13.810> keeps<00:03:13.989> going<00:03:14.140> off<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.600> think

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
because it keeps going off and I think

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.940 
because it keeps going off and I think
I'm<00:03:16.870> gonna<00:03:16.959> touch<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:17.410> up<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.590> little<00:03:17.680> bit<00:03:17.890> I

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
I'm gonna touch it up a little bit I

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.430 
I'm gonna touch it up a little bit I
think<00:03:18.100> it<00:03:18.310> should<00:03:18.489> be<00:03:18.519> more<00:03:18.730> like<00:03:18.790> 375<00:03:19.440> because

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
think it should be more like 375 because

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.570 
think it should be more like 375 because
they're<00:03:20.530> not<00:03:20.620> basically<00:03:21.040> trusted

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
they're not basically trusted

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.759 
they're not basically trusted
okay<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.420> then<00:03:22.570> I'm<00:03:22.660> gonna<00:03:22.840> wait<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:23.500> I'll<00:03:23.680> be

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
okay and then I'm gonna wait and I'll be

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.979 
okay and then I'm gonna wait and I'll be
back<00:03:23.920> here<00:03:24.280> we<00:03:24.370> go<00:03:24.489> so<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.600> turned<00:03:25.780> out<00:03:25.870> really

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
back here we go so it turned out really

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.910 
back here we go so it turned out really
well<00:03:26.280> this<00:03:27.280> is<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.610> second<00:03:27.940> of<00:03:28.000> two<00:03:28.330> I<00:03:28.920> the

well this is the second of two I the

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.500 
well this is the second of two I the
oven<00:03:30.160> was<00:03:30.310> too<00:03:30.489> hot<00:03:30.640> for<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.850> first<00:03:31.030> one<00:03:31.239> it

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
oven was too hot for the first one it

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.289 
oven was too hot for the first one it
worked<00:03:31.989> out<00:03:32.110> fine<00:03:32.350> but<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.610> cake<00:03:33.820> wasn't<00:03:34.180> as

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.920 
worked out fine but the cake wasn't as
puffy<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.560> I<00:03:36.540> don't<00:03:37.540> know<00:03:37.600> just<00:03:37.870> the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930
