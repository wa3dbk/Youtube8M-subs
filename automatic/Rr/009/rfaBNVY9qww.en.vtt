you can take another path to the figure

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.660 
you can take another path to the figure
on<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.120> right<00:01:08.620> your<00:01:09.620> eye<00:01:09.650> then<00:01:10.040> follows<00:01:10.490> the

leg up to the left arm and then follows

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.850 
leg up to the left arm and then follows
the<00:01:13.940> direction<00:01:14.450> of<00:01:14.510> this<00:01:14.690> left<00:01:14.930> arm<00:01:15.110> back<00:01:15.680> to

head of the main figure once again and

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.820 
head of the main figure once again and
then<00:01:26.480> rejoin<00:01:26.960> one<00:01:27.170> of<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.350> other<00:01:27.530> paths

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830
