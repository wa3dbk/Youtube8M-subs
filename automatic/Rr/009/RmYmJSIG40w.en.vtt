about<00:01:53.759> our<00:01:53.939> snipers<00:01:54.509> really<00:01:55.170> really<00:01:55.409> weird<00:01:56.090> if

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
about our snipers really really weird if

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.130 
about our snipers really really weird if
you're<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.509> use<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.780> for<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> first

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
you're going to use it for the first

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.539 
you're going to use it for the first
time<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.500> may<00:01:58.619> think<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:59.009> really<00:01:59.369> really

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
time you may think it's really really

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.670 
time you may think it's really really
easy<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.969> mean<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.420> i<00:02:01.020> thought<00:02:01.439> was<00:02:01.560> really

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
easy I mean I i thought was really

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.990 
easy I mean I i thought was really
easier<00:02:02.009> i<00:02:02.070> thought<00:02:02.340> i<00:02:02.490> thought<00:02:02.520> it's<00:02:02.820> going<00:02:02.939> to

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
easier i thought i thought it's going to

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.690 
easier i thought i thought it's going to
be<00:02:03.090> difficult<00:02:03.329> because<00:02:04.070> of<00:02:05.070> how<00:02:05.219> it's<00:02:05.430> about

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
be difficult because of how it's about

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880 
be difficult because of how it's about
intervention<00:02:06.420> was<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.840> comparison<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:07.799> a

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
intervention was and comparison it's a

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.699 
intervention was and comparison it's a
wish<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.190> think<00:02:08.429> using<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.360> sniper<00:02:09.660> it's<00:02:10.530> much

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
wish I think using that sniper it's much

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.229 
wish I think using that sniper it's much
easier<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:11.129> think<00:02:11.160> model<00:02:11.640> for<00:02:11.819> three<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.060> much

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
easier I think model for three is much

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.140 
easier I think model for three is much
easier<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.540> type

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
easier to type

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.110 
easier to type
quick<00:02:13.599> serpent<00:02:13.959> wise<00:02:14.079> and<00:02:14.799> the<00:02:15.790> part<00:02:16.000> is

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
quick serpent wise and the part is

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.759 
quick serpent wise and the part is
really<00:02:16.269> powerful<00:02:16.629> as<00:02:16.930> well<00:02:17.079> it's<00:02:17.620> just

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
really powerful as well it's just

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.140 
really powerful as well it's just
literally<00:02:17.980> just<00:02:18.250> watch<00:02:18.519> foots<00:02:18.790> for<00:02:19.030> many

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
literally just watch foots for many

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.640 
literally just watch foots for many
ranges<00:02:19.390> as<00:02:20.170> far<00:02:20.379> as<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.819> I've<00:02:21.819> used<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.329> and<00:02:22.650> even

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
ranges as far as I I've used it and even

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.449 
ranges as far as I I've used it and even
that<00:02:23.860> long<00:02:23.980> range<00:02:24.780> it's<00:02:25.780> got<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.930> quick<00:02:26.140> scope

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
that long range it's got a quick scope

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.420 
that long range it's got a quick scope
but<00:02:27.459> i<00:02:27.819> also<00:02:28.060> know<00:02:28.209> sisters<00:02:28.750> it's<00:02:29.170> sort<00:02:29.290> of

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.930 
itself so if it's my connection but it
seems<00:03:50.169> tick<00:03:50.470> off<00:03:50.680> alot<00:03:50.979> a<00:03:51.129> long<00:03:51.489> time<00:03:51.729> to

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
actually lower I actually get to a game

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.069 
actually lower I actually get to a game
cuz<00:03:54.760> every<00:03:54.909> type<00:03:55.060> of<00:03:55.090> surgery<00:03:55.389> I<00:03:55.659> would<00:03:55.959> go<00:03:56.049> to

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
cuz every type of surgery I would go to

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.710 
cuz every type of surgery I would go to
lobby<00:03:56.349> but<00:03:57.010> it<00:03:57.099> doesn't<00:03:57.250> collect<00:03:57.599> start<00:03:58.599> the

yeah<00:05:06.750> this<00:05:06.900> is<00:05:06.960> pretty<00:05:07.170> much<00:05:07.410> new<00:05:07.650> game<00:05:07.860> mode

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
yeah this is pretty much new game mode

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.490 
yeah this is pretty much new game mode
and<00:05:08.430> muddle<00:05:08.640> through<00:05:08.940> belief<00:05:09.180> stir<00:05:09.450> that<00:05:10.350> was

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
and muddle through belief stir that was

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.170 
and muddle through belief stir that was
not<00:05:10.650> in<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:10.860> previous<00:05:11.070> club<00:05:11.490> on<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:11.760> warfare

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
not in the previous club on the warfare

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.690 
not in the previous club on the warfare
so<00:05:12.930> yeah<00:05:13.350> overall<00:05:13.800> I<00:05:14.070> say<00:05:14.250> it's<00:05:14.430> a<00:05:14.460> really

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
so yeah overall I say it's a really

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.460 
so yeah overall I say it's a really
really<00:05:14.910> fun<00:05:15.030> game<00:05:15.420> mode<00:05:15.630> to<00:05:15.810> actually<00:05:16.110> play<00:05:16.290> in

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
really fun game mode to actually play in

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.710 
really fun game mode to actually play in
and<00:05:16.620> go<00:05:16.770> for<00:05:16.800> popular<00:05:17.280> tags<00:05:18.030> at<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.300> same<00:05:18.480> time

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
and go for popular tags at the same time

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.690 
and go for popular tags at the same time
so<00:05:19.560> if<00:05:19.680> you're<00:05:19.830> sort<00:05:20.070> of<00:05:20.100> person<00:05:20.460> I<00:05:20.550> would<00:05:20.640> be

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
so if you're sort of person I would be

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.520 
so if you're sort of person I would be
objective<00:05:21.630> and<00:05:21.660> this<00:05:21.810> is<00:05:21.930> pretty<00:05:22.080> much<00:05:22.170> of<00:05:22.410> the

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
objective and this is pretty much of the

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.440 
objective and this is pretty much of the
objective<00:05:22.980> play<00:05:23.190> we<00:05:23.670> feel<00:05:23.880> if<00:05:24.060> you<00:05:24.150> got<00:05:24.180> sort
