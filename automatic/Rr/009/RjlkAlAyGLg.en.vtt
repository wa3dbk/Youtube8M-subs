00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
accident sometimes and that's like a

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.060 
accident sometimes and that's like a
saddest<00:04:42.060> part<00:04:42.300> of<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.570> game<00:04:42.780> you<00:04:42.960> know<00:04:42.990> we<00:04:43.320> we

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
saddest part of the game you know we we

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.490 
saddest part of the game you know we we
proved<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.639> car<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.150> it's<00:04:45.300> still<00:04:45.479> a<00:04:45.510> great

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
proved the car and it's still a great

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.850 
proved the car and it's still a great
car<00:04:46.860> obviously<00:04:47.070> not<00:04:47.669> probably<00:04:48.500> fast<00:04:49.500> enough

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
car obviously not probably fast enough

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.810 
car obviously not probably fast enough
to<00:04:50.550> China's<00:04:50.970> Mercedes<00:04:51.599> all<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.870> time<00:04:52.110> but

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
to China's Mercedes all the time but

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.800 
to China's Mercedes all the time but
it's<00:04:53.820> a<00:04:54.000> it's<00:04:54.470> a<00:04:55.470> very<00:04:55.500> good<00:04:55.919> car<00:04:56.220> and<00:04:56.660> it's<00:04:57.660> a

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
it's a it's a very good car and it's a

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.350 
it's a it's a very good car and it's a
massive<00:04:58.020> improvement<00:04:58.380> from<00:04:59.099> from<00:04:59.789> last<00:05:00.090> year

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
massive improvement from from last year

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.290 
massive improvement from from last year

so you know things go wrong sometimes

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.180 
so you know things go wrong sometimes
but<00:05:03.870> it<00:05:04.050> doesn't<00:05:04.410> mean<00:05:04.560> that<00:05:04.620> you<00:05:04.979> suddenly

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
but it doesn't mean that you suddenly

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.159 
but it doesn't mean that you suddenly
hide<00:05:05.729> the<00:05:05.940> car<00:05:06.180> or<00:05:06.389> you<00:05:06.539> don't<00:05:06.690> like<00:05:06.960> the
