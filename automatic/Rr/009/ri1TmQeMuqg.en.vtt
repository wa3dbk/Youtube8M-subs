00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 he imitated the amount of myths and legends 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.830
 about how this food was made 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.269
 scrap or this low meal 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.590
 nourishingly speaking the truth that I 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.630
 to know the step with this information 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.309
 answered one by one all the questions 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.170
 about this but it's already with 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.279
 us maria jesus barraza 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.039
 nutritionist to worker's hospital 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.470
 to talk about if it's so harmful 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.199
 how they say junk food or not 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.199
 thanks for being here fagot 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:30.929
 good morning if it really is so 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.850
 harmful as we saw in the image this is 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.370
 magic is a little more than I already know 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.230
 I knew they actually show that they try to 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.300
 pretend that they do it only with 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.570
 chicken breast but well it is totally 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.670
 wrong is wrong is impossible 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.550
 what happens is that in a laboratory 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.020
 Pesco dress different brands of nuggets 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.399
 and what I analyze clearly was this thing 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.399
 of bone fat cartilage 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.079
 chicken and mcdonald went out to show 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.449
 that his own processes were like that 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.949
 they were either they are declaring 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.690
 transparency but that no one is that 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.400
 are even those who do not understand 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.020
 a supermarket I say clearly what I will see 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.780
 alone well indeed they are made with 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.820
 this crap in the bottom there's even 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.520
 a worse study in the usa that says that the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.400
 worse worse worse edible for children than 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.650
 Generally, how crafty is the boy? 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.860
 the fried fish because what they put 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.560
 over then the oil stuck 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.790
 horrible hydrogenation yes clear what 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.140
 happens is that a set of things 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.820
 independent descriptions with 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.830
 only chicken breast and many 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.500
 critical nutrients involved in this 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.960
 the high amount of sodium fats 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.940
 saturated the issue of whether or not 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.940
 they make fried then 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.810
 They are meant all components 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.610
 our friend was saying because 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.930
 They need this food to have a 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.550
 true how to say a component 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.860
 addictive finds the need 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.320
 evolutionary of man it must be said that 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.390
 we must recognize this already in the year 2004 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.520
 a documentary called super 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.380
 size I know what you mean he wants 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.870
 enlarge your combo and where this man 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.490
 morgan spurlock decides to do the 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.800
 experiment with your own body and 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.180
 for more than a month he eats only food 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.849
 in this store 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.280
 it's true and when he proposes 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.560
 that just like a happy customer every 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.920
 Once the cashier tells you you want 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.510
 enlarge potatoes and say yes so 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.189
 that the conclusion is that in the end 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.349
 began to present a series of 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:31.319
 physical problems 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.879
 it's a very very healthy guy in fact the 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.439
 start as I was overcome these 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.810
 nice autonomous but after 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.370
 quickly the body adapted and only 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.639
 we left had this addiction for this 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.319
 food is worth this generated that this chain 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.849
 of party to begin to include 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.840
 salads until today 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.150
 exist 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.189
 then the next one is critical with the 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.439
 over the years it took us to 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.269
 place the amount of calories that 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.609
 included that each of the combos and there 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.950
 to say that mcdonald applauds for 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:02.010
 they have done tremendous campaign where 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.480
 obviously their cattle are many 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.239
 have made them transparent in a way 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.540
 given and many more people to do the 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.370
 hamburger according to your process you have to 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.019
 clarify that not only mcdonald's trial 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.049
 for nothing on the contrary those are all 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.639
 the fast food chains of some 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.479
 way that if one consumes it 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.479
 constantly 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.510
 mcdonald I have talked to us 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.790
 they say that the usual consumer of 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.310
 madonna eats something like four times 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.990
 a month or whatever the problem let's say is 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.240
 precisely in making breakfast 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.920
 Lunch lunch this but eat it 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.120
 well when I confess I at least 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.890
 how a lot 15 is a year at least 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.600
 because it comes out more to try 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.320
 make this situation transparent is for this 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.320
 image of the substance 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:04:00.270
 this is the origin of the nuggets saying 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.190
 I do not know what is done with breast I'm going now 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.280
 I like to pay a brisket at home 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.500
 chicken the kitchen and try the know 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.750
 just as a get is not clear if 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.380
 written the problem returns to quote the 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.470
 super size documentary and make them pay 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.810
 some french fries and put them some 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.090
 on a plate and says I'm not going to touch them and 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.700
 at the a home-made party then 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.200
 happens that it was created and the fries 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.060
 normal was lasting 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.790
 week and they went black they were from 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.470
 worm and the other nothing happened to them 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.540
 then he began to wonder and from 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.940
 there began 100 documentaries that the 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.860
 quantity of flavoring preservatives 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.960
 that are the dangerous and healthy the 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.700
 substance in the food itself are those that 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.520
 could we say put on fabric 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.900
 judgment as to what good they have a 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.830
 series of requirements that are super 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.330
 important and I have friends who have 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.850
 worked in this chain and the 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:55.160
 burgers all the food is done 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.160
 it has to be so many minutes per clock 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.120
 they are super strict has a manual 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.320
 super strict because they can not sell 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.580
 a hamburger that injured two 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.670
 hours the minimum burger has to 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.860
 last 15 and only with the fast food that 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:11.370
 this height is considered a pleasure 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.050
 guilty the problem is not the food 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.610
 junk itself but the friend of the 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.550
 person in relation to the problem 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.260
 then we appear cereals 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.880
 It also has a high degree of sodium or 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.350
 there are a lot of products that 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.570
 we are placing so you have to 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.160
 act to them what happens is that a good 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.680
 year does not agree with the theme that 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.090
 McDonald is being given so many 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.960
 credits because because there 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.350
 transparent to certain things to 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.169
 I find that they have a campaign their 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.539
 advertising obviously calls that everything 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.849
 more than anything we have for the 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:44.740
 children who are the ones who are most attracted 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.830
 for advertising campaigns that go 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.210
 adding gift toys and also 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.900
 this type of companies not only 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.690
 mcdonald how are you also 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:58.090
 sponsors of olympic tournaments 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.479
 those of activities that in turn are 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.479
 healthy for us and they are going to 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.479
 bleach 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:16.270
 the expression but only for the 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:18.550
 blame is not that I'm going to officiate a 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.169
 tournament is not that there is such a company x 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.550
 it's from the parents that finally 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.650
 make it easy to sell food 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:29.289
 healthy hamburger making the 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:32.020
 child to make you hook 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:35.319
 commercial with children 's toys 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.180
 to sell you has suffered so many 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.969
 modifications that in the end remained in 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.599
 something 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:43.789
 and in the end the baby will be with all 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:46.189
 us because they were going to do this topic 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:48.499
 of the colors with the nutrients 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:51.229
 criticism that sodium sugar 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:52.639
 fats with colors that do not impact the 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:55.789
 time to buy and be able to choose 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:58.039
 us as parents or as with the 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:59.839
 same children at the end since they are going to 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:01.610
 leave out of schools eradicated 

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:04.129
 they are small things that of course 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.809
 little something besides Jesus I love you 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:10.389
 ask because I did not know it was 

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:10.389
 tremendously dangerous and put ice cream
