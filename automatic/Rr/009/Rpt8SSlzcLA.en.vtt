 It does not interest us but what happens is 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:28.360
 what he does inside the studio comes a 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.230
 part to put in the flash in the 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.680
 torch 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.760
 There you put it, the policy that I 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.570

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.560
 the contact buttons is on. 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.220
 What do you do with them? 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.320

00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:01.119
 connecting all channels and he and boss ac 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:04.900

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:07.150
 this is the studio flash O looks okay there 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.750
 well then I'll be back in my 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.390
 camera and the other will be in flash 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.330
 It happens like the others close your 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.569
 studio 314 has photocell 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.730
 that the photocell picks up radiation from the 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.459
 Remote Control 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.480
 I said if you understand it 's better when 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:30.150

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.069
 all flashes that did not turn on 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.049
 the photocell does not appear here 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.470
 I 'm paying the kids 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:41.660
 I shot the shape and had another shape 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.040
 Okay, so this is what happens . 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.060
 mobility the photographer inside the studio 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.400
 demand person to pose and and now does 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.709
 this way you can move 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.040
 have a child can disrupt anyone who does not 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.340
 Face it but the show ends here at 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.910
 Brazil, it used to be late from 600 upwards. 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.870
 depending on the brand out there and so 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.500
 who can 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.239
 now it 's he who can not have that car 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.769
 that you have already picked up once 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.090
