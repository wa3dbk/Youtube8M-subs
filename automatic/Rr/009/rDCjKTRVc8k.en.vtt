00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:12.520 
Peter and today I want to show you a

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.190 
Peter and today I want to show you a
little<00:00:12.850> bit<00:00:12.970> more<00:00:13.210> about<00:00:13.420> how<00:00:13.480> to<00:00:13.750> build<00:00:14.050> a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
little bit more about how to build a

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
little bit more about how to build a
scale<00:00:14.640> based<00:00:15.640> on<00:00:15.820> a<00:00:15.850> certain<00:00:16.620> note<00:00:17.620> center

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
scale based on a certain note center

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.310 
scale based on a certain note center
that<00:00:18.370> we<00:00:18.490> find<00:00:18.790> in<00:00:18.940> any<00:00:19.090> song<00:00:19.750> or<00:00:20.050> chord

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
that we find in any song or chord

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.550 
that we find in any song or chord
progression<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:22.060> our<00:00:22.180> last<00:00:22.360> video<00:00:22.930> we<00:00:23.289> talked

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
progression in our last video we talked

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.720 
progression in our last video we talked
about<00:00:23.740> how<00:00:24.250> each<00:00:24.840> song<00:00:25.840> we<00:00:26.110> play<00:00:26.410> has<00:00:26.730> these

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
about how each song we play has these

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.330 
about how each song we play has these
our<00:00:27.940> ears<00:00:28.270> to<00:00:28.480> find<00:00:28.780> where<00:00:29.050> the<00:00:29.260> tonal<00:00:30.130> center

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
our ears to find where the tonal center

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.649 
our ears to find where the tonal center
center<00:00:31.150> or<00:00:31.390> the<00:00:31.649> low<00:00:32.649> to<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:32.980> home<00:00:33.309> record<00:00:33.819> is

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:34.659 
center or the low to the home record is

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:38.779 
center or the low to the home record is
evidence<00:00:35.649> so<00:00:36.309> we<00:00:36.460> just<00:00:36.640> use<00:00:36.789> our<00:00:36.909> ears<00:00:37.120> to<00:00:37.210> tell

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:38.789 
evidence so we just use our ears to tell

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.149 
evidence so we just use our ears to tell
that<00:00:39.789> is<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.749> home<00:00:40.929> known<00:00:41.229> that<00:00:41.559> notice<00:00:41.949> day

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.159 
that is the home known that notice day

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:44.189 
that is the home known that notice day
for<00:00:42.550> this<00:00:42.760> one<00:00:42.999> so<00:00:43.030> we<00:00:43.539> know<00:00:43.659> that<00:00:43.839> this<00:00:43.960> one<00:00:44.170> is

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
for this one so we know that this one is

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.739 
for this one so we know that this one is
in<00:00:44.409> the<00:00:44.499> key<00:00:44.679> of<00:00:44.710> error<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:46.300> we<00:00:46.449> can<00:00:46.600> figure

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:46.749 
in the key of error and we can figure

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.250 
in the key of error and we can figure
out<00:00:46.870> some<00:00:47.079> things<00:00:47.109> based<00:00:47.499> on<00:00:47.789> now<00:00:48.789> um<00:00:49.179> once<00:00:50.139> we

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
out some things based on now um once we

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.289 
out some things based on now um once we
find<00:00:50.499> out<00:00:50.679> what<00:00:50.889> that<00:00:51.069> note<00:00:51.339> is<00:00:51.729> what<00:00:52.149> that

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:52.299 
find out what that note is what that

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:54.209 
find out what that note is what that
home<00:00:52.539> note<00:00:52.749> is<00:00:52.929> there<00:00:53.589> are<00:00:53.649> different<00:00:53.949> tricks

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
home note is there are different tricks

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.520 
home note is there are different tricks

processes<00:00:57.069> we<00:00:57.249> can<00:00:57.399> go<00:00:57.549> through<00:00:57.579> to<00:00:57.850> figure

00:00:58.169 --> 00:00:58.179 
processes we can go through to figure

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:00.930 
processes we can go through to figure
out<00:00:58.329> how<00:00:59.079> to<00:00:59.139> build<00:00:59.469> the<00:00:59.649> scale<00:00:59.920> on<00:01:00.100> that<00:01:00.309> now

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
out how to build the scale on that now

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.660 
out how to build the scale on that now
if<00:01:01.089> it<00:01:01.239> starts<00:01:01.539> on<00:01:01.659> a<00:01:01.690> natural<00:01:02.459> it's<00:01:03.459> always

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
if it starts on a natural it's always

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.399 
if it starts on a natural it's always
going<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:03.909> be<00:01:03.999> a<00:01:04.059> sharp<00:01:04.329> scale<00:01:04.719> is<00:01:05.019> always

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
going to be a sharp scale is always

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:06.300 
going to be a sharp scale is always
gonna<00:01:05.500> have<00:01:05.649> sharps<00:01:05.890> in<00:01:05.979> the<00:01:06.039> key<00:01:06.159> signature

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
gonna have sharps in the key signature

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.880 
gonna have sharps in the key signature
unless<00:01:06.909> it<00:01:07.060> starts<00:01:07.240> on<00:01:07.390> C<00:01:07.750> which<00:01:08.530> is<00:01:08.560> all

cuz f has one planet
get<00:01:16.939> all<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.299> other<00:01:17.329> natural<00:01:17.899> notes<00:01:18.110> their

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
get all the other natural notes their

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.609 
get all the other natural notes their
scales<00:01:19.159> have<00:01:19.490> sharp<00:01:19.790> syntom<00:01:20.119> site<00:01:20.420> as<00:01:21.079> two

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
scales have sharp syntom site as two

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.550 
scales have sharp syntom site as two
sharps<00:01:21.979> is<00:01:22.520> four<00:01:22.790> sharps<00:01:23.180> G<00:01:23.780> a<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:23.990> B<00:01:24.290> are<00:01:24.320> all

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
sharps is four sharps G a and B are all

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.499 
sharps is four sharps G a and B are all
sharp<00:01:24.799> scales<00:01:25.039> as<00:01:25.250> well<00:01:25.430> so<00:01:26.149> that<00:01:26.329> leaves

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
sharp scales as well so that leaves

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.510 
sharp scales as well so that leaves
these<00:01:26.750> keys<00:01:27.079> and<00:01:27.320> we<00:01:27.470> could<00:01:27.680> think<00:01:27.920> of<00:01:28.039> this<00:01:28.460> as

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
these keys and we could think of this as

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.160 
these keys and we could think of this as
being<00:01:28.820> F<00:01:29.090> sharp<00:01:29.360> which<00:01:29.630> would<00:01:29.780> have<00:01:29.869> six

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
being F sharp which would have six

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.999 
being F sharp which would have six
sharps<00:01:30.560> um<00:01:32.110> oricon<00:01:33.110> goes<00:01:33.259> G<00:01:33.530> flat<00:01:33.710> which<00:01:33.890> is

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
sharps um oricon goes G flat which is

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.649 
sharps um oricon goes G flat which is
heads<00:01:34.189> which<00:01:34.460> has<00:01:34.610> six<00:01:34.880> flats<00:01:35.119> as<00:01:35.299> well<00:01:35.450> so

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
heads which has six flats as well so

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.060 
heads which has six flats as well so
after<00:01:36.020> watching<00:01:36.170> these<00:01:36.439> two<00:01:36.619> videos<00:01:36.770> you

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
after watching these two videos you

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
after watching these two videos you
should<00:01:37.130> be<00:01:37.369> able<00:01:37.429> to<00:01:37.549> figure<00:01:37.670> out<00:01:37.880> both<00:01:38.060> of

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
should be able to figure out both of

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.399 
should be able to figure out both of
those<00:01:38.330> keys<00:01:38.630> but<00:01:39.380> let's<00:01:39.590> take<00:01:39.829> a<00:01:41.200> flat<00:01:42.200> for

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
those keys but let's take a flat for

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.760 
those keys but let's take a flat for
example<00:01:42.860> a<00:01:43.039> flat<00:01:43.939> since<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:44.899> starts<00:01:45.170> on<00:01:45.289> a<00:01:45.409> flat

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
example a flat since it starts on a flat

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.469 
example a flat since it starts on a flat
we<00:01:45.950> know<00:01:46.070> that<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:46.340> has<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:46.729> have<00:01:46.880> flats<00:01:47.179> in<00:01:47.360> it

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
we know that it has to have flats in it

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.389 
we know that it has to have flats in it
because<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:48.170> key<00:01:48.350> signature<00:01:48.560> cannot<00:01:49.130> mix

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
because the key signature cannot mix

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.490 
because the key signature cannot mix
flats<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:50.030> sharps<00:01:50.270> it's<00:01:51.110> either<00:01:51.319> gonna<00:01:51.440> be

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
flats and sharps it's either gonna be

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.529 
flats and sharps it's either gonna be
one<00:01:51.709> or<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:51.979> other<00:01:52.069> or<00:01:52.490> none<00:01:52.880> as<00:01:53.090> in<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.390> case

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
one or the other or none as in the case

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.020 
one or the other or none as in the case
of<00:01:53.720> C<00:01:53.929> so<00:01:54.170> if<00:01:54.560> it<00:01:54.740> starts<00:01:55.039> on<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.310> flat<00:01:55.610> we<00:01:55.880> know

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
of C so if it starts on a flat we know

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.210 
of C so if it starts on a flat we know
that<00:01:56.179> it<00:01:56.270> has<00:01:56.390> flats<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.950> way<00:01:58.069> we're

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
that it has flats and the way we're

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.039 
that it has flats and the way we're
going<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.369> do<00:01:58.640> is<00:01:58.819> it<00:01:59.149> has<00:01:59.420> a<00:01:59.509> different<00:01:59.899> rule

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
going to do is it has a different rule

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.100 
going to do is it has a different rule
then<00:02:00.470> we<00:02:00.590> use<00:02:00.770> for<00:02:01.099> sharps<00:02:01.580> if<00:02:02.240> it<00:02:02.420> starts<00:02:02.630> on<00:02:02.869> a

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
then we use for sharps if it starts on a

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.089 
then we use for sharps if it starts on a
flat<00:02:03.380> we<00:02:03.560> know<00:02:03.649> that<00:02:03.740> we're<00:02:03.830> going<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:03.979> have

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
flat we know that we're going to have

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:06.219 
flat we know that we're going to have
all<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.459> flats<00:02:04.759> in<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.119> order<00:02:05.479> of<00:02:05.509> flats<00:02:05.929> up

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
all the flats in the order of flats up

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.140 
all the flats in the order of flats up
to<00:02:06.619> a<00:02:07.269> flat<00:02:08.269> plus<00:02:08.660> one<00:02:09.140> more<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:10.429> in<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.729> sharps

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
to a flat plus one more so in the sharps

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.520 
to a flat plus one more so in the sharps
video<00:02:11.450> we<00:02:11.540> talked<00:02:11.780> about<00:02:11.930> how<00:02:12.049> the<00:02:12.110> order<00:02:12.470> of

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
video we talked about how the order of

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.250 
video we talked about how the order of
sharps<00:02:12.819> always<00:02:13.819> starts<00:02:14.090> with<00:02:14.150> F<00:02:14.480> then<00:02:14.959> see

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
sharps always starts with F then see

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.250 
sharps always starts with F then see
then<00:02:15.620> G<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.190> we<00:02:16.700> used<00:02:16.970> this<00:02:17.690> saying<00:02:17.989> father

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
then G and we used this saying father

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.130 
then G and we used this saying father
Charles<00:02:18.769> goes<00:02:19.010> down<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.610> ends<00:02:20.000> battle<00:02:20.450> FCG

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
Charles goes down and ends battle FCG

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.860 
Charles goes down and ends battle FCG
Dae<00:02:21.620> be<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.640> remember<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.150> order<00:02:23.180> of<00:02:23.630> sharps

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
Dae be to remember the order of sharps

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.650 
Dae be to remember the order of sharps
and<00:02:24.140> if<00:02:24.590> we<00:02:24.709> flip<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.130> around<00:02:25.239> battle<00:02:26.239> ends

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
and if we flip that around battle ends

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.020 
and if we flip that around battle ends
and<00:02:26.870> Down<00:02:27.079> Goes<00:02:27.109> Charles<00:02:27.980> father<00:02:28.220> we<00:02:28.760> have<00:02:28.880> the

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
and Down Goes Charles father we have the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.759 
and Down Goes Charles father we have the
order<00:02:29.299> of<00:02:29.420> flats<00:02:29.660> be<00:02:30.109> EAD<00:02:30.709> GCF<00:02:31.630> so<00:02:32.630> if<00:02:32.959> we<00:02:33.410> have

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
order of flats be EAD GCF so if we have

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.490 
order of flats be EAD GCF so if we have
a<00:02:33.980> flat<00:02:34.340> we<00:02:35.299> know<00:02:35.480> that<00:02:35.630> we<00:02:35.750> also<00:02:35.930> have<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.470> have

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
a flat we know that we also have to have

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.400 
a flat we know that we also have to have
B<00:02:36.890> flat<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.459> E<00:02:38.209> flat<00:02:38.450> because<00:02:38.780> they<00:02:39.109> come

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
B flat and E flat because they come

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.550 
B flat and E flat because they come
before<00:02:39.769> a<00:02:39.799> flat<00:02:40.220> in<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.790> order<00:02:41.090> flats<00:02:41.440> so<00:02:42.440> if

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
before a flat in the order flats so if

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.319 
before a flat in the order flats so if
it<00:02:42.650> starts<00:02:42.920> on<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.040> flat<00:02:43.459> we're<00:02:44.030> gonna<00:02:44.150> have

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
it starts on a flat we're gonna have

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.990 
it starts on a flat we're gonna have
everything<00:02:44.720> up<00:02:45.019> to<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.470> flat<00:02:45.829> plus<00:02:46.370> one<00:02:46.609> more<00:02:46.850> so

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
everything up to a flat plus one more so

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.020 
everything up to a flat plus one more so
we're<00:02:47.090> going<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.299> be<00:02:47.660> e<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.739> a<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.519> then<00:02:49.940> we

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
we're going to be e and a and then we

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.410 
we're going to be e and a and then we
also<00:02:50.209> have<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.510> add<00:02:50.720> D<00:02:51.170> battle<00:02:51.889> ends<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.489> down

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
also have to add D battle ends and down

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.000 
also have to add D battle ends and down
okay<00:02:53.989> so<00:02:54.049> we're<00:02:54.200> going<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.380> have<00:02:54.410> those<00:02:54.680> four

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
okay so we're going to have those four

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.150 
okay so we're going to have those four
flats<00:02:55.340> in<00:02:55.670> our<00:02:56.329> key<00:02:56.540> signature<00:02:57.079> so<00:02:57.709> now<00:02:57.889> we<00:02:57.950> can

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
flats in our key signature so now we can

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.289 
flats in our key signature so now we can
build<00:02:58.340> our<00:02:58.489> scale<00:02:58.730> i'm<00:02:58.850> going<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.030> jump<00:02:59.180> down

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
build our scale i'm going to jump down

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.880 
build our scale i'm going to jump down

else<00:03:57.010> is<00:03:57.159> natural<00:03:57.870> okay<00:03:58.870> so<00:03:59.170> that's<00:03:59.349> how<00:03:59.500> we

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
else is natural okay so that's how we

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.309 
else is natural okay so that's how we
build<00:03:59.799> a<00:03:59.889> scale<00:04:00.159> or<00:04:00.849> a<00:04:00.879> flat<00:04:01.299> and<00:04:01.689> once<00:04:01.989> we<00:04:02.139> know

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
build a scale or a flat and once we know

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.020 
build a scale or a flat and once we know
that<00:04:02.530> that<00:04:02.769> we<00:04:02.859> can<00:04:03.069> figure<00:04:03.370> out<00:04:03.579> things<00:04:03.670> like

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
that that we can figure out things like

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.660 
that that we can figure out things like
this<00:04:04.810> is<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.109> one<00:04:05.319> core<00:04:05.620> this<00:04:05.829> is<00:04:05.889> for<00:04:06.370> corn

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
this is the one core this is for corn

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.869 
this is the one core this is for corn
five<00:04:06.970> chord<00:04:07.500> we<00:04:08.500> can<00:04:08.620> also<00:04:08.769> know<00:04:09.040> that<00:04:09.069> a<00:04:09.370> our

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
five chord we can also know that a our

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.229 
five chord we can also know that a our
fifth<00:04:10.120> scale<00:04:10.239> degree<00:04:10.829> 1<00:04:11.829> 2<00:04:11.919> 3<00:04:11.950> 4<00:04:12.280> 5<00:04:12.519> is<00:04:12.730> e<00:04:12.849> flat

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
fifth scale degree 1 2 3 4 5 is e flat

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:14.699 
fifth scale degree 1 2 3 4 5 is e flat
and<00:04:13.510> we<00:04:13.659> know<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.900> key<00:04:14.019> flats<00:04:14.260> gonna<00:04:14.470> sound

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
and we know the key flats gonna sound

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:22.910 
and we know the key flats gonna sound
good<00:04:15.010> in<00:04:15.220> a<00:04:15.819> lot<00:04:15.939> of<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.090> chords

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.650 

and<00:04:23.370> it<00:04:23.460> unlocks<00:04:23.820> a<00:04:23.970> lot<00:04:24.090> of<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.300> theory<00:04:24.540> that

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
and it unlocks a lot of that theory that

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.080 
and it unlocks a lot of that theory that
we've<00:04:24.810> been<00:04:24.900> talking<00:04:24.960> about<00:04:25.380> in<00:04:25.590> other<00:04:25.680> videos

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
we've been talking about in other videos

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.030 
we've been talking about in other videos
let's<00:04:27.090> do<00:04:27.300> one<00:04:27.540> more<00:04:27.570> example<00:04:27.750> let's<00:04:28.380> take<00:04:28.920> it

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
let's do one more example let's take it

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.580 
let's do one more example let's take it
down<00:04:29.160> a<00:04:29.220> couple<00:04:29.310> of<00:04:29.640> flats<00:04:29.880> and<00:04:30.480> let's<00:04:31.440> see

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
down a couple of flats and let's see

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.030 
down a couple of flats and let's see
what<00:04:31.710> we<00:04:31.800> figure<00:04:32.100> out<00:04:32.130> that<00:04:32.430> our<00:04:32.550> center<00:04:33.210> is<00:04:34.040> B

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
what we figure out that our center is B

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.580 
what we figure out that our center is B
flat<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:36.150> we<00:04:36.360> can<00:04:36.540> tell<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.020> B<00:04:37.200> flat<00:04:37.350> is

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
flat and we can tell it the B flat is

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.860 
flat and we can tell it the B flat is
kind<00:04:37.770> of<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.920> home<00:04:38.130> note<00:04:38.430> or<00:04:39.150> chord<00:04:39.480> for

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
kind of the home note or chord for

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.980 
kind of the home note or chord for
whatever<00:04:40.500> song<00:04:40.760> okay<00:04:41.760> so<00:04:42.240> what<00:04:42.420> we<00:04:42.510> can<00:04:42.600> do<00:04:42.750> is

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
whatever song okay so what we can do is

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.140 
whatever song okay so what we can do is
we're<00:04:43.830> gonna<00:04:43.980> have<00:04:44.160> everything<00:04:44.430> in<00:04:44.670> the<00:04:44.760> order

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
we're gonna have everything in the order

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.320 
we're gonna have everything in the order
of<00:04:45.240> flats<00:04:45.480> up<00:04:45.780> to<00:04:45.960> be<00:04:46.110> flat<00:04:46.410> plus<00:04:47.160> one<00:04:47.430> more<00:04:47.670> net

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
of flats up to be flat plus one more net

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.760 
of flats up to be flat plus one more net
beautified<00:04:48.750> is<00:04:48.870> first<00:04:49.260> in<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.500> order<00:04:49.650> of

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
beautified is first in the order of

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.680 
beautified is first in the order of
flats<00:04:50.070> so<00:04:50.340> there<00:04:50.520> are<00:04:50.640> no<00:04:50.790> flats<00:04:51.090> that<00:04:51.360> have<00:04:51.510> to

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
flats so there are no flats that have to

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.680 
flats so there are no flats that have to
be<00:04:51.810> in<00:04:51.930> order<00:04:52.110> flats<00:04:52.530> for<00:04:53.430> be<00:04:53.580> fun<00:04:53.820> battle<00:04:54.510> ends

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
be in order flats for be fun battle ends

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.840 
be in order flats for be fun battle ends
and<00:04:55.290> Down<00:04:55.410> Goes<00:04:55.440> Tom's<00:04:55.860> father<00:04:56.040> so<00:04:56.310> B<00:04:56.550> flat<00:04:56.730> is

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
and Down Goes Tom's father so B flat is

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.270 
and Down Goes Tom's father so B flat is
the<00:04:56.940> first<00:04:57.150> one<00:04:57.360> so<00:04:58.200> we<00:04:58.350> just<00:04:58.470> have<00:04:58.530> to<00:04:58.710> add<00:04:58.860> one

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
the first one so we just have to add one

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.470 
the first one so we just have to add one
more<00:04:59.520> and<00:04:59.760> then<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.330> one<00:05:00.510> mores<00:05:00.780> can<00:05:00.990> be<00:05:01.110> easy

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
more and then the one mores can be easy

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.610 
more and then the one mores can be easy
so<00:05:03.480> everything<00:05:03.900> is<00:05:03.960> going<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:04.110> be<00:05:04.170> natural<00:05:04.560> in

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
so everything is going to be natural in

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.290 
so everything is going to be natural in
this<00:05:04.710> scale<00:05:04.860> except<00:05:05.220> for<00:05:05.400> B<00:05:05.520> flat<00:05:05.790> and<00:05:06.060> even

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
this scale except for B flat and even

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.110 
this scale except for B flat and even
start<00:05:07.170> on<00:05:07.260> b-flat<00:05:07.530> this<00:05:08.400> throws<00:05:08.610> some<00:05:08.850> kind<00:05:09.060> of

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
start on b-flat this throws some kind of

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:16.540 
start on b-flat this throws some kind of
see<00:05:09.560> which<00:05:10.560> is<00:05:10.680> natural<00:05:11.130> d<00:05:11.610> e<00:05:12.170> is<00:05:13.170> flat<00:05:13.850> then

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
see which is natural d e is flat then

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.760 
see which is natural d e is flat then
she<00:05:17.600> Hey<00:05:20.480> okay<00:05:21.480> so<00:05:21.540> just<00:05:21.870> two<00:05:22.110> flats<00:05:22.410> on<00:05:22.620> that

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
she Hey okay so just two flats on that

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.760 
she Hey okay so just two flats on that
one<00:05:22.950> and<00:05:23.600> you<00:05:24.600> know<00:05:24.690> it's<00:05:25.080> all<00:05:25.260> about<00:05:25.470> figuring

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
one and you know it's all about figuring

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.590 
one and you know it's all about figuring
out<00:05:26.070> what<00:05:26.250> that<00:05:26.400> home<00:05:26.670> note<00:05:26.910> is<00:05:27.120> and<00:05:27.450> then<00:05:27.540> we

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
out what that home note is and then we

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.570 
out what that home note is and then we
can<00:05:27.750> build<00:05:27.990> a<00:05:28.110> scale<00:05:28.350> from<00:05:28.500> there<00:05:28.710> so<00:05:28.950> again

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
can build a scale from there so again

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.010 
can build a scale from there so again
with<00:05:29.730> flats<00:05:29.940> you<00:05:30.090> just<00:05:30.270> know<00:05:30.420> that<00:05:30.540> home<00:05:30.780> note

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
with flats you just know that home note

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.230 
with flats you just know that home note
you<00:05:31.770> find<00:05:31.980> it<00:05:32.130> in<00:05:32.220> the<00:05:32.310> order<00:05:32.580> of<00:05:32.610> flats<00:05:32.970> and

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
you find it in the order of flats and

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.550 
you find it in the order of flats and
then<00:05:33.270> you<00:05:33.450> add<00:05:33.600> all<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:33.900> flights<00:05:34.080> up<00:05:34.260> to<00:05:34.410> that

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
then you add all the flights up to that

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.610 
then you add all the flights up to that
plus<00:05:34.830> one<00:05:35.070> more<00:05:35.340> okay<00:05:36.090> just<00:05:36.660> a<00:05:36.840> verbal<00:05:37.050> example

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
plus one more okay just a verbal example

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.780 
plus one more okay just a verbal example
if<00:05:37.770> we<00:05:37.950> had<00:05:38.270> um<00:05:39.440> let's<00:05:40.440> say<00:05:40.590> D<00:05:40.830> flat<00:05:41.100> we<00:05:41.610> found

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
if we had um let's say D flat we found

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.880 
if we had um let's say D flat we found
out<00:05:41.970> the<00:05:42.000> D<00:05:42.300> flat<00:05:42.570> was<00:05:42.900> the<00:05:43.140> center<00:05:43.440> of<00:05:43.470> our<00:05:43.590> key

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
out the D flat was the center of our key

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.680 
out the D flat was the center of our key
we<00:05:44.550> would<00:05:44.670> know<00:05:44.760> that<00:05:44.820> we<00:05:45.000> would<00:05:45.120> have<00:05:45.270> battle

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
we would know that we would have battle

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.720 
we would know that we would have battle
ends<00:05:46.260> and<00:05:46.470> down<00:05:47.630> plus<00:05:48.630> one<00:05:49.020> more<00:05:49.260> g<00:05:49.770> ok<00:05:50.400> so<00:05:50.460> we

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
ends and down plus one more g ok so we

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.530 
ends and down plus one more g ok so we
