opportunities to get past them the first

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.540 
opportunities to get past them the first
one<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.289> drill<00:00:49.530> them<00:00:49.649> out<00:00:49.829> with<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> skill

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
one is to drill them out with a skill

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.819 
one is to drill them out with a skill
move<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.600> second<00:00:52.020> one<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.440> push<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
move and the second one is to push the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.250 
move and the second one is to push the
ball<00:00:53.010> alongside<00:00:53.489> him<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.059> getting<00:00:54.660> past<00:00:55.050> them

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
of course you can also shoot before you

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.930 
of course you can also shoot before you
get<00:00:57.989> past<00:00:58.230> them<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.070> also<00:00:59.219> chip<00:00:59.609> over

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
some space around you let's train a bit

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.580 
some space around you let's train a bit
in<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> arena<00:01:12.060> mode<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.540> great<00:01:12.900> place<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.439> get

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
in the arena mode a great place to get

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.890 
in the arena mode a great place to get
to<00:01:13.650> know<00:01:13.920> how<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.369> works<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.820> then<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.509> very

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
to know how it works and then it's very

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.590 
to know how it works and then it's very
easy<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.500> real<00:01:16.740> game<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:18.180> it

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
easy in the real game as you can see it

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.020 
easy in the real game as you can see it
seems<00:01:18.960> very<00:01:19.320> easy<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.830> me<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.400> get<00:01:20.549> past<00:01:20.850> them

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
seems very easy to me to get past them

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.380 
seems very easy to me to get past them
because<00:01:21.689> there's<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.380> big<00:01:22.740> secret<00:01:23.310> maybe<00:01:24.240> you

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
because there's one big secret maybe you

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.210 
because there's one big secret maybe you
have<00:01:24.509> already<00:01:24.750> seen<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.290> yourself<00:01:25.409> if<00:01:25.890> not

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
have already seen it yourself if not

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
before before we go on you have to keep

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.450 
before before we go on you have to keep
one<00:01:57.420> important<00:01:57.899> aspect<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.380> mind<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:58.770> your

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
one important aspect in mind if your

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.730 
one important aspect in mind if your
players<00:01:59.850> right<00:02:00.210> footed<00:02:00.570> then<00:02:01.079> also<00:02:01.290> try<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
players right footed then also try to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.560 
players right footed then also try to
get<00:02:02.040> parts<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.430> keep<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.939> right<00:02:03.119> side<00:02:03.390> if

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
get parts to keep on the right side if

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.080 
get parts to keep on the right side if
your<00:02:04.259> players<00:02:04.619> left<00:02:04.890> footed<00:02:05.159> take<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.939> left

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
your players left footed take the left

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.900 
your players left footed take the left
side<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.930> reason<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.469> easy<00:02:07.710> your<00:02:08.340> player<00:02:08.610> lets

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
side the reason is easy your player lets

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.029 
side the reason is easy your player lets
the<00:02:09.119> ball<00:02:09.270> alongside<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.050> keeper<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.530> has

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
the ball alongside the keeper and has

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.650 
the ball alongside the keeper and has
his<00:02:11.220> body<00:02:11.430> between<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:12.000> ball<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.420> keeper

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
his body between the ball and the keeper

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.430 
his body between the ball and the keeper
so

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
so

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.930 
so
chance<00:02:13.710> is<00:02:13.920> higher<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.430> may<00:02:14.610> get<00:02:14.820> at

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
chance is higher that you may get at

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.120 
chance is higher that you may get at
least<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.270> foul<00:02:15.540> if<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:16.200> fail<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.560> get<00:02:16.860> past

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
least the foul if you fail to get past

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.400 
least the foul if you fail to get past
them<00:02:17.340> here's<00:02:18.330> an<00:02:18.450> example<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.930> pushing<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
ball sideways to the keeper I wasn't a

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.170 
ball sideways to the keeper I wasn't a
one-on-one<00:02:21.900> situation<00:02:22.110> with<00:02:22.860> karishma<00:02:23.220> 3

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
one-on-one situation with karishma 3

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.330 
one-on-one situation with karishma 3
meters<00:02:24.510> before<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:25.110> push<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.740> ball<00:02:25.890> alongside

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
meters before I push the ball alongside

meters before I push the ball alongside
the<00:02:26.610> keeper<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.150> ball<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.050> here<00:02:28.650> it

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
the keeper and the ball is in here it

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.290 
the keeper and the ball is in here it
would<00:02:28.950> be<00:02:29.070> even<00:02:29.220> better<00:02:29.370> if<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.910> push<00:02:30.120> the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
would be even better if you push the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.910 
would be even better if you push the
ball<00:02:30.450> parts<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.930> keep<00:02:31.080> on<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.410> right<00:02:31.620> side

ball parts to keep on the right side

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.710 
ball parts to keep on the right side
