and look at us in between two players
and<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.319> think<00:02:35.349> that<00:02:35.620> little<00:02:35.890> look<00:02:38.099> what<00:02:39.099> do<00:02:39.160> you

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
and I think that little look what do you

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.530 
and I think that little look what do you
do<00:02:39.400> do<00:02:39.519> you<00:02:39.580> watch<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.970> ball<00:02:40.120> do<00:02:40.330> you<00:02:40.360> watch

do do you watch the ball do you watch

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.720 
do do you watch the ball do you watch
his<00:02:40.750> feet<00:02:40.930> or<00:02:41.140> he<00:02:41.260> watch<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.470> mind<00:02:41.890> can<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.430> do

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
his feet or he watch the mind can you do

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.540 
his feet or he watch the mind can you do
I<00:02:42.970> think<00:02:43.480> they<00:02:43.690> always<00:02:43.810> watch<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.260> ball

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.410 

have<00:02:50.480> some<00:02:50.690> of<00:02:50.780> that

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.080 

the<00:02:53.900> story<00:02:54.560> has<00:02:54.800> too<00:02:55.280> much<00:02:55.430> who<00:02:55.580> was<00:02:55.760> in<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.030> in

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
the story has too much who was in it in

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.610 
the story has too much who was in it in
Italy<00:02:56.450> before<00:02:56.569> he<00:02:56.840> came<00:02:56.990> over<00:02:57.230> one<00:02:57.440> of<00:02:57.560> the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
Italy before he came over one of the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.620 
Italy before he came over one of the
best<00:02:57.830> stuff<00:02:58.069> of<00:02:58.580> course<00:02:58.850> but<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.150> think<00:02:59.209> players

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
best stuff of course but I think players

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.540 
best stuff of course but I think players
like<00:02:59.870> Pastora<00:03:00.319> need<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.800> ball<00:03:03.069> more<00:03:04.069> Spanish

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
like Pastora need the ball more Spanish

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.479 
like Pastora need the ball more Spanish
than<00:03:04.580> Brasilia
