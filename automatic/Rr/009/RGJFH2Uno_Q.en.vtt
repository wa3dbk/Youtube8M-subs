00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.880 
don't have any kind of understanding of
it<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.509> then<00:02:04.630> if<00:02:04.780> you're<00:02:04.899> too<00:02:05.140> referential

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
it and then if you're too referential

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.590 
it and then if you're too referential
everyone<00:02:06.250> says<00:02:06.429> you<00:02:06.579> have<00:02:06.670> no<00:02:06.819> ideas<00:02:07.270> of<00:02:07.479> your

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.720 
own so I think it has to take a few
seasons<00:02:11.290> till<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.739> can<00:02:11.950> really<00:02:12.220> find<00:02:12.519> your
