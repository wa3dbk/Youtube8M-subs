to return to normal when the volunteers

to return to normal when the volunteers
drank<00:02:22.170> hot<00:02:22.440> beverages<00:02:23.069> it<00:02:23.280> took<00:02:23.640> 23<00:02:24.120> minutes

to return to normal the greatest

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.369 
to return to normal the greatest
implication<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.270> it<00:02:27.450> reduces<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.020> guessing

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
implication is it reduces the guessing

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.979 
implication is it reduces the guessing
game<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:29.160> will<00:02:29.760> more<00:02:30.060> consistently<00:02:30.690> have

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
game we will more consistently have

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.199 
game we will more consistently have
accurate<00:02:31.530> temperatures<00:02:32.190> because<00:02:32.970> now<00:02:33.150> we

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
accurate temperatures because now we

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.729 
accurate temperatures because now we
know<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.510> if<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:33.959> drink<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.260> cold<00:02:34.500> beverage

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
know that if you drink a cold beverage

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.160 
know that if you drink a cold beverage
you<00:02:35.280> should<00:02:35.489> wait<00:02:35.610> 15<00:02:36.090> minutes<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.870> recheck

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
you should wait 15 minutes to recheck

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.510 
you should wait 15 minutes to recheck
the<00:02:37.349> temperature<00:02:37.770> and<00:02:38.099> if<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.310> drink

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
the temperature and if you drink

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.610 
the temperature and if you drink
something<00:02:38.730> hot<00:02:39.090> we<00:02:39.390> should<00:02:39.569> wait<00:02:39.690> 23<00:02:40.050> minutes

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
something hot we should wait 23 minutes

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.710 
something hot we should wait 23 minutes

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
so on average we're telling clinicians

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.619 
so on average we're telling clinicians
to<00:02:42.870> wait<00:02:42.989> 30<00:02:43.319> minutes<00:02:43.940> work<00:02:44.940> like<00:02:45.180> there's<00:02:45.420> not
