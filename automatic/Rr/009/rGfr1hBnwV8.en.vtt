 with intro playing 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.170
 I muffled muted here here 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.740
 this part of the palm of your hand get along here in this place 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.420
 somewhere 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:39.730
 muffle the first string we find 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:43.920
 this position and play the first play 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.920

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:55.590

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:59.900
 farther 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.900
 playing 7 and 8 10 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:23.110
 here and so on after that 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:28.560
 the entry we goes there is played here 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:35.709
 such notes third string 2 frets 5 4 and 2 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:43.450
 next will be a solo play of 4 strings 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:46.200
 begin the seventh fret 75 again 7 and 3 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.200
 string on the fifth fret 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.269
 so three times we play on 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:08.280
 pull up the third string of 7 incense 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:11.850
 tons until sound 9 pulled up again 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:17.120
 pastra did not hit let go 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.120
 and on 5 again 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.490
 farther on the seventh we return to 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.490
 third string 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.900
 and 5 you 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:45.819
 understandable and after the second time we play the same 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:50.500
 most of all we pull up we let go 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:53.729
 the second note sounds the fifth fret and the second 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:05:02.830
 string we pull up on one tone 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:04.780
 before the sound of 8 ladodo sound 10 here in 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.910
 basically all the complexity is nothing there 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.310

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.940
