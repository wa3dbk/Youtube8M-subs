like<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:24.850> mace<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.870> can<00:02:26.050> hit<00:02:26.350> people<00:02:26.560> with<00:02:26.740> it<00:02:26.950> I

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
like a mace you can hit people with it I

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.120 
like a mace you can hit people with it I
bet<00:02:27.819> it<00:02:27.910> would<00:02:28.030> hurt<00:02:28.300> it's<00:02:28.959> very<00:02:29.050> like<00:02:29.740> what

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
bet it would hurt it's very like what

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.010 
bet it would hurt it's very like what
softer<00:02:30.880> rubber<00:02:31.030> than<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.390> other<00:02:31.510> constructs

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
softer rubber than the other constructs

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.430 
softer rubber than the other constructs
on<00:02:33.290> but<00:02:33.650> whatever<00:02:33.830> still<00:02:34.640> very<00:02:35.150> nice<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:36.140> can

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
on but whatever still very nice it can

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.650 
on but whatever still very nice it can

just give a nice like a movie

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.340 
just give a nice like a movie
representation<00:03:25.250> which<00:03:26.180> is<00:03:26.630> you<00:03:27.320> know

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
representation which is you know

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.820 
representation which is you know
important<00:03:30.070> so<00:03:31.070> here<00:03:31.670> our<00:03:32.200> articulation<00:03:33.200> just

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
important so here our articulation just

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.680 
important so here our articulation just
the<00:03:33.950> same<00:03:34.130> as<00:03:34.250> everything<00:03:34.550> else<00:03:34.640> so<00:03:35.420> i<00:03:35.480> can<00:03:35.600> go

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
the same as everything else so i can go

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.800 
the same as everything else so i can go
side<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:35.960> side<00:03:36.110> is<00:03:36.710> arms<00:03:37.430> can<00:03:37.550> go<00:03:37.640> out<00:03:37.850> and<00:03:38.570> go

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
side to side is arms can go out and go

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.990 
side to side is arms can go out and go
forward<00:03:39.110> like<00:03:39.320> that<00:03:39.350> they<00:03:40.220> can<00:03:40.400> rotate<00:03:40.760> every

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
forward like that they can rotate every

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.660 
forward like that they can rotate every
which<00:03:41.240> way<00:03:41.270> they<00:03:42.260> can<00:03:42.500> rotate<00:03:42.860> at<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.370> waist

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
which way they can rotate at the waist

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.040 
which way they can rotate at the waist
legs<00:03:44.300> and<00:03:44.450> go<00:03:44.510> forward<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.250> they<00:03:46.250> can<00:03:46.520> go<00:03:46.700> back

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
legs and go forward and they can go back

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.460 
legs and go forward and they can go back
so<00:03:48.050> there<00:03:48.260> you<00:03:48.410> go<00:03:48.440> you<00:03:49.130> got<00:03:49.340> Abin<00:03:49.970> Sur<00:03:50.470> which

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
so there you go you got Abin Sur which

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.020 
so there you go you got Abin Sur which
you<00:03:51.770> know<00:03:51.890> I've<00:03:52.160> gotten<00:03:52.430> over<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:52.700> fact<00:03:52.730> that

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
you know I've gotten over the fact that

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.970 
you know I've gotten over the fact that
these<00:03:53.180> uh<00:03:53.380> figures<00:03:54.380> really<00:03:54.560> don't<00:03:54.800> have<00:03:54.950> that

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
these uh figures really don't have that

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.030 
these uh figures really don't have that
greater<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:56.590> articulation<00:03:57.590> I'm<00:03:57.740> pretty<00:03:58.010> much

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
greater the articulation I'm pretty much

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.610 
greater the articulation I'm pretty much
gotten<00:03:58.370> over<00:03:58.730> it<00:03:58.820> just<00:03:59.780> show<00:03:59.930> you<00:03:59.990> with<00:04:00.350> Hal
