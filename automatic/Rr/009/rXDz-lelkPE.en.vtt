to kind of go over the character
animation<00:00:12.660> process<00:00:13.200> now<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.130> do<00:00:14.580> use<00:00:14.759> a

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
animation process now we do use a

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.790 
animation process now we do use a
high-tech<00:00:15.089> tool<00:00:15.330> called<00:00:15.839> blender<00:00:16.320> which<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.770> a

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
high-tech tool called blender which is a

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.070 
high-tech tool called blender which is a
free<00:00:17.130> open<00:00:17.520> source<00:00:17.550> software<00:00:17.850> for<00:00:18.510> animation

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
free open source software for animation

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.320 
free open source software for animation
but<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:19.920> also<00:00:20.039> use<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> lot<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.699> low<00:00:20.820> tech<00:00:21.090> tools

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
but we also use a lot of low tech tools

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.029 
but we also use a lot of low tech tools

going to take all my ideas and put them

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.700 
going to take all my ideas and put them

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
in now I really like 2d animation so I'm

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.870 
in now I really like 2d animation so I'm
going<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.920> go<00:01:56.040> ahead<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.430> draw<00:01:56.549> them<00:01:56.729> out

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
going to go ahead and draw them out

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.730 
going to go ahead and draw them out
first<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.869> way<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.049> can<00:01:58.290> test<00:01:58.530> out<00:01:58.710> ideas

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
first that way I can test out ideas

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.499 
first that way I can test out ideas
without<00:01:59.460> having<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.880> spend<00:02:00.090> too<00:02:00.299> much<00:02:00.450> time

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
without having to spend too much time

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.350 
without having to spend too much time
posing<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.380> characters<00:02:02.030> once<00:02:03.030> I'm<00:02:03.210> happy

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
posing the characters once I'm happy

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.420 
posing the characters once I'm happy
with<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.079> start<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.500> block<00:02:04.710> out<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.040> poses

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
with it I start to block out the poses

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.760 
with it I start to block out the poses
of<00:02:05.579> what<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.820> think<00:02:05.909> will<00:02:06.270> work<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.689> just<00:02:07.170> focus

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
of what I think will work I just focus

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.040 
of what I think will work I just focus
on<00:02:07.920> poses<00:02:08.399> no<00:02:08.700> timing<00:02:09.239> or<00:02:09.450> trying<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.690> match<00:02:09.869> a

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
on poses no timing or trying to match a

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.290 
on poses no timing or trying to match a
dialogue<00:02:10.470> none<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.400> never<00:02:12.000> worry

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
dialogue none of that I never worry

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.120 
dialogue none of that I never worry
about<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.569> complex

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
about the complex

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.070 
about the complex
things<00:02:13.460> like<00:02:13.670> tiny<00:02:13.940> finger<00:02:14.360> details<00:02:14.810> are

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
things like tiny finger details are

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.380 
things like tiny finger details are
accenting<00:02:15.680> different<00:02:16.010> eyelids<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.550> just<00:02:17.240> go

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
accenting different eyelids I just go

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.460 
accenting different eyelids I just go
for<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.690> overall<00:02:18.170> look<00:02:18.410> of<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.620> Pope's

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.809 

once<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.620> figured<00:02:25.980> out<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.250> poses<00:02:26.640> for

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
once I figured out the poses for

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.880 
once I figured out the poses for
everything<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.390> go<00:02:27.900> ahead<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.380> time<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.770> out

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
everything I go ahead and time it out

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.470 
everything I go ahead and time it out
using<00:02:29.340> something<00:02:29.550> called<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.030> graph<00:02:30.239> editor

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
using something called the graph editor

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.610 
using something called the graph editor
or<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.080> dope<00:02:31.290> sheet<00:02:32.810> these<00:02:33.810> marks<00:02:34.260> help<00:02:34.500> me

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
or the dope sheet these marks help me

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.890 
or the dope sheet these marks help me
time<00:02:34.890> everything<00:02:35.550> out<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.910> just<00:02:36.540> slide<00:02:36.780> them

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
time everything out I just slide them

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.420 
time everything out I just slide them
around<00:02:37.140> until<00:02:37.319> I<00:02:37.530> think<00:02:37.800> more<00:02:38.040> or<00:02:38.130> less<00:02:38.250> it

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
around until I think more or less it

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.729 
around until I think more or less it
feels<00:02:38.670> right<00:02:38.910> it's<00:02:39.480> definitely<00:02:40.260> an<00:02:40.380> art<00:02:42.739> after

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
feels right it's definitely an art after

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.500 
feels right it's definitely an art after
an<00:02:43.830> hour<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.459> timing<00:02:44.819> I'm<00:02:44.940> ready<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.330> show

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
an hour so of timing I'm ready to show

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.949 
an hour so of timing I'm ready to show
it<00:02:45.540> off

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
it off

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
could be better how that movement feels

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.290 
could be better how that movement feels
how<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.650> acting<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.250> working<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.850> what

to<00:03:04.980> summon<00:03:05.400> some<00:03:05.610> monster<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.480> now<00:03:06.750> he's<00:03:06.900> out

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
to summon some monster and now he's out

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.630 
to summon some monster and now he's out
there<00:03:07.230> tearing<00:03:07.560> up<00:03:07.799> our<00:03:07.950> home<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.459> it's<00:03:08.580> like

there tearing up our home and it's like
five<00:03:09.030> times<00:03:09.299> I<00:03:09.450> sighs<00:03:09.810> all<00:03:10.260> we're<00:03:10.620> going<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:10.920> do

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.229 

is<00:03:15.420> it<00:03:15.930> even<00:03:16.110> still<00:03:16.350> out<00:03:16.500> there

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
is it even still out there

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.900 
is it even still out there
this<00:03:18.239> process<00:03:18.840> is<00:03:19.019> messy<00:03:19.440> we<00:03:20.310> go<00:03:20.430> back<00:03:20.670> and

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
this process is messy we go back and

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.640 
this process is messy we go back and
forth<00:03:21.120> with<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.390> animators<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.110> a<00:03:22.200> director

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
forth with the animators and a director

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.640 
forth with the animators and a director
to<00:03:22.769> try<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.040> find<00:03:23.370> an<00:03:23.489> idea<00:03:23.880> that's<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.330> best

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
to try to find an idea that's the best

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.590 
to try to find an idea that's the best
but<00:03:25.650> once<00:03:25.920> we<00:03:26.130> get<00:03:26.340> there<00:03:26.640> we<00:03:26.970> move<00:03:27.150> on<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.569> a

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
but once we get there we move on to a

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.599 
but once we get there we move on to a
new<00:03:27.900> phase<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.350> animation<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.280> all

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
new phase of animation that all

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.210 
new phase of animation that all
animators<00:03:30.420> dread

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.610 

some<00:03:35.220> animators<00:03:35.730> call<00:03:35.970> its<00:03:36.120> planing<00:03:36.750> refining

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
some animators call its planing refining

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.979 
some animators call its planing refining
mush<00:03:38.070> mucking<00:03:38.609> but<00:03:39.180> all<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.390> terms<00:03:39.630> mean<00:03:39.930> the

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
mush mucking but all the terms mean the

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.840 
mush mucking but all the terms mean the
same<00:03:40.109> thing<00:03:40.620> we're<00:03:41.310> going<00:03:41.459> through<00:03:41.670> this

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
same thing we're going through this

and Derek then we hand it over to
compositing<00:05:57.390> to<00:05:57.540> do<00:05:57.660> a<00:05:57.690> little<00:05:57.930> bit<00:05:58.050> of<00:05:58.110> work

more<00:06:19.140> or<00:06:19.260> less<00:06:19.410> the<00:06:19.560> same<00:06:19.770> process<00:06:20.400> sometimes

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
more or less the same process sometimes

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.630 
more or less the same process sometimes
animators<00:06:22.260> like<00:06:22.530> to<00:06:22.680> just<00:06:22.890> dive<00:06:23.160> right<00:06:23.190> in<00:06:23.610> and

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
animators like to just dive right in and

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.030 
animators like to just dive right in and
start<00:06:23.910> animating<00:06:24.530> sometimes<00:06:25.530> they<00:06:25.740> like<00:06:25.920> to

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
start animating sometimes they like to

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.890 
start animating sometimes they like to
use<00:06:26.070> video<00:06:26.520> reference<00:06:27.000> or<00:06:27.180> just<00:06:27.690> only

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
use video reference or just only

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.280 
use video reference or just only
thumbnails<00:06:28.440> but<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.340> idea<00:06:29.820> is<00:06:30.150> the<00:06:30.480> same<00:06:30.720> to

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
thumbnails but the idea is the same to

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.280 
thumbnails but the idea is the same to
view<00:06:31.620> life<00:06:31.860> into<00:06:32.400> characters<00:06:32.880> now<00:06:33.840> I<00:06:33.900> hope

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
view life into characters now I hope

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.750
