00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
I informed you guys how to differentiate

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.210 
I informed you guys how to differentiate
between<00:00:34.750> a<00:00:34.989> normal<00:00:35.200> attack<00:00:35.650> and<00:00:35.890> a<00:00:35.920> smash

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
of Italy sore I'd Elise I'm not exactly

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.380 
of Italy sore I'd Elise I'm not exactly
sure<00:00:41.559> how<00:00:41.800> to<00:00:41.860> say<00:00:42.070> it<00:00:42.220> forgive<00:00:42.640> me<00:00:42.850> bro<00:00:43.090> I'm

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
sorry he informed me that you can also

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.420 
sorry he informed me that you can also
tell<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.320> difference<00:00:47.710> by<00:00:48.010> simply<00:00:48.400> using

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
tell the difference by simply using

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.640 
tell the difference by simply using
heavy<00:00:48.879> standard<00:00:49.330> with<00:00:49.449> any<00:00:49.600> shield<00:00:50.050> and<00:00:50.320> if

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
heavy standard with any shield and if

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.200 
heavy standard with any shield and if
struck<00:00:50.949> by<00:00:51.100> a<00:00:51.129> normal<00:00:51.489> attack<00:00:51.790> you'll

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
struck by a normal attack you'll

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.470 
struck by a normal attack you'll
generate<00:00:52.600> no<00:00:52.840> SP<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:54.489> minor<00:00:54.699> detail<00:00:54.970> but

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
generate no SP it's a minor detail but

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.220 
generate no SP it's a minor detail but
the<00:00:55.629> more<00:00:55.809> you<00:00:55.840> know<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.199> better<00:00:56.410> off<00:00:56.710> you<00:00:56.920> are

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the more you know the better off you are

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.170 
the more you know the better off you are
so<00:00:59.230> you<00:00:59.320> will<00:00:59.649> generate<00:01:00.070> SP<00:01:00.489> from<00:01:00.700> blocks<00:01:00.970> from

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
so you will generate SP from blocks from

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.870 
so you will generate SP from blocks from
these<00:01:01.390> three<00:01:01.660> situation<00:01:02.380> normal<00:01:03.340> guarding<00:01:03.730> or

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
these three situation normal guarding or

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.180 
these three situation normal guarding or
perfect<00:01:04.330> guarding<00:01:04.660> normal<00:01:04.960> attacks<00:01:05.290> heavy

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
perfect guarding normal attacks heavy

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.210 
perfect guarding normal attacks heavy

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
Stan during a smash attack or taking

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.460 
Stan during a smash attack or taking
damage<00:01:09.460> which<00:01:10.000> slightly<00:01:10.300> increases<00:01:10.960> your<00:01:11.050> SP

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
damage which slightly increases your SP

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.940 
damage which slightly increases your SP
but<00:01:11.890> is<00:01:12.130> generally<00:01:12.910> not<00:01:13.060> recommended<00:01:13.950> again

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
but is generally not recommended again

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
heavy stander against a normal attack

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.830 
heavy stander against a normal attack
will<00:01:17.649> not<00:01:17.830> generate<00:01:18.280> SP<00:01:21.539> moving<00:01:22.539> on<00:01:22.660> we're

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
will not generate SP moving on we're

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.359 
will not generate SP moving on we're
going<00:01:22.930> to<00:01:22.990> talk<00:01:23.170> about<00:01:23.320> rank<00:01:23.680> 9<00:01:23.860> guard<00:01:24.160> and

going to talk about rank 9 guard and
simply<00:01:24.729> seeing<00:01:25.030> it<00:01:25.240> in<00:01:25.360> action<00:01:25.479> I'm<00:01:25.899> going<00:01:26.590> to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
simply seeing it in action I'm going to

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.900 
simply seeing it in action I'm going to

assume you're familiar with the basic

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.090 
assume you're familiar with the basic
combos<00:01:28.539> of<00:01:28.690> jana<00:01:29.140> either<00:01:29.319> with<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.560> sword<00:01:29.890> or

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
combos of jana either with a sword or

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.309 
combos of jana either with a sword or
with<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.340> hammer<00:01:30.580> if<00:01:30.880> you've<00:01:31.600> leveled<00:01:31.810> guard<00:01:32.200> to

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
with a hammer if you've leveled guard to

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:33.809 
with a hammer if you've leveled guard to
rank<00:01:32.500> 9<00:01:32.709> you<00:01:32.890> should<00:01:33.069> understand<00:01:33.550> and<00:01:33.700> pick

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
rank 9 you should understand and pick

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:36.150 
rank 9 you should understand and pick
this<00:01:33.940> up<00:01:34.119> very<00:01:34.390> quickly<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.619> let's<00:01:35.800> read<00:01:36.009> and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
this up very quickly so let's read and

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.300 
this up very quickly so let's read and
understand<00:01:36.670> first<00:01:37.110> for<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.140> rank<00:01:38.380> 9<00:01:38.590> or<00:01:38.770> hire<00:01:38.979> an

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
understand first for a rank 9 or hire an

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.430 
understand first for a rank 9 or hire an
additional<00:01:39.610> three<00:01:40.300> hit<00:01:40.539> normal<00:01:40.959> attack<00:01:41.229> will

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
additional three hit normal attack will

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.900 
additional three hit normal attack will
be<00:01:41.560> made<00:01:41.770> when<00:01:41.950> you<00:01:42.039> use<00:01:42.190> a<00:01:42.220> normal<00:01:42.459> attack

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
be made when you use a normal attack

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.600 
be made when you use a normal attack
after<00:01:43.119> using<00:01:43.599> guard<00:01:44.099> so<00:01:45.099> what<00:01:45.280> does<00:01:45.429> this<00:01:45.550> mean

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
after using guard so what does this mean

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.749 
after using guard so what does this mean
exactly<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.869> pretty<00:01:47.080> sketchy<00:01:47.380> right<00:01:47.759> first

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
exactly it's pretty sketchy right first

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.359 
exactly it's pretty sketchy right first
let<00:01:49.119> me<00:01:49.149> tell<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.599> think<00:01:49.869> about<00:01:50.170> this<00:01:50.440> move

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
let me tell you to think about this move

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.480 
let me tell you to think about this move
as<00:01:51.640> an<00:01:51.940> alternative<00:01:52.569> to<00:01:52.990> counter-attack<00:01:53.490> so

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
as an alternative to counter-attack so

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.370 
as an alternative to counter-attack so
just<00:01:55.060> think<00:01:55.509> about<00:01:55.569> this<00:01:55.899> move<00:01:56.110> as<00:01:56.289> an

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
just think about this move as an

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.100 
just think about this move as an
alternative<00:01:56.860> to<00:01:57.039> counter<00:01:57.399> attack<00:01:57.640> first<00:01:58.110> so

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
alternative to counter attack first so

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.930
