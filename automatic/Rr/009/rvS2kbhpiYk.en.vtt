00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:13.919
And it looks like Pacto has

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.368
another idea of 
what the box could be.

00:00:21.272 --> 00:00:25.817
He's going to step on the box
 to reach that lovely juicy apple.

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:29.264
No!

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:48.609
I am afraid this box
 isn't like most box is.

00:00:49.237 --> 00:00:52.118
Do you know why the box 
keeps running away?

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.962
Let me give you a clue.

00:00:57.644 --> 00:01:01.595
There's something inside the box.

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:06.159
It is very very friendly,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.373
with floppy ears 
and a very waggy tail.

00:01:10.844 --> 00:01:12.436
Can you guess what is it?

00:01:32.565 --> 00:01:35.471
Can any of you tell our friends

00:01:35.472 --> 00:01:40.533
what or who is inside the
box and making it move?

00:01:46.516 --> 00:01:47.908
Lula!

00:01:49.997 --> 00:01:52.556
That's right! It's Lula!

00:01:54.172 --> 00:01:55.404
Lula?
