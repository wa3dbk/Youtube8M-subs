00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
about it perfect shapes look at this

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.880 
about it perfect shapes look at this
what<00:01:11.550> in<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> world<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.690> it<00:01:13.680> almost

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890
