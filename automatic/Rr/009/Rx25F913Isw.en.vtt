00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello everyone my name is bad fame and 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.819
 well we are here in a game in 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.730
 I live I'm commenting live on the 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.309
 event this one shot one king I will try 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.990
 commenting a little while to see if something comes out 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.480
 well you know in this event there 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.220
 sniper and wall tok and one but 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.710
 good 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.710
 and then it is not used much that we say 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 look 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.410
 I thought I had the turn 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.410
 because they make you 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.040
 Hello 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.629
 until the typical day before they do not have me 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.790
 a game is that this event is 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.430
 good when they start doing blind if 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.530
 that people but before there was a 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.060
 heading that presses the fears have a 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.980
 shot with the sniper and then 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.900
 take the turn or they hit you or smoke 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.900
 that is, only to have death 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.580
 I do not know why people do not want 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.180
 have fun 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.180
 wow 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.170
 good 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.650
 here it leaves you 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.650
 it is normal to be still 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.280
 to 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.970
 allow me 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.340
 josÃ©luis gala this 60 ok I'm going to 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.670
 ride then you have to kill him because 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.560
 reassure yourself a little 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.209
 and get in there for the sniper that 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.620
 use the sniper because it 's all 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.780
 the hard part is that there are people who do not 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.310
 like to use the sniper in this 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.510
 modality that is for them to use the 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.920
 sniper 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.920
 you will not have to throw it away 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.730
 with this gala 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.659
 the here not 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.659
 and if it runs 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.470
 and now now you are not zero 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.630
 this grandmother will be 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.860
 as now 61 to see if now it 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.060
 reassure a little bit more if I start 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.060
 use more the sniper 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.440
 but I knew that also 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.780
 take out one another 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.810
 my god how heavy is 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.620
 I thought it is another more ratico of 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.620
 base and ratita 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.890
 I would have liked to record the game in 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.720
 I live one that was before it was very 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.780
 very good the truth that people saw 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.790
 that people could be respected because 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.770
 we even took turns to do 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.620
 the live and everything and the last and without 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.680
 talk to anyone that is what is lost 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.680
 sometimes 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.350
 since he attends but my god what disgust that 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.350
 It gives people like me 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.200
 a little here and there 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.200
 I thought 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.350
 is that it is a boat that is not in the 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.370
 team 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.370
 here there are no bots 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.010
 oh my god my heaviest people god 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.389
 is to have fun please this way 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.389
 of game to have fun 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.250
 I was pretty much wanted to raise a game 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.440
 so you can see what the event is like if 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.000
 they never played it or if they did not directly 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.840
 they have the game and they like to watch videos 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.550
 of the game 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.680
 the event is like this they give you a 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.750
 sniper and one turn 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.450
 well I did not put any blaine but good 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.040
 I will try to make it more likes to 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.440
 talk more live 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.430
 in this in this type of events and good 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.880
 I hope you liked that we see each other 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.880
 in another video
