 it is first and foremost to be at 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.270
 public service ie our 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.520
 role is to connect urban centers

 along the network or to the villages 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.100
 between the two so we are to bear 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:21.780
 Canada's economic prosperity 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.360
 will allow the mobility of people for 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.470
 personal purposes but also for 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.890
 professional purposes and purposes 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.600
 business 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.360
 to do that we have to do three things 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.490
 first always operated go are 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.679
 security 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.060
 secondly maintain the reputation that 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.610
 we have in terms of service to the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.840
 customer service and 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.470
 the sea ​​in the transport industry 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.270
 passengers third one must 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.729
 identify market opportunities 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.739
 that is, where are there people who 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.170
 want to take the train when are they going 

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:52.649
 take the train and addressed this 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.770

 ambition at liana 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.920
 and 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.509
 despite our mission being 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.610
 to be the public service we have to when

 even operated commercially so 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.260
 to do this we need to rethink everything 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.970
 what we do every day what we 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.130

 well, we have the minuad 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.080
 what we do to win we have to 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.940
 stop doing it takes 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.540
 imagination the creativity and of
