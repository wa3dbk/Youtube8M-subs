00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.980 
differences in gigabytes is the 128 one
that's<00:01:55.570> why<00:01:55.780> it<00:01:55.840> was<00:01:55.930> so<00:01:56.020> much<00:01:57.660> but<00:01:58.660> the<00:01:58.930> other

that's why it was so much but the other

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.400 
that's why it was so much but the other
model<00:01:59.320> goes<00:01:59.710> by<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.820> 16<00:02:01.510> gigabyte<00:02:02.020> think<00:02:02.260> it

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
model goes by the 16 gigabyte think it

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:12.600 
model goes by the 16 gigabyte think it
is<00:02:02.880> 499<00:02:03.880> +<00:02:04.950> 64<00:02:05.950> is<00:02:08.369> 599<00:02:09.369> oh<00:02:09.640> ok<00:02:10.600> so<00:02:11.310> I'll<00:02:12.310> most
