it's definitely made a nice environment
in<00:00:08.220> our<00:00:08.370> class<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.900> say<00:00:10.080> that<00:00:10.230> we<00:00:10.350> can<00:00:10.500> like

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
in our class and say that we can like

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.700 
in our class and say that we can like
talk<00:00:11.070> more<00:00:11.850> together<00:00:12.270> and<00:00:12.540> we<00:00:12.630> can<00:00:12.810> be<00:00:13.530> move

that happened with all the children and

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.370 
that happened with all the children and
then<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:20.039> world<00:00:20.220> could<00:00:20.670> be<00:00:21.150> like<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:22.199> would<00:00:22.320> be

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
then the world could be like it would be

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.830 
then the world could be like it would be
such<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> nice<00:00:23.070> place<00:00:23.369> because<00:00:23.910> not<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.750> it

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
such a nice place because not that it

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.279 
such a nice place because not that it
isn't<00:00:24.960> now<00:00:25.230> but<00:00:25.740> um<00:00:26.570> then<00:00:27.570> everyone<00:00:27.990> could<00:00:28.140> be

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
isn't now but um then everyone could be

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.109 
isn't now but um then everyone could be
a<00:00:28.320> team<00:00:28.590> instead<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.580> they're<00:00:29.970> being

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
a team instead of like they're being

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:48.460 
a team instead of like they're being
fights<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.689> conflicts

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
fun it's a fun way to learn and through

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.109 
fun it's a fun way to learn and through
most<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> lesson<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.009> fun<00:01:08.250> over<00:01:08.940> watch

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
most of the lesson the fun over watch

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.070 
most of the lesson the fun over watch
video<00:01:09.600> clips<00:01:09.660> and<00:01:10.610> we<00:01:11.610> play<00:01:11.820> games<00:01:11.850> or<00:01:12.720> loops

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
video clips and we play games or loops

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.630 
video clips and we play games or loops
too

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.670 

the<00:01:18.360> children<00:01:18.720> started<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.380> talk<00:01:19.530> about

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
the children started to talk about

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.310 
the children started to talk about
themselves<00:01:20.010> in<00:01:20.670> terms<00:01:20.940> of<00:01:21.210> how<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.900> impacted

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
themselves in terms of how it impacted

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.410 
themselves in terms of how it impacted
on<00:01:22.470> them<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:23.520> they're<00:01:23.700> able<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.030> kind<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.360> use

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
on them then they're able to kind of use

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210 
on them then they're able to kind of use
those<00:01:24.780> skills<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:25.440> how<00:01:25.620> their<00:01:26.070> behavior

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
those skills to see how their behavior

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.490 
those skills to see how their behavior
is<00:01:26.580> impacted<00:01:27.060> upon<00:01:27.300> others<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.170> there's<00:01:28.350> all

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
is impacted upon others so there's all

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.690 
is impacted upon others so there's all
sorts<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.770> things<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.100> was<00:01:29.190> seeing<00:01:29.310> over<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
sorts of things I was seeing over the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.430 
sorts of things I was seeing over the
program<00:01:29.909> where<00:01:30.210> children<00:01:30.479> was<00:01:31.050> fun<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.350> think

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
program where children was fun to think

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.380 
program where children was fun to think
about<00:01:31.560> choosing<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.610> right<00:01:32.760> decision<00:01:33.360> so

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
about choosing the right decision so

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.219 
about choosing the right decision so
thinking<00:01:33.810> about<00:01:33.900> their<00:01:34.170> true<00:01:34.680> voice<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.670> also

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
thinking about their true voice and also

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.420 
thinking about their true voice and also
then<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.440> impact<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:37.920> playground<00:01:38.310> for

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
then that impact on the playground for

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.930 
then that impact on the playground for
things<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:39.050> sharing<00:01:40.050> and<00:01:40.940> resolving

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
things like sharing and resolving

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.730 
things like sharing and resolving
conflict<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.600> things<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.259> there

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
conflict and things like that so there

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.810 
conflict and things like that so there
was<00:01:43.830> definitely<00:01:44.130> progression<00:01:44.520> throughout

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
was definitely progression throughout

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.399 
was definitely progression throughout
the<00:01:44.940> 13<00:01:45.270> weeks<00:01:45.450> where<00:01:45.690> initially<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
the 13 weeks where initially the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.320 
the 13 weeks where initially the
children<00:01:46.680> were<00:01:46.740> thinking<00:01:46.950> about<00:01:47.100> themselves

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
children were thinking about themselves

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.180 
children were thinking about themselves
and<00:01:48.330> then<00:01:48.600> about<00:01:49.350> how<00:01:49.530> their<00:01:49.710> behaviors

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
and then about how their behaviors

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.980 
and then about how their behaviors
impact<00:01:50.490> for<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.700> others<00:01:53.600> last<00:01:54.600> time<00:01:54.869> we

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
impact for the others last time we

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.600 
impact for the others last time we
learned<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.560> both<00:01:55.680> life<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.220> games<00:01:56.460> are

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
learned that both life and games are

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.279 
learned that both life and games are
similar<00:01:56.789> and<00:01:57.240> if<00:01:57.390> they<00:01:57.509> have<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.840> same<00:01:58.050> types

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
similar and if they have the same types

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:59.719 
similar and if they have the same types
of<00:01:58.410> pieces<00:01:58.649> or<00:01:59.009> components

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
of pieces or components

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.190 
of pieces or components
do<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.240> remember<00:02:00.360> what<00:02:00.630> those<00:02:00.750> components

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
do you remember what those components

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.120 
do you remember what those components
are<00:02:01.289> hold<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.550> I<00:02:02.789> got<00:02:03.330> this<00:02:03.539> one<00:02:03.840> okay<00:02:04.619> re<00:02:04.830> what

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
are hold up I got this one okay re what

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.550 
are hold up I got this one okay re what
are<00:02:05.250> they<00:02:05.429> rules<00:02:06.330> goals<00:02:06.780> players<00:02:07.259> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
are they rules goals players and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.780 
are they rules goals players and
challenges<00:02:09.410> exactly<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.709> last<00:02:11.370> week<00:02:11.610> we

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
challenges exactly and last week we

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.580 
challenges exactly and last week we
learned<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.330> if<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.450> know<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.959> rules<00:02:13.170> you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
learned that if you know the rules you

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.560 
learned that if you know the rules you
can<00:02:13.800> get<00:02:13.980> everything<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.850> really<00:02:15.330> want

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
can get everything that you really want

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.430 
can get everything that you really want
the<00:02:15.690> program<00:02:15.989> would<00:02:16.410> help<00:02:16.680> beat<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:19.140> three

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
the program would help beat the three

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:29.270
