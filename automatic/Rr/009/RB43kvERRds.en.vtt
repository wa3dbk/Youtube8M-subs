business classes that we created in a
previous<00:00:11.700> tutorial<00:00:12.679> introduce<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.980> the

previous tutorial introduce you to the

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.369 
previous tutorial introduce you to the
application<00:00:14.250> model<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.210> show<00:00:15.599> how<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.900> use<00:00:16.230> it

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
application model and show how to use it

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.980 
application model and show how to use it
to<00:00:16.500> set<00:00:16.710> custom<00:00:16.920> settings<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.060> UI<00:00:18.270> so
