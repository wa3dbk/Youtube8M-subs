right<00:00:36.809> up<00:00:36.960> until<00:00:37.079> qualifying<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.829> hadn't

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
right up until qualifying you hadn't

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.889 
right up until qualifying you hadn't
really<00:00:38.219> shown<00:00:38.399> your<00:00:38.550> hand<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.790> weekend<00:00:39.149> yes

really shown your hand this weekend yes
and<00:00:40.079> no<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.290> think<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:41.250> think<00:00:41.700> had<00:00:42.110> had<00:00:43.110> Lewis<00:00:43.350> had

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
and no I think I think had had Lewis had

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.240 
and no I think I think had had Lewis had
a<00:00:44.390> more<00:00:45.390> normal<00:00:45.600> get<00:00:45.930> away<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.950> would<00:00:47.160> have

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
a more normal get away this would have

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.100 
a more normal get away this would have
been<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.370> tougher<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> tougher<00:00:48.360> proposition<00:00:48.570> but

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
been a tougher a tougher proposition but

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.740 
been a tougher a tougher proposition but
we<00:00:49.530> were<00:00:49.620> pretty<00:00:49.649> close<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:51.090> roseburg<00:00:51.539> in

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.700 
we can be really competitive challenge
for<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.579> win<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.390> think<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.079> unlikely<00:01:43.470> that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
for the win I I think it's unlikely that

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.249 
for the win I I think it's unlikely that
we<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:45.000> we<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.689> level<00:01:45.930> of

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
we can that we can have this level of

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.920 
we can that we can have this level of
performance<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:48.030> all<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.329> races<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.720> come

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
performance in in all the races to come

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.170 
performance in in all the races to come
as<00:01:49.170> all<00:01:49.560> sorts<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.979> chaos<00:01:50.310> happen<00:01:50.670> today<00:01:50.850> as

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
as all sorts of chaos happen today as

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.080 
as all sorts of chaos happen today as
I'm<00:01:51.329> sure<00:01:51.360> you're<00:01:51.689> aware<00:01:51.750> but<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.759> think

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
I'm sure you're aware but but I think

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.090 
I'm sure you're aware but but I think
that<00:01:54.329> we've<00:01:54.869> been<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.110> little<00:01:55.290> under<00:01:55.590> par<00:01:55.920> in

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
that we've been a little under par in

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.249 
that we've been a little under par in
the<00:01:56.189> last<00:01:56.369> few<00:01:56.579> races<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.420> not<00:01:57.930> really

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
the last few races and not really

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.810 
the last few races and not really
showing<00:01:58.439> what<00:01:58.680> we're<00:01:58.799> capable<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.310> so

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
showing what we're capable of so

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.880 
showing what we're capable of so
hopefully<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.390> were<00:02:00.659> worried<00:02:01.079> abour<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.590> little

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
hopefully we were worried abour a little

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.440 
hopefully we were worried abour a little
more<00:02:01.979> competitive<00:02:02.490> as<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.880> as<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> rest<00:02:03.390> of

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
more competitive as that as the rest of

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.450 
more competitive as that as the rest of
the<00:02:03.540> year<00:02:03.659> unfolds<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.710> final<00:02:05.009> question<00:02:05.280> for

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
the year unfolds just final question for

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.570 
the year unfolds just final question for
