00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.020 

is<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.610> original<00:00:35.030> I<00:00:36.340> can<00:00:37.340> wold<00:00:37.550> it<00:00:37.700> all<00:00:37.820> back

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
is the original I can wold it all back

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.480 
is the original I can wold it all back
together<00:00:38.560> which<00:00:39.560> I'm<00:00:39.770> not<00:00:39.920> worried<00:00:40.190> about<00:00:40.250> the

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
together which I'm not worried about the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:58.190 
together which I'm not worried about the
world<00:00:49.780> well<00:00:50.780> that's<00:00:51.050> not<00:00:51.230> what<00:00:51.500> should<00:00:51.770> be

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.300 

it's<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.920> be<00:00:59.070> even<00:00:59.160> worse<00:00:59.430> than<00:00:59.670> away<00:00:59.910> I

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
it's going to be even worse than away I

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:13.710 
it's going to be even worse than away I
think

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:21.510 

you<00:01:14.260> got<00:01:14.470> yours<00:01:14.710> upside<00:01:15.130> down<00:01:16.500> mm-hmm<00:01:20.520> no

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
you got yours upside down mm-hmm no

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:46.610 
you got yours upside down mm-hmm no
matter<00:01:21.730> what<00:01:21.940> I<00:01:21.970> look

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.690 

give<00:01:47.220> me<00:01:47.370> the<00:01:47.490> clearance<00:01:47.970> rate<00:01:48.180> them<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:49.700> guess

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
give me the clearance rate them I guess

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.610 
give me the clearance rate them I guess
it<00:01:50.850> could<00:01:51.000> melt<00:01:51.180> something<00:01:51.540> down<00:01:51.720> here<00:01:54.620> well

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
it could melt something down here well

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.990 
it could melt something down here well
you<00:01:55.740> could<00:01:55.860> probably<00:01:56.130> put<00:01:56.370> an<00:01:56.460> extension<00:01:56.940> on

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
you could probably put an extension on

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.440 
you could probably put an extension on
that<00:01:57.060> panhard<00:01:57.570> bar<00:01:58.370> bracket<00:01:59.370> right<00:01:59.460> here<00:01:59.520> just

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
that panhard bar bracket right here just

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.020 
that panhard bar bracket right here just
extend<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.050> panhard<00:02:01.500> bar<00:02:01.770> bracket<00:02:02.460> down<00:02:02.700> a

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
extend that panhard bar bracket down a

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.460 
extend that panhard bar bracket down a
little<00:02:03.930> deeper<00:02:04.050> yeah<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.550> mountain<00:02:06.470> an

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
little deeper yeah in the mountain an

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.469 
little deeper yeah in the mountain an
endemic<00:02:08.040> by<00:02:08.340> he'll<00:02:08.610> have<00:02:08.820> room<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.360> your

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
endemic by he'll have room for your

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.260 
endemic by he'll have room for your
steering<00:02:10.170> rod<00:02:10.440> there<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:11.430> go<00:02:11.700> right<00:02:11.910> Molly<00:02:12.120> it

steering rod there and go right Molly it

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.330 
steering rod there and go right Molly it
laughs<00:02:12.450> what<00:02:13.350> must<00:02:13.590> feel<00:02:13.740> something<00:02:13.980> good<00:02:14.220> to
