into<00:02:37.390> its<00:02:37.960> separate<00:02:38.620> pieces<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:39.750> started<00:02:40.750> off

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
into its separate pieces I started off

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.140 
into its separate pieces I started off
by<00:02:40.990> trying<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.440> hit<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.830> shuriken<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:42.850> idea<00:02:43.090> is

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
by trying to hit a shuriken the idea is

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.760 
by trying to hit a shuriken the idea is
the<00:02:43.300> throat<00:02:43.510> assure<00:02:43.750> again<00:02:43.959> based<00:02:44.200> on<00:02:44.500> where

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
the throat assure again based on where

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.250 
the throat assure again based on where
she's<00:02:45.070> heading<00:02:45.459> so<00:02:46.300> we<00:02:46.390> can<00:02:46.540> see<00:02:46.720> here<00:02:46.930> she's

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
she's heading so we can see here she's

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.020 
she's heading so we can see here she's
heading<00:02:47.530> forward<00:02:47.830> even<00:02:48.520> though<00:02:48.580> she<00:02:48.700> backs

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
heading forward even though she backs

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.730 
heading forward even though she backs
off<00:02:49.300> as<00:02:49.570> soon<00:02:49.870> as<00:02:49.990> she<00:02:50.110> realized<00:02:50.410> as<00:02:50.590> I've

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
off as soon as she realized as I've

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.550 
off as soon as she realized as I've
thrown<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.160> it's<00:02:51.310> still<00:02:51.520> a<00:02:51.580> clean<00:02:51.940> hit<00:02:52.560> the
