00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.379
 I already promised a lot because 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.059
 I always ask people you have 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.160
 Do you yourself so I do not know how 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.570
 it is with you I like me quite 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.340
 once myself and I think if you are 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.400
 It usually does itself as well 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.980
 better and you have a lot more fun with it 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.560
 and yes of course the speech is of course 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.420
 I 'll do it myself and me 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.260
 will you today in the small tutorial 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.730
 betrayed this has the advantage 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.769
 if you have ne jackets on or 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.960
 clinging yourself makes you always have 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.309
 people arrive and ask their boco 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.809
 had that yes how did you do that 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.969
 and definitely learned a lot 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.610
 People know I have a 70 year old 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.350
 old lady so just met the easy 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.050
 passed by and said 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.980
 May I not touch it like that 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.390
 then spiked year 18 too 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.860
 As I said she was totally sweet that has me 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.230
 then also reveal that they themselves as 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.030
 little child and as a teenager totally 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.480
 has built a lot of mess and 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.190
 I did it because I did it like that 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.949
 asked if that's true with a 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.210
 teen crazy clothes and what's up 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.320
 the older people do not always do everything 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.890
 but I was thrilled 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.420
 So very cool as I thought about you 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.380
 before that, the rivets I made 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.670
 do not wish you on the breasts 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.200
 recommend or ask where I am 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.259
 like to be adapted because of the people 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.240
 come on and off 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.680
 yes, but it is very cool as today betrayed 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.119
 i told you how to do this yes 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.159
 made as I did you and 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.720
 maybe you and me are inspired 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.119
 can give you a few tricks and tips 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.009
 So today, have fun with the tutorial 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.960
 now comes first the things you 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.630
 so it really takes care of everyone 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.549
 If we take a garment now 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.750
 my jacket with denim jacket yours 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.750
 wanted to beautify 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.680
 so if you are now one 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.650
 you have chosen garment 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.120
 There is necessarily a hot glue gun there 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.320
 Actually, I am already somewhere 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.540
 to buy in the hardware store 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.450
 then he made such a glue stick 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.130
 pure or sticky sticks and I would 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.630
 Recommend this to you the best because I 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.160
 had done here as well as sticky 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.560
 pistol and therefore in the rain at the moment 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.270
 when people adapt and dry there 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.039
 super fast and has the advantage that 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.110
 who do not like each other so now and then 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.420
 fall off one but very rarely 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.900
 really important and as I said 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.900
 hot glue gun 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.050
 so then you need natural things we 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.220
 stick on the jacket and there you can 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.720
 be creative now 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.680
 I have now leads for example 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.790
 such rent decided 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.530
 different spines then is still here 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.540
 a little chain with it so I have 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.450
 really taken different things 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.490
 and then just have to look 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.290
 There is really in the shop to 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.290
 such a glittering stone here 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.980
 In any case, it should be so instead of the 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.750
 you can cut it right there is 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.240
 You can then buy here somehow 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.950
 stick to the ak or whatever 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.480
 I now have for example not turn 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:01.310
 but there are different cards her 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.750
 can really look at belts and 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.630
 accessories and here comes the trick 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.920
 namely, there are people besides these 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.870
 relatively heavy and I would you 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.630
 namely not for such a jacket because the 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.040
 Because there is everywhere to buy because 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.450
 The neat ones are heavy then hangs on you 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.900
 all down and do not stand that way 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.250
 beautiful 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.410
 and now comes the trick I'm taking 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.990
 I ran through a business one day 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.920
 and just to name a few 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.910
 h &amp; m zara or whatever 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.220
 do you have to mean the girl department 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.500
 give the have so no earrings and 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.110
 chains and there are staggering everywhere and 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.120
 rivet and you have to get involved 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.160
 So the things are right 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.540
 Just pick up the rents from the 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.130
 chain or somehow use because the 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.510
 are mostly made of lightweight aluminum 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.610
 you're doing such a thing for example now 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.470
 rent from the chain and they are great 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.460
 easy and you can do it here without 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.460
 stick problems on it 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.790
 yes and they are not that hard but me 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.390
 show you some examples now 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.390
 for this 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.489
 as you can see you have to say 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.730
 being creative really looks you in order 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.170
 hardware stores accessoire life guys dar 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.030
 you want to buy the girl department 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.919
 earrings you can say it would be 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.269
 for your sister so the cat her 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.789
 away does not immediately determine that you are 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.190
 as women dressed so you dare 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:29.110
 buy as said by boehringer that 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.180
 were rings of h &amp; m so really 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.800
 also cheap things you have to do it 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.550
 not necessarily expensive things to buy 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.870
 cool for that and arm yourself 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.639
 then somehow with a pair of pliers or 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.380
 something like that you her this 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.910
 rent from the actual earring then 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.229
 Abzwacken can or can separate the 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.150
 Maybe it's because it works like that 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.789
 said only aluminum is or 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.500
 light metals and then you can like 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.110
 said start if you love them 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.150
 have solved here on the bottom of the 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.789
 to apply glue with the 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.610
 hot glue gun and then just there 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.470
 Put on the shoulder where have it 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.699
 So I would also recommend you 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.460
 that one can turn on one shoulder 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.750
 so it does not look so good then 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.570
 when I think of my it is 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.520
 too much you can but do so shall your 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.530
 Credit creativity is no limit 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.780
 set and as I said I have to go here 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.090
 for example a few safety pins 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.410
 go ahead and take bigger rivets 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.320
 take smaller rentals 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.270
 you see this long thing that was here 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.460
 actually a bracelet for the hand 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.460
 So you could buy solid starts 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.630
 I just have it up 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.030
 separated with scissors and got 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:40.950
 almost the bracelet stuck up here 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.510
 and yes, as I said, do what you want 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.520
 your creativity is not limited 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.230
 set as stated is not important 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.040
 These heavy rent for jackets because of the 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.990
 do not look so nice now and then 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.790
 otherwise hot glue gun teeth 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.890
 then the state can go to a business 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.630
 and in the end you have your coal jacket 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.520
 again asks where did you have those 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.980
 can claim 50,000 million here 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.200
 cost euro 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.520
 So yes super much fun to tinker and 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.050
 Of course you can not just do it with me 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.230
 a jacket but also with 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.230
 shoes 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.570
 of course, it is also possible with pocket pants 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.690
 everything you can really behind that 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:25.530
 give where we wanted to in the bathroom 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.720
 toilet paper anyway does what 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.490
 you want what you want and I hope 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.430
 I was able to give you some small tips 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:36.270
 Give today and I'll show you now 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:39.300
 again two pictures like it with me 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:42.170
 dressed looked almost standing once 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.170
 and sit once 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.260
 okay the last photo and seat heating we 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.720
 are from the rihanna at the 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.490
 autograph session was I was in 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.590
 hoyerswerda as I waited for the train 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.800
 I have and not the roma, so to speak 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:05.810
 so had a lot of fun with 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.810
 tinker and see you next time
