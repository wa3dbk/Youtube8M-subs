00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.149
 whatsapp everybody these crystals and 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.009
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.629
 very special video at home that you 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.790
 see me but since only one 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.050
 video so back in fact of my video 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.910
 special video fans rather 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.740
 catastrophic saying that I do not 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.509
 could not do so many videos 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.770
 since I am currently at my house 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.930
 father after a few small worries 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.220
 maybe one of those bullshit there because 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.449
 that it gets me drunk when I turn on my 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.160
 computer and something that appears 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.900
 west at pea libre and nook whaou 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.150
 post it the new presta of red dead 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.890
 redemption so basically it was one of 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.719
 back to tell you that it's okay 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.100
 much better 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.230
 in addition to that for a few days 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.120
 I will be alone at my father's house because 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.440
 that they left fine end so kind 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.520
 in three days I 'll be all that 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.290
 I will be able to offer you anyway 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.670
 a lot of content in the new passage 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.960
 laptop so hop people me 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.879
 say with what computer you played 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.190
 with a very important sock the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.530
 sock that allows the mouse 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.840
 so to play well on it and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.239
 so my second laptop 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.590
 generation with my other computer 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.359
 so at the level of my boat it's true 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.739
 I do not have many things right 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.299
 I have two computers but still 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.729
 they are often pretty good we'll say 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.250
 quite powerful but they are 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.310
 laptops and so with where 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.799
 with grandma's name is called sorts of 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.619
 wood us in quarters and all that and then 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.970
 where I sleep finally brief since I am 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.770
 my father and I'm all alone 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.070
 it's true that I was late 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.119
 good it's not too much I've got it all right 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.380
 and that's actually it was just a little 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.180
 back to tell you by the way ah yes 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.650
