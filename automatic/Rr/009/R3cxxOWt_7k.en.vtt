you're wondering the price tag on those

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.910 
you're wondering the price tag on those
trucks<00:02:33.540> does<00:02:33.810> run<00:02:34.049> from<00:02:34.319> two<00:02:34.620> hundred

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
trucks does run from two hundred

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.039 
trucks does run from two hundred
thousand<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.790> seven<00:02:36.239> hundred<00:02:36.659> thousand

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
thousand to seven hundred thousand

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.229 
thousand to seven hundred thousand
dollars<00:02:37.079> but<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.920> varies<00:02:38.549> per<00:02:38.909> truck

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
dollars but that varies per truck

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.140 
dollars but that varies per truck
because<00:02:39.599> each<00:02:39.840> one<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.170> custom-made<00:02:41.150> that's

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
because each one is custom-made that's

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.240 
because each one is custom-made that's
so<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.750> can<00:02:42.900> get<00:02:43.140> pricey<00:02:43.379> but<00:02:43.769> I<00:02:43.829> guess<00:02:44.069> you
