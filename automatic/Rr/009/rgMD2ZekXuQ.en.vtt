00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
all to be the same size because I my

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.020 
all to be the same size because I my
strips<00:00:51.230> cut<00:00:51.440> I<00:00:51.739> have<00:00:52.309> three<00:00:52.640> different<00:00:52.789> kinds

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
strips cut I have three different kinds

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.360 
strips cut I have three different kinds
of<00:00:53.239> ribbon<00:00:53.539> and<00:00:53.780> just<00:00:54.109> two<00:00:54.530> strips<00:00:54.949> of<00:00:55.070> each

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
of ribbon and just two strips of each

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.310 
of ribbon and just two strips of each
there<00:00:55.670> are<00:00:55.730> five<00:00:55.940> inches<00:00:56.269> long<00:00:56.510> you<00:00:57.079> can<00:00:57.199> do

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
there are five inches long you can do

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.900 
there are five inches long you can do
this<00:00:57.440> with<00:00:57.500> more<00:00:57.920> or<00:00:58.100> less<00:00:58.280> if<00:00:58.460> you'd<00:00:58.579> like<00:00:58.699> I

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
this with more or less if you'd like I

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.340 
this with more or less if you'd like I
think<00:00:59.149> six<00:00:59.390> is<00:00:59.510> probably<00:00:59.840> the<00:00:59.960> least<00:01:00.109> you'd

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
think six is probably the least you'd

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.139 
think six is probably the least you'd
want<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.590> do<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:01.039> then<00:01:01.699> what<00:01:01.820> you're<00:01:01.940> going<00:01:02.059> to

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
want to do and then what you're going to

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.740 
want to do and then what you're going to
do<00:01:02.210> is<00:01:02.300> just<00:01:02.329> take<00:01:02.690> them<00:01:02.980> one<00:01:03.980> at<00:01:04.010> a<00:01:04.129> time<00:01:04.750> you

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
do is just take them one at a time you

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.100 
do is just take them one at a time you
could<00:01:05.870> vary<00:01:06.430> they<00:01:07.430> look<00:01:07.700> like<00:01:07.730> let's<00:01:08.180> see<00:01:08.420> I'm

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
could vary they look like let's see I'm

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
could vary they look like let's see I'm
just<00:01:09.229> going<00:01:09.439> to<00:01:09.500> spread<00:01:09.920> these<00:01:10.130> around<00:01:10.189> evenly

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
just going to spread these around evenly

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.280 
just going to spread these around evenly
this<00:01:13.130> one<00:01:13.280> goes<00:01:13.430> next<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.619> then<00:01:15.619> our<00:01:15.770> last<00:01:15.950> one

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
this one goes next and then our last one

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.770 
this one goes next and then our last one
okay<00:01:18.290> now<00:01:18.470> I<00:01:18.500> kind<00:01:18.830> of<00:01:18.920> left<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.430> space<00:01:19.909> there<00:01:20.479> I

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
okay now I kind of left a space there I

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.270 
okay now I kind of left a space there I
like<00:01:21.590> that<00:01:21.770> to<00:01:21.979> be<00:01:22.780> my<00:01:23.780> center<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:24.920> I<00:01:24.950> have<00:01:25.159> an

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
like that to be my center so I have an

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.609 
like that to be my center so I have an
even<00:01:25.400> number<00:01:25.549> on<00:01:25.850> each<00:01:26.000> side<00:01:26.329> you<00:01:27.200> can<00:01:27.350> fold

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
even number on each side you can fold

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.460 
even number on each side you can fold
this<00:01:27.799> up<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.310> just<00:01:28.579> make<00:01:28.820> sure<00:01:29.150> that<00:01:29.479> you're

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
this up and just make sure that you're

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.719 
this up and just make sure that you're
even<00:01:30.799> if<00:01:31.810> your<00:01:32.979> pieces<00:01:33.979> of<00:01:34.159> ribbon<00:01:34.399> aren't

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
even if your pieces of ribbon aren't

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.399 
even if your pieces of ribbon aren't
exactly<00:01:35.090> even<00:01:35.270> that's<00:01:35.540> fine<00:01:35.720> because<00:01:35.960> we<00:01:36.229> can

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
exactly even that's fine because we can

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.039 
exactly even that's fine because we can
cut<00:01:36.649> them<00:01:36.829> later<00:01:37.360> they'll<00:01:38.360> just<00:01:38.540> be<00:01:38.689> a<00:01:38.720> little

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
cut them later they'll just be a little

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.920 
cut them later they'll just be a little
bit<00:01:39.259> shorter<00:01:39.759> then<00:01:40.759> you<00:01:40.970> start<00:01:41.210> off<00:01:41.390> with<00:01:41.689> if

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
bit shorter then you start off with if

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.410 
bit shorter then you start off with if
you<00:01:42.049> cut<00:01:42.229> too<00:01:42.439> much<00:01:42.649> ok<00:01:43.549> so<00:01:43.610> just<00:01:43.850> arrange<00:01:44.240> us

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
you cut too much ok so just arrange us

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.760 
you cut too much ok so just arrange us
however<00:01:44.630> you<00:01:44.899> like<00:01:45.140> evenly<00:01:46.009> spaced<00:01:47.619> once<00:01:48.619> you

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
however you like evenly spaced once you

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.550 
however you like evenly spaced once you
have<00:01:48.950> it<00:01:49.100> how<00:01:49.219> you<00:01:49.280> like<00:01:49.549> it<00:01:50.170> gonna<00:01:51.170> take<00:01:51.409> our

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
have it how you like it gonna take our

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.160 
have it how you like it gonna take our
needle<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:52.009> thread<00:01:52.360> stitch<00:01:53.360> up<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.630> center

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
needle and thread stitch up the center

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.510 
needle and thread stitch up the center
three<00:01:54.469> times<00:01:55.000> you<00:01:56.000> start<00:01:56.299> at<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.509> back<00:01:57.520> make

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
three times you start at the back make

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.529 
three times you start at the back make
three<00:01:58.880> stitches<00:02:00.549> you<00:02:01.549> can<00:02:01.700> also<00:02:01.850> just<00:02:02.149> wrap

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
three stitches you can also just wrap
