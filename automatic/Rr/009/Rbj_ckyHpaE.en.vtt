00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.560
 a cake its creation in the United States is 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.460
 surrounded by many legends count the same 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.080
 story 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.970
 a cook to make a cake 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.880
 chocolate that you forgot to put 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.239
 yeast in the mass did not grow but even 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.220
 so the slices were served the recipe 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.260
 discovered in the last century contains 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.390
 lots of chocolate and nuts 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.620
 brownie won the world and fell into taste 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.110
 of Brazilians 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.400
 in an outside judge, the mass took shape and 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.050
 full and very original decoration I see 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.910
 it was a year of 2011 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.370
 rafael is still an education student 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.160
 physics wanted to have their own money 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.380
 watching a cooking program and 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.770
 one brownie recipe and decided to test 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.230
 God has begun manufacturing at home and 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.680
 selling to some stores in the city in 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.320
 four months already had 25 clients and soon 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.079
 realized the need for a new space 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.810
 for the production in the factory the smell 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.120
 of chocolate began to attract customers 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.370
 When we got the door, we had all the 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.800
 customers outside entered wanted 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.990
 I started walking on the promenade to eat and 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.610
 so we were forced to adjust to the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.979
 this reality framework is a reality 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.590
 store and this company is 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.479
 suffering a gigantic growth that 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.180
 so out of the promotions that we 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.310
 I imagined to grow around 110 per 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.310
 the month in question, the volume of 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.799
 demand grew and with it the 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.180
 need for new hires 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.130
 eric is one of 25 employees here 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.320
 aroused the taste for gastronomy and 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.330
 To learn a profession I have never worked 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.360
 in kitchen had never done anything of the 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.890
 Like I learned a lot that I 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.299
 I never imagined myself doing it. 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.100
 imagined for me 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.220
 I thought that confectionery could be 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.320
 suddenly do one thing or another but not 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.810
 You can train yourself in this gastronomy.
