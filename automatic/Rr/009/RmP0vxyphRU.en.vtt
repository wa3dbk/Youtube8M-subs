00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.570
 to design a shoe you have to have 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.360
 great ideas and based on all the 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.119
 trends of the year that comes in I make a 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.340
 selection of colors of ranges of designs 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.510
 of heels platforms to design 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.510
 the perfect shoe 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.000
 and well we are in the selection area 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.400
 of skins there is a great variety of 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.350
 textures colors you can not 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.770
 imagine people think they are just 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.990
 beige black and brown and we have more than 2000 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.430
 ranges of colors purple rose mari los 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.470
 good shines are crazy 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.140
 the skins choose according to the style or 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.020
 season and we start with the development 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.810
 choosing the time 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.900
 is behind the model that we are going to make 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.390
 a center was brought forward a center 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.610
 back this is the guide 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.560
 of the shoe that we are going to make for 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.870
 then take out the molds 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.420
 of an initial sample I already defined 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.440
 He is with the platform and now we are going 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.440
 to start with the cut 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.470
 The fabric or skin is stretched and marked 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.590
 short 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:25.210
 flip over if you put on your skin so this 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:28.510
 it's the view because this way 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.970
 an example is how is this does not put it 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.220
 pulls out 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.500
 there is the temperature that is there 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.780
 but it 's hot but you have to 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.640
 be hot so that it sticks 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.690
 dow interlining thins the edge of the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.270
 skin to be able to bend 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.270
 here what I'm doing is the sunny 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.260
 for the numbering this is the die-cut 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.260
 for quality control 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.200
 now we connect the heel with the 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.200
 cover 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.700
 with the sewing machine closes the 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.700
 skin 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.160
 with that hammer we are going to open these two 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.160
 seams 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.080
 dry the lining and the skin and this thread with 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.510
 glue reinforces the seams and 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:30.500
 banks adhere to pay with the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.500
 hammer you will not open like that 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.800
 that is well muddy because if you do not 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.500
 wrinkle the glue is never placed on 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.550
 excess now you do start to see the 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.710
 shoe castle 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.710
 this is hot changes is an oven 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.250
 talking talking as you are talking 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.250
 it gives strength 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.760
 at the time of planting the missive plant 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.160
 in the last the castle of 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.530
 skin with the plant and it stretches 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.540
 will reduce burrs on the sole for later 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.540
 stick it with the heel at a price 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.930
 missing the lid with this gum 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.959
 remove the excess glue and 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.510
 brush of the last processes to take off 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.659
 the template and reduce the excess fabric 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.689
 It is cleaned and a touch of color is added and 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.430
 shine our shoes are ready 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:37.590
 here goes quality control dry that 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.040
 there is no outside thread if you do not 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.620
 they cut what they burn and now they save them 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.810
 is the quality 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.379
 of the shoe industry of our 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.379
 women now
