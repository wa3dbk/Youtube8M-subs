jump it from the battery to go directly

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.890 
jump it from the battery to go directly
to<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.730> blower<00:01:31.940> motor<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.420> make<00:01:32.600> sure<00:01:32.750> your

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
to the blower motor to make sure your

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.780 
to the blower motor to make sure your
blower<00:01:33.080> motor<00:01:33.380> is<00:01:33.500> getting<00:01:33.770> power<00:01:34.040> it'll<00:01:34.490> kick

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
blower motor is getting power it'll kick

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.310 
blower motor is getting power it'll kick
it<00:01:34.910> on<00:01:35.030> just<00:01:35.420> make<00:01:35.660> sure<00:01:35.810> your<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.200> know

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
right here which is your blower motor

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.680 
right here which is your blower motor
control<00:01:49.940> module<00:01:50.390> or<00:01:50.740> speed<00:01:51.740> controller<00:01:52.690> hope

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
control module or speed controller hope

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.500 
control module or speed controller hope
this<00:01:53.930> helps<00:01:54.290> anyone<00:01:54.710> with<00:01:54.950> a<00:01:54.979> 2001<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.360> I

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
think 2002 Lincoln maybe some other

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.170 
think 2002 Lincoln maybe some other
models<00:01:59.990> too<00:02:00.200> not<00:02:00.619> really<00:02:00.950> sure<00:02:01.190> didn't<00:02:02.060> go

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
models too not really sure didn't go

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.480 
models too not really sure didn't go
that<00:02:02.390> far<00:02:02.630> with<00:02:02.840> my<00:02:03.020> homework<00:02:03.259> but<00:02:04.190> this

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490
