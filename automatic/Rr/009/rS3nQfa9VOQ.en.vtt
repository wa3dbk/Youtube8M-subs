ripped a little that is probably the
trickiest<00:02:39.720> part<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:42.590> mean<00:02:43.590> they<00:02:43.800> can<00:02:44.069> rip<00:02:44.340> a

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
trickiest part I mean they can rip a

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.140 
trickiest part I mean they can rip a
little<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.950> plant<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.220> mean<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:47.610> probably<00:02:48.030> a

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
little and plant I mean it's probably a

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.040 
little and plant I mean it's probably a
better<00:02:48.360> thing<00:02:48.840> but<00:02:49.319> no<00:02:50.069> don't<00:02:50.610> don't<00:02:51.420> try<00:02:51.989> to

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
better thing but no don't don't try to
