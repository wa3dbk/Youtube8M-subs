biplane camel from world or one can tell
by<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:16.100> markings<00:00:17.100> on<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.369> wings<00:00:17.580> it's

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
by the markings on the wings it's

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.790 
by the markings on the wings it's
British<00:00:19.430> so<00:00:20.430> there<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.170> almost<00:00:22.170> exactly<00:00:22.380> a

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
British so there it is almost exactly a

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.990 
British so there it is almost exactly a
picture<00:00:23.539> so<00:00:24.539> it's<00:00:25.699> 882<00:00:26.699> pieces<00:00:28.580> levels<00:00:29.580> 14

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
picture so it's 882 pieces levels 14

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.350 
picture so it's 882 pieces levels 14
plus<00:00:30.410> this<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.590> vic<00:00:31.830> split<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:33.059> on<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.239> leg

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
plus this is vic split it on the leg

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.360 
plus this is vic split it on the leg
webpage<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> exclusive<00:00:34.590> section

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
webpage it's in the exclusive section

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.370 
webpage it's in the exclusive section
which<00:00:36.270> means<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.809> won't<00:00:37.079> be<00:00:37.260> in

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
which means that it won't be in

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.350 
which means that it won't be in
production<00:00:37.590> for<00:00:37.950> very<00:00:38.280> long<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.520> if<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.180> want

room to sit like its seat covers and
staff<00:01:05.210> yeah<00:01:06.210> ah<00:01:08.540> this<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:09.810> good<00:01:09.960> took<00:01:10.170> me

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
staff yeah ah this really good took me

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.590 
staff yeah ah this really good took me
about<00:01:10.470> three<00:01:10.740> hours<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.159> build<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.939> not<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.510> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
about three hours to build like not in a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.130 
about three hours to build like not in a
row<00:01:12.810> progressively<00:01:13.880> um<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.780> comes<00:01:15.960> with

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
row progressively um so it comes with

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.840 
row progressively um so it comes with
rotating<00:01:17.040> propellers<00:01:18.229> um<00:01:19.490> it<00:01:20.490> looks<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
rotating propellers um it looks like a

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.100 
rotating propellers um it looks like a
real<00:01:21.060> engine<00:01:21.570> actually<00:01:22.729> um<00:01:26.570> gear<00:01:27.570> with

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
real engine actually um gear with

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.719 
real engine actually um gear with
traction<00:01:28.560> um<00:01:29.240> this<00:01:30.240> back<00:01:30.600> wheel<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.350> added<00:01:31.829> it

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
traction um this back wheel I added it

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.260 
traction um this back wheel I added it
actually<00:01:33.540> comes<00:01:33.750> with<00:01:34.070> just<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.250> make<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.759> Lego

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
actually comes with just a make a Lego

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.410 
actually comes with just a make a Lego
piece<00:01:36.799> but<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.860> change<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> actually

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
piece but I change that so it actually

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.450 
piece but I change that so it actually
rolls<00:01:40.549> um<00:01:41.549> yeah<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.659> comes<00:01:42.899> decals<00:01:43.530> stop<00:01:44.159> with

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
rolls um yeah it comes decals stop with

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.350 
rolls um yeah it comes decals stop with
that<00:01:45.860> um<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.130> then<00:01:47.399> same<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> other<00:01:48.210> side

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
that um and then same on the other side

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.609 
that um and then same on the other side
and<00:01:48.869> then<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.340> wings<00:01:54.229> it's<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.350> really<00:01:55.530> good

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
and then on the wings it's a really good

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.160 
and then on the wings it's a really good
set<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:56.880> wouldn't<00:01:57.180> makes<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.509> really<00:01:57.630> awesome

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
set but wouldn't makes it really awesome

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.399 
set but wouldn't makes it really awesome
is<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:59.280> see<00:01:59.430> all<00:01:59.490> these<00:01:59.610> chords<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.180> stuff

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
is you see all these chords and stuff

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.569 
is you see all these chords and stuff
first<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.619> was<00:02:01.740> wondering<00:02:02.189> what<00:02:02.340> they're<00:02:02.490> going

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
first I was wondering what they're going

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.280 
first I was wondering what they're going
to<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.820> when<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.000> put<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.780> then<00:02:04.399> I

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
to do when I put it on and then I

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.960 
to do when I put it on and then I
realize<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.340> an<00:02:08.489> actual<00:02:08.640> moving

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
realize that it's like an actual moving

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.900 
realize that it's like an actual moving
plane<00:02:09.410> so<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.920> joystick<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.550> what<00:02:11.670> controls

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
plane so the joystick is what controls

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.140 
plane so the joystick is what controls
it<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.450> if<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.629> just<00:02:12.780> watch<00:02:13.020> the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
it so if you just watch the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.880 
it so if you just watch the
the<00:02:15.150> flaps<00:02:15.480> here<00:02:16.379> you<00:02:16.439> go<00:02:18.349> so<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.469> joystick

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
the flaps here you go so the joystick

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.209 
the flaps here you go so the joystick
moves<00:02:19.920> them<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.609> then<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.239> go<00:02:21.359> up<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.629> down<00:02:21.780> I

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:22.219 
moves them and then to go up and down I

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:26.420 
moves them and then to go up and down I
also<00:02:23.219> moves<00:02:23.459> that<00:02:23.640> one<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:25.069> cannot<00:02:26.069> win<00:02:26.250> real

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
also moves that one I cannot win real

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.190 
also moves that one I cannot win real
life<00:02:26.670> they'd<00:02:26.939> probably<00:02:27.209> be<00:02:27.450> foot<00:02:27.750> pedal<00:02:28.049> some

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
life they'd probably be foot pedal some

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.140 
life they'd probably be foot pedal some
of<00:02:28.349> these<00:02:28.560> but<00:02:28.920> it's<00:02:29.129> awesome<00:02:29.519> about<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.879> didn't

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
of these but it's awesome about I didn't

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.410 
of these but it's awesome about I didn't
think<00:02:30.269> it<00:02:30.480> was<00:02:30.569> going<00:02:30.719> to<00:02:30.780> be<00:02:30.959> this<00:02:31.409> cool<00:02:32.420> so

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
think it was going to be this cool so

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.050 
think it was going to be this cool so
yeah<00:02:33.870> it's<00:02:34.530> really<00:02:34.829> detailed<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.579> love<00:02:35.849> it

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
yeah it's really detailed I love it

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
Minn and of course this is my website

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.900 
Minn and of course this is my website
and<00:05:21.710> this<00:05:22.710> has<00:05:22.950> been<00:05:22.980> the<00:05:23.430> video<00:05:23.670> for<00:05:23.820> this
