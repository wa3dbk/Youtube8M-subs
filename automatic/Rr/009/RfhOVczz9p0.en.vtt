turn around

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:18.110 
turn around
oh<00:06:14.240> I<00:06:15.240> just<00:06:15.570> keep<00:06:15.870> doing<00:06:16.140> this<00:06:16.520> until<00:06:17.520> you

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
oh I just keep doing this until you

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.840 
oh I just keep doing this until you
reach<00:06:18.270> the<00:06:18.480> end<00:06:18.630> of<00:06:18.780> your<00:06:18.840> head<00:06:22.280> and<00:06:23.280> it's

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
reach the end of your head and it's

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.600 
reach the end of your head and it's
really<00:06:24.060> simple<00:06:24.330> of<00:06:24.660> any<00:06:24.840> of<00:06:25.110> you<00:06:25.440> use<00:06:26.400> this

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
really simple of any of you use this

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.130 
really simple of any of you use this
method<00:06:26.910> like<00:06:27.680> 800<00:06:28.680> times<00:06:28.710> really

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
method like 800 times really

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.750 
method like 800 times really
so<00:06:31.140> then<00:06:31.410> you're<00:06:32.280> going<00:06:32.490> to<00:06:32.580> need<00:06:33.120> to<00:06:33.300> left

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
so then you're going to need to left

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.430 
so then you're going to need to left
stay<00:06:35.760> put

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
stay put

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.510 
stay put
really<00:06:37.470> so<00:06:37.890> you're<00:06:38.790> going<00:06:39.090> to<00:06:39.180> use<00:06:39.300> a<00:06:40.520> rubber

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
really so you're going to use a rubber

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.200 
really so you're going to use a rubber
band

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
band

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.690 
band
and<00:06:43.280> I<00:06:44.280> use<00:06:44.700> the<00:06:45.600> guys<00:06:45.840> that<00:06:46.380> comes<00:06:46.800> with<00:06:47.130> them
