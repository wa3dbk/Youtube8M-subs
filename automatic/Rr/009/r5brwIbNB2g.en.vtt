00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.839
 in the classics and the word dad that I 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.769
 Yesterday I defended death because I already have 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.469
 to be quiet because aldo de nigris 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.810
 says we meet on the court or 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.820
 you do not say 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.530
 this person can repeat it please 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.860
 what did you feel when you listen to the 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.869
 wolves is to say that they transmit us nothing 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.240
 aldo de nigris and jonathan or two with the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.430
 classic print we have to win 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.950
 no no no no i heard it first 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.140
 to say right now I did not hear it no no 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.630
 he is a great player lucas me what I say 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.400
 is that you have to talk on the court there 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.620
 some also went on the court can 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.300
 say anything but 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.940
 he made a great game we win well and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.260
 Well the truth is that you also have a 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.920
 respect team and is doing very 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.920
 good things 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.730
 a lady is not trying to take him 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.610
 merit in this sense not to what I 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.410
 touch 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.390
 it does not matter, no, you do not have to follow 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.950
 working as I said we won a match 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.810
 important but we have not achieved anything 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.270
 and we know what we are 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.220
 doing well what is not there and I think that 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.660
 two league championships and one 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.580
 concachampios be in another end of 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.760
 concachampions be in second place of 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.610
 the table now I do not think it's luck or 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.020
 although the other teams play badly 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.310
 I think they are doing well 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.020
 things and it's thanks to the work that 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.780
 we do it and the best when 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.850
 when you lose the classic it's 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.920
 just do not talk I think so 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.509
 but I tell you inside the court they 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.670
 they also behaved very well to 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.400
 know when the match is over well 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.410
 new teasing there was nothing of what I 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.910
 they say of my celebration was one thing that 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.979
 they're getting bigger because I do not 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.420
 I went to nobody I'm in my house and in 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.399
 my court I can clear like me 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.200
 want and I did not put myself towards a 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.910
 coach a player in anything to the 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.890
 opposite with all well and you can 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.780
 say and the people that know me that is 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.119
 important to know that I am not like that, I 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.310
 I think he showed up inside the 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.810
 court that teams was fine and already 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.670
 then what can be said good are 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.409
 things 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.830
 for comments like that they are talking 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.830
 of the world 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.890
 how do I defend that 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.340
 he did it at home he did it on his court 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.620
 what into it did to this before the public 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.590
 of the tigers is the problem that was and 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.180
 he sought the public of the tigers he did 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.750
 before the public of tigers and 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.160
 tigers unfortunately we did not have 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.290
 representativeness within the court 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.720
 I want representativeness within the 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.640
 court does not represent activity before 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.860
 television cameras I do not want 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.890
 distract me right now with that if the arrangement 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:41.050
 of the kikin fonseca already arrived does not look at the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:45.070
 number this 8 consecutive classics that 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:48.220
 tigers does not win of which are 3 goals 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.970
 in favor in 8 games that's the numbers 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.160
 there it is and as they tell me 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.530
 take out the numbers at your convenience as 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.140
 you will see that the numbers are not right 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.269
 clear because I kept thinking and how many 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.030
 classics go that we do not give a goal 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.330
 four and a half or we put a goal 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.739
 on average four and a half matches that 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.190
 Do not give him a goal or in the team 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.150
 riding that is serious that's serious if you do not 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.579
 we had in front 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.480
 it's fine but we have all four 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.480
 fantastic 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.260
 or not 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:29.680
 We won Chivas name yesterday Chivas 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:33.219
 He was killed by a 38-year - old man 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:37.060
 these chivas crossed the court of 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:39.519
 side by side at 38 years until the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.099
 Chivas does not bring anything clear that he will win 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.290
 tigers and it's not going to start saying that 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.650
 there are mouths no no no 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.870
 this number stays here to shake and 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.450
 If the month of May is not long in coming 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.650
 we have to see the faces again 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.689
 with the monterrey team 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.359
 I'm going to get these high numbers out 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:01.120
 beginning of the game to say no no 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:05.169
 They are willing to discourage you, they are willing to 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:09.690
 boost you I do not want to see another 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:13.980
 0 on the tigers marker 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.970
 finalized mother mind if you lose tigers 5 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.670
 a 2 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:22.560
 well we promised 2 they do not jump bad 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:24.750
 thing of 0 and 0 and 0 and diverting the 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.520
 attention and no one appears to face 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.590
 more than the captain lucas wolves that in 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.500
 that cinema aspect if it grants you a 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.990
 applause because he has been the only tiger of 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.340
 the entire organization that has come out to 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:42.140
 talk after the classic give me a 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.140
 commercial break and we return 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.979
 what would we do without you without those goals 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.310
 without those shortcuts without the big 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.310
 overflow
