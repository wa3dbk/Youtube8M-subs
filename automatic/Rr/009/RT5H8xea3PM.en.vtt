00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.920
 friends of youtube I am beasley and present 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.860
 and are welcome to comment on this 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.750
 reyno 4 is from team sniper yes of all 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.420
 this related to the playlists 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.110
 and also with the game itself basically 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.570
 today that is February 12 this video more 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.480
 ok the reset was up but the 12 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.250
 I was playing for the first time you have 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.890
 person again that production again 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.440
 the list and back to the list and everything very 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.180
 plan and I do not know how much request as well as 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.530
 that does not do I do not know the for example the 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.780
 first game that is this that they are 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.970
 watching in fact I liked it I liked it 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.950
 quite in no game mode was 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.230
 playing with soto and everything we were not 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.390
 done so talking surprising team 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.580
 work and nothing of that but simply 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.200
 playing like this I can like it I liked it in 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.640
 yes like that or I was half champion 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:04.270
 I was also half camper but 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.270
 nothing of the normal reminded me 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.850
 but what happened after I got in and I wanted to 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.280
 actually record the live game 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:20.030
 and I do not know I do not know I did not like it very much 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.070
 on behalf of those in the community that 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.259
 many orders many what is called 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.240
 many were with the shotgun nothing more 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.610
 sensors or pursue team strippers 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.070
 then of campers crouching in some 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.810
 corner caching everyone and so 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.750
 that is, the essence is not missing 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.850
 of you is not nor persist this list of 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.800
 game according to this olive does not improve and I do not know 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.860
 how much they improved it if it's okay 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.910
 made by 343 but this is something 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.429
 of what good yes and speak because I mean 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:53.000
 is that I do not know if yes in itself what comes in 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:55.910
 the cinema as it ruins the the 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.250
 community including everyone or yes itself 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.200
 the game is not our tampa or not or 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.539
 is what I do not know why for example 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.980
 in halo 3 that we got to find then 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.570
 some typical 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.540
 who came to do this kind of 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.550
 recruits and all that like how to be 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.080
 frisking being crouched when it's 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.800
 competitive but as it is more 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.240
 regulated I do not know I feel here the only 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.060
 game that I like was this one that 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.480
 I'm uploading the others to about four 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.450
 tandas with series on the map alone or 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.430
 something like this is called this all all all 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.560
 all of the opposite team and they go with 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.910
 the shotgun as a main weapon 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.190
 they did not even deign to take out the 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.920
 Schneiter stayed in the corners 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.920
 font they were waiting for you they killed you stepped on and 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.170
 obviously I won not because you wanting 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.790
 do day but good in that attitude of 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.800
 truth is more much more difficult since 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.420
 if you bring the shotgun for all 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.280
 little way is when you find one of 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.950
 front nothing more than 60 are shotgun and 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.540
 ready then I do not know in this game of 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.460
 the first one reminded me a lot about the halo 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.960
 reach in halo reach i liked he has 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.910
 sun express not so much new minister 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.680
 favorite favorite minister age made 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.760
 team objective but more because they are going 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.459
 more credits than because he studies own 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.650
 but then here as it is weird is 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.370
 rolling you is that today you played more 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.500
 in the new list put in the 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.519
 comments they think about everything 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.890
 this because I do not know it's strange to me that if 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.360
 the list is not badly done nothing the 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.000
 maps that you are also because you do not 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.489
 there is radar and all that but, if everything 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.959
 the world is using shotgun and everything 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.940
 that kind of thing as well as it's going to 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.099
 do something boring and not many will 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.170
 play and I think that also came out team 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.849
 objective in this new update 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.129
 that I have not played it, I'm going to try 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.620
 play if you highlighted a live video or something 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.940
 as it processes there is no longer so much camper 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.879
 because it's the same thing that you have to 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.849
 do goals and all that but here without 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:51.549
 sheen disgusted me a little bit about that 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.829
 especially the campers and the landlords and 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.049
 the shotguns say who am I to 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.700
 tell them how to play no no no no 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:03.230
 deal with this but normally for 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.790
 a fun game halo reach then 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.940
 Normally and you met with guys 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.459
 that we say they were like that playing 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.170
 must be a person with the sniper and 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.930
 all trying one or the other I do not look for 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.459
 even for non-assembly eclipses of 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.829
 'top ten' if all that many 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.079
 west and you savers me but here like that 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.729
 I am they are I do not know I do not know if it is the 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.010
 community if it's cool reference and be 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.110
 everything a combination of all things 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.820
 they give happens it froze 4 because then there 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.130
 many many many dislikes 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.900
 it is even seen in the hearing of 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.630
 youtube before when you went up a 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.990
 video for example halloween so I do not know 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.060
 of a clichÃ© in the multiplayer or of the 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.590
 campaign or something there were many people that what 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.780
 I saw you and all of the first 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.400
 his video that video had a lot but 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.290
 Many people are already doing well or badly or 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.270
 is allying in the video not but the 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.700
 people over and I was watching the 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.830
 video liked him and all that and here in 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.569
 halo 4 like at the beginning yes 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.479
 obviously not because it's expected 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:03.029
 at the beginning maybe gives this but I have not 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.550
 seen as well as a great improvement not 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:07.800
 there are so many community there are 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.219
 returning to helder which also to halo 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.689
 3 obviously because I do not know I do not know about 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:15.509
 game is a bit different from the others 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:17.339
 but we must also get used to it 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.409
 with this kind of lists it gets boring 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:21.029
 is not to say if you get yourself if you do not bring 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:24.209
 team and you just want to play a 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:25.649
 and then they pass the program you get and 

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:27.899
 at the moment you find in you is nobody 

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:30.629
 but it 's the guys with shotguns 

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:32.669
 crouched down and so then like that 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:35.520
 it becomes something monotonous a little bit 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.839
 bored maybe the multiplayer thing that 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.389
 it did not happen in other genres that were 

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:41.249
 characteristic for spending hours and 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.830
 hours and hours in the in the halo without 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:45.749
 no problem of being bored or the 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.249
 only game that could be you're never going to 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:49.800
 bore and here the kilo then what I 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:51.959
 I see that many times the community plays 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.069
 one hour an hour and a half a lot 2 and 

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:54.749
 ready 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:57.029
 the game bores them something is done 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:59.779
 monotonous the ranges mostly complain 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:59.779
 many that according to 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:06.669
 150 but I'm not sure how everything is 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:08.949
 this I like your opinion of many 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:12.159
 Stealth but useful things has appeared 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:14.319
 in general if it is good or bad if it is bad 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:17.440
 for example that I have done it wrong or if it is 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.120
 four of solar the community itself what 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.340
 more sure good friends my opinion is 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.039
 a combination not because for example in 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.830
 Spartans then has many errors and 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:28.419
 that then from the back with three 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.550
 mistakes like you get stuck on 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:32.169
 monkey and also things that are the 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.030
 same maps nothing but the covenants are 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:36.180
 In contrast to a mission in the newspaper 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:40.330
 Then they do it and they do not do it very 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:43.090
 very dry with one let's say it does not have like 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.520
 how much game dynamics is then 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.319
 just as I felt is that new list 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.300
 I'm going to play without an objective to see if 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:51.759
 I bring the game live so you can see 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.440
 that I think I will like more 29 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:56.870
 character I liked the first game and 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:03.080
 later I did not dislike 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:05.540
 it bothered me that yes, too 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.250
 hahaha then leave all your down here 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:12.460
 comments that this one and comments 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:14.680
 subscribe little fingers up thank you 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.780

 simple I bring you in your know but more 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.160
 well of my trunk the account that of being 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.039
 he who faces the water more clearly 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.229
 radio and 360 has the forgiven for 

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:27.940
 leave us a lie if they want to eat and 

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:30.130
 see the packages that is not so much your 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.199
 height is killing every garbage 

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.800
 novices who presume I do not have it without 

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:34.780
 Cook 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.150
 prieto and will support and youtube 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.979
 prescribe many false liars want 

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.750
 and I aim to win that is the good 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:43.180
 to see that they fit many have 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.039
 sold like you and he does not discount from 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.080
 a good time began to grab the 

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:49.300
 flights but do not misunderstand me and always 

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.440
 with your feet on the ground help that 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.440
 does not deserve effort
