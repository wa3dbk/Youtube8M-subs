00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
my kitchen countertops in the past

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.429 
my kitchen countertops in the past
they've<00:00:21.420> been<00:00:21.600> painted<00:00:21.930> I've<00:00:22.050> changed<00:00:22.350> them

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
they've been painted I've changed them

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.929 
they've been painted I've changed them
this<00:00:22.560> will<00:00:22.650> be<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.890> third<00:00:23.250> time<00:00:23.460> I've<00:00:23.640> changed

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
them and each time it gives the whole

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.650 
them and each time it gives the whole
kitchen<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.849> whole<00:00:26.880> new<00:00:27.029> look<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.510> it's

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
kitchen a whole new look and it's

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.259 
kitchen a whole new look and it's
relatively<00:00:28.170> inexpensive<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:30.029> far

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
relatively inexpensive and and so far

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.820 
relatively inexpensive and and so far
they've<00:00:30.480> held<00:00:30.660> up<00:00:30.720> really<00:00:30.900> really<00:00:31.109> good<00:00:31.349> but

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
they've held up really really good but

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.860 
they've held up really really good but
I'm<00:00:31.920> gonna<00:00:32.009> try<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.520> time<00:00:32.759> as<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.360> was<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
I'm gonna try this time as I was in the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.389 
I'm gonna try this time as I was in the
store<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.290> found<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.890> stuff<00:00:35.190> it's

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
store and I found this this stuff it's

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.580 
store and I found this this stuff it's
meant<00:00:35.579> for<00:00:35.640> concrete<00:00:36.239> floors<00:00:36.630> actually<00:00:37.079> and

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
meant for concrete floors actually and

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.959 
meant for concrete floors actually and
it's<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.430> flake<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:40.370> you<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.670> don't

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
it's like this flake that you I don't

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.360 
it's like this flake that you I don't
know<00:00:42.030> if<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.329> see<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.230> there<00:00:43.410> or<00:00:43.559> not<00:00:43.739> but

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
know if you can see in there or not but

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.330 
know if you can see in there or not but
it's<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.969> flaky<00:00:45.480> stuff<00:00:46.200> kind<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.860> I

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
it's it's this flaky stuff kind of I

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.799 
it's it's this flaky stuff kind of I
don't<00:00:47.879> even<00:00:47.940> know<00:00:48.120> what<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.420> made<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.629> it

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
don't even know what it's made of it

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.260 
don't even know what it's made of it
looks<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.200> might<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.500> paint<00:00:49.800> chips<00:00:50.270> but

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
looks like it might be paint chips but

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.130 
looks like it might be paint chips but
um<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.500> idea<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.550> put<00:00:53.760> down<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
um the idea is is you put down on the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.080 
um the idea is is you put down on the
concrete<00:00:55.440> floor<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.890> white<00:00:56.039> epoxy<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.969> then

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
concrete floor the white epoxy and then

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.060 
concrete floor the white epoxy and then
you<00:00:57.180> sprinkle<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.629> stuff<00:00:57.899> around<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.890> then

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
you sprinkle this stuff around and then

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.500 
you sprinkle this stuff around and then
you<00:00:59.190> seal<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.789> I'm<00:00:59.910> gonna<00:01:00.059> try<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.300> same

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
you seal it so I'm gonna try the same

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
you seal it so I'm gonna try the same
thing<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:00.750> my<00:01:00.840> countertops<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.500> I

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
thing with my countertops because I

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.479 
thing with my countertops because I
think<00:01:01.649> it's<00:01:01.770> going<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.920> end<00:01:02.039> up<00:01:02.100> with<00:01:02.190> kind<00:01:02.399> of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
think it's going to end up with kind of

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.000 
think it's going to end up with kind of
a<00:01:02.579> granite<00:01:02.969> II<00:01:03.030> look<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:04.229> what<00:01:04.320> I'm<00:01:04.439> gonna<00:01:04.769> see

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
a granite II look but what I'm gonna see

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.740 
a granite II look but what I'm gonna see
if<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.189> works<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.460> latex<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> total

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
if it works with latex this is a total

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.000 
if it works with latex this is a total
experiment<00:01:07.290> I'm<00:01:07.409> not<00:01:07.530> sure<00:01:07.710> if<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:07.890> gonna

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
experiment I'm not sure if it's gonna

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.960 
experiment I'm not sure if it's gonna
work<00:01:08.100> or<00:01:08.549> not

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
work or not

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.270 
work or not
if<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.659> doesn't<00:01:10.020> I'm<00:01:10.080> gonna<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> mastic

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
if it doesn't I'm gonna have a mastic

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.140 
if it doesn't I'm gonna have a mastic
alene<00:01:11.430> oh<00:01:11.689> okay<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:12.780> I'm<00:01:12.930> gonna<00:01:13.580> now<00:01:14.580> get

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.710 

I<00:03:10.560> think<00:03:11.280> it's<00:03:11.430> kind<00:03:11.640> of<00:03:11.730> in<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:11.940> disarray<00:03:12.270> here

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
I think it's kind of in a disarray here

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.570 
I think it's kind of in a disarray here
because<00:03:13.050> uh<00:03:13.080> this<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.130> middle<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.460> our

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
because uh this is the middle of our

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:24.230 
because uh this is the middle of our
kitchen<00:03:14.970> so<00:03:15.120> it's<00:03:15.270> kind<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:17.240> real<00:03:18.240> quickly<00:03:23.240> I'm

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240
