00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:07.529
 just to give a pitaco in the access to 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.400
 independent of the angle of observation nÃ© 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.280
 if you observe and what day the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.170
 schools that more often than 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.180
 were in the main group 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.960
 the first day is stronger but if 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.960
 analyze the moment 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.910
 Saturday is stronger then the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.320
 criterion that will judge this if I 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.530
 I had to buy the ticket and I 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.329
 would choose to collect as the negotiators 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.770
 if I could if I had to choose 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.989
 a Saturday premiere more expensive than I 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.059
 I picked up my dear ipea too but this 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.690
 there already is passion has nothing to do with a 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:54.030
 critical analysis with special relation I 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.250
 I think the party that involves the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.969
 military horse 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.550
 carnival 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.420
 for this, and people have so much to do with 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.390
 Carnival is correct to make this clip 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.869
 Saturday doing this has no error 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.760
 I wanted here to call you all and it 's 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:18.420
 transferred to the order of the day, 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.630
 the day because everyone wants on Monday 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.330
 because in the second 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.820
 winner is easy to ask why it is 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.979
 difficult to answer for me I have to 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.820
 My theory, I learned there at home. 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.390
 little voice and the last impression is what 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.480
 stay 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.060
 my son today 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.980
 he said that he has given until today because 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.190
 statistics never lie ever 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.710
 statistic on the way and it is not 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.450
 now that it goes active and the tactics of who 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.060
 wins with the intervention of fenam 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.030
 then in this sense the only one 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.660
 plausible explanation that the meeting is 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.620
 this one here 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:00.320
 the jury stays in the head with Augustine 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:04.730
 50 there enters into another discussion if the 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:08.540
 The jury should close the trial. 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:11.870
 just Sunday and start the second is a 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:14.690
 discussion that does not have a time but 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.290
 in this discussion to keep the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.780
 word gives the final impression that it 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.800
 we can also transfer this in the 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.410
 Monday 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.220
 and then falls into the great controversy of the night that 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.370
 the question of the portela after summarizing the 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.220
 portela was drawn to be used 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.490
 to close the carnival, which is all that 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.800
 the kissing flower that is 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.920
 who wishes the dream of the hummingbird 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.980
 closing the carnival the portela was 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.530
 raffled and could close the carnival and 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.250
 To give up, he gave it up to parade in 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.680
 fifth place to this is the great controversy 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.030
 The night is going on here, come on. 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.610
 We are going to analyze this hurts the law. 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.450
 I want mine and I would like to have 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.300
 closed 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.600
 but I recognize that my condition 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.940
 she is in love 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.040
 I can inform everyone and 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.200
 especially the conferences in my 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.390
 decision that the copel's board played 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.440
 here is no right but decision 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.550
 taken here 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.790
 this was a historic decision and right 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.160
 I think that common sense prevailed 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:31.330
 because it 's very difficult for you in July 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.620
 imagine the size of this 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.010
 difficulty is because it is 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.590
 facing today with so many debts 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.430
 is being equated this day by day 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.610
 but you have a correct radiograph 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:49.060
 exact and July what will be the carnival is 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.180
 a task for the prudent magician and has 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.489
 also the issue of concentration is 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.849
 this all reflects the question of the structure 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.250
 that the portela will have to show the 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.769
 everybody, everybody, nobody has any doubts. 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.730
 now the question is the current champion structure 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.530
 Carnival 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.019
 I believe that the board also 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.659
 I believe but we concede a goal because it's 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:14.250
 Everybody believes they are fighting the good now. 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:17.169
 sense prevailed and I will say why 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.340
 we hear the line the village president 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:24.460
 isabel yes and he said that the position 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.190
 His favorite would be Thursday and Monday 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.870
 which was the position that the portela parades 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:34.750
 it's a very good thing, very good and I want 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.210
 tell the speakers that they will not be lacking 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.270
 Face does for anybody and if to the parade 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.139
 and then with all structure with the whole 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.690
 your strength 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.580
 do not worry about it what this 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.360
 Mardi Gras we put our mouths on the 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.180
 rail 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.979
 this is the role of instructing clark because 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.250
 She goes to win the carnival but the 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:57.070
 main policy of the portela is to place 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.310
 by the trio is this make soft body is the 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.720
 big carrijo remembering that 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.580
 not with me, okay? 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.849
 the problem of structure that will be a 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.619
 carnival is kind 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:10.219
 and here next to a school that 

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:10.969
 markedly has an impact on the 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:13.490
 carnival 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:16.520
 then if the tijuca closes with great 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:20.300
 Knife she takes a lot of advantage over the ju 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.669
 is the only restriction that defines the 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.979
 my body was either shutting down 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.439
 I recognize that it is a sensible thing 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:30.469
 balanced team 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:32.449
 one thing is taken in advance 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:36.939
 It was not taken away. 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.939
 but my fear is to let the social
