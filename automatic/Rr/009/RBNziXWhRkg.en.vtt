since<00:00:04.310> I<00:00:04.400> was<00:00:04.520> a<00:00:04.550> little<00:00:04.609> kid<00:00:04.940> my<00:00:05.000> dad<00:00:05.240> has

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:05.630 
since I was a little kid my dad has

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.080 
since I was a little kid my dad has
always<00:00:05.810> told<00:00:05.930> me<00:00:06.380> that<00:00:06.560> back<00:00:07.130> in<00:00:07.339> the<00:00:07.460> sixties

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
always told me that back in the sixties

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.970 
always told me that back in the sixties
rodent<00:00:08.510> trap<00:00:08.719> did<00:00:09.049> an<00:00:09.290> article<00:00:09.500> where<00:00:09.860> they

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
rodent trap did an article where they

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.640 
rodent trap did an article where they
said<00:00:10.190> that<00:00:10.280> the<00:00:10.400> notchback<00:00:10.959> was<00:00:11.959> the<00:00:12.110> fastest

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
said that the notchback was the fastest

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.769 
said that the notchback was the fastest
overall<00:00:13.010> top<00:00:13.369> speed<00:00:13.639> of<00:00:13.760> a<00:00:13.820> 356<00:00:14.270> because<00:00:14.660> the

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:14.779 
overall top speed of a 356 because the

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.930 
overall top speed of a 356 because the
way<00:00:14.869> the<00:00:15.020> air<00:00:15.199> exits<00:00:15.650> off<00:00:15.799> the<00:00:15.980> rear<00:00:16.160> so<00:00:16.760> hey<00:00:16.910> I

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
way the air exits off the rear so hey I

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.370 
way the air exits off the rear so hey I
thought<00:00:17.300> I'd<00:00:17.480> put<00:00:17.630> that<00:00:17.810> theory<00:00:18.080> to<00:00:18.199> the<00:00:18.320> test

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
thought I'd put that theory to the test

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.650 
thought I'd put that theory to the test
I<00:00:18.890> built<00:00:19.580> a<00:00:19.810> vintage<00:00:20.810> race<00:00:21.080> car<00:00:21.350> based<00:00:21.770> on<00:00:22.010> a<00:00:22.040> 61

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.750 
I built a vintage race car based on a 61
t5<00:00:23.660> notchback<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:24.470> what<00:00:25.040> I<00:00:25.070> found<00:00:25.400> out<00:00:25.700> was

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
t5 notchback and what I found out was

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.910 
t5 notchback and what I found out was
that<00:00:26.030> it<00:00:26.180> was<00:00:26.270> exactly<00:00:26.720> correct<00:00:26.810> this<00:00:27.680> car

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
that it was exactly correct this car

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.470 
that it was exactly correct this car
ended<00:00:28.100> up<00:00:28.250> being<00:00:28.580> one<00:00:28.730> of<00:00:28.760> the<00:00:28.880> quickest<00:00:29.330> on

part<00:00:32.270> of<00:00:32.329> it<00:00:32.449> was<00:00:32.480> because<00:00:32.599> of<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:32.960> body<00:00:33.140> but

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
part of it was because of the body but

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.260 
part of it was because of the body but
most<00:00:33.980> of<00:00:34.129> all<00:00:34.250> because<00:00:34.520> of<00:00:34.699> the<00:00:34.789> way<00:00:34.910> I<00:00:34.940> built

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
most of all because of the way I built
