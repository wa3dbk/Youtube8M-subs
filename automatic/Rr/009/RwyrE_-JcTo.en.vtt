down the road and then come back up here
and<00:00:38.489> there's<00:00:38.670> kind<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.940> an<00:00:39.000> invisible<00:00:39.270> barrier

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
and there's kind of an invisible barrier

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.220 
and there's kind of an invisible barrier
it<00:00:40.440> seems<00:00:41.540> you're<00:00:42.540> gonna<00:00:42.660> want<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> clip<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
it seems you're gonna want to clip the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.630 
it seems you're gonna want to clip the
chains<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.829> Hades<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.809> then<00:00:45.809> just<00:00:46.640> repeatedly

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
chains of Hades and then just repeatedly

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.459 
chains of Hades and then just repeatedly
do<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.000> soul<00:00:48.270> rip<00:00:48.510> because<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.989> barely<00:00:49.200> does

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
do the soul rip because it barely does

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.250 
do the soul rip because it barely does
any<00:00:49.710> damage<00:00:49.800> whatsoever<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:51.000> they<00:00:51.870> don't

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
any damage whatsoever and they don't

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.959 
any damage whatsoever and they don't
really<00:00:52.379> seem<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.739> cross<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.190> barrier<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.879> all

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
really seem to cross that barrier at all

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.389 
really seem to cross that barrier at all
