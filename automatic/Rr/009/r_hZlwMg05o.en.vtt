00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
on so so far I've got a few things

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.020 
on so so far I've got a few things
that<00:02:17.049> game<00:02:17.290> should<00:02:17.319> be<00:02:17.620> played<00:02:17.739> with<00:02:18.189> one<00:02:18.849> is

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
that game should be played with one is

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.229 
that game should be played with one is
it<00:02:19.480> should<00:02:19.780> start<00:02:20.590> off<00:02:20.739> at<00:02:20.980> night<00:02:21.189> once<00:02:22.060> you're

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
it should start off at night once you're

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.300 
it should start off at night once you're
down<00:02:22.360> here<00:02:22.599> doesn't<00:02:23.019> matter<00:02:23.170> what<00:02:23.829> time<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.040> is

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
down here doesn't matter what time it is

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.280 
down here doesn't matter what time it is
kind<00:02:24.579> of<00:02:24.640> thing<00:02:24.939> but<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:27.400> should<00:02:27.640> also<00:02:27.730> be<00:02:28.290> no

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
kind of thing but it should also be no

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.470 
kind of thing but it should also be no
mobs<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:30.069> then<00:02:32.489> I'm<00:02:33.489> thinking<00:02:33.760> that's<00:02:34.090> all

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
mobs and then I'm thinking that's all
