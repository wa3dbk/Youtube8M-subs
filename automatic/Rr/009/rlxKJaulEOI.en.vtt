2012 apex buy coachman this is a 16 RBX

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.560 
2012 apex buy coachman this is a 16 RBX
the<00:00:12.360> 16<00:00:12.840> RBX<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.830> hybrid<00:00:14.549> as<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.150> can<00:00:15.330> see

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
the 16 RBX is a hybrid as you can see

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.480 
the 16 RBX is a hybrid as you can see
here<00:00:15.929> but<00:00:16.410> it's<00:00:16.560> very<00:00:16.770> unique<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
here but it's very unique in the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.279 
here but it's very unique in the
marketplace<00:00:18.470> the<00:00:19.470> unit<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.779> double<00:00:21.779> axle

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
marketplace the unit is a double axle

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.000 
marketplace the unit is a double axle
weighing<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.949> just<00:00:23.340> over<00:00:23.720> 3400<00:00:24.720> pounds

weighing in just over 3400 pounds

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.830 
weighing in just over 3400 pounds
meaning<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.460> flexibility<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.240> tow<00:00:27.539> this

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
meaning that the flexibility to tow this

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.099 
meaning that the flexibility to tow this
is<00:00:28.080> very<00:00:28.590> wide<00:00:29.070> with<00:00:29.460> tow<00:00:29.699> vehicles<00:00:30.240> let's

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
is very wide with tow vehicles let's

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.130 
is very wide with tow vehicles let's
take<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> closer<00:00:31.679> look<00:00:31.890> at<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.790> apex<00:00:33.270> we<00:00:33.930> do

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
take a closer look at the apex we do

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.160 
take a closer look at the apex we do
have<00:00:34.350> some<00:00:34.620> exterior<00:00:35.040> storage<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:36.210> does<00:00:36.840> come

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
have some exterior storage it does come

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.340 
have some exterior storage it does come
with<00:00:37.879> spare<00:00:38.879> tire<00:00:39.239> which<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.600> tucked<00:00:40.050> up

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350

with spare tire which is tucked up
underneath<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.280> tongue<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.820> keep<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.180> out<00:00:42.390> of

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
underneath the tongue to keep it out of

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.110 
underneath the tongue to keep it out of
the<00:00:42.690> way<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.230> give<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.129> better<00:00:44.460> clearance

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
and in a second you'll see why it will

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.990 
and in a second you'll see why it will
be<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.480> big<00:00:48.719> feature<00:00:48.989> two<00:00:49.770> propane<00:00:50.039> tanks<00:00:50.789> up

what coachman is done with the apex line
in<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> 16<00:01:31.890> RDX<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.329> we<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> very

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
in the 16 RDX is that we have a very

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.289 
in the 16 RDX is that we have a very
tall<00:01:35.100> height<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:37.140> hybrid<00:01:37.619> end<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.790> this

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
tall height in the hybrid end so this

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.660 
tall height in the hybrid end so this
can<00:01:39.630> be<00:01:39.659> used<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.290> sleeping<00:01:40.439> by<00:01:40.920> inserting

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
can be used for sleeping by inserting

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.350 
can be used for sleeping by inserting

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.130 
the air high to bed the air mattress I
should<00:01:45.540> say<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.619> what's<00:01:46.950> also<00:01:47.159> nice<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:48.140> I'm

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
should say but what's also nice is I'm

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.010 
should say but what's also nice is I'm
five<00:01:49.710> nine<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.790> basically<00:01:50.970> stand<00:01:51.750> in

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
five nine and I can basically stand in

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.639 
five nine and I can basically stand in
the<00:01:52.140> front<00:01:52.380> part<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:54.060> slide<00:01:54.329> out<00:01:54.780> so

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
the front part of this slide out so

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.830 
the front part of this slide out so
they've<00:01:55.920> designed<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.000> idea<00:01:57.210> that

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
they've designed it with the idea that

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.560 
they've designed it with the idea that
you<00:01:57.990> could<00:01:58.170> put<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.680> table<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.670> chairs<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.119> here

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
you could put a table and chairs in here

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.109 
you could put a table and chairs in here
use<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.380> as<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> dining<00:02:01.890> area<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.850> play<00:02:03.090> cards<00:02:03.869> or

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
use it as a dining area to play cards or

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.479 
use it as a dining area to play cards or
use<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.299> for<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.750> kids<00:02:07.020> as<00:02:07.320> an<00:02:07.740> overall<00:02:08.039> room

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
use it for the kids as an overall room

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.630 
use it for the kids as an overall room
so<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.179> really<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.899> very<00:02:10.259> flexible<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:11.370> its

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
so it really is very flexible in its

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.740 
so it really is very flexible in its
overall

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
overall

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.780
