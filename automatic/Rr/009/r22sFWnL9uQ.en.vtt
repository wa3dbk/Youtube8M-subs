00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.429
 I 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.059
 it rains you have your hair made a mess 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.250
 quiet today I'm going to show you a 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.869
 hairstyle to rescue your hair a day 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.529
 of rain 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.529
 I'm going to look for inspiration 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:29.000
 and now what happens 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.370
 you know what 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.050
 and this crime 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.760
 let's start by giving a little bit of 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.490
 volume top so 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.180
 we take some strands and load them 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.180
 with the comb 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:55.050
 right at the root and we throw it towards 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.050
 forward we apply a little bit of lacquer 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.450
 and we place it that hands 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.780
 now we take two tortillas 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.060
 and we are going to place one to one side and the 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.060
 another towards the other 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.010
 and we just gave the volume 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.760
 and let's make a braid we take three 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.970
 partitions and let's make a holding 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.810
 cross-rooted in normal let's do 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.299
 the first crossing 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.299
 without adding hair we crossed 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.090
 and we cross and now when we cross the 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.560
 tufts of the ends we add 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.930
 hair 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.490
 we cross 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.490
 and we add hair 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.250
 we cross 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.970
 and we add hair and we do the same in 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.970
 each crossing 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.840
 when we get to this to this point 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.300
 let's change the position of the hands 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.140
 we put it aside and we continue 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.140
 centering huge 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.600
 we take a small rubber 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.480
 and hold the braid if you want the 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.480
 we can pinch 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.560
 we apply a little lacquer 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.550
 we undo it we leave it so very 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.450
 undone 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.450
 and ready 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.750
 we keep the hair and apply a little 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.240
 lacquer 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.950
 we make the toupee and place an orchid 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.080
 to one side and the other to the other 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.209
 we make of it's partitions to make a 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.200
 root braid and hold the braid with 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.200
 a small rubber 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.190
 of spain masters and we apply a little bit of 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.190
 lacquer 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.959
 You have seen how easy it is to look good one 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.940
 rainy day because this trick and many 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.370
 you will find them more in the channel and 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.680
 remember before combing you look at yourself in the 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.209
 mirror and give you on because I'm worth it 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.209
 you'll see how good it feels 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.690
 Y
