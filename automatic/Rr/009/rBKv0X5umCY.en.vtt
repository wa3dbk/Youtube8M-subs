00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.140
 today we will learn to render 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.849
 three-dimensional or a notebook for 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.969
 encourage space management 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:18.480
 chart for children who have problems 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:22.320
 of alignment of the letters inside the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.050
 squares or polishing as we see 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:33.170
 this child does not write so badly 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:38.700
 but often he leans over with the buttonholes 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:41.480
 or below with the lower parts of the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.480
 of some letters 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.120
 ok or goes beyond the margin 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.020
 these are all problems of 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.360
 alignment that could be given 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.050
 also from a visual defect such as 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:07.350
 hyperopia and astigmatism that don't 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:11.549
 favors the defined vision of the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.220
 rifling and the character we are 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.610
 by writing or by a handle 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.540
 incorrect that goes to cover what the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.540
 subject is writing 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:29.100
 but how can we render three-dimensional 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:32.640
 a notebook through gods 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.600
 highlighters first of all need to 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.990
 buy a high quality notebook 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.450
 with a fairly thick card the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:48.899
 there are three notebooks on the market 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:52.740
 weight 60 80 100 grams this is a 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:57.469
 100 gram notebook then the sheet 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.369
 and very often will not let it pass either 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:04.680
 the initiator liquid is 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.409
 the ink of the pen that 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.850
 we will use it especially if on a pen 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:15.140
 and liquid ink 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:23.000
 well we have highlighted the upper part 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:28.520
 the sky to write and to manage the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:35.920
 buttonholes or auctions of some letters like 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:40.580
 labs to be used in this area 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:44.380
 top we used the color 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.700
 yellow the color of the sun to 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.970
 highlight the middle part that is 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.100
 the one you use most in all 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:58.100
 letters of writing 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:03:01.340
 we highlighted the lower part a 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.870
 low part with red color 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:10.190
 looks like earth color 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:18.610
 here we will write the lower part of 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:18.610
 some letters like q the app well 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.329
 this is a little help that can be 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.260
 given at the beginning by agreeing 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.720
 at the beginning of writing 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.100
 learning to write 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.100
 agreeing with the teachers 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.900
 thus helping the child manage it 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.519
 space was tricot another help that 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.670
 we can give through 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.359
 highlighters and indicate the point of 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.859
 departure 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:51.079
 here we did it in yellow is the point 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:55.519
 of arrival and we did it in red 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:59.600
 as if it were a red light to tell a 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:07.750
 subject where it should start and where it should 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:13.549
 finish we have also indicated a point 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:16.609
 long before the end of the margin a 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.510
 tour of the space dedicated to 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.859
 writing 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.650
 obvious to indicate to the child 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.909
 that is finishing the space dedicated to 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.479
 writing 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:34.990
 here for example in this case we have it 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:39.699
 put it after the child wrote if 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:44.439
 had written he had written with this 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:49.509
 help maybe he wouldn't have written topo but 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:51.969
 would have stopped at that because the 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:54.729
 point and would indicate that it is ending 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:57.930
 the writing space so you have to 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:03.819
 terminate by word you are writing 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:06.699
 even here he would have understood that cheese 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:10.750
 he wasn't there and therefore he would be there 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:15.210
 stopped at the writing of di and cheese 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:18.969
 he would have written it well 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.969
 let us remember however that problems of 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:25.569
 workouts are often due also has 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:29.469
 therefore incorrect visual defects 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:32.650
 in addition to these simple suggestions for 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:36.099
 making it three-dimensional is more manageable 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.379
 the graphic space of a sheet you know 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:44.800
 what you have to do is check yours 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:46.779
 the boy or girl from a 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:52.439
 vision professional for 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:56.849
 highlight if type visual disturbances 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:06:00.599
 hypermetropia myopia and astigmatism 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:04.229
 they can have a negative impact 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:07.319
 on learning to write 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:07.319
 good job
