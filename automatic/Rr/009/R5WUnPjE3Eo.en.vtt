00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
not because of my smooth slick hair or

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.980 
not because of my smooth slick hair or
my<00:01:14.430> bowtie<00:01:14.880> but<00:01:15.210> because<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.509> these<00:01:15.689> wings

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
my bowtie but because of these wings

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.120 
my bowtie but because of these wings
possibly<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.610> menu<00:01:18.030> they<00:01:18.860> raided<00:01:19.860> these

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
possibly on the menu they raided these

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.600 
possibly on the menu they raided these
with<00:01:20.369> two<00:01:20.580> flames<00:01:21.920> you<00:01:22.920> know<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.100> their<00:01:23.250> scale

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
with two flames you know on their scale

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.899 
with two flames you know on their scale
of<00:01:23.880> heat<00:01:24.509> intensity<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.380> suppose<00:01:25.770> they<00:01:26.700> gave

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
of heat intensity I suppose they gave

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.600 
of heat intensity I suppose they gave
these<00:01:27.119> two<00:01:27.360> flames<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.110> menu<00:01:28.579> so<00:01:29.579> that

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
these two flames on the menu so that

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.380 
these two flames on the menu so that
means<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.360> somewhat<00:01:30.659> spicy<00:01:31.170> little<00:01:31.920> spicy

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
means it's somewhat spicy little spicy

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.300 
means it's somewhat spicy little spicy
but<00:01:33.390> not<00:01:34.259> overly<00:01:34.979> hot<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.490> could<00:01:35.700> hope<00:01:37.310> alright

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
but not overly hot I could hope alright

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.690 
but not overly hot I could hope alright
so<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> wings<00:01:39.299> themselves<00:01:39.509> are<00:01:39.960> bonus<00:01:40.579> or<00:01:41.579> may

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
the heat and they said these wings are

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.730

in case these are bad but uh they're

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.869 
in case these are bad but uh they're
definitely<00:05:45.389> more<00:05:45.719> spicy<00:05:46.050> than<00:05:46.319> that<00:05:46.879> they're

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
definitely more spicy than that they're

definitely more spicy than that they're
not<00:05:47.969> ha<00:05:48.270> they're<00:05:48.779> not<00:05:48.930> overly<00:05:49.500> hot<00:05:49.680> like<00:05:49.949> the

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069

not ha they're not overly hot like the
suicide<00:05:50.339> wings<00:05:50.819> but<00:05:51.089> they're<00:05:51.900> spicy<00:05:52.310> and<00:05:53.310> they

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
suicide wings but they're spicy and they

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.040 
suicide wings but they're spicy and they
definitely<00:05:53.610> are<00:05:53.849> they're<00:05:54.360> spicier<00:05:54.810> than<00:05:54.930> they

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
definitely are they're spicier than they

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.390 
definitely are they're spicier than they
said<00:05:55.229> I<00:05:55.259> would<00:05:55.409> give<00:05:55.560> these<00:05:55.710> more<00:05:55.919> like<00:05:56.069> three

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
flames on the menu than - that's a

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.439 
flames on the menu than - that's a
little<00:05:58.830> false<00:05:59.129> advertising<00:06:00.000> there<00:06:00.150> in<00:06:00.300> that

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
little false advertising there in that

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.499 
little false advertising there in that
part<00:06:00.719> trying<00:06:01.439> to<00:06:01.529> screw<00:06:01.770> me<00:06:01.979> over<00:06:05.360> and<00:06:06.360> but

part trying to screw me over and but

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:07.790 
part trying to screw me over and but
overall<00:06:06.810> you<00:06:06.930> could<00:06:07.020> really<00:06:07.349> you<00:06:07.500> could<00:06:07.620> taste

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
overall you could really you could taste

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.379 
overall you could really you could taste
some<00:06:08.099> of<00:06:08.129> the<00:06:08.219> garlic<00:06:08.580> but<00:06:08.789> mostly<00:06:09.120> it's<00:06:09.300> the

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
some of the garlic but mostly it's the

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:13.550 
some of the garlic but mostly it's the
heat<00:06:09.659> that's<00:06:09.960> the<00:06:10.050> main<00:06:10.229> focus<00:06:10.759> um<00:06:11.759> a<00:06:12.560> little

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
heat that's the main focus um a little

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.329 
heat that's the main focus um a little
crispy<00:06:13.949> that's<00:06:14.669> fine<00:06:14.909> and<00:06:15.949> with<00:06:16.949> that<00:06:17.159> being

00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:17.339 
crispy that's fine and with that being

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:19.850 
crispy that's fine and with that being
said<00:06:17.699> you<00:06:18.029> know<00:06:18.629> the<00:06:18.870> heats<00:06:19.110> the<00:06:19.259> main<00:06:19.439> focus

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
said you know the heats the main focus

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.350 
said you know the heats the main focus
here<00:06:19.979> and<00:06:20.129> it's<00:06:20.219> an<00:06:20.310> odd<00:06:20.460> combination<00:06:20.759> but<00:06:21.150> it

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
here and it's an odd combination but it

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:29.760 
here and it's an odd combination but it
works<00:06:23.330> twice

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:38.020 

yeah<00:06:33.490> all<00:06:34.490> right<00:06:35.260> calculator<00:06:36.260> tap<00:06:36.880> the<00:06:37.880> lens

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
yeah all right calculator tap the lens

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.450 
yeah all right calculator tap the lens
were<00:06:38.180> about<00:06:38.300> four<00:06:38.600> dollars<00:06:39.040> four<00:06:40.040> dollars<00:06:40.070> for

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
were about four dollars four dollars for

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.760 
were about four dollars four dollars for
five<00:06:40.730> of<00:06:40.970> them<00:06:41.090> whole<00:06:41.900> meal<00:06:42.110> was<00:06:42.260> about<00:06:42.440> twelve

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770 
five of them whole meal was about twelve

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.680 
five of them whole meal was about twelve
but<00:06:43.100> uh<00:06:43.130> it<00:06:43.610> was<00:06:43.730> about<00:06:43.850> four<00:06:44.120> dollars<00:06:44.300> for

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
but uh it was about four dollars for

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.340 
but uh it was about four dollars for
these<00:06:44.780> guys<00:06:45.020> so<00:06:45.669> they're<00:06:46.669> all<00:06:46.820> right<00:06:47.030> I<00:06:47.350> guess

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
these guys so they're all right I guess

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.000 
these guys so they're all right I guess
I<00:06:48.590> got<00:06:48.740> my<00:06:48.830> money's<00:06:49.130> worth<00:06:50.710> but<00:06:51.710> yeah<00:06:51.860> well

I got my money's worth but yeah well
that<00:06:52.130> being<00:06:52.280> said<00:06:52.580> I<00:06:52.639> suppose<00:06:53.090> that's<00:06:53.360> it<00:06:53.889> I'm

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:54.889 
that being said I suppose that's it I'm

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:56.830 
that being said I suppose that's it I'm
a<00:06:54.919> bad<00:06:55.220> feeling<00:06:55.639> my<00:06:55.760> bow<00:06:55.940> ties<00:06:56.240> cook<00:06:56.630> at<00:06:56.750> the

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 
a bad feeling my bow ties cook at the

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.010 
a bad feeling my bow ties cook at the
entire<00:06:57.139> time<00:06:57.470> but<00:06:57.770> if<00:06:57.889> it<00:06:58.040> is<00:06:58.720> deal<00:06:59.720> with<00:06:59.780> it

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
entire time but if it is deal with it

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.159 
entire time but if it is deal with it
what<00:07:00.979> are<00:07:01.040> we<00:07:01.130> gonna<00:07:01.250> do<00:07:01.460> about<00:07:01.490> it<00:07:01.729> right<00:07:02.169> jump

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:03.169 
what are we gonna do about it right jump

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:05.140 
what are we gonna do about it right jump
into<00:07:03.440> the<00:07:03.530> screen<00:07:03.680> and<00:07:04.040> fix<00:07:04.280> it<00:07:04.430> for<00:07:04.610> me<00:07:04.790> how

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.150 
into the screen and fix it for me how

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:11.310 
into the screen and fix it for me how
about<00:07:05.360> that<00:07:09.400> so<00:07:10.400> out<00:07:10.550> of<00:07:10.669> ten

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.320 
about that so out of ten

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.730 
about that so out of ten
it's<00:07:12.320> an<00:07:12.440> odd<00:07:12.560> combination<00:07:14.530> what's<00:07:15.530> a<00:07:15.620> little

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.740 
it's an odd combination what's a little

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.680 
it's an odd combination what's a little
harder<00:07:16.130> than<00:07:16.250> I<00:07:16.340> expected<00:07:17.380> so<00:07:18.380> for<00:07:18.650> that<00:07:19.690> I'm

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:20.690 
harder than I expected so for that I'm

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.240 
harder than I expected so for that I'm
gonna<00:07:20.930> give<00:07:21.080> it<00:07:21.110> a<00:07:21.290> 7<00:07:21.889> point<00:07:22.100> 5<00:07:22.510> -<00:07:23.979> yeah<00:07:24.979> she's

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:25.250 
gonna give it a 7 point 5 - yeah she's

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.980 
gonna give it a 7 point 5 - yeah she's
just<00:07:25.490> a<00:07:25.550> seven<00:07:25.790> point<00:07:25.940> five<00:07:26.180> two<00:07:26.450> out<00:07:26.600> of<00:07:26.630> ten<00:07:26.870> I

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:26.990 
just a seven point five two out of ten I

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.650 
just a seven point five two out of ten I
think<00:07:27.200> that's<00:07:27.400> solid<00:07:28.400> enough<00:07:28.700> just<00:07:29.540> a<00:07:29.570> little

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:29.660 
think that's solid enough just a little

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.060 
think that's solid enough just a little
hotter<00:07:29.930> than<00:07:30.020> I<00:07:30.229> expected<00:07:30.650> but<00:07:30.770> it's<00:07:30.890> an<00:07:30.950> odd

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:31.070 
hotter than I expected but it's an odd

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.680 
hotter than I expected but it's an odd
combination<00:07:31.370> better<00:07:31.910> works<00:07:32.150> it's<00:07:32.360> definitely

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:32.690 
combination better works it's definitely

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:38.230 
combination better works it's definitely
on<00:07:32.810> the<00:07:33.850> higher<00:07:34.850> end<00:07:35.150> of<00:07:35.210> the<00:07:35.270> spectrum<00:07:36.789> so<00:07:37.789> I'm

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 
on the higher end of the spectrum so I'm

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.469 
on the higher end of the spectrum so I'm
for<00:07:38.450> that<00:07:38.539> being<00:07:38.780> said<00:07:39.050> I<00:07:39.380> suppose<00:07:39.830> that's<00:07:40.010> it

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 
for that being said I suppose that's it

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:43.029 
for that being said I suppose that's it
this<00:07:41.479> is<00:07:41.660> running<00:07:41.840> on<00:07:41.960> empty<00:07:42.110> food<00:07:42.710> a<00:07:42.830> view<00:07:42.979> of
