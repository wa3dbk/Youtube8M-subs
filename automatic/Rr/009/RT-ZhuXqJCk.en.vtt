00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:18.940
 well bruno senna the touch is 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:20.650
 We consider that the auctioneer 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.490
 we see it here repeated and we're going to 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.490
 times in the vettel camera 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.520
 you 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.350
 from fernando 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.490
 the repetition of a scene with 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.490
 Sebastian Vettel 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.560
 the blow says 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.690
 and that telemetry is fine because it does not 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.190
 lose heavily loaded dynamically no no me 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.330
 turns fast for sebastian vettel 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.650
 right now 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.450
 sebastian vettel who now has to 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.670
 have an objective in mind to forget about 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.620
 everything and try to ride up to the fourth 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.330
 position is the only thing that can 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.090
 allow to be world champion because 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.800
 has Fernando ahead very far and 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.720
 Fernando is in the position that 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.280
 need for the moment on the podium there 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.520
 we have recovering positions sebastian 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.520
 vettel 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.810
 in the team's work to try 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.820
 get a title that is possible is 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.360
 raining because the artist there is no one 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.800
 that improve the times and now I said 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.390
 this time it's raining you can 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.970
 to use network I know precisely why 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.750
 careful that you can change a lot this 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.240
 to see how the rain progresses and how 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.619
 runs the market itself if that can be 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.900
 a rival also for Fernando Alonso 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.300
 care fernando needs to be in the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.190
 podium needs to be on the podium to 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.540
 salvation of the world out band 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.670
 behind fernando that goes from 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.680
 Braking caramba, you have to get inside 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.180

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.630
 hÃ¼lkenberg is the super track 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.630
