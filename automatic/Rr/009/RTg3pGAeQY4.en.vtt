00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.080
 I come to talk about tofu are at 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.419
 government that everyone knows that what 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.189
 they have changed but nobody knows why 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.989
 why are the rest of the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.400
 reds too and you still have to receive 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.010
 very first-hand information 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.120
 important and above all very truthful 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.680
 protect your country and mean truthful 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.080
 verify the true information about 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.449
 of what has actually happened with 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.280
 the eyes what is what we're going to 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.739
 bring or you know we 're going to do what 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.250
 I'll show you in this video is worth 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.829
 in this video so well let's go to 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.530
 go through but let's start 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.879
 explain you not the characteristics that 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.880
 Had before 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.950
 oksana well and the ones he has now I'm going to 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.470
 explain why the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.149
 characteristics and especially why 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.490
 they want to change the method of obtaining 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.530
 is what Magnano says the method of 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.179
 but good you will realize 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.950
 later in the video what 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.670
 really want to do with this the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.670
 change of eyes 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.090
 and goodbye well as you can see here this 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.310
 we have the differences above all of 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.770
 be between the two in augury 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.700
 Hispanics worth before they gave of 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.310
 650 wisdom and currently give 60 and 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.410
 most bound to an account is the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.370
 main change that they have made to 12 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.620
 Seeing French was the same, we have 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.420
 that the effects will be the same 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.690
 to admit jesus and they have always been the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.840
 same effects but it is true that 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.700
 I had the odd change as well 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.700
 Say it in the visual aspect 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.280
 Well, that's how it would be just world of 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.560
 French has not been like this until the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.390
 moment that because he has not seen any 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.490
 image so because really the 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.940
 onces that you want to hide because 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.600
 well now he likes to be seen in 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.240
 that position is not good but really 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.830
 this is how it was obvious South African and 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.750
 now comes the million dollar question 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.100
 because they changed the dow melting water and 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.380
 why are the rest of the 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.940
 two well this is because really in 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.670
 French that he was giving a speech in 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.920
 something already of wisdom boost or they are 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.450
 an obvious fusion of eight wisdoms that 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.050
 they did not work and to feed him 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.970
 payment because really that was a 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.290
 terrible exception and that touched one 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.630
 was going to be the dungeon and he played one of 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.730
 you practically had to burn it and 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.090
 use special poems so that you do not 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.100
 there will be no trace of that aberration 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.769
 then they have changed it that way so that 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.769
 so I can so they do not have to 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.120
 suffer that terrible terrible unease in 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.360
 your interior that have 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.030
 when it's playing little and that's why they go 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.180
 to change the rest of the two in 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.430
 consequence also one of the things 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.959
 what the French do is not once 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.709
 I had when you create an account 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.900
 would be French at level 1 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.720
 since they are incarnated there is a kid 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.700
 entrance a nfc that if you talk to him and 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.650
 you give to exchange directly without 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.900
 that you put nothing will put all the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.610
 two and all of football's maximum is 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.950
 say if by chance someone is going to 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.959
 do it later and second your home tours 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.519
 of less than 20 that his turquoise is not going 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.200
 to be worth anybody that's why they're going to 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.519
 change because really the French 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.400
 from level 1 they already have all the 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.280
 eyes as you know the French then 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.739
 has that reputation of rich 90 pus that 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.040
 but good clearly is given by 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.620
 these for these two that they give them from the 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.079
 level 1 and this is what gives them the 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.140
 very great advantage they have in the 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.209
 level one tournament called mild 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.709
 luminator I do not know if you will know him but a 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.990
 very secret tournament so I doubt there's 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.550
 overheard heard about him 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.800
 so good now I'm going to leave you with 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.130
 a few images already to finish the 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:16.030
 video of the other two french mpc 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.650
 what's left of those two and well this was a 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.480
 little everything that I hope has opened 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.830
 in the eyes at least this video I hope 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.820
 that you liked it and see you in the 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.820
 next goodbye 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.740
 well after having seen all the 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.410
 tests and all the photos that I finish you 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.100
 to teach the two with cesses and about 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.380
 all the mpc that the organ 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.750
 you could have an idea of â€‹â€‹why 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.750
 what the great sun takes and feels
