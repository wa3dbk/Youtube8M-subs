00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.949 

let's<00:00:02.040> see<00:00:02.250> how<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.669> calculate<00:00:03.000> cube<00:00:03.689> root

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
let's see how to calculate cube root

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.970 
let's see how to calculate cube root
using<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:05.009> method<00:00:05.310> of<00:00:05.400> prime<00:00:05.790> factorization

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:06.980 
using the method of prime factorization

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.040 
using the method of prime factorization
we'll<00:00:07.980> learn<00:00:08.220> with<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.700> help<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.240> an<00:00:09.420> example

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
we'll learn with the help of an example

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.880 
we'll learn with the help of an example
so<00:00:11.010> let's<00:00:11.429> consider<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:12.269> cube<00:00:12.570> root<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:14.000> 216

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
so let's consider the cube root of 216

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.410 
so let's consider the cube root of 216
so<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:17.250> will<00:00:17.460> first<00:00:17.820> do<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.210> prime

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
so we will first do the prime

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.210 
so we will first do the prime
factorization<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.699> 216<00:00:21.410> here<00:00:22.410> are<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.859> prime

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
factorization of 216 here are the prime

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.009 
factorization of 216 here are the prime
factors<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.330> 16<00:00:25.160> divided<00:00:26.160> by<00:00:26.189> 2<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:27.000> get<00:00:27.210> 108

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
factors to 16 divided by 2 you get 108

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.070 
factors to 16 divided by 2 you get 108
divided<00:00:28.619> by<00:00:28.769> 2<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.130> get<00:00:29.279> 54<00:00:29.939> divided<00:00:30.570> by<00:00:30.599> 2<00:00:30.720> you

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
divided by 2 you get 54 divided by 2 you

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.819 
divided by 2 you get 54 divided by 2 you
get<00:00:31.260> 27<00:00:32.300> 27<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.480> not<00:00:33.719> divisible<00:00:34.020> by<00:00:34.260> 2<00:00:34.440> so

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
get 27 27 is not divisible by 2 so

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.569 
get 27 27 is not divisible by 2 so
divided<00:00:35.340> by<00:00:35.430> 3<00:00:36.290> you<00:00:37.290> get<00:00:37.440> 9<00:00:37.710> again<00:00:38.160> divided<00:00:38.430> by

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
divided by 3 you get 9 again divided by

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.139 
divided by 3 you get 9 again divided by
3<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.149> get<00:00:39.360> 3<00:00:39.719> 3<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.070> prime<00:00:41.430> number<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:41.790> we

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
3 you get 3 3 is a prime number so we

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.360 
3 you get 3 3 is a prime number so we
stop<00:00:43.309> so<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> prime<00:00:44.700> factor<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.480> 216<00:00:46.260> are<00:00:46.469> 2<00:00:46.739> x

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
stop so the prime factor of 216 are 2 x

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.760 
stop so the prime factor of 216 are 2 x
2<00:00:47.610> x<00:00:48.270> 2<00:00:48.890> x<00:00:49.890> 3<00:00:50.070> x<00:00:50.670> 3<00:00:50.879> x<00:00:51.570> 3<00:00:53.840> we<00:00:54.840> know<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.289> when<00:00:55.590> we

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 3 we know that when we

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.639 
2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 3 we know that when we
write<00:00:56.610> down<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.910> prime<00:00:57.329> factors<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.350> square

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
write down the prime factors of a square

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.139 
write down the prime factors of a square
number<00:00:59.180> every<00:01:00.180> prime<00:01:00.809> factor<00:01:01.520> appears<00:01:02.520> twice

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
number every prime factor appears twice

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.219 
number every prime factor appears twice
in<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:04.110> factors<00:01:04.880> so<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.119> case<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:07.020> cube

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
in the factors so in case of a cube

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.910 
in the factors so in case of a cube
number<00:01:07.500> what<00:01:08.070> would<00:01:08.280> happen<00:01:09.500> each<00:01:10.500> prime

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
number what would happen each prime

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.390 
number what would happen each prime
factor<00:01:11.490> will<00:01:11.939> appear<00:01:12.420> three<00:01:12.780> times<00:01:13.130> in<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
factor will appear three times in the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.929 
factor will appear three times in the
factors<00:01:16.400> why<00:01:19.130> what<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> definition<00:01:20.670> of

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
factors why what is the definition of

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.890 
factors why what is the definition of
cube<00:01:22.009> the<00:01:23.009> definition<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.970> cube<00:01:24.240> number<00:01:24.420> is

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
cube the definition of a cube number is

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.999 
cube the definition of a cube number is
that<00:01:25.939> you<00:01:26.939> multiply<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.720> number<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.829> same

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
that you multiply a number with the same

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.090 
that you multiply a number with the same
number<00:01:29.840> three<00:01:30.840> times<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.619> means<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> number

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
number three times that means the number

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.600 
number three times that means the number
appears<00:01:32.820> three<00:01:33.150> times<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> product<00:01:34.610> to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
appears three times in the product to

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.390 
appears three times in the product to
get<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.880> cube<00:01:36.450> number<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.710> if<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.920> write<00:01:38.159> down

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
get the cube number so if you write down

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.810 
get the cube number so if you write down
the<00:01:38.729> factors<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.869> number<00:01:40.110> every<00:01:40.820> factor

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the factors of that number every factor

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.580 
the factors of that number every factor
is<00:01:41.939> going<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.420> there<00:01:42.689> three<00:01:42.930> times<00:01:42.960> because

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
is going to be there three times because

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.999 
is going to be there three times because
that's<00:01:43.829> how<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.100> cube<00:01:44.460> number<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.939> formed<00:01:46.009> now

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
that's how the cube number is formed now

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.789 
that's how the cube number is formed now
you<00:01:47.070> want<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.549> root<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> cube<00:01:48.270> number

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
you want the root of the cube number

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.039 
you want the root of the cube number
that<00:01:49.799> means<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.610> want<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> root<00:01:51.180> number<00:01:51.659> that

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
that means you want the root number that

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.039 
that means you want the root number that
made<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.680> cube<00:01:53.009> number<00:01:53.570> so<00:01:54.570> what<00:01:54.720> we<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:55.020> here

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
made this cube number so what we do here

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.789 
made this cube number so what we do here
is<00:01:56.090> from<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.270> set<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.659> three<00:01:57.930> twos<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.590> take

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
is from the set of three twos we take

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.039 
is from the set of three twos we take
only<00:01:58.979> one<00:01:59.280> two<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.759> from<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.390> set<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.750> three

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
only one two and from the set of three

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.830 
only one two and from the set of three
things<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:01.680> take<00:02:01.860> only<00:02:02.040> one<00:02:02.340> three<00:02:02.840> multiply

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
things we take only one three multiply

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.469 
things we take only one three multiply
that<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.350> two<00:02:04.500> threes<00:02:04.920> are<00:02:05.100> six<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.240> cube

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
that so two threes are six and the cube

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.790 
that so two threes are six and the cube
root<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.930> 216<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:08.250> six

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
root of 216 is six

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.190 
root of 216 is six
when<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:10.640> calculate<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.450> cube<00:02:11.690> of<00:02:11.840> number

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
when you calculate the cube of number

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.350 
when you calculate the cube of number
six<00:02:12.880> what<00:02:13.880> you<00:02:14.030> do<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.630> do<00:02:14.780> 6<00:02:15.110> x<00:02:15.680> 6<00:02:15.890> x<00:02:16.670> 6<00:02:16.880> and

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
six what you do is you do 6 x 6 x 6 and

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.880 
six what you do is you do 6 x 6 x 6 and
that's<00:02:17.750> how<00:02:17.990> you<00:02:18.050> get<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.880> 16<00:02:20.350> but<00:02:21.350> 6<00:02:21.680> is

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
that's how you get to 16 but 6 is

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.970 
that's how you get to 16 but 6 is
essentially<00:02:22.520> 2<00:02:22.730> x<00:02:23.180> 3<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.350> means<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.830> are

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
essentially 2 x 3 so that means you are

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.930 
essentially 2 x 3 so that means you are
going<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.370> multiply<00:02:25.780> 2<00:02:26.780> x<00:02:27.350> 3<00:02:27.640> three<00:02:28.640> times

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
going to multiply 2 x 3 three times

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.110 
going to multiply 2 x 3 three times
that's<00:02:29.930> why<00:02:30.170> in<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.560> prime<00:02:30.770> factors<00:02:31.310> 2

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
that's why in the prime factors 2

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.450 
that's why in the prime factors 2
appears<00:02:32.540> 3<00:02:32.810> times<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.410> 3<00:02:33.470> appears<00:02:34.100> three

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
appears 3 times and 3 appears three

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.410 
appears 3 times and 3 appears three
times<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:35.540> you<00:02:35.600> group<00:02:35.990> it<00:02:36.200> in<00:02:36.800> triples<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.700> you

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
times so you group it in triples and you

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.870 
times so you group it in triples and you
take<00:02:38.630> it<00:02:38.780> only<00:02:39.050> once<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.770> multiply<00:02:40.370> to

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
take it only once and multiply to

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.780 
take it only once and multiply to
calculate<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.600> cube<00:02:42.050> root<00:02:42.460> let's<00:02:43.460> take<00:02:43.640> one

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
calculate the cube root let's take one

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.340 
calculate the cube root let's take one
more<00:02:43.820> example<00:02:44.620> 1,000<00:02:45.760> so<00:02:46.760> let's<00:02:47.420> calculate

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
more example 1,000 so let's calculate

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.240 
more example 1,000 so let's calculate
the<00:02:48.800> prime<00:02:49.010> factors<00:02:49.490> of<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:50.210> number<00:02:50.330> 1,000

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
the prime factors of the number 1,000

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.340 
the prime factors of the number 1,000
divided<00:02:52.250> by<00:02:52.370> 2<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:52.700> get<00:02:52.850> 500<00:02:53.540> divided<00:02:54.140> by<00:02:54.290> 2

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
divided by 2 you get 500 divided by 2

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.260 
divided by 2 you get 500 divided by 2
you<00:02:54.620> get<00:02:54.800> 250<00:02:55.430> divided<00:02:56.210> by<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.450> get<00:02:56.930> 125

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
you get 250 divided by to get 125

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.260 
you get 250 divided by to get 125
divided<00:02:59.270> by<00:02:59.480> 5<00:02:59.810> you<00:03:00.200> get<00:03:00.440> 25<00:03:01.100> divided<00:03:01.670> by<00:03:01.700> 5<00:03:01.850> you

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
divided by 5 you get 25 divided by 5 you

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.620 
divided by 5 you get 25 divided by 5 you
get<00:03:02.420> 5<00:03:02.480> 5<00:03:03.020> is<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.230> prime<00:03:03.410> number<00:03:03.800> so<00:03:03.830> we<00:03:04.100> stop<00:03:04.630> so

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
get 5 5 is a prime number so we stop so

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.550 
get 5 5 is a prime number so we stop so
here<00:03:05.930> are<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.410> prime<00:03:06.860> factors<00:03:07.430> of<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:09.200> number

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
here are the prime factors of the number

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.830 
here are the prime factors of the number
1000<00:03:10.840> again<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:12.230> group<00:03:12.530> it<00:03:12.820> in<00:03:13.820> triples<00:03:14.330> there

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
1000 again you group it in triples there

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.970 
1000 again you group it in triples there
are<00:03:15.070> three<00:03:16.070> twos<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.610> there<00:03:16.880> are<00:03:17.060> 3<00:03:17.450> fives<00:03:17.980> so

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
are three twos and there are 3 fives so

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.780 
are three twos and there are 3 fives so
you<00:03:19.040> multiply<00:03:19.220> 2<00:03:19.760> by<00:03:19.790> 5<00:03:20.330> 5<00:03:20.780> to<00:03:21.050> 10<00:03:21.470> so<00:03:21.860> 10<00:03:21.890> is<00:03:22.400> the

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
you multiply 2 by 5 5 to 10 so 10 is the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.490 
you multiply 2 by 5 5 to 10 so 10 is the
cube<00:03:23.600> root<00:03:23.840> of<00:03:24.459> 1000<00:03:25.630> now<00:03:26.630> let's<00:03:26.810> consider<00:03:27.050> the

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
cube root of 1000 now let's consider the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.930 
cube root of 1000 now let's consider the
cube<00:03:27.740> root<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:29.140> 1125<00:03:30.490> let's<00:03:31.490> do<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:31.730> prime

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
cube root of 1125 let's do the prime

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.490 
cube root of 1125 let's do the prime
factorization<00:03:33.160> divided<00:03:34.160> by<00:03:34.430> 3<00:03:34.820> you<00:03:35.420> get<00:03:35.600> 375

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
factorization divided by 3 you get 375

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.900 
factorization divided by 3 you get 375
divided<00:03:37.459> by<00:03:37.610> 3<00:03:37.820> you<00:03:37.940> get<00:03:38.150> 25<00:03:39.430> 125<00:03:40.430> is<00:03:40.640> not

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
divided by 3 you get 25 125 is not

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.720 
divided by 3 you get 25 125 is not
divisible<00:03:41.240> by<00:03:41.480> 2<00:03:41.630> or<00:03:41.930> 3<00:03:41.959> so<00:03:42.680> let's<00:03:42.890> divide<00:03:43.100> by<00:03:43.430> 5

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
divisible by 2 or 3 so let's divide by 5

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.010 
divisible by 2 or 3 so let's divide by 5
you<00:03:44.120> get<00:03:44.330> 25<00:03:44.900> divided<00:03:45.260> by<00:03:45.290> 5<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:45.920> get<00:03:46.070> 5<00:03:47.020> so

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
you get 25 divided by 5 you get 5 so

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.720 
you get 25 divided by 5 you get 5 so
these<00:03:48.260> are<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.770> prime<00:03:49.070> factors<00:03:49.550> 3<00:03:49.820> x<00:03:50.420> 3<00:03:50.630> x<00:03:51.620> 5<00:03:52.130> x

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
these are the prime factors 3 x 3 x 5 x

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.620 
these are the prime factors 3 x 3 x 5 x
5<00:03:53.180> x<00:03:53.660> 5<00:03:54.280> we<00:03:55.280> know<00:03:55.490> that<00:03:55.760> each<00:03:56.000> factor<00:03:56.450> should

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
5 x 5 we know that each factor should

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.880 
5 x 5 we know that each factor should
appear<00:03:57.080> 3<00:03:57.410> times

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
appear 3 times

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.210 
appear 3 times
so<00:03:58.370> let's<00:03:58.580> group<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.180> factors<00:04:00.020> in<00:04:00.620> triples

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
so let's group the factors in triples

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.720 
so let's group the factors in triples
but<00:04:01.459> there<00:04:02.390> is<00:04:02.510> only<00:04:02.720> one<00:04:03.050> group<00:04:03.320> like<00:04:03.380> that

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
but there is only one group like that

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.390 
but there is only one group like that
there<00:04:04.730> are<00:04:04.880> 3<00:04:05.090> fives<00:04:05.420> but<00:04:06.020> there<00:04:06.320> are<00:04:06.500> only<00:04:06.739> 2

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
there are 3 fives but there are only 2

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.590 
there are 3 fives but there are only 2
threes<00:04:08.410> so<00:04:09.410> what<00:04:09.590> do<00:04:09.680> I<00:04:09.770> learn<00:04:09.950> I<00:04:10.600> cannot

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
threes so what do I learn I cannot

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.860 
threes so what do I learn I cannot
really<00:04:11.870> calculate<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.890> cube<00:04:13.130> root<00:04:13.370> of<00:04:15.160> 1125

really calculate the cube root of 1125

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.260 
really calculate the cube root of 1125
that<00:04:17.870> means<00:04:18.169> this<00:04:18.710> number<00:04:19.220> is<00:04:19.460> not<00:04:19.910> a<00:04:19.940> perfect

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
that means this number is not a perfect

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.290 
that means this number is not a perfect
cube<00:04:21.250> this<00:04:22.250> is<00:04:22.520> not

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
cube this is not

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.740 
cube this is not
cube<00:04:23.629> of<00:04:23.930> a<00:04:24.289> whole<00:04:24.710> number<00:04:25.159> so<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:26.479> prime

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
cube of a whole number so the prime

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.070 
cube of a whole number so the prime
factorization<00:04:27.530> method<00:04:28.180> not<00:04:29.180> only<00:04:29.509> helps<00:04:29.870> me

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
factorization method not only helps me

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.249 
factorization method not only helps me
to<00:04:30.229> calculate<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:31.430> cube<00:04:31.669> root<00:04:31.909> it<00:04:32.300> also<00:04:32.690> helps

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
to calculate the cube root it also helps

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.860 
to calculate the cube root it also helps
me<00:04:33.319> to<00:04:33.500> understand<00:04:34.220> whether<00:04:35.120> a<00:04:35.240> given<00:04:35.539> number
