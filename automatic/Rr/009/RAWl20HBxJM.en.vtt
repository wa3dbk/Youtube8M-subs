I'm going to talk about my triple lutz
triple<00:00:08.639> toe<00:00:09.019> wouldn't<00:00:10.019> put<00:00:10.710> it<00:00:10.740> in<00:00:11.730> all<00:00:12.630> my

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
triple toe wouldn't put it in all my

triple toe wouldn't put it in all my
jumps<00:00:13.139> not<00:00:13.889> just<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.219> triple<00:00:14.549> lutz<00:00:14.670> triple

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089

jumps not just the triple lutz triple
toe<00:00:15.269> speed<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> most<00:00:16.379> important<00:00:16.859> part<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
toe speed is a most important part the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:25.790 
toe speed is a most important part the
faster<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.270> go<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.570> higher<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.050> jump<00:00:24.680> take<00:00:25.680> a

triple lutz I focus on keeping my right

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.350 
triple lutz I focus on keeping my right
shoulder<00:00:31.410> behind<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.130> left<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.640> plant<00:00:33.210> my

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
shoulder behind the left I plant my

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.060 
shoulder behind the left I plant my
right<00:00:33.570> toe<00:00:33.780> pick<00:00:33.989> into<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> ice<00:00:34.620> which

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
right toe pick into the ice which

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.729 
right toe pick into the ice which
launches<00:00:35.520> me<00:00:35.700> into<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> air<00:00:42.379> cooler<00:00:43.379> getting

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
launches me into the air cooler getting

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.010 
launches me into the air cooler getting
me<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.040> when<00:00:44.850> she<00:00:44.879> launches<00:00:45.360> into<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.750> jump

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
me that when she launches into the jump

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.450 
me that when she launches into the jump
that<00:00:46.200> she<00:00:46.350> can<00:00:46.530> take<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.920> torque<00:00:47.190> from<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
that she can take the torque from the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.850 
that she can take the torque from the
preparation<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.289> translate<00:00:49.739> into

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
preparation and it can translate into

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.400 
preparation and it can translate into
the<00:00:50.100> jump<00:00:50.370> we're<00:00:50.550> dealing<00:00:50.940> with<00:00:51.350> creating<00:00:52.350> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the jump we're dealing with creating a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.380 
the jump we're dealing with creating a
torque<00:00:52.739> that's<00:00:53.010> down<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.730> foot<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.300> in

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
torque that's down in your foot and in

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.180 
torque that's down in your foot and in
your<00:00:54.539> ankle<00:00:54.960> which<00:00:55.410> kind<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.800> comes<00:00:56.010> up

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
your ankle which kind of comes up

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.590 
your ankle which kind of comes up
through<00:00:56.430> your<00:00:56.520> body<00:00:56.699> through<00:00:57.030> your<00:00:57.180> knee<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
through your body through your knee and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.069 
through your body through your knee and
your<00:00:57.780> hip

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
your hip

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.560 
your hip
it's<00:00:58.590> like<00:00:58.739> winding<00:00:59.190> something<00:00:59.609> up<00:00:59.760> at<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
it's like winding something up at the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.299 
it's like winding something up at the
same<00:01:00.809> time<00:01:00.989> she<00:01:01.140> has<00:01:01.170> great<00:01:01.379> power<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.890> she<00:01:01.949> can

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
same time she has great power so she can

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.429 
same time she has great power so she can
release<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.030> torque<00:01:03.359> which<00:01:03.899> allows<00:01:04.229> her<00:01:04.379> to

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
release the torque which allows her to

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.570 
release the torque which allows her to
spin<00:01:04.739> quickly<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> air

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
spin quickly in the air

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.030 
spin quickly in the air
and<00:01:05.670> her<00:01:06.270> body<00:01:06.510> awareness<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.260> very<00:01:07.619> precise

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
and her body awareness is very precise

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.620 
and her body awareness is very precise
so<00:01:08.220> she<00:01:08.280> knows<00:01:08.460> exactly<00:01:08.670> where<00:01:09.119> she<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.540> she

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
so she knows exactly where she is if she

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.880 
so she knows exactly where she is if she
keeps<00:01:09.750> her<00:01:09.869> shoulders<00:01:10.229> level<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.619> her<00:01:10.680> hips

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
keeps her shoulders level and her hips

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.109 
keeps her shoulders level and her hips
level<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.280> her<00:01:11.340> feet<00:01:11.549> are<00:01:11.640> nice<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.820> tight

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
level and her feet are nice and tight

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.060 
level and her feet are nice and tight
together<00:01:12.320> so<00:01:13.320> there's<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.560> sense<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.890> just

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
together so there's a sense of just

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.550 
together so there's a sense of just
defying<00:01:14.369> gravity<00:01:14.820> too<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.750> when<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.140> are<00:01:16.170> up

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
defying gravity too that when you are up

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.950 
defying gravity too that when you are up
there<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.369> defy<00:01:18.210> gravity<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.840> you

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
there that you can defy gravity and you

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.140 
there that you can defy gravity and you
can<00:01:19.170> linger<00:01:19.530> at<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.860> top<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> jump<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.060> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
can linger at the top of the jump it's a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.480 
can linger at the top of the jump it's a
little<00:01:21.420> how<00:01:21.479> cold<00:01:21.750> anything<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.259> say<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
little how cold anything I say be the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.580 
little how cold anything I say be the
guy<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> landing<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.659> try<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.990> maintain<00:01:25.200> my

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
guy on the landing I try to maintain my

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.649 
guy on the landing I try to maintain my
speed<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.130> keep<00:01:26.310> my<00:01:26.490> body<00:01:26.520> upright<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.820> she

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
speed and keep my body upright and she

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.899 
speed and keep my body upright and she
can<00:01:30.869> actually<00:01:31.110> build<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.280> bit<00:01:32.579> more<00:01:32.759> momentum

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
can actually build a bit more momentum

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.749 
can actually build a bit more momentum
from<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.960> landing<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.500> Lutz<00:01:34.860> into<00:01:35.670> the
