here<00:05:42.330> so<00:05:43.330> don't<00:05:43.419> ever<00:05:43.660> say<00:05:44.080> you<00:05:44.610> don't<00:05:45.610> want

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
here so don't ever say you don't want

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.300 
here so don't ever say you don't want
something<00:05:46.389> don't<00:05:46.870> say<00:05:47.320> we<00:05:47.740> don't<00:05:47.860> care<00:05:48.280> about

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
something don't say we don't care about

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.930 
something don't say we don't care about
it<00:05:48.759> because<00:05:49.300> if<00:05:49.479> you<00:05:50.020> per<00:05:50.289> se<00:05:50.320> don't<00:05:50.910> still<00:05:51.910> a

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
it because if you per se don't still a

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.650 
it because if you per se don't still a
part<00:05:52.150> of<00:05:52.270> the<00:05:52.360> group<00:05:52.599> it<00:05:53.080> does<00:05:53.520> okay<00:05:54.520> deep<00:05:55.449> down

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
part of the group it does okay deep down

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.740 
part of the group it does okay deep down
inside<00:05:55.949> you<00:05:56.949> want<00:05:56.979> those<00:05:57.430> games<00:05:57.789> that<00:05:58.150> are

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
inside you want those games that are

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.350 
inside you want those games that are
coming<00:05:59.020> out<00:05:59.169> between<00:05:59.889> September<00:06:00.729> in<00:06:00.759> November

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
coming out between September in November

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.749 
coming out between September in November
of<00:06:01.539> this<00:06:02.110> year<00:06:02.500> and<00:06:02.680> you're<00:06:03.070> not<00:06:03.280> going<00:06:03.550> to<00:06:03.610> get

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 
of this year and you're not going to get
