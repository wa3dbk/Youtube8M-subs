the 360 looper using an ebow with the
360<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.320> can<00:00:34.620> produce<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:35.130> string<00:00:35.489> quartet<00:00:36.090> in

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
360 you can produce a string quartet in

00:00:36.270 --> 00:01:35.539 
360 you can produce a string quartet in
less<00:00:36.600> than<00:00:36.809> 60<00:00:37.290> seconds

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.270 

the<00:01:36.549> 360<00:01:37.270> can<00:01:37.450> record<00:01:37.750> up<00:01:37.929> to<00:01:37.990> six<00:01:38.409> minutes<00:01:38.799> but

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
the 360 can record up to six minutes but

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.459 
the 360 can record up to six minutes but
using<00:01:39.609> a<00:01:39.700> very<00:01:39.909> short<00:01:40.299> loop<00:01:40.570> of<00:01:40.750> only<00:01:40.899> a<00:01:41.020> second

using a very short loop of only a second

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:43.469 
using a very short loop of only a second
or<00:01:41.590> two<00:01:41.619> can<00:01:42.009> produce<00:01:42.579> a<00:01:42.880> great<00:01:43.179> background

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
or two can produce a great background

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.749 
or two can produce a great background
texture<00:01:44.200> this<00:01:44.679> is<00:01:44.859> much<00:01:45.069> like<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.549> hold

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
texture this is much like the hold

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
switch on the old digital delays you can

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.160 
switch on the old digital delays you can
then<00:01:48.340> change<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:49.000> pitch<00:01:49.210> of<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.600> short<00:01:49.899> loop

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
then change the pitch of the short loop

00:01:50.170 --> 00:02:23.260 
then change the pitch of the short loop
