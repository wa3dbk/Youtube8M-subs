00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.980
 ni 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:21.540
 Some of the insects, like the cicada , become parents when the larva suddenly takes off, and the larva and then the larva 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.289
 Between the adult and 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:28.919
 For example , go through the season of sanagi 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.270
 There are insects like beetles and flying birds 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:39.460
 Here is the point of perfect transformation 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:40.060
 It is called a pillar, and the insect which suddenly becomes parent from both sides is called an imperfect metamorphosing insect 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:47.110
 I will 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:50.890
 In the case of a completely metamorphosed insect, the form is completely different if you look at the larvae and parents 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.290
 For example, it swallowtail butterfly larvae is the caterpillar 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.420
 Notebook 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:01:02.090
 The chief has big wings, so what you eat is completely different. 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:06.860
 That larva eats leaves and parents suck flower nectar with their eldest daughter 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:09.830
 Oh, we learn such things at school or live and become stupid 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.280
 But in fact it is amazing 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.159
 Life is more than fresh 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.060
 As you think, it is a completely metamorphosing insect that has two, a completely different larval world and a parent world 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.320
 is not it 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.100
 so 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:27.130
 Insects of incomplete metamorphosis, that is, insects in the parent without going through the pessimism of moths, are in the seminar or in the ground 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.439
 Live 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:39.520
 And I think the shape has changed a lot because it becomes a semi to solve the sky 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:43.780
 But food basically it is the same that larvae sucking the juice from yesterday roots seed from parent yesterday stem 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:47.150
 I'm hunting so I look very similar when I look at the face part 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:51.200
 Dragonfly is also an incomplete metamorphosing insect and is a pound of 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:56.600
 If you look at the food, it is quite different 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.330
 Yago catches and eats insects after all Catching and eating insects in the water and Aihara 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.570
 And 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:06.820
 Now it is flying in the outside and become a parent 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.150
 9 small that the Betaiu that used the insects look is it then Battaran I'm the same 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.760
 When 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.840
 Whether it is the luxury of Batam incomplete metamorphosis doing Well larvae, etc. there is a feather It is almost the same 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.350
 About whether or not there 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:22.460
 In such a manner , the insects of incomplete transformation are those of the Middle East and the 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:28.880
 It is distinguished by the painter if there is not you wings similar internal medicine 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:29.630
 That kind of is life when you observe the do You're insects are even insects like such a batter 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.120
 is not it 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:38.340
 I think it's amazing to say that you look at it once 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.420
 Shake in case of butterfly or beetle 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:48.209
 If you were a multimillionaire I I think that How about when I bought yourself reflected 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.050
 If you catch a larva and feed it , you will see more and more coordination 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.879
 Can you 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.069
 And I think it would be better to find that little four elbows as much as possible to the larva of the government office building 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:59.689
 Good thing 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:05.269
 It's there are the center of the enemy to say that regulation times or the regulations standing in the larvae 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:10.879
 In fact, there is a lot of chance to find eggs, and I intend to raise them in common 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.959
 8 Well also because is not I a word Tteyuu came out of it as well and become one of the good experience 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.730
 I think so 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:19.170
 a 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.170
 I think that if this is it maybe fun to try to buy the larvae of the butterfly butterfly
