00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
it's been difficult here um I've kind of

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.130 
it's been difficult here um I've kind of
sugar-coated<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:29.480> for<00:04:30.480> a<00:04:30.510> little<00:04:30.720> bit<00:04:30.930> now

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
sugar-coated it for a little bit now

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:38.930 
sugar-coated it for a little bit now
just<00:04:34.580> it's<00:04:36.320> it's<00:04:37.430> definitely<00:04:38.430> not<00:04:38.640> what<00:04:38.910> I

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
just it's it's definitely not what I

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.480 
just it's it's definitely not what I
thought<00:04:39.390> that<00:04:40.260> it<00:04:40.410> would<00:04:40.530> be<00:04:40.590> which<00:04:41.100> is<00:04:41.130> weird

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
thought that it would be which is weird

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.800 
thought that it would be which is weird
because<00:04:41.670> I<00:04:41.790> don't<00:04:42.120> really<00:04:42.210> know<00:04:42.570> what<00:04:42.780> I

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
because I don't really know what I

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.050 
because I don't really know what I
thought<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.170> would<00:04:43.290> be<00:04:44.090> but<00:04:45.830> it<00:04:46.830> is<00:04:47.430> it's<00:04:47.760> it's

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
thought it would be but it is it's it's

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.890 
thought it would be but it is it's it's
different<00:04:48.810> and<00:04:48.990> so<00:04:49.710> I've<00:04:50.040> definitely<00:04:50.900> been

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
different and so I've definitely been

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.640 
different and so I've definitely been
making<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.740> most<00:04:52.980> of<00:04:53.370> what<00:04:53.910> I've<00:04:54.570> been<00:04:55.290> given
