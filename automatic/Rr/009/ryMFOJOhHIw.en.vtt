00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.750
 hello girls hello everybody then vi 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.830
 I show my Christmas tree 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.770
 made with the kansas 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.940
 I must say that it was enough 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.250
 difficult because we do not know well 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.290
 how to position the petals and the first 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.150
 experiment didn't go so well 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.939
 this is the second finally there are 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.220
 successful and I think it will also be the last one 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.230
 for those who are really employed 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.170
 so much time 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.880
 this is my sapling as you see 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:46.420
 of the monster in this way during the 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.790
 video you will see how I made it 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.650
 is the most complicated part and do 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:56.140
 lots of lots of petals after which it is 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.040
 very easy to insert them with glue 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.780
 hot 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.210
 the important thing, and paste in a 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.580
 unusual direction for those who do short 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.680
 little flowers for those who already have 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.320
 familiar with the kansas come 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.390
 glued from below and not from the side 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.179
 however, then I'll show you exactly 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.210
 all I'm very happy with 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:22.359
 I really like my little tree 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.820
 so I hope you like it too 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:27.670
 and if you have some time maybe 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.740
 you can also make it happen because not 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.350
 I leave you with the video with the instructions for 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.740
 make it happen and nothing 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.159
 I wish him a Merry Christmas so let's see 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.640
 together how to make the petal I took a 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.490
 small square of 5 centimeters and folded 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.180
 folded it three times as well 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.180
 you are seeing 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.789
 once folded 3 times it goes from 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:01.280
 cut the most core part like this people 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.700
 I go to burn it clear I help myself with delle 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.560
 pliers to burn it burn it so as to 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.239
 connect all the lenses 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.239
 in this way it will be beautifully stuck 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.120
 at this point I leave the petal in 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.510
 this way and goes from scorching to 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.690
 remove the hairs from the lower door 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.070
 so this is our petal 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.840
 we have to do so many 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.960
 many depending on the size 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.780
 who has our tree 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.210
 so I'm going to build mine 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.580
 sapling I take a sheet of paper with 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.120
 a compound drawn as usual mine 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.720
 line that I will then cut into this 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:52.610
 way will actually form a 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:56.780
 I go to roll it up and go to 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.300
 stop with the hot glue then the 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.200
 my cone is finished and ready to be 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.200
 clad 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.520
 I take a cloth that I will need for 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.180
 cover the lower part the size more 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:20.430
 or less than two centimeters from my cone in 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:24.540
 so as to make then bends e 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:28.700
 I go as usual and paste it with the 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:33.720
 hot glue then paste first 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:37.310
 four corners and then I'm going to paste 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.310
 all other remaining parts 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.489
 in this way I covered the whole part 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.489
 lower 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.960
 so I'm ready to enter mine 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.960
 Kansas 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.560
 I take all my petals and them 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.159
 I go to place them side 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.689
 other 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.260
 don't worry I'll show you by 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:04:00.930
 near how to do it here i'm doing 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.569
 see the line I'm following then 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.019
 I will insert them practically on a line 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:11.060
 then above the upper line precisely 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.060
 and always like that until the end 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.430
 as you can see here I approached a little bit 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.229
 the camera shows you which part of the 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.210
 petal you have to paste the part 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.580
 underlying the last we have 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.580
 singed then we take it 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:46.560
 put it with the glue and insert it on the 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:49.880
 our cone in this way we will see later 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:53.639
 the end result like a sapling 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.680
 so I'll just take the part 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.490
 final the last we have 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.150
 singed and I'm going to paste it 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.150
 exactly this way 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.850
 at this point I always proceed in this 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.570
 way and when I'm coming up and 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:36.380
 your how to finish I always insert 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.950
 my petals gradually until it arrived 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.950
 at the top 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:16.309
 once at the top I decide that 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:19.589
 decoration I have to put I chose 

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:23.180
 so I'm going to insert it 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:23.180
 always with hot glue 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:41.610
 cut my subject burn Nazi 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.610
 the edges 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.920
 so that it does not fray and goes by 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:50.530
 insert other decorations 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.530
 I chose golden balls 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:07:00.400
 I'm always going to insert it with glue 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:02.890
 hot so I choose the tip of the 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.760
 my petal I go to insert mine 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:08.110
 pallina this is the last step for 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:13.270
 complete the decoration of ours 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:15.360
 alberello well I enjoy so until 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.360
 end 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.900
 putting all my people in dots 

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:26.910
 all my beads and then mine 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.910
 sapling will be finished 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:34.050
 I hope you like it and that you succeed in 

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:39.060
 do it for this christmas 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:39.060
 I greet you and the next hello
