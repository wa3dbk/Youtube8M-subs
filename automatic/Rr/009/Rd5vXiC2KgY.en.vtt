cocoa<00:00:42.760> powder<00:00:43.030> in<00:00:43.210> this<00:00:43.360> on<00:00:43.600> off<00:00:43.780> leave<00:00:44.170> guys

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.160 

so<00:00:49.059> you<00:00:49.120> want<00:00:49.359> to<00:00:49.449> make<00:00:49.480> sure<00:00:49.660> that<00:00:50.050> we're

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
so you want to make sure that we're

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.529 
so you want to make sure that we're
going<00:00:50.260> to<00:00:50.320> agree<00:00:50.469> gets<00:00:51.340> deep<00:00:51.789> into<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.329> juice

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
going to agree gets deep into the juice

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
great so we can move on so next step is

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.740 
great so we can move on so next step is
to<00:00:59.559> add<00:01:00.750> disqus<00:01:01.750> to<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:02.350> base<00:01:02.559> yeah<00:01:03.479> this<00:01:04.479> your
