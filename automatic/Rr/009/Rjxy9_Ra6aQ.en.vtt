makes this a side thing is if you click
let's<00:02:23.110> see<00:02:24.010> here<00:02:24.280> if<00:02:24.370> this<00:02:24.520> thing<00:02:24.760> is<00:02:24.910> open<00:02:25.660> for

let's see here if this thing is open for

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.620 
let's see here if this thing is open for
this<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:26.470> can<00:02:27.060> turn<00:02:28.060> it

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
this and you can turn it

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.500 
this and you can turn it
there<00:02:29.350> we<00:02:29.530> go<00:02:29.680> that's<00:02:29.860> how<00:02:30.070> it's<00:02:30.370> done<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.790> it

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
there we go that's how it's done and it

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.120 
there we go that's how it's done and it
turns<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:31.900> way<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:32.380> guess<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:32.710> goes<00:02:32.830> there

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
turns that way and I guess it goes there

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.640 
turns that way and I guess it goes there
like<00:02:33.430> that

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
like that

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.730 
like that
