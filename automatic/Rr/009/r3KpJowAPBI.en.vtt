00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.799
 and now roach fishing nozzle 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.379
 Of course this foam for catching small fry and 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.289
 not only from March to November 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.840
 by the way it's not that old 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.250
 phishing nozzle not one hundred percent off 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.939
 phishing in and still pretty young and 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.250
 foam nozzle is very effective 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.110
 so to speak with great confidence 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.160
 and perhaps the most effective of all 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.210
 remaining baits 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.210
 but it only works together with 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.300
 bait mechanism of foam operation 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.370
 nozzles pretty simple prikormka 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.010
 washed out of the feeder creeps over here 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.059
 some sort of field gets enough sleep 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.859
 this prikormka in this sector where she 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.320
 crumbled lay our foam 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.570
 Hooks Hooks with foam plastic fish 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.760
 swims going to bait 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.570
 automatically cuts through 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.490
 a hook and the polyfoam put on it 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.130
 , too, the roach takes here such 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.509
 hook with foam if the ball is a little 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.759
 a little more and hook this a little bit 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.680
 swims for some kind of larva 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:28.350
 it doesn't matter anymore but on the foam just 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.100
 with lead ball without trough without 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.619
 bait 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.100
 not what fish bite except perhaps 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.920
 very very random and so in general 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.520
 I made my choice already fifteen years 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.020
 backwards 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.140
 if not 20 if not more nozzle this 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.490
 polystyrene to produce such a nozzle easier 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.049
 than any other 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.420
 because polyfoam a lot of it everywhere 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.180
 can buy it can find it 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:02.850
 packing construction foam here 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:05.610
 such balls we pick off a hook 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.170
 we have a number eight according to the old numbering 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.170
 how to dress foam 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.060
 we pierce in the middle 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.430
 foam ball cheat 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.569
 loosen it properly 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.310
 sometimes we put the hook on the forearm 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:29.250
 stick to it a piece of foam and 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:32.459
 return back all our nozzle is ready 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:37.420
 to fulfill their direct duties 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.700
 but that's exactly the foam he 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.709
 a little bit soft and when catching say 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.500
 the same bream at great depths 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.819
 this foam will shrink to 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.680
 depth of 10 meters 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:54.340
 its volume will be halved if not 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.620
 more this ball will fall to the bottom along with 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.129
 crochet and will not be so effective 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.170
 work this foam 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:07.209
 really decreases in volume this 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:10.920
 can be easily seen under pressure if 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.920
 we foam balls put a syringe 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:20.260
 close this here's a hole in the syringe 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:24.190
 I need them, you see, it has decreased by two 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.590
 times we syringe and simulated pressure 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.420
 at a depth of only 10 meters well on 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.590
 normal standard still in depth 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.810
 This must be taken into account for catching roach in 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.290
 principle on shallow beach areas 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.240
 this foam is not bad for catching bream 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.370
 on deeper sections of the river 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.940
 I have been using the so-called for many years 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.360
 a pill but not a ball like this 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.540
 pill form of the same foam 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.660
 it turns out nasadochka like doing it 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.730
 thin-walled 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.470
 sharpened tube here I came up 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.150
 such a piston can be for your convenience 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.900
 do it in a machine very quickly 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.730
 it turns out if the machine is not at hand 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.500
 when please manually this one 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.840
 its polyfoam much where it is used 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.520
 it is used in packaging 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.940
 well, all his computer equipment 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.760
 same system units for example here it is 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:25.200
 harder than this foam it is harder than 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:28.440
 this construction foam is not 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.300
 so he shrinks he is more stable yes yes 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.250
 happens with the following way we take here 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.460
 this one is a piece 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.010
 packaging computer unit and 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.190
 fast movement we drill cylinder 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:52.050
 then squeeze it here alone 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:53.520
 the billet is ready here a little second 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.380
 sticks to hands because 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:04.760
 electrified after that we take 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:04.760
 we cut the usual wallpaper knife 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:16.120
 right size cylinders like this 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.560
 we stock the amount we need 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:23.240
 exactly the size we need foam 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.860
 but not ball cylinders as well 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:33.560
 the very thing they dress cylinder slightly 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:38.600
 wrinkled in the hands put on the hook 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:41.230
 everything is fast reliably when he bites 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.420
 reduces the sting of the hook is released and the fish 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.700
 caught but what else to say for catching 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.850
 on the foam it is advisable to pick nicknames 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.560
 Well, not that thin but that they 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.990
 was round for and without any there 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.570
 square turns to foam 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:01.760
 ball or cylinder is very easy with this 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:04.130
 hook ran from personal experience yet 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.590
 I will add that the foam with correctly 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.990
 cooked porridge with properly 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.790
 cooked bait here in this 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:15.580
 here's the gear or in the cylinders or in 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:17.890
 mesh here if throw often and 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.890
 lure fish intensively 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.930
 then I can not, in general, I do not know 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.120
 screw up such that let's say the same 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.070
 two spinning we do not have time to catch 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.120
 the same roach serve very 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.800
 effective tip I recommend here at 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.410
 me on her still for this season 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.410
 plans as nozzle number 1 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:44.919
 the only problem may be that 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:47.139
 there will be big water and it will start 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:49.539
 there is some kind of flood and again over 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:52.389
 will carry on the bottom the grass is grass 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:55.300
 will cover the feeder here along with 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:57.550
 our short habits then yes 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.389
 then the problem will need habits 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.479
 lengthen and 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:06.519
 foam replaced by the same maggots but 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:07.179
 if this does not happen and if the year will be 

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:09.369
 usual 

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:10.769
 and there will not be this grass 

00:07:09.369 --> 00:07:15.429
 the bottom is such 

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:19.179
 tackle well show yourself just the thing 

00:07:15.429 --> 00:07:19.809
 in the best way 

00:07:19.179 --> 00:07:23.769
 nozzle 

00:07:19.809 --> 00:07:26.469
 foam here so here it is mined here 

00:07:23.769 --> 00:07:30.209
 so here she is dressing and how it works 

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:30.209
 try to shoot already on the shore
