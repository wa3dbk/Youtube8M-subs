00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:07.390
 This time , using grid lines to express effects like television images 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.280
 I would like to do for a moment 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.969
 First, it is usually in 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.960
 A movie of a woman is prepared Yes it is this 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.189
 I'd like to explain it after the heavy screen grease or have a few steps 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.800
 Please watch 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:27.070
 It is a lung airway contrast from it is first effect 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:31.810
 I will set this one is a little so hard ground 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:37.540
 Let's make it a little sharper than 24 -43 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:42.580
 And this time will choose a grid of drawing from the effect 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:45.670
 Normally it will be like this if it is a brid, but the amount will return to normal from the mode 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:50.470
 And put a slider with Taka 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:54.720
 Yes, it's a point here, but usually it 's only 200 that this width is written 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:01:00.710
 There is no, but please ignore this 200 and sell it with 2000 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:04.640
 Then you can move it in this way 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:08.960
 In a word, it will start the vertical line that will go to the end 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:13.520
 And let the height to about after this time 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:19.100
 And border the thickness of 4 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.810
 And this time is set at about height 3 I heard Kedomo is What It is funny Yeah Kore 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:27.810
 Shoo or high 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:31.049
 It is this and it is in the grid of color slightly and set to form such a greenish 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.970
 Yes, something like a line of investigation came out 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:39.030
 Well this is right Yeah it's right timecode of the text 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.369
 It may be difficult and I will ride a little 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.369
 I think it seems like it would be like 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:52.450
 Yes and no, I'm not a surveillance camera, but I want to be more awkward with people 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.480
 The case is from here time 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:00.850
 Aim for posterization time and here 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:02.630
 If you set the frame rate to 15 or something, it looks like it is a bit jumbled 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.469
 More than 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.469
 I think it seems like I'm approaching a TV like a surveillance camera
