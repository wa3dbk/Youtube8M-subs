00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
quite willies he's wearing out in full

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.609 
quite willies he's wearing out in full
range<00:00:26.609> he's<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.000> very<00:00:27.119> little<00:00:27.359> pain<00:00:27.630> little

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
range he's in very little pain little

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.900 
range he's in very little pain little
stiff<00:00:28.830> towards<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.189> end<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.340> ranges<00:00:29.699> but

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
stiff towards the end of ranges but

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.640 
stiff towards the end of ranges but
again<00:00:30.570> he's<00:00:30.750> probably<00:00:30.960> progress<00:00:31.320> better<00:00:31.500> than

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
again he's probably progress better than

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.200 
again he's probably progress better than
we<00:00:31.710> thought<00:00:31.890> how<00:00:32.430> long<00:00:32.550> has<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.700> normally<00:00:33.000> take

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
we thought how long has it normally take

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.440 
we thought how long has it normally take
to<00:00:33.329> get<00:00:33.480> get<00:00:34.290> back<00:00:34.320> from<00:00:34.649> an<00:00:34.800> injury<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.070> that

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
to get get back from an injury like that

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.639 
to get get back from an injury like that
look<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.960> little<00:00:37.110> bit<00:00:37.200> hard<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.440> say

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
look it's a little bit hard to say

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.830 
look it's a little bit hard to say
Andrew<00:00:38.520> at<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> moment<00:00:39.300> simply<00:00:39.420> because<00:00:39.809> of

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
Andrew at the moment simply because of

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.040 
Andrew at the moment simply because of
its<00:00:40.379> its<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.460> ranger<00:00:42.030> ii<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.149> an<00:00:42.239> old<00:00:42.420> old

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
its its it's a ranger ii of an old old

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.560 
its its it's a ranger ii of an old old
pcl<00:00:43.559> tear<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.890> he<00:00:43.980> had<00:00:44.239> in<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> State<00:00:45.539> of

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
pcl tear that he had in the State of

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.700 
pcl tear that he had in the State of
Origin<00:00:45.690> last<00:00:46.079> year<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.760> look<00:00:47.930> given<00:00:48.930> given

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
Origin last year so look given given

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.840 
Origin last year so look given given
that<00:00:49.890> he's<00:00:49.980> progressing<00:00:50.309> quite<00:00:50.550> well<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> think

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
that he's progressing quite well I think

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.520 
that he's progressing quite well I think
he's<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> realistic<00:00:51.719> chance<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:52.079> making<00:00:52.410> that

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
he's a realistic chance of making that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.750 
he's a realistic chance of making that
phone<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.309> that's<00:00:53.460> what<00:00:53.579> we're<00:00:53.670> working

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
phone and that's what we're working

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.860 
phone and that's what we're working
towards<00:00:54.210> he's<00:00:54.300> certainly<00:00:54.510> not<00:00:54.600> going<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.809> play

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
towards he's certainly not going to play

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.049 
towards he's certainly not going to play
this<00:00:55.050> week<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:55.520> you<00:00:56.520> know<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:56.730> think<00:00:57.000> that

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
this week but you know we think that

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.910 
this week but you know we think that
he's<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.660> good<00:00:57.780> chance<00:00:57.989> playing<00:00:58.320> next<00:00:58.530> week<00:00:58.710> and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
he's a good chance playing next week and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.470 
he's a good chance playing next week and
if<00:00:59.010> we<00:00:59.160> had<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> game<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.969> week<00:01:00.090> after<00:01:00.390> he

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
if we had a game the week after he

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.000 
if we had a game the week after he
probably<00:01:00.660> definitely<00:01:00.840> play<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.320> game<00:01:01.469> so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
probably definitely play that game so

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.740 
probably definitely play that game so
