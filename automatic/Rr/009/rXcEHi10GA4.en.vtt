00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.880
 and also their children because patrio al cabo 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:08.040
 is going to teach us how to make frames with 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.780
 a scoring technique I do not know in what 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.620
 beautiful are also left us some 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.660
 little gifts for you we go with him 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.980
 how about friends how are i part 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.140
 rubalcaba in this section of 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.880
 crafts and decoration today 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.310
 I bring you a technique really very 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.830
 they can easily do it with their children and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.720
 well very very very economical because what 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.300
 what we need is a wooden frame 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.009
 You can send these frames to 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.600
 do with who do all these 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.809
 craft wood figurines 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.540
 can you draw your template according to 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.370
 what you want openwork and then 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.579
 they are made with a laser 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.350
 this is a material that is mdf and if it 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.510
 they fix the little bank, there's always a 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.699
 little bit darker because it makes it like 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.059
 burn the wood because it already gives a touch 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.070
 different then this is lovely 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.739
 we will also use acrylic paints 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.739
 I recommend you put them on a plate 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.890
 in a plastic lid where they are a 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.250
 different professional tennis goal 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.750
 colors in acrylic paint we are going to 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.420
 use a brush 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.190
 but the brush or more important now goes 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.340
 to be the other part this part is 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.800
 flat because we need a little circle or 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.140
 a thick stick and depends on the frame that 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.060
 so big, so let's use what 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.520
 is the circle can be one more circle 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.160
 big if it's a larger frame or one 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.570
 smaller and we will need for the 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:36.000
 final one layer either varnish or 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.979
 transparent of what is this one a 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.350
 little thicker so they do not fit 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.009
 so as transparent without a finish as 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.660
 if it were oil and well let's start now 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.670
 we have here our wood is not 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.160
 necessary to sand it because this wood 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.810
 comes super soft and what are we going to 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.780
 start doing is that we're going to take a 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.119
 color any color for example red 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.520
 we wet our brush and what we're going to 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.220
 to do is that we're going to start supporting 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.399
 with the same brush and we're going to put the 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.440
 dots for different places around 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.170
 what is going to be the frame 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.940
 let's make us a part for 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.430
 see how we are going to interspersed 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.640
 the different colors we are going to make 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.550
 this part above 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.700
 and then we're going to guide and we're going to 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.290
 can do with another color we are going to 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.750
 have it here we are going to download a 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.600
 little bit and then we are going to follow us with 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.850
 another tone here we have this green and 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.850
 let's start marking with green 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.910
 it does not matter if the colors are refreshed 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.680
 at the beginning or all the time it does not matter 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.230
 who do you joke about the creativity that each 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.250
 who has and the colors that most 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.140
 like children love to paint 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.300
 they can do it if the frame is very large 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.790
 they can do it with the fingers of the 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.300
 children with the prints can do it 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.030
 also this technique is very fast and 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.040
 it's very very economical now we're going to 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.500
 download again our brush and not 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.260
 because with another color we are going to do now 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.160
 a blue so it's different then 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.730
 let's load what we redirect 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.010
 always trying to be next to 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.600
 the points that we someone and I think 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.660
 that the points we already made 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.970
 here more blue let's put in this 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.370
 part and these frames are very beautiful 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.260
 because they can use to bring them if 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.870
 they want photos but if not they can also 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.940
 put them a mirror or they can also 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.160
 put them directly on the wall if they have 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.050
 a colored wall friends put it 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.180
 straight on the wall and do not know how nice 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.010
 you see we are going to change color 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.830
 now let's put something stronger 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.360
 Let 's go with this blue and let's go 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.020
 checking 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.810
 and we 're going to go like this until the end 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.640
 end to the children let them be that if 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.370
 they want to put a color here and another one 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.740
 here let those who put it where they want 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.380
 the joke is that we go covering if not 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.510
 it covers all the wood does not matter 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.450
 a lot because as we have this base of 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.200
 beige color helps us a lot as well 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.450
 base 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.000
 if they want to put an extra base they can 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.820
 make it with shades with a light color by 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.489
 white example or a very light yellow 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.990
 they paint their base first and then they 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.150
 they put the point 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.850
 now let's download again and let's go 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.979
 to put another tone let's go now with this 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.409
 orange 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.509
 let's put it cut where we see that 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:36.880
 there are not many points there we go to 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:39.820
 put 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.010
 and we're going to go all all everything up 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.860
 let's finish all four parts 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.410
 the more colors you obviously get 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.500
 Well, it's better to see it because it's going 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.080
 to see different and light colors 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.150
 they stand out very much if they put many tones in 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.070
 Dark color light color for 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.650
 that always stand out also what can 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.050
 do according to the range of colors and if 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.400
 they are going to put in a room that the room 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.080
 it's better in brown tones 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.440
 well, do it in those shades 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.510
 oranges yellows ocher let's change 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.580
 now the color and we are going to put this rose 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.790
 also for the nursery that 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:19.300
 it was really very very nice once 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.390
 and we are going to have everything full 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.910
 all the parts what I have here 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:28.150
 another one will see it right now as we have 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.569
 the four parts will be for us 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.699
 this way 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:34.610
 and then now we are going to give you a 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:37.069
 finished that is I love the finish 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.379
 that is called paul I read it is finished 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:40.909
 it gives us as if it were precisely a 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:43.699
 forget that lolo as it looks like 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:45.499
 wrinkled or what can we do the ready 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.439
 then I'm going to take my brochita that 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:50.539
 I pull it here but here it is I have 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:51.619
 a sponge this can also be 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.360
 find in any store 

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:56.209
 crafts are the store where they sell 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.039
 all for paintings and this then here 

00:05:56.209 --> 00:06:01.610
 I have already measured and cop smelled in a 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:04.129
 tapita I wet it a little bit and then I go 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.159
 to start is to freeze it if I sponge or 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:09.379
 if they are fixed it is going to be like 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:12.289
 Grooming not small groups and not as corrugated 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:14.240
 or I could put it in ready but the 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:16.819
 truth is much better if I 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.969
 sponge because that's going to give us shine 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:23.269
 will protect us what we already painted 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:24.949
 will last much longer and as they 

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:27.979
 I say they can put down maybe a 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:29.779
 mirror or you can put some picture of 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.040
 some special event of your children and 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:34.010
 it can be in an arch 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.840
 also do not worry much about this 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.420
 Draft not this draft can be 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.190
 any on any surface there 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.080
 also some wooden letters that 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.660
 surely have seen in stores 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.760
 decoration that is athletic wood 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.120
 If you put them with this this 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.010
 scoring technique they are precious 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.050
 and then it's to decorate the room 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.780
 the children and they do it with a lot 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.700
 taste and when they see something in the room that 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.680
 they did like they're going to take care 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.320
 much more or maybe for a gift 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.240
 could make these marquitos also be 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.970
 They use a lot to give them in the 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.680
 parties as I remember you already know that you 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.420
 give the gift that the sweets or 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.060
 any good memory because this is 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:17.290
 a good option for children 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:20.240
 moms help them at home and make them 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.980
 these marquitos to his friends if they 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.870
 like to the lines the tones 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.030
 in pink because I recommend you combine 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.360
 the pink with the green and the purple and you see 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.360
 Really 

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:33.239
 Well, this is going to be leaving us and once 

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:36.210
 that we finished and nothing else we let 

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:38.669
 dry as a few 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:41.460
 about two hours it's going to dry and it's going to 

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:43.350
 to be more shiny we will be more 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.349
 protected in our frame and what 

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.000
 we will be able to do is to hang it from 

00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:50.490
 immediately, this is the technique if 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.650
 they want to find us on facebook we are 

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.930
 as patio rubalcaba crafts and 

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.520
 decoration and good then here we see 

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:59.780
 next the next section of 

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.780
 crafts we continue
