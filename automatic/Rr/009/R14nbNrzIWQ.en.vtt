well<00:00:44.420> for<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:44.720> answer<00:00:45.050> to<00:00:45.200> that<00:00:45.290> question<00:00:45.560> we

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
well for the answer to that question we

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.550 
well for the answer to that question we
went<00:00:46.310> to<00:00:46.399> the<00:00:46.489> experts<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:48.260> biggest

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
went to the experts the biggest

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.410 
went to the experts the biggest

one of the big advantages of that not
only<00:01:58.520> is<00:01:58.729> their<00:01:58.939> ability<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.450> function<00:01:59.900> and

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
only is their ability to function and

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.590 
only is their ability to function and
protect<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:00.829> high<00:02:00.950> temperature

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.609 
applications better than conventional
but<00:02:04.310> it<00:02:04.430> it<00:02:05.710> accepts<00:02:06.710> in<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:07.250> life<00:02:07.729> expectancy

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
but it it accepts in a life expectancy

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.960 
but it it accepts in a life expectancy
significantly<00:02:09.619> longer<00:02:09.979> than<00:02:10.610> what<00:02:10.789> can<00:02:10.910> be

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970

motor oils are created equal just like

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.520 
motor oils are created equal just like
conventional<00:02:20.300> motor<00:02:20.510> oils<00:02:20.840> some<00:02:21.290> are<00:02:21.410> better

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
conventional motor oils some are better

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.290 
conventional motor oils some are better
than<00:02:21.650> others<00:02:21.800> so<00:02:22.610> we<00:02:22.790> went<00:02:22.910> back<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
than others so we went back to the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.510 
than others so we went back to the
experts<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:23.930> asked<00:02:24.230> what<00:02:24.770> set<00:02:25.040> sams<00:02:25.310> all

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
experts and asked what set sams all

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.660 
experts and asked what set sams all
apart<00:02:26.620> well<00:02:27.620> amsoil<00:02:28.100> is<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.280> little<00:02:28.550> bit

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
apart well amsoil is a little bit

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.670 
apart well amsoil is a little bit
different<00:02:29.090> than<00:02:29.300> other<00:02:29.569> synthetic<00:02:29.900> producers

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
different than other synthetic producers

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.040 
different than other synthetic producers
because<00:02:31.070> we're<00:02:31.250> not<00:02:31.280> linked<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:31.910> any<00:02:32.360> base

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
because we're not linked to any base

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.800 
because we're not linked to any base
stock<00:02:33.410> or<00:02:33.709> base<00:02:33.920> oil<00:02:34.220> supplier<00:02:34.730> or<00:02:35.030> additive

stock or base oil supplier or additive

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.990 
stock or base oil supplier or additive
supplier<00:02:36.200> so<00:02:36.650> what<00:02:36.830> we<00:02:36.980> do<00:02:37.160> is<00:02:37.190> we<00:02:37.490> look<00:02:37.760> around

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
supplier so what we do is we look around

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.479 
supplier so what we do is we look around
the<00:02:38.570> entire<00:02:38.840> world<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.500> we<00:02:39.830> find<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.280> best

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
the entire world and we find the best

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.760 
the entire world and we find the best
technology<00:02:41.209> available<00:02:41.239> anywhere<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.350> then

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
technology available anywhere and then

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.860 
technology available anywhere and then
we'll<00:02:42.980> bring<00:02:43.250> two<00:02:43.550> three<00:02:44.000> four<00:02:44.360> different

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
we'll bring two three four different

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.990 
we'll bring two three four different
types<00:02:45.080> of<00:02:45.260> base<00:02:45.470> stocks<00:02:45.800> together<00:02:46.340> along<00:02:46.970> with

the best additives that we can find and

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.280 
the best additives that we can find and
that's<00:02:49.670> how<00:02:49.850> we<00:02:49.910> make<00:02:50.180> our<00:02:50.390> synthetic<00:02:50.660> fluids

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
that's how we make our synthetic fluids

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.870 
that's how we make our synthetic fluids

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
biggest benefit of a synthetic many

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.539 
biggest benefit of a synthetic many
studies<00:04:12.590> in<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.799> marketplace<00:04:13.340> have

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
studies in the marketplace have

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.729 
studies in the marketplace have
demonstrated<00:04:14.090> fuel<00:04:14.540> economy<00:04:15.019> benefits<00:04:15.170> when

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
demonstrated fuel economy benefits when

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.500 
demonstrated fuel economy benefits when
you<00:04:15.829> use<00:04:16.010> a<00:04:16.039> synthetic<00:04:16.310> and<00:04:16.820> that's<00:04:17.180> because

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
you use a synthetic and that's because

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.449 
you use a synthetic and that's because
it's<00:04:17.690> more<00:04:17.870> slippery<00:04:18.200> I<00:04:18.530> mean<00:04:19.010> if<00:04:19.100> you<00:04:19.160> compare

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
it's more slippery I mean if you compare

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.190 
it's more slippery I mean if you compare
synthetic<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:20.000> petroleum<00:04:20.539> the<00:04:20.750> synthetics

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.920 
deliver as far as fuel economy benefits
in<00:04:31.000> an<00:04:31.150> engine<00:04:31.450> which<00:04:31.690> in<00:04:31.840> today's

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930
