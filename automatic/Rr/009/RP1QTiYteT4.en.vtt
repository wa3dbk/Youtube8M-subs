00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.800
 Today is a New Year's Eve 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.750
 souvenirs 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.340
 if you are also invited ne party 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.480
 you know how it is sometimes then 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.079
 you do not know what to bring yet 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.599
 should 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.939
 and if I have something special right now 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.890
 should be from a normal 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.660
 champagne bottle then that only so the poor 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.739
 I've been thinking about something now 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.610
 and I have to do it for you 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:45.580
 then carefully go up from below 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:48.000
 So you can have a pineapple pineapple here 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.000
 underneath 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.290
 So here below is hidden now 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.409
 a champagne bottle disguised as pineapple 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.150
 with a lot of sweets around 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.089
 so that you first the 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.180
 sweets and then so on 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.640
 slowly to the champagne bottle goes over 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.080
 I have a very sweet idea until a little bit 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.869
 should be difficult to transport one 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:18.609
 then be transported and on the 11th 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:20.979
 if you then hold her up here and 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:21.490
 read that it is bad it is already in 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.670
 game 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.579
 I'll show you this here now 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.780
 actually, it's relatively easy 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.609
 you need a lot of packs so 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.429
 until then after perpetrators are used 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:38.979
 Once there are four to five weeks 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.659
 then packs of those larger bottle 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.200
 you need a home of the 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.200
 thole 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.070
 no six bottle of your choice 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.710
 it might be just fine if it is 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.130
 either gold or green mainly 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.590
 the bottle of course is best 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.350
 look for something not too big 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.270
 is so expensive with the roche 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.460
 The paper should be thicker and thicker 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.350
 bigger than a din a4 sheet because we 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.939
 yes, big ones needed to climb the pineapple 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.890
 and now we'll leave 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.290
 we would need in a 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.870
 color of yellow so that the pineapple still 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.690
 a demarcation has now cuts you 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.860
 then to say so yes the leaves to right 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.470
 I'm just after 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.420
 Querbeet from top to bottom but always 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.360
 that down a piece suddenly broke 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.650
 is and the top is a pointy results 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.230
 should you only once a few 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.470
 elongated ones accept so you ever 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.530
 so wrapping the share of area 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.780
 have for the pineapple and then smaller 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.209
 then you can cross once 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.930
 cut like I do now 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.480
 then in smaller ones so that you too 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.760
 over as and broken still have the then 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.549
 a bit in between, so to speak 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.049
 can be plugged 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.340
 I have only one color for it now 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.630
 I think they use that though 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.250
 of course, too 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.780
 we now need the scissors and 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.710
 then swipe from customer to the sheet 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.290
 along 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.690
 It's going to be so light 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.580
 for strength you can do that in front 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.220
 do a little more or just completely 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.230
 easy it should be left to you 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.710
 of course, that's what it looks like 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.430
 wrong model of practical way 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.820
 results 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.560
 I hope that we start now 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.010
 with the big leaves first the 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.630
 bottle to envelop the bottle 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.390
 now not visible at the top 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.600
 is so sticks with the hot set first 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.770
 times the first leaves said away 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.280
 of course, and sticks 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.430
 so to speak now the next sheet something 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.069
 added 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.019
 only because the first ceiling 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.480
 ever everything and the second should 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.950
 be chosen a bit forward 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.870
 I hope you can see that now completely 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.879
 Well, because I describe that 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.799
 anyway, you see it now 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:04.780
 just just the just over it 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.780
 stick and yes 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.570
 then come the smaller leaves 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.740
 but if you miss the word I was missing 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.540
 explains the smaller leaves for the first time 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.880
 a little bit on the edges so that 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.800
 that is also covered again 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.960
 and then with pure 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.449
 put that you just see that you 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.130
 the communicated difficult falls into it 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:02.009
 that now a bit too 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.539
 hiding is more and also natural 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.699
 White does not just look great 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.560
 leaves there are these little leaves 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.919
 here always unfairly pineapple and cross 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.419
 That's why we do it that way now 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.650
 then a few more on the page 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.820
 because otherwise it looks very unnatural 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.560
 leads that to be different now 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.389
 and that's why you do that now 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.620
 also a little bit more the page 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.960
 Put the leaves a bit 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.610
 rightly he wanted her and then 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.949
 does that continue right away with the 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.139
 Commute if you tell aha there 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:32.729
 I see a little bit up here 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.900
 the bottle just sticks in 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.990
 couple between with pure 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.220
 then everything goes as it were 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.190
 No nonsense 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:44.510
 it is now going to lace that is now 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:48.750
 so this demarcation of the roche to the 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:51.720
 plant so to say and say that is 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.210
 very terrible today sorry for everyone 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.000
 case cuts just makes it easy 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:00.020
 a few times more and then takes 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.280
 more beautiful from the roche the ceiling from the 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.960
 awards that is that is clear 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.940
 Of course , it will look a bit too 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.370
 better, then that's already 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.800
 further than sticking 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:13.710
 that makes him the first time, of course 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.240
 bottom row then it goes on and on 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.729
 then transversely offset I show you 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.999
 now 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:22.849
 here replaces a backside loan and 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:25.539
 then go back one higher 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.539
 operate 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.510
 inwardly it provides stability itself 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.410
 sometimes a broken or broken 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.200
 something falls out 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.730
 unfortunately that happens more often even if you 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.430
 the lid down the little piece 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.020
 subtract the label then you have stop 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.310
 something to snack on and that's what you do again 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.310
 a little more pleased 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:10.430
 now it's time to spread evenly 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:13.310
 Sit in my bed and if you come 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:16.699
 To be finished then he has a great 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:18.680
 sweet party gift idea and yourself 

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:23.289
 have fun while neighbors make my 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.289
 teams then it's good
