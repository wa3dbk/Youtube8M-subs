00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.660
 drivers could not wait to shove 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.489
 me from home is a winner 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:13.369
 great future 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.409
 a serious eight-day innovation 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.329
 baby 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.859
 I once found out that this happened and 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.859
 in another family in quadrant year 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.960
 it met it better than the rest 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.769
 matches the answer was given a start 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.570
 even as a result of an explosion of rivalry 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.310
 e 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.840
 our battle became 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.990
 more sophisticated 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.390
 head of fair healthy 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.780
 life claims who won the race 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.250
 other defendants will not 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.149
 he took his name we pay 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.960
 I chose the ruling 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.050
 for this little 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.040
 all parties in power will pay their 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.040
 performance 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.140
 machine tool 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.089
 all hands up 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.089
 m 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
 I love you my native land 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.860
 the battle between good and evil 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.850
 and the author himself 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.990
 but your brain 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.990
 a red star 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.380
 any questions 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.229
 and we will not say that soon my palm 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.229
 such a loss of risk appetite 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.340
 Yamal does not work and 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.820
 get down to your 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.420
 2 2 and so 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.950
 Turkish media 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.510
 Further 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.120
 I thought for them 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.870
 funds at the station were obtained on October 19 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.330
 that's exactly what I did 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
 because something new 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.090
 so we managed 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.560
 having a bite once if these heaps 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.320
 have you seen what not 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.250
 it is precisely this amount 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.650
 Stalin 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.909
 at the same time he said during the negotiations 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.849
 as well as 3 5 5 in November 2010
