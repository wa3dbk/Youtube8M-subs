00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.059 
and I kind of want to be able to see
something<00:02:17.180> there<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.200> would<00:02:18.500> probably<00:02:18.680> wear

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
something there so I would probably wear

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.940 
something there so I would probably wear
maybe<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.879> higher<00:02:20.480> neckline<00:02:20.870> but<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.680> thought

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
maybe a higher neckline but I thought

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.350 
maybe a higher neckline but I thought
we'll<00:02:22.549> put<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:22.910> necklace<00:02:23.090> there<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:24.680> kind<00:02:24.950> of

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
we'll put the necklace there to kind of

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.699 
we'll put the necklace there to kind of
give<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.390> something<00:02:27.019> because<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.349> was<00:02:27.470> just

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
give it something because it was just

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.550 
give it something because it was just
bare<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.849> was<00:02:29.209> stupid<00:02:29.690> so<00:02:31.780> yes<00:02:32.780> that's<00:02:33.140> kind<00:02:33.470> of

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
bare it was stupid so yes that's kind of

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.030 
bare it was stupid so yes that's kind of
my<00:02:33.709> look<00:02:33.950> for<00:02:34.010> today<00:02:34.549> but<00:02:35.060> I'd<00:02:35.239> get<00:02:35.510> all
