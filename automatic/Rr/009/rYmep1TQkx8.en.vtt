00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.939
 Hello everyone and free to suffer 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.069
 self 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:33.069
 bat 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.930
 now we explain the basic rules of texas hold'em 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.210
 which is an instant form of little faith in the United States 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.490
 played with internal bat sees from 52 cards 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.270
 without jokers the text or otherwise card is distributed to the table 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.910
 there is no change for this your strange character distributed every 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.750
 Player of the year to be filled with those who are on the table maybe weight 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.520
 let's take an example 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.190
 in this case the usual il would be alicamenti maziere what 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.620
 distributes the cards 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.980
 the game takes place in a clockwise direction as normal power and there will also be smog 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.560
 line of the diclaimer therefore small darkness the big blind that are of the episodes 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.540
 compulsory 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.570
 what good is the dish of tactics first, otherwise not not 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.020
 would make sense. play s 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.340
 there was no way to 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.860
 drontal plate even before taking the cards we say cost to replace a 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.290
 bit the cp selling flat of traditional poker 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.290
 so let's see then the cards in a clockwise direction 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.390
 I become one at a time 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.640
 after which you can start betting rounds 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.100
 it obviously began from the player to the right of the big blind in this 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.560
 In the case of simulation, I pretended that we have three players then 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.790
 the same player starts with the cards then the first after the diploma 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.750
 of great darkness in this case I have the possibility of leaving the hand 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.190
 Funds cover the amount of the big bang or make a balance sheet after which it is 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.890
 obviously the action will go around until we all have our say 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.519
 option and optionally allowed asexual if you betray xd 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.269
 on the plate after which it is started with the dead the flight of the consist in the cards 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.529
 that are on the table and a broken regulation lens in the cement is being discarded 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:24.539
 a card 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:27.549
 books that will put 3 on the table then one 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.260
 now they will begin to mind with a round of betting with the difference, however, that 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.089
 after the support the betting round does not start very good player 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:44.760
 next to the vin blanc but started from first player to kindergarten in saying 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.830
 that always plays clockwise 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.900
 so use it to decide if there is a sort of cip 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:56.429
 if you bet or eventually face the bet yes 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:03:01.039
 will still be able to make a shot to make a budget would like 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:05.389
 spupazzare chris would consist of photos so after doing this round of 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.689
 bets you pass the fourth card always burns one 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.759
 here is the fourth card 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:15.519
 president gets a little distant however the stamp is made from the left 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.639
 to the right the same thing 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.300
 it is played clockwise 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.170
 blind back foda according to the beginning of the players from what they animate a 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.559
 maybe en place d'italy of the lighthouse - same thing in the end 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:29.399
 sisi red river 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:32.130
 last round of betting with the same rules 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.570
 after which if it is activated in the end then what does this mean that it is not 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.750
 obligatory to go to play cards comanchero normal cover 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.390
 someone makes a tip of the customs covered by nobody this means that 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.880
 he will go flat diesel 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.260
 could have any way it could be inverting the room. not it 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.630
 I'll never know why he can safely throw the cards in the center 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.630
 being the last being the pot takes the money I'm in the process 

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:57.500
 having said that let's take the case where 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.029
 we are all going to cover the final card production episode 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:04.159
 let's see here 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.159
 we have a double pair that combines 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.369
 a women catch 1 10 watts formed a hand buy the 5-card set in 

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:17.329
 this case we see bass re 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.099
 assessor will combine differently in this seems to combine with 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:26.949
 a k within the 10 pandas forms a double pair because this obviously does not give 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.590
 mas drink select the 5 - give us the best hand in that case yours 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.330
 obviously we have the possibility of verona a dowry of woman and to say 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.129
 in order to overcome what was already available on the 10p de copies available 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.020
 donated more rain than the one the board will offer you in this case we see 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.310
 what we have born to run to subjects on the scale 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.050
 immediately we say from floppy notes of the clash that can happen in 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.660
 reply 2 double and against a scale that I suffer I tell you clash in the sense that 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.349
 not that there was very frequently but 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.300
 we are that from time to time something like this may happen, said this to 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.849
 end we see you a little khyentse to judge flat photo suite will improve 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.830
 all your hands are there for teeth but I can do nothing but throw them away 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.729
 cards 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.460
 wait for the next round
