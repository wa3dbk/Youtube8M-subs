understand this on a very deep level we

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.850 
understand this on a very deep level we
put<00:01:03.489> this<00:01:03.640> also<00:01:04.089> in<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.360> context<00:01:05.199> of<00:01:05.350> a<00:01:05.469> visit

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
put this also in the context of a visit

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.910 
put this also in the context of a visit
by<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:06.100> Dalai<00:01:06.490> Lama<00:01:06.850> and<00:01:07.240> he<00:01:07.689> had<00:01:08.049> been<00:01:08.799> at

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
by the Dalai Lama and he had been at

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.389 
by the Dalai Lama and he had been at
Stanford<00:01:09.429> in<00:01:09.549> October<00:01:10.030> of<00:01:10.060> 2005<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:11.350> if<00:01:11.799> you

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
Stanford in October of 2005 and if you

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:13.739 
Stanford in October of 2005 and if you
know<00:01:12.490> anything<00:01:12.609> about<00:01:12.729> the<00:01:12.909> Dalai<00:01:13.090> Lama<00:01:13.420> one

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:13.749 
know anything about the Dalai Lama one

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:15.870 
know anything about the Dalai Lama one
of<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:13.899> things<00:01:14.079> you<00:01:14.200> know<00:01:14.229> not<00:01:14.530> only<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:15.069> his

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
of the things you know not only is his

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.039 
of the things you know not only is his
life<00:01:16.209> centered<00:01:16.840> around<00:01:16.959> the<00:01:17.789> promotion<00:01:18.789> of

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
life centered around the promotion of

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.190 
life centered around the promotion of
compassion<00:01:20.049> and<00:01:21.329> universal<00:01:22.329> ethics<00:01:22.779> and

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
compassion and universal ethics and

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.529 
compassion and universal ethics and
morals<00:01:23.590> if<00:01:23.770> you<00:01:23.920> will<00:01:24.100> but<00:01:24.999> he<00:01:25.119> has<00:01:25.329> had<00:01:25.509> a

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
morals if you will but he has had a

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.779 
morals if you will but he has had a
long-standing<00:01:25.810> interest<00:01:26.529> in<00:01:26.979> neuroscience

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
long-standing interest in neuroscience

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.480 
long-standing interest in neuroscience
and<00:01:27.999> how<00:01:28.359> the<00:01:28.420> brain<00:01:28.719> works<00:01:28.779> why<00:01:29.709> bother<00:01:30.069> with

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
and how the brain works why bother with

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.129 
and how the brain works why bother with
contemplatives<00:01:31.240> I<00:01:31.450> mean<00:01:31.749> this<00:01:31.959> is<00:01:32.109> just

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:32.139 
contemplatives I mean this is just

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:34.919 
contemplatives I mean this is just
neuroscience<00:01:32.950> after<00:01:33.279> all<00:01:33.429> well<00:01:33.789> it<00:01:34.209> is<00:01:34.359> we<00:01:34.810> do

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
neuroscience after all well it is we do

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:36.359 
neuroscience after all well it is we do
a<00:01:34.959> different<00:01:35.229> kind<00:01:35.529> of<00:01:35.560> neuroscience<00:01:36.219> than

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
a different kind of neuroscience than

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.629 
a different kind of neuroscience than
they<00:01:36.490> do<00:01:36.749> contemplative<00:01:37.749> traditions<00:01:38.639> allow

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:39.639 
they do contemplative traditions allow

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:43.099 
they do contemplative traditions allow
one<00:01:39.999> to<00:01:40.270> think<00:01:41.020> about<00:01:41.409> what<00:01:41.560> they<00:01:41.709> think<00:01:41.740> about

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
one to think about what they think about

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:46.159 
one to think about what they think about
its<00:01:44.109> first<00:01:44.380> person<00:01:44.740> observation<00:01:45.399> it's

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:46.169 
its first person observation it's

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:48.449 
its first person observation it's
thinking<00:01:47.169> about<00:01:47.529> what<00:01:47.709> you<00:01:47.740> think<00:01:48.130> about

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
thinking about what you think about

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.370 
thinking about what you think about
that's<00:01:48.609> what<00:01:48.789> contemplatively<00:01:49.240> do<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.289> very

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
that's what contemplatively do it very

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.809 
that's what contemplatively do it very
well<00:01:50.499> on<00:01:50.799> the<00:01:50.889> training<00:01:51.429> training<00:01:51.700> training

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
well on the training training training

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.099 
well on the training training training
they're<00:01:52.119> practicing<00:01:52.509> practicing<00:01:52.659> pretty

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 
they're practicing practicing pretty

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:55.190 
they're practicing practicing pretty
soon<00:01:53.319> they're<00:01:54.009> very<00:01:54.399> good<00:01:54.609> at<00:01:54.700> controlling

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
their thought processes and that evokes

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.050 
their thought processes and that evokes

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
this correctly and it comes out as we

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.850 
this correctly and it comes out as we
have<00:02:57.150> impressions<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:57.960> it<00:02:58.110> probably<00:02:58.380> will

but this is a very cool thing to try to
do<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.570> quite<00:03:15.840> frankly<00:03:16.910> this<00:03:17.910> resonates<00:03:18.570> with

in a way that a lot of other topics

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.390 
in a way that a lot of other topics
don't<00:03:22.290> people<00:03:22.680> want<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.190> know<00:03:23.220> about

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
don't people want to know about

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.920 
don't people want to know about
compassion<00:03:24.470> really<00:03:25.470> really<00:03:26.430> good<00:03:27.120> people<00:03:27.510> and

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
compassion really really good people and

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.620 
compassion really really good people and
really<00:03:28.709> really<00:03:29.160> troubled<00:03:29.550> people<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.150> really

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
really really troubled people and really

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.120 
really really troubled people and really

people<00:03:32.550> all<00:03:32.790> want<00:03:33.360> to<00:03:33.450> know<00:03:33.540> about<00:03:33.630> compassion

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
people all want to know about compassion

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.949 
people all want to know about compassion
and<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:35.459> I<00:03:35.490> think<00:03:35.670> we've<00:03:35.940> hit<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:36.090> nerve<00:03:36.300> so<00:03:36.900> to

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
and so I think we've hit a nerve so to

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.660 
and so I think we've hit a nerve so to
speak<00:03:37.140> and<00:03:37.380> we're<00:03:37.920> going<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.070> play<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:38.310> out

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
speak and we're going to play that out

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.580 
speak and we're going to play that out
we're<00:03:38.940> going<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.090> see<00:03:39.270> what<00:03:39.390> we<00:03:39.480> can<00:03:39.600> do<00:03:39.810> to

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
we're going to see what we can do to

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.530 
we're going to see what we can do to
really<00:03:40.770> understand<00:03:41.400> who<00:03:41.730> we<00:03:41.760> are<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.360> what

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
really understand who we are and what

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.590 
really understand who we are and what
