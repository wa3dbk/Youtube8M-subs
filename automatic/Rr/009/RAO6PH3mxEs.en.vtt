beat<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.159> with<00:01:32.189> his<00:01:32.340> arm<00:01:32.579> like<00:01:32.820> he<00:01:32.909> did

against<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> falcons<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.079> he<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.290> run

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
against the falcons and then he can run

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.380 
against the falcons and then he can run
all<00:01:34.710> over<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.250> like<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.790> did<00:01:35.939> against<00:01:36.150> Green

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
all over you like you did against Green

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
Bay and the Baltimore Ravens certainly

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.560 
Bay and the Baltimore Ravens certainly
have<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> great<00:01:38.369> defense<00:01:38.549> but<00:01:39.180> they<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.450> to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
have a great defense but they have to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.270 
have a great defense but they have to
account<00:01:39.810> for<00:01:39.930> his<00:01:40.170> running<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.680> his<00:01:40.950> throwing

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
account for his running and his throwing

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.249 
account for his running and his throwing
and<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.000> know<00:01:42.060> Flacco's<00:01:42.570> experience<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.140> know

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
and I know Flacco's experience I know

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.440 
and I know Flacco's experience I know
Flacco's<00:01:43.649> been<00:01:43.829> there<00:01:44.009> before<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.640> there's<00:01:45.390> a

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
Flacco's been there before but there's a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.359 
Flacco's been there before but there's a
lot<00:01:45.689> o<00:01:45.720> out<00:01:46.049> there<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.470> how<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> stop<00:01:47.009> Flacco

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
lot o out there on how to stop Flacco

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.219 
lot o out there on how to stop Flacco
you<00:01:47.640> know<00:01:47.729> he<00:01:47.880> not<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.600> accurate<00:01:48.810> because<00:01:49.079> he

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
you know he not that accurate because he

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.899 
you know he not that accurate because he
throws<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.560> ball<00:01:49.649> downfield<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.399> often<00:01:50.759> for

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
throws the ball downfield so often for

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.460 
throws the ball downfield so often for
able<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.360> take<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.540> away<00:01:51.780> from<00:01:51.899> him<00:01:52.259> you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
able to take that away from him you

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.260 
able to take that away from him you
could<00:01:52.740> really<00:01:52.890> get<00:01:53.130> after<00:01:53.340> Flacco<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:54.030> think

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
could really get after Flacco I think

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.310 
could really get after Flacco I think
there's<00:01:54.420> still<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.600> lot<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.720> question<00:01:55.110> how<00:01:55.259> you

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
there's still a lot of question how you

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.560 
there's still a lot of question how you
really<00:01:55.740> stop<00:01:56.310> hampering<00:01:56.729> Atlanta<00:01:57.210> stop<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
really stop hampering Atlanta stop the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.910 
really stop hampering Atlanta stop the
option<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.079> then<00:01:58.259> he<00:01:58.380> beat<00:01:58.530> them<00:01:58.680> through<00:01:58.829> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
option and then he beat them through the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.350 
option and then he beat them through the
air<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.430> know<00:01:59.520> it's<00:01:59.670> interesting<00:01:59.820> i<00:02:00.240> right

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
air you know it's interesting i right

there with all the talk about what

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.690 
there with all the talk about what
Flacco's<00:02:01.920> done<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.280> postseason

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
Flacco's done in the postseason

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.880 
Flacco's done in the postseason
especially<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.329> last<00:02:03.479> three<00:02:03.689> weeks<00:02:03.719> week<00:02:04.590> 14

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
especially the last three weeks week 14

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.160 
especially the last three weeks week 14
15<00:02:05.460> 16<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.909> NFL<00:02:05.939> season<00:02:06.390> people<00:02:06.750> were<00:02:06.930> saying

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
15 16 the NFL season people were saying

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.050 
15 16 the NFL season people were saying
let<00:02:07.649> him<00:02:07.770> go<00:02:07.920> don't<00:02:08.129> even<00:02:08.369> resign<00:02:08.759> him<00:02:08.940> he'll

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
let him go don't even resign him he'll

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.550 
let him go don't even resign him he'll
be<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.209> free

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
be a free

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.110 
be a free
after<00:02:09.860> this<00:02:09.950> season<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:10.550> I<00:02:10.640> think<00:02:10.880> there<00:02:11.030> was

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
after this season and I think there was

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.150 
after this season and I think there was
a<00:02:11.150> major<00:02:11.390> turning<00:02:11.510> point<00:02:12.080> in<00:02:12.200> week<00:02:12.410> 15<00:02:12.650> when

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
a major turning point in week 15 when

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.800 
a major turning point in week 15 when
they<00:02:13.250> got<00:02:13.430> embarrassed<00:02:13.790> by<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.150> Broncos<00:02:14.630> that

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
they got embarrassed by the Broncos that

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.330 
they got embarrassed by the Broncos that
was<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.020> last<00:02:15.170> time<00:02:15.380> Flacco<00:02:15.709> turned<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.190> ball

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
was the last time Flacco turned the ball

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.190 
was the last time Flacco turned the ball
over<00:02:16.400> that's<00:02:17.330> what's<00:02:17.540> been<00:02:17.690> most<00:02:17.780> impressive

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
over that's what's been most impressive

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.559 
over that's what's been most impressive
to<00:02:18.380> me<00:02:18.500> he<00:02:18.620> is<00:02:18.709> being<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:19.040> lot<00:02:19.280> more<00:02:19.520> secure<00:02:20.390> with

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
to me he is being a lot more secure with

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.699 
to me he is being a lot more secure with
the<00:02:20.690> football<00:02:20.900> he's<00:02:21.140> making<00:02:21.470> better

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
the football he's making better

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.320 
the football he's making better
decisions<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.489> I<00:02:22.610> think<00:02:22.819> he's<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:22.970> lot<00:02:23.180> more

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
decisions and I think he's a lot more

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.030 
decisions and I think he's a lot more
comfortable<00:02:23.540> in<00:02:23.870> Jim<00:02:24.020> Caldwell's<00:02:24.500> offense<00:02:24.920> we

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
comfortable in Jim Caldwell's offense we

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.410 
comfortable in Jim Caldwell's offense we
can<00:02:25.190> talk<00:02:25.340> about<00:02:25.550> how<00:02:25.610> Colin<00:02:25.880> Kaepernick<00:02:26.300> can

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
can talk about how Colin Kaepernick can

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.580 
can talk about how Colin Kaepernick can
run<00:02:26.569> all<00:02:26.599> over<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.959> place<00:02:27.110> we<00:02:27.290> know<00:02:27.410> Joe

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
run all over the place we know Joe

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.170 
run all over the place we know Joe
Flacco's<00:02:28.010> not<00:02:28.160> going<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:28.400> do<00:02:28.489> that<00:02:28.519> I<00:02:28.940> don't

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
Flacco's not going to do that I don't

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.430 
Flacco's not going to do that I don't
trust<00:02:29.330> Colin<00:02:29.720> Kaepernick<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.170> run<00:02:30.319> the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
trust Colin Kaepernick to run the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.930 
trust Colin Kaepernick to run the
no-huddle<00:02:30.709> offense<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.280> way<00:02:31.400> Flacco<00:02:31.640> has

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
no-huddle offense the way Flacco has

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.610 
no-huddle offense the way Flacco has
lately<00:02:32.209> so<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.510> think<00:02:32.720> that's<00:02:32.900> something<00:02:33.080> he's

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
lately so I think that's something he's

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.930 
lately so I think that's something he's
going<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.890> have<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.130> ability<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.519> throw<00:02:34.819> at

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
going to have the ability to throw at

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.820 
going to have the ability to throw at
the<00:02:35.000> 49ers<00:02:35.630> that<00:02:35.840> maybe<00:02:36.290> they'll<00:02:36.500> have<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.680> hard

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
the 49ers that maybe they'll have a hard

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.440 
the 49ers that maybe they'll have a hard
time<00:02:37.069> counting<00:02:37.310> but<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:37.819> just<00:02:38.090> think<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.360> way

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
time counting but I just think the way

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.580 
time counting but I just think the way
you<00:02:38.480> protects<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.930> football<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.349> look<00:02:39.470> at

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
you protects the football you look at

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.620 
you protects the football you look at
Kaepernick<00:02:40.010> had<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:40.640> pick<00:02:40.849> six<00:02:41.120> before<00:02:41.300> he<00:02:41.510> got

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
Kaepernick had to pick six before he got

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.270 
Kaepernick had to pick six before he got
his<00:02:41.780> bearings<00:02:42.140> against<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.440> Packers<00:02:42.830> he

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
his bearings against the Packers he

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.559 
his bearings against the Packers he
almost<00:02:43.400> had<00:02:43.640> another<00:02:43.730> against<00:02:44.180> Corey<00:02:44.360> Peters

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
almost had another against Corey Peters

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.610 
football I'm not sold yet on this kid
from<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.180> pocket<00:03:11.540> yeah<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:11.870> know<00:03:12.049> I<00:03:12.080> think

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
from the pocket yeah you know I think

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.380 
from the pocket yeah you know I think
that's<00:03:12.769> is<00:03:12.950> his<00:03:13.430> biggest<00:03:13.640> concern<00:03:13.820> you<00:03:14.239> look

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
that's is his biggest concern you look

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.180 
that's is his biggest concern you look
back<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.870> game<00:03:14.989> against<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.380> rams<00:03:15.620> in<00:03:16.100> the

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
back to the game against the rams in the

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.470 
back to the game against the rams in the
season<00:03:16.489> when<00:03:16.579> they<00:03:16.670> lost<00:03:16.700> that<00:03:17.150> game<00:03:17.329> I<00:03:17.450> think

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
season when they lost that game I think

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.539 
season when they lost that game I think
that's<00:03:17.750> one<00:03:17.959> real<00:03:18.470> red<00:03:18.739> flag<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:19.310> Colin

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
that's one real red flag and Colin

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:20.740 
that's one real red flag and Colin

against<00:03:22.820> seattle<00:03:23.209> that<00:03:23.269> he<00:03:23.329> can<00:03:23.630> be<00:03:23.810> stopped

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109
