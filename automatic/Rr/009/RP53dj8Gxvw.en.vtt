if you were to eat your cheeseburger
upside<00:00:28.850> down<00:00:29.830> not<00:00:30.830> like<00:00:30.980> that<00:00:31.160> not<00:00:31.369> like<00:00:31.520> that

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
upside down not like that not like that

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.410 
upside down not like that not like that
easier<00:00:32.449> than<00:00:32.599> that<00:00:34.000> take<00:00:35.000> a<00:00:35.030> burger<00:00:36.280> and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
easier than that take a burger and

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.700 
easier than that take a burger and
instead<00:00:38.420> of<00:00:38.510> eating<00:00:38.660> it<00:00:38.840> right<00:00:38.989> side<00:00:39.230> up<00:00:39.290> just

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
instead of eating it right side up just

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.990 
instead of eating it right side up just
flip<00:00:40.190> it<00:00:41.800> so<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:42.890> bottom<00:00:43.070> bun<00:00:43.340> is<00:00:43.460> on<00:00:43.580> top<00:00:43.790> and

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
flip it so the bottom bun is on top and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.080 
flip it so the bottom bun is on top and
top<00:00:44.269> bun<00:00:44.480> is<00:00:44.600> on<00:00:44.750> bottom<00:00:45.670> how<00:00:46.670> good<00:00:46.880> would<00:00:47.030> that

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
top bun is on bottom how good would that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:56.280 
top bun is on bottom how good would that

you're now getting the cheese on top
when<00:01:15.890> you're<00:01:16.040> used<00:01:16.190> to<00:01:16.310> getting<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:16.580> cheese

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
top is you know that flat smooth thing

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.620 
top is you know that flat smooth thing
and<00:01:24.400> the<00:01:25.400> bottom<00:01:25.760> bun<00:01:25.940> is<00:01:26.210> acting<00:01:26.510> a<00:01:26.540> little

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
and the bottom bun is acting a little

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.749 
and the bottom bun is acting a little
bit<00:01:26.780> rough<00:01:29.470> and<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:30.979> make<00:01:31.130> matters<00:01:31.160> even<00:01:31.610> more

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
bit rough and to make matters even more

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.210 
bit rough and to make matters even more
interesting<00:01:32.150> was<00:01:33.050> actually<00:01:33.350> no<00:01:33.500> sauce<00:01:33.800> on<00:01:34.160> the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
interesting was actually no sauce on the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.609 
interesting was actually no sauce on the
top<00:01:34.250> on<00:01:34.759> what's<00:01:35.660> now<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:35.900> top<00:01:36.259> part<00:01:36.500> of<00:01:36.560> the

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
top on what's now the top part of the

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.380 
top on what's now the top part of the
bun<00:01:36.830> so<00:01:37.460> when<00:01:37.550> you<00:01:37.610> have<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.850> burger<00:01:38.090> upside

if<00:01:50.900> you<00:01:50.960> flip<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.259> around<00:01:51.380> you're<00:01:51.830> getting<00:01:52.040> all

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
if you flip it around you're getting all

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.320 
if you flip it around you're getting all

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
the taste in inverted order and even

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.820 
the taste in inverted order and even
though<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.569> seems<00:01:59.810> they<00:01:59.960> arrange<00:02:00.289> sandwiches

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830

in<00:02:00.950> a<00:02:01.009> very<00:02:01.190> haphazard<00:02:02.000> random<00:02:02.450> doesn't<00:02:02.869> even

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
in a very haphazard random doesn't even

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.919 
in a very haphazard random doesn't even
matter<00:02:03.259> away<00:02:04.000> from<00:02:05.000> experience<00:02:05.479> it<00:02:05.569> turns<00:02:05.750> out

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
matter away from experience it turns out

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.719 
matter away from experience it turns out
that<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.500> order<00:02:06.860> that<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.069> put<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.280> sandwich

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
that the order that you put a sandwich

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.279 
that the order that you put a sandwich
together<00:02:07.910> makes<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.569> Big<00:02:09.020> Damn<00:02:09.050> difference

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
together makes a Big Damn difference

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.680 
together makes a Big Damn difference
when<00:02:09.860> you're<00:02:09.979> actually<00:02:10.069> tasting<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.729> it

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
when you're actually tasting it it

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.300 
when you're actually tasting it it
definitely<00:02:12.050> has<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.290> McDonald's<00:02:12.830> taste<00:02:13.069> to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
definitely has the McDonald's taste to

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.570 
definitely has the McDonald's taste to
it<00:02:13.660> but<00:02:14.660> any<00:02:14.840> upside<00:02:15.260> down<00:02:15.470> gives<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.460> new

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
it but any upside down gives it a new

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.600 
it but any upside down gives it a new
spin<00:02:17.620> it's<00:02:18.620> like<00:02:18.890> eating<00:02:19.190> something

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
spin it's like eating something

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.449 
spin it's like eating something
recognizable<00:02:19.940> but<00:02:20.860> it's<00:02:21.860> not<00:02:22.100> quite<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.370> same

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
recognizable but it's not quite the same
