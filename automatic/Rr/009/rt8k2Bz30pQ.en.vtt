world and they they often have this

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.210 
world and they they often have this
amazingly<00:01:05.890> simple<00:01:06.890> question<00:01:07.580> about<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:09.220> you

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
amazingly simple question about the you

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.060 
amazingly simple question about the you
know<00:01:10.540> about<00:01:11.540> Santa<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.230> Christmas<00:01:12.740> Eve

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
how can he go all around the world but I

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.060 
how can he go all around the world but I
think<00:01:16.909> it's<00:01:17.360> a<00:01:17.600> rather<00:01:18.260> simple<00:01:18.680> question

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
think it's a rather simple question

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.110 
think it's a rather simple question
because<00:01:19.370> it's<00:01:20.920> well<00:01:21.920> it's<00:01:22.280> very<00:01:22.430> simple<00:01:22.550> all

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
because it's well it's very simple all

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.670 
because it's well it's very simple all
or<00:01:24.460> it's<00:01:25.460> not<00:01:25.700> depends<00:01:26.630> for<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:27.020> are<00:01:27.350> you<00:01:27.530> an

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
or it's not depends for you are you an

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.819 
or it's not depends for you are you an
elf<00:01:28.250> or<00:01:28.909> not<00:01:29.180> but<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:32.270> about<00:01:32.810> this<00:01:32.990> simple

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
elf or not but so about this simple

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.280 
elf or not but so about this simple
question<00:01:34.159> about<00:01:34.399> Santa<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:35.210> Christmas<00:01:35.869> Eve

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290

there's lots of treasures all around the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.170 
there's lots of treasures all around the
world<00:01:38.840> for<00:01:39.170> example<00:01:39.890> here<00:01:39.920> in<00:01:40.219> Finland<00:01:40.670> we

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
world for example here in Finland we

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.840 
world for example here in Finland we
sent<00:01:41.719> that<00:01:41.780> center<00:01:42.200> gives<00:01:42.409> us<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:43.040> presents

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
sent that center gives us the presents

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.679 
sent that center gives us the presents
in<00:01:44.229> Christmas<00:01:45.229> Eve<00:01:45.409> and<00:01:45.939> for<00:01:46.939> example<00:01:47.420> in

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
in Christmas Eve and for example in

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.459 
in Christmas Eve and for example in
Russia<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:49.250> presence<00:01:49.820> they<00:01:49.969> come<00:01:50.149> in<00:01:50.469> you

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
Russia the presence they come in you

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.060 
Russia the presence they come in you
know<00:01:51.759> look<00:01:52.759> beyond<00:01:53.119> that<00:01:53.630> that's<00:01:54.049> in<00:01:54.619> January

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
know look beyond that that's in January

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.480 
know look beyond that that's in January
so<00:01:55.369> it<00:01:55.520> it's<00:01:56.060> long<00:01:56.390> time<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.049> for<00:01:57.890> example<00:01:57.979> in

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
so it it's long time and for example in

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.450 
so it it's long time and for example in
England<00:01:59.299> you<00:01:59.960> get<00:02:00.140> keeps<00:02:00.409> in<00:02:00.799> in<00:02:01.189> the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
England you get keeps in in the

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.039 
England you get keeps in in the
Christmas<00:02:02.210> Day<00:02:02.950> but<00:02:03.950> there's<00:02:04.520> also<00:02:04.880> these<00:02:05.719> you

know time zones in earth the the ball

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.450 
know time zones in earth the the ball
you<00:02:10.430> know<00:02:10.610> earth<00:02:11.450> is<00:02:11.750> its<00:02:12.220> there's<00:02:13.220> like

this is all day time but also we have
this<00:02:31.550> amazing<00:02:32.510> time<00:02:33.580> adjustment<00:02:34.580> machine

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
this amazing time adjustment machine

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.869 
this amazing time adjustment machine
which<00:02:36.410> is<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.740> is<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:36.920> very<00:02:37.190> simple<00:02:37.310> actually

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
which is it is a very simple actually

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.440 
which is it is a very simple actually
just<00:02:39.940> like<00:02:40.940> that

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
just like that

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.940 
just like that
I<00:02:41.810> got<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.410> is<00:02:42.590> easy<00:02:42.770> so<00:02:43.069> you<00:02:43.280> can<00:02:43.580> like<00:02:44.239> oh<00:02:44.950> is

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
I got it is easy so you can like oh is

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.440 
I got it is easy so you can like oh is
it<00:02:46.430> slows<00:02:47.209> down<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.980> rotational<00:02:49.670> movement<00:02:50.239> of

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
it slows down the rotational movement of

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.559 
it slows down the rotational movement of
Earth<00:02:50.900> I<00:02:51.200> think<00:02:52.040> it's<00:02:52.640> better<00:02:52.790> for<00:02:53.030> me<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.180> show

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
Earth I think it's better for me to show

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.540 
Earth I think it's better for me to show
you<00:02:53.629> I<00:02:53.959> can<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:54.950> could<00:02:55.160> just<00:02:55.629> change<00:02:56.629> here<00:02:57.550> like

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
you I can I could just change here like

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.300 
you I can I could just change here like
this<00:02:58.819> and<00:02:59.030> then<00:03:00.019> you<00:03:00.050> can<00:03:00.620> see<00:03:00.800> there<00:03:01.190> is<00:03:01.280> the

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
this and then you can see there is the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.860 
this and then you can see there is the
the<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.390> large<00:03:03.620> will<00:03:03.970> it'll<00:03:04.970> it's<00:03:05.660> like

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
the the large will it'll it's like

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.370 
the the large will it'll it's like
more<00:03:06.410> more<00:03:06.920> like<00:03:07.610> big<00:03:08.120> adjustments<00:03:08.420> with<00:03:09.170> with

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
more more like big adjustments with with

more more like big adjustments with with
a<00:03:09.410> big<00:03:09.620> wheel<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.069> then<00:03:10.819> then<00:03:11.120> they<00:03:11.269> like<00:03:12.110> the

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
a big wheel and then then they like the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.300 
a big wheel and then then they like the
small<00:03:12.860> will<00:03:13.340> then<00:03:14.299> this<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:15.349> know<00:03:15.500> in<00:03:15.950> in

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
small will then this you know in in
