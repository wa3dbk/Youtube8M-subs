00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.819
 and here I am with connie and the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.280
 group was armed the group for the taste and 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.889
 the same as how are you going to get 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.009
 a little group to go to take libero classes 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.039
 and this is impressive if the beauty of 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.410
 this will be the result or you do not achieve 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.330
 letting the paintings act on 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.939
 silk until it dries by itself not 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.189
 speed it up with a hair dryer that's 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.650
 the secret also what I wanted 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.320
 really to see in the amount of 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.160
 effects that can be done is not without 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.130
 number 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.280
 look at this, look, it's another effect 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.620
 different 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.649
 another effect 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.879
 all different this is what we are going to 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:48.219
 do if in the study of lidia we're going 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.989
 all specific techniques for 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.530
 just this after using it 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.360
 about what about objects about 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.879
 clothing accessories or you 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:03.159
 You can suddenly line this clogs all 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.100
 the issue of the failure of the clothing of 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.860
 the fashion but another thing more we see this 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.720
 well but not in a blouse one in a 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.100
 skirt whatever if I take a blouse 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.950
 white anyone suppose of these 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:19.690
 talks or in a little bit without intervening 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.009
 It is to have your precautions to avoid 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.409
 shock the front part with the 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.149
 delay but that is achieved can be done 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.920
 quietly with a planchita is not 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.289
 fashion is a technique that will 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.659
 follow the will be in this year several 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.520
 times because people make it easy there's no 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.470
 apart it's because the trend forces you 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:41.039
 to do it because everyone makes me 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.039
 I do not want step by step 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.170
 what we must first do to 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.829
 perform the technique of the sÃ­vori is to wash 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.630
 the fabric whether natural or artificial in 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:12.280
 this case I am working with a silk 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.819
 we dry and then we sew with a basting the 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.299
 half silk 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.579
 is well cooked simply is for 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:22.049
 mark if with any type of thread and 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.109
 with a needle that does not look very thick 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.090
 as to harm then we have to make another 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:30.389
 type of stitching that's why it's the subject of 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.879
 Yes, I do not use any 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:36.109
 simply mean what you are going to do 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.849
 is to reserve your fund with different 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:42.889
 various pleated pleated techniques 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:47.700
 cooked if it is generate as a small 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:51.599
 cordoncito if in the middle and return to 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.829
 sew with one with one with the needle and 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.810
 thread all around this cord gone and 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.340
 back so we will not do 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.060
 out but we will not be able to demonstrate 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.359
 everything in such a way that I keep this one 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.409
 lace cited well cooked 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.409
 if well puckered 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.170
 once we have it cooked what 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.800
 let's do is with water moisten the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.410
 silk 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.410
 with water all the silk 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.840
 this is simply so that the colors 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.390
 that I then apply them to go in a 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.590
 way spreading spreading throughout 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.350
 of all the cloth 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:46.540
 where is the cord 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:48.870
 and where are we going to apply the tones with the 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.870
 dropper 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.870
 in pure 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.870
 in pure 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.140
 I can work even with another tone 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.590
 in this case it is a color the azurro and 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.790
 now I go and apply a bit of the band 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:11.769
 as to create different effects 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:15.709
 notice how the tones are going 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:18.650
 opening and then simply with a 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.250
 synthetic brush and help with the help of a 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.670
 little bit of water what I'm going to do is 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:29.550
 drag the tone out 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:32.880
 the cutest thing is to generate wrinkles 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.700
 this is important because all of that is going 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.310
 to generate texture later also 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.050
 We are working on an iron 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.100
 I strategize because it will allow me 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.060
 the texture itself of this material 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.930
 copy it 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:52.710
 On the fabric, see how it opens 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.520
 the more arrogant you are the better in this 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.129
 sector will create 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.729
 this effect 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:03.800
 and this effect where it is sewn and 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.989
 then katz is opened according to ccoo 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.009
 that you use it the results are going to 

00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:09.110
 be different but you're always going to 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.449
 get a result on this too 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.479
 I can explain sales if in this case I 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:18.139
 liked this kind of designs because it simulates 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:20.029
 the sheet and it occurred to me how is one of 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.639
 the designs that are say of 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:25.249
 trend in if you can apply 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.550
 perfectly look at you that is simple 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:31.550
 without nothing only sew different types 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.759
 of different leaves locations on a 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.759
 cloth 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:55.349
 and in the closing that is already ready I already 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:58.770
 I did it suppose since you do what you left 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:00.720
 well I do not touch it anything not did not accelerate it 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.290
 with the hair dryer once it is 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.910
 dry is plancho reverse sew 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.370
 and there and there is the surprise because 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.680
 well you never know what the 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.810
 result but always of course 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.790
 there are wonders so with and I 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.380

 that on youtube they will see everything also 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.900
 take advantage and we are 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:28.240
 preparing each time against machines 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:29.920
 thanks thanks to a great plant 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.690
