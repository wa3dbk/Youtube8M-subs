00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello youtube friends we are truck and 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.000
 we come to present a tutorial about 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.210
 how to install a nintendo emulator 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.070
 ds for our iphone ipad or ipod without 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.070
 need to jailbreak 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.300
 so much 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.090
 We are here on the iphone to show you 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.690
 the first thing we should do is go to 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.310
 safari 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.730
 and search 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.900
 a page is called n of s 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.029
 4 the number 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.029
 and I point you 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.190
 wings 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.190
 net point 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.030
 the description although good you should 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.140
 enter from the iphone this tutorial will 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.180
 It is done through the iphone 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.680
 you do not need the computer at all 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.680
 we enter the page 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.960
 the google search engine we enter the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.860
 page n of that forum 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.810
 angel x wing dot net 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.059
 we give to download this is the page 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.650
 of the inhabitant and good here gives us the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.790
 option to download them and we have a 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.530
 device with jailbreak I do not know how 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.770
 I do not know how to install it button 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.860
 a lot of ideas but that is creating a network 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.720
 vital but good this tutorial is about 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.720
 to do it without jailbreak and here is if 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.690
 you download a little piano and the block 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:32.050
 so good we give you to install n of 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.050
 that forum and you are via ota we give you 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.930
 and as you can see, this little message does not jump 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.990
 where we want to install we are going to 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.659
 install 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.439
 and now while this is being installed 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.600
 we will have to go to adjustments and change the 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.799
 date of our device for it 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.270
 we go to general we lower the date and time 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.450
 we remove the automatic adjustment and 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.830
 we will have to put on July 15, 2013 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.830
 that exact date 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.310
 apparently good is the date they put 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.560
 them so that you put it when while 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.729
 it's being downloaded we'll have to put it 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.729
 while it is downloading 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.370
 what would the emulator be like is good 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.040
 already half it does not take long we have 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.769
 also in the channel a video of how 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.800
 will be a boy advance emulator and 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.290
 gameboy color that good more or less the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.760
 tutorial is pretty much like this one but 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.400
 good is the description if you want it 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.300
 this one is from nintendo ds so we're going to 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.300
 enter the emulator 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.840
 and as you can see, the appearance is very simple 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.490
 that the games would appear we have a 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.820
 options button that I do not know very well 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:53.080
 options you'll have as is to remove the 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.540
 sound and four more things and the arrow 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.380
 of more than is to be able to add games 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.380
 we give it to ok 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.650
 now continue 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.360
 and as you can see, it appears good in the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.940
 search in google to download rooms 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.510
 of then we enter in this same one that 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.510
 school room 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.120
 and we wait for it to open 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.819
 and good for example let's download a 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.670
 pokémon to see a game so that 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.890
 see what works and we are going to 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.879
 download this pokémon platinum 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.879
 soon 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.450
 well let's go down on the 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.830
 game and you see that it puts download now it 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.180
 dais web 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.730
 you are going to download now 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.769
 and you will have to wait quite a thing 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.319
 It depends on your internet 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:49.769
 but the games usually take 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.650
 a good time to download so do not you 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.480
 you think he is charging badly or something 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.700
 well just that they take a long time 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.349
 to download 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.050
 so well I'm going to pass the camera a 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.590
 little fast and now I am with you 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.590
 again 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.110
 As you can see, I finish downloading in my 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.650
 good case taken like 34 minutes already 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.419

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.699

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.590
 We are gonna give 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:18.050
 up the scheme puts me April in 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.050
 and we are going to open in nds four 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.770
 As you can see, the emulator opens 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.150
 taking 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.150
 the game 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.729
 there is the game we enter 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.960
 As you can see, it's a bit slow 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.630
 it's gone usually happens the first time 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:53.000
 that install is a game 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:53.000

00:05:54.009 --> 00:06:01.180
