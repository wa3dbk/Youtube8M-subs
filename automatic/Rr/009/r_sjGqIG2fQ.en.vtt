00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980 
you guys think that that's not important

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.820

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
to have an offline multiplayer aspect to

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.950 
to have an offline multiplayer aspect to
your<00:06:05.860> football<00:06:06.370> game<00:06:06.610> and<00:06:07.240> it<00:06:07.450> just<00:06:07.630> doesn't

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
your football game and it just doesn't

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.480 
your football game and it just doesn't
seem<00:06:08.110> like<00:06:08.260> a<00:06:08.320> very<00:06:08.350> hard<00:06:08.770> thing<00:06:08.830> to<00:06:09.160> do<00:06:09.310> to

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
seem like a very hard thing to do to

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.340 
seem like a very hard thing to do to
just<00:06:09.700> you<00:06:10.240> know<00:06:10.300> if<00:06:10.750> that's<00:06:11.020> the<00:06:11.170> direction

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
just you know if that's the direction

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.540 
just you know if that's the direction
they<00:06:11.680> want<00:06:11.770> to<00:06:11.920> take<00:06:12.040> and<00:06:12.220> I<00:06:12.250> know<00:06:12.310> they're

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
they want to take and I know they're

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.830 
they want to take and I know they're
trying<00:06:12.760> to<00:06:12.790> take<00:06:13.000> the<00:06:13.120> creative<00:06:13.540> direction

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
trying to take the creative direction

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.390 
trying to take the creative direction
trying<00:06:14.170> to<00:06:14.230> place<00:06:14.440> you<00:06:14.560> directly<00:06:14.980> on<00:06:15.220> the

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
trying to place you directly on the

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.160 
trying to place you directly on the
field<00:06:15.670> but<00:06:16.120> I<00:06:16.180> do<00:06:16.300> think<00:06:16.630> that<00:06:16.750> they<00:06:16.930> could<00:06:16.990> at

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.170 
field but I do think that they could at

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.810 
field but I do think that they could at
least<00:06:17.320> put<00:06:17.590> in<00:06:17.740> the<00:06:17.830> option<00:06:18.250> of<00:06:18.340> having<00:06:18.520> the

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
least put in the option of having the

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.490 
least put in the option of having the
overhead<00:06:19.270> camera<00:06:19.630> and<00:06:19.720> I<00:06:19.750> really<00:06:20.140> hope<00:06:20.290> that

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
overhead camera and I really hope that

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.730 
overhead camera and I really hope that
you<00:06:20.650> guys<00:06:20.800> can<00:06:21.070> do<00:06:21.220> that<00:06:21.460> you<00:06:22.000> know<00:06:22.030> and<00:06:22.590> so<00:06:23.590> as

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
you guys can do that you know and so as

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.190 
you guys can do that you know and so as
far<00:06:23.950> as<00:06:24.010> backbreaker<00:06:24.940> cannot<00:06:25.540> wait<00:06:25.930> until
