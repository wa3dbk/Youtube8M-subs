night<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.340> went<00:00:38.340> out<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:39.510> opted<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.680> roll<00:00:40.890> my

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
night I went out and I opted to roll my

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.770 
night I went out and I opted to roll my
pants<00:00:41.730> up<00:00:42.230> instead<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.290> pinning<00:00:43.710> them<00:00:43.890> back<00:00:44.160> I

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
pants up instead of pinning them back I

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.630 
pants up instead of pinning them back I
did<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> few<00:00:46.110> turns<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.890> mirror<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.520> was

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
did a few turns in the mirror and I was

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.420 
did a few turns in the mirror and I was
like<00:00:47.760> okay<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.510> looks<00:00:48.750> awkward<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.920> it

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
like okay this just looks awkward and it

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.420 
like okay this just looks awkward and it
really<00:00:50.670> became<00:00:51.649> what<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.680> hiding<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.309> there

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
really became what you hiding in there

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.389 
really became what you hiding in there
are<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.670> hiding<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.090> beehive<00:00:54.510> or<00:00:55.070> roll<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.100> up

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
are you hiding a beehive or roll it up

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.900 
are you hiding a beehive or roll it up
and<00:00:56.610> be<00:00:56.879> like<00:00:57.149> Huck<00:00:57.449> Finn<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> baby<00:00:58.170> leg<00:00:58.910> so

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
and be like Huck Finn with a baby leg so

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.229 
and be like Huck Finn with a baby leg so
I<00:01:00.920> went<00:01:01.920> through<00:01:02.070> out<00:01:02.219> with<00:01:02.370> Huck<00:01:02.550> Finn<00:01:02.850> and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
I went through out with Huck Finn and

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.200 
I went through out with Huck Finn and
the<00:01:03.300> baby<00:01:03.449> leg<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.650> yeah<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.880> was<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
the baby leg so yeah that was the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.560 
the baby leg so yeah that was the
solution<00:01:06.479> without<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.460> I<00:01:08.460> mean<00:01:08.970> more<00:01:09.270> than<00:01:09.330> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
solution without and I mean more than a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.440 
solution without and I mean more than a
year<00:01:09.600> later<00:01:10.020> my<00:01:10.580> thing<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.909> hangs<00:01:12.180> here

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
year later my thing just hangs here

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.770 
year later my thing just hangs here
empty<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:13.320> still<00:01:13.560> kind<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.979> weird<00:01:14.130> like

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
empty like it's still kind of weird like

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.880 
empty like it's still kind of weird like
wiggles<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.350> flag<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:18.409> I'm<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:19.650> all<00:01:19.860> that

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
wiggles like a flag and I'm not all that

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.929 
wiggles like a flag and I'm not all that
stable<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:21.060> don't<00:01:21.420> really<00:01:22.640> use<00:01:23.640> just

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
stable because I don't really use just

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.230 
stable because I don't really use just
one<00:01:24.000> leg<00:01:24.420> anymore<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.909> this<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.119> just

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
one leg anymore and this is just

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.700 
one leg anymore and this is just
irritating<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.140> feels<00:01:28.320> going<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> get

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
irritating like it feels going to get

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.340 
irritating like it feels going to get
all<00:01:28.770> tangled<00:01:29.159> up<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.460> there<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.170> like<00:01:31.170> a
