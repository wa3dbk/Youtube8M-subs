00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
so cultivators are important this is the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.580 
so cultivators are important this is the
akh<00:00:55.829> 7.2<00:00:56.670> I've<00:00:56.969> noticed<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.390> as<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.690> kW<00:00:58.199> six

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
akh 7.2 I've noticed this as a kW six

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.580 
akh 7.2 I've noticed this as a kW six
there<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.489> one<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.940> other<00:01:00.260> it's<00:01:01.260> ten

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
there so it's one of the other it's ten

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.800 
there so it's one of the other it's ten
thousand<00:01:02.039> dollars<00:01:03.379> here's<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.619> BDT<00:01:05.630> seven<00:01:06.630> I

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
thousand dollars here's the BDT seven I

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.630 
thousand dollars here's the BDT seven I
assume<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.229> means<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.560> same<00:01:07.740> thing<00:01:07.799> is

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
assume that means the same thing is

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.310 
assume that means the same thing is
fifty<00:01:09.060> two<00:01:09.210> hundred<00:01:09.240> dollars<00:01:11.180> this<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.930> more

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
fifty two hundred dollars this is a more

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.050 
fifty two hundred dollars this is a more
realistic<00:01:13.619> partner<00:01:14.340> Terry<00:01:14.670> disk<00:01:14.909> 5001<00:01:15.840> k<00:01:16.439> I

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
realistic partner Terry disk 5001 k I

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.520 
realistic partner Terry disk 5001 k I
don't<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.150> more<00:01:18.299> realistic<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.930> this

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
don't have more realistic on this

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.090 
don't have more realistic on this
particular<00:01:19.939> save<00:01:20.939> game<00:01:21.680> but<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.710> wanted<00:01:23.009> to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
particular save game but I wanted to

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.940 
particular save game but I wanted to
look<00:01:23.280> at<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.610> anyway<00:01:23.970> because<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.140> think<00:01:25.619> it's

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
look at it anyway because I think it's

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.190 
look at it anyway because I think it's

working<00:05:44.570> this<00:05:44.780> one<00:05:44.990> is<00:05:45.110> broken<00:05:45.860> and<00:05:46.070> what<00:05:46.400> it

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
working this one is broken and what it

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.040 
working this one is broken and what it
is<00:05:46.640> when<00:05:46.970> you<00:05:47.060> hook<00:05:47.210> it<00:05:47.330> up<00:05:47.480> it's<00:05:47.690> trying<00:05:47.960> to

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
is when you hook it up it's trying to

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.200 
is when you hook it up it's trying to
resolve<00:05:48.350> a<00:05:48.650> whole<00:05:48.860> bunch<00:05:49.100> of<00:05:49.340> collisions<00:05:49.910> and

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.910 

yeah<00:06:42.440> unfortunately<00:06:43.440> this<00:06:43.650> one<00:06:43.950> is

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:45.920 
yeah unfortunately this one is

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.060 
yeah unfortunately this one is
absolutely<00:06:46.920> a<00:06:46.950> resource<00:06:47.460> disaster<00:06:48.950> and<00:06:49.950> at

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
absolutely a resource disaster and at

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.780 
absolutely a resource disaster and at
all<00:06:50.720> so<00:06:51.720> this<00:06:51.930> one<00:06:52.140> is<00:06:52.460> something<00:06:53.460> you<00:06:53.550> want<00:06:53.670> to
