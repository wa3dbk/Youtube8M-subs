00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hey youtube guys, what the late video with the first video 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.600
 for our our debut 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.120
 we'll start with a pocketknife on the river until the tenth 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:16.659
 first to all who use 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.789
 and if that perfect penknife to be used daily in the tasks fan 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:23.789
 daily 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.259
 as a tool for a blade 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.499
 utility 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.689
 I speak the desire to be her design was not 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:33.160
 for ceron 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.070
 a tactical blade that can not be used 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.820
 possibly beginning 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.510
 the case in an emergency only that it was not made for this 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.520
 its size is not great except 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.480
 he is a pocketknife with no feelings measured in the mine 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.890
 nine centimeters 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.920
 the cable 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.290
 and 15 6 centimeters 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.449
 with it open 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.730
 so we can compare it with a pen and coin 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.850
 so they're there 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.269
 okay but he's a 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.180
 with the small pocketknife 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.080
 made ipreo and to accompany 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.390
 in your daily activities and there what you 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.340
 you may need 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.300
 it also says candinho that I walked using it the zaeli prouni have shine 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.340
 had any use 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.370
 some physicists and t7 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.370
 his access is 440 c 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.800
 which is a very good subject 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.150
 he is not the 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.590
 Topic milk, right? 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.060
 but it's only reasonable 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.749
 with a rumor durability is not a very hard subject 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
 but also not very good at the box office 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.740
 tel 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.299
 the beginning of 2010 57 58 floors certainly good 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.249
 he is reasonable 

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:54.249
 about the possible action in the elevator some time 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.520
 right and he does not 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.650
 a difficult subject to sharpen 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.650
 sure it's compared to google at 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.990
 to mr 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.840
 8 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.270
 dark hotelaria that we find in other places only that this she 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.789
 personifies his 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:14.119
 the shape of the blade 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:16.009
 it is similar to 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.439
 the style spread yoko 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.950
 where you can see that I smoked by this communication format 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.219
 Felix Pacheco 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.179
 he was 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:27.109
 despite being rational they 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.259
 done by tutela racing 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:32.440
 we see who is is a blade 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.929
 What will be done? 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:34.889
 with a null 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.849
 what is made for everyday use right 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.669
 She even has that little belly here. 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:42.249
 that can be used 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:43.680
 This is where your 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.379
 main cut area right where you will be 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.300
 her main cost 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.680
 What an honor 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.929
 with a penknife on our side 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:55.839
 he's not very expensive said kan should grow about 40 reais to you 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:59.219
 but freight our cement structure 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.459
 dot com dot br 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.389
 which is a quality penknife 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.389
 good because they deal with a national 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.119
 certain he is a knife you could 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.529
 if you can open it with one hand 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:16.929
 sure not super-fast more 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:19.929
 A little practice will tell you that you're getting better at this. 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:27.749
 and it could have to be theoretically used in an emergency with the tacticians 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.249
 that's why I 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:33.119
 I consider speed what I think cool it you can see it 

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:34.139
 close it 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.369
 with one hand only 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:36.709
 so it's easy 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.559
 you do this 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:45.139
 now how much I regret that this blade was reaffirmed was not very sharp 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.819
 it was reasonable for his chain of consumption that a pocket knife should be sharp 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.819
 I want you not to know what you're going to need it for 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:57.399
 he went to the toilet so getting a little more 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:04:01.439
 sharp really only him come pro is not eight and jorge arrate 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:05.729
 from the right original so if you ask, 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.779
 they speak so well so you're going to have to 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:13.669
 work on it but did not create when parsing original sound is bad 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.819
 to lock her 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.409
 it's a lottery 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.400
 that we can see 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.220
 dr 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.939
 well resistant and a sweatshirt you see that it has a cost 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:28.099
 bad 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:30.590
 a good grade 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.420
 as resistance started in your very resilient system maybe one of the 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:35.719
 more resistant 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:37.120
 they say right 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.560
 Americans say that 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.039
 and is the most resistant there is 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.300
 although from this national selection experiment in simple not to be of the most 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.300
 sophisticated 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.659
 His car 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:50.729
 it's a cable 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.930
 with a format 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.080
 can handle very well enter 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.009
 so he has a good and has the hard 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.460
 he's done everything from me to sinovac his car too 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.460
 so with a blade 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:09.559
 it has a good idea is hard you can see the formats that having due 

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.909
 for you to hold here, yes the clown as you stand 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:15.889
 not good a good grip 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:16.860
 for the hand 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.860
 He is small, but you can handle it well. 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.490
 another thing that is legal about sica and vert are 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.520
 the details is that it attracts salomÃ© 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.839
 so you can 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:29.409
 put a big toe 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.659
 the darm deco hold more forward by the mega-sena at the most 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:36.659
 with more delicate work with more precision 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.129
 and this is a cousin 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:41.169
 how 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.689
 a detail however 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:44.479
 if we can say it in him 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.529
 so it's super 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:48.990
 clumsy clerk 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.170
 these details here are not certain of the band blade mansion with something 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.629
 What are you going to help? 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:59.289
 we also have the clip 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.909
 the reversible clip is okay if you can 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:04.819
 change sides 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:07.020
 so you can use the talent on your side 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.650
 how much of the other 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.919
 with the tip up 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.520
 or with the account down as it is 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.099
 Experienced is a small pocket knife success in the pocket 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.099
 you just will not realize he's there 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:26.599
 this is a joker etc will probably last some time with you 

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:30.679
 and I do not say if it will last a lifetime but if you take good care of it 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:32.960
 from him he goes to 1 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.729
 It's been a while, yes. 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.619
 so it is a good quality 

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:39.930
 it weighs about 120 grams 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.729
 which is not much 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:44.729
 exchanged ideas mainly whole stainless steel 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:47.780
 It's a pocketknife that's going to have to be a 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.499
 A help for you never was utah 

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:52.169
 It's not a super pocket knife. 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:53.099
 but it is not 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:54.490
 a knife with him 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.839
 in everyday tasks it may be what you are looking for 

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:00.879
 it costs about 40 reais so it is affordable 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:06.090
 follows presently grampa is a light pocketknife is one thing that you will 

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:07.419
 to use on a day-to-day basis 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:11.129
 ok if you think of something tactical something 

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:14.690
 more specific it is not the recommended are silver area alerts 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.910
 just to shut everything down on bases it's better to have him not need what 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.270
 need and not have
