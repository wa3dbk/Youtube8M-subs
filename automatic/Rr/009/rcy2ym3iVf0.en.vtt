00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.829 
there so um when I say mind is basically
it<00:00:54.190> involves<00:00:54.489> making<00:00:55.000> your<00:00:55.239> defender<00:00:55.600> think

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
it involves making your defender think

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:56.820 
it involves making your defender think
that<00:00:55.989> you're<00:00:56.140> going<00:00:56.260> to<00:00:56.320> be<00:00:56.379> doing<00:00:56.500> one<00:00:56.799> thing

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
that you're going to be doing one thing

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.680 
that you're going to be doing one thing
when<00:00:57.790> you<00:00:57.970> know<00:00:58.119> you're<00:00:58.269> going<00:00:58.390> to<00:00:58.420> go<00:00:58.540> the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
when you know you're going to go the

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.109 
when you know you're going to go the
other<00:00:58.720> okay<00:00:59.470> so<00:00:59.530> if<00:01:00.040> you<00:01:00.580> know<00:01:00.670> if<00:01:00.760> you<00:01:00.970> work

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:01.119 
other okay so if you know if you work

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:02.579 
other okay so if you know if you work
slowly<00:01:01.449> can't<00:01:01.809> jump<00:01:02.019> that<00:01:02.049> high<00:01:02.260> or<00:01:02.320> you<00:01:02.440> can't

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
slowly can't jump that high or you can't

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:03.840 
slowly can't jump that high or you can't
do<00:01:02.680> a<00:01:02.710> little<00:01:02.890> well<00:01:03.040> you<00:01:03.220> can<00:01:03.489> just<00:01:03.580> figure<00:01:03.760> out

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
do a little well you can just figure out

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.009 
do a little well you can just figure out
how<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:04.059> make<00:01:04.210> your<00:01:04.330> defender<00:01:04.659> think<00:01:04.900> that

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
how to make your defender think that

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.780 
how to make your defender think that
you're<00:01:05.170> going<00:01:05.350> one<00:01:05.530> way<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:05.920> you<00:01:06.400> just<00:01:06.520> go<00:01:06.640> the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
you're going one way and you just go the

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.210 
you're going one way and you just go the
other<00:01:06.820> in<00:01:07.060> wall<00:01:07.270> can't<00:01:07.930> stop<00:01:08.320> that<00:01:08.500> right<00:01:08.680> so

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
other in wall can't stop that right so

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.609 
other in wall can't stop that right so
something<00:01:09.820> is<00:01:09.970> simple<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:11.229> is<00:01:11.320> a<00:01:11.350> little<00:01:11.500> more

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
something is simple it is a little more

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.080 
something is simple it is a little more
advancement<00:01:12.130> but<00:01:12.549> if<00:01:12.640> you're<00:01:12.790> bringing<00:01:13.060> a

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
legs okay if one time hesitate for a

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:41.819 
legs okay if one time hesitate for a
second<00:01:40.630> on<00:01:40.689> the<00:01:40.780> third<00:01:41.049> time<00:01:41.289> instead<00:01:41.770> of

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
second on the third time instead of

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.849
