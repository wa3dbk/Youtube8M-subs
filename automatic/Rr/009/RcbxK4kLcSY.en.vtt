00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.899
 Come on 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.910
 first great excitement for nintendo 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.399
 friends and although there are rumors now 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.280
 that possibly the streaming service 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.940
 netflix a zelda live action series 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.649
 to bring out 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.180
 live action pur easily as with 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.890
 real actor and the whole thing 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.510
 such a kind of games of thrones for the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.489
 Whole family will be natural 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.870
 quite a hit and nintendo has yes 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.210
 already announced last year that 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.909
 you can do much more with your licenses 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.680
 so would like to do so as itself 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.100
 series that would be something or that 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.990
 somehow by disney theme is 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.659
 probably also over the whole year 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.030
 In this respect, of course, fans enjoy 2005 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.090
 be the series because ceo eric Hirshberg 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.950
 has announced that the dlc house 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.540
 although she is not the last thing we did 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.280
 got to see this year and has so 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.320
 he already announced that you are in 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.630
 autumn a relatively large extension 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.290
 plan and now around 16 million 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.790
 players are active 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.200
 Assassin's creed Roth speaks that 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.510
 I do not even know that 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.430
 was at the same time assassin's creed 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.830
 unity appeared and only for the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.510
 last dance version for the xbox 360 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.730
 and the playstation 3 and now has 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.770
 ubisoft announce that on march 10 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.170
 quite simply a pc adaptation 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.270
 will come out and if you all 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.280
 you can imagine yourself on you play 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.920
 one of seven assassin's creed titles 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.570
 again for free to choose 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.160
 the whole thing will be relatively moderate 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.470
 have requirements it will be specified 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.580
 a graphics card from the last 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.520
 century as it seemed to me and 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.560
 about 11 GB of space so if 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.290
 you have the guts you can do this 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.290
 last gentile but also gamble on the pc 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.710
 Attention now, hold on tight 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.930
 unbelievably at the end of the year 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.870
 presumably in november it will appear 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.970
 actually a igel brand new call of 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.650
 Duty values ​​that now thought my life 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.050
 but in fact they have fun now 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.850
 really known on the dice 2015 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.400
 given that truck to the new call of 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.160
 duty title works and that is the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.590
 studio what just before for world 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.800
 at was black ops and black ops 2 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.180
 was responsible and probably will 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.650
 Edward Two will have that but they will 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.450
 not yet said interestingly 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.680
 But it was about the zombie mode because 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.110
 that was the last one with the hashtag 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.870
 already tweeted and there was told 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.550
 that almost this zombie mode never gets into it 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.840
 had made it and it was at the 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.430
 development so that she was at with world 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.380
 actually behind the schedule 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.700
 went back and made such a small 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.620
 just still team with this 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.090
 zombie mode would have been employed instead 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.070
 really full throttle on 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.170
 main game but when you saw how 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.030
 cool that fits nazi zombies 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.890
 is it then converted into folk play and 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.920
 is meanwhile as I think so 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.239
 one of the hit or the highlight of this 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.239
 become a call of duty series 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.310
 Now let's go to the team linear 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.810
 the people the dead or alive 5 last round 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.330
 develop and they have it again 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.160
 said that to the pc version that they 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.260
 be very strict about what 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.240
 Do the men and that they do not do anything 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.030
 make immoral with their game because 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.770
 then there would be no pc games in the future 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.230
 more of them give that part, yes 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.420
 february, february for 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.670
 the current consoles and in march should 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.590
 the whole for the pc player follow if 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.630
 I'll give them a goal like that 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.400
 because of that, and how they develop that way 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.470
 have the start in their game are the 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:09.940
 I believe the last ones somehow that 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:11.769
 first stone should throw on the third 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.950
 april it will be ready and the last 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.959
 hardcore gamer dark soul 2 now appears 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.180
 finally also for the playstation 4 and 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.590
 the xbox were and fortunately 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.080
 they really know it 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.979
 given that on both consoles the 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.270
 game in 1080p with 60 fps will run 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.310
 And then there is one more 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.330
 Brand new trailer I first you 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.330
 show 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.090
 I now and then them suffering because during 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.950
 We still in Germany on the 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.570
 indexing the title of techland 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.620
 Wait, but it's so bad 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.500
 not at all like one 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.690
 zombies on the head so what's the point 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.730
 now has a wonderful youtuber 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.650
 especially funny is the corner of and 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.090
 Although there is a level that's great 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.110
 Mario is ajar and because I have that 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.790
 did not find himself 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.940
 I'm just blind in the now 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:11.200
 video and fun are indexed 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.180
 title then really play tip for the 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.420
 Sunday afternoon if you 're tired of it 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.040
 ubisoft should have been too brutal 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.630
 Already a lot of success with games like 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.310
 reamonn one had now again very 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.300
 interesting game brought out and 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.490
 I would like to just flat rate 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.430
 what do I call then and go home and 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.900
 which costs only 79 99 so wanders 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.580
 he always with a small robot 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.380
 further up and the whole thing is 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.330
 actually very simple of the game 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.710
 idea is just fun and I think so 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.570
 for casual gambling in between 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.570
 Can you do that to yourself? 

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:45.529
 if I am properly informed 

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:48.349
 will be published on 12 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:51.169
 juli a new 30 park film jurassic 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:54.139
 world and it will fit perfectly then 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:56.269
 Just a new logo adventure for the 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:59.059
 give the console of your choice and the teaser 

00:05:56.269 --> 00:06:01.749
 too so if you guys give that to me then 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:01.749
 I do not know either 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.979
 yes, the biggest topic on the weekend was 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.930
 for me actually once again a 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:28.720
 youtube theme and so reported sarrazin 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.310
 in his latest blog about that 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.470
 State Institute for Media and the 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.990
 Protecting him and grog writing 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.300
 because they are simple 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.759
 partially indexed games on her 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.949
 show channel and have shown so 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:43.840
 then became of the protection of course 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:45.370
 We complain that we have indexed games 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.860
 our plates have barriers call of 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.510
 duty black ops first let's play is 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.789
 unfortunately not on mine anymore 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:54.310
 channel and now turns up to date 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:58.419
 really the question is what will happen 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:07:01.660
 if the german legislation is not 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:04.720
 more allows quasi media with content 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.490
 which are intended for fsk 16 fsk18 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.220
 that they are no longer freely available 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.960
 on youtube that would allow for 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.910
 complete example of all call of duty and 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.900
 all battlefield videos concern that 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.849
 not even necessarily have to 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.070
 indexed games are cut 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:19.750
 be games or something but virtually everyone 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.550
 any multiplayer titles of the 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.919
 very popular and very popular nowadays 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.470
 might be widespread 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:29.560
 thus removed from the German youtube 

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.729
 I'll just notice that me 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.139
 actually lately 

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:34.419
 said few I would like only times 

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:36.370
 individually to comment but I'm missing in 

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:38.139
 he was currently still the time 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.210
 format more so I am 

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:41.530
 have been relatively clamped the last 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.370
 days i am happy that the daily news 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.050
 run so well 

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.090
 I am extremely happy that Wednesday 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.990

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.280
 I believe you have gotten there

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.940
 I'm sorry because I already have it 

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.949
 pondering if I follow Wednesday 

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.789

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.780
 make unboxing stuff 

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:06.250
