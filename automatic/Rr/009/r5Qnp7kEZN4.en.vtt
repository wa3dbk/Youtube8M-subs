00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850 

there<00:00:00.780> are<00:00:00.870> basically<00:00:01.170> three<00:00:01.469> types<00:00:01.500> of

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
there are basically three types of

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.470 
there are basically three types of
sections<00:00:02.190> that<00:00:02.310> we<00:00:02.520> can<00:00:02.669> use<00:00:02.850> when<00:00:03.030> foiling

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
sections that we can use when foiling

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.690 
sections that we can use when foiling
the<00:00:03.570> hair<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:04.500> first<00:00:04.740> type<00:00:04.920> of<00:00:04.950> section<00:00:05.430> is

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
the hair the first type of section is

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.540 
the hair the first type of section is
what<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.600> lot<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.810> people<00:00:06.990> do<00:00:07.290> today<00:00:07.649> which<00:00:07.980> is<00:00:08.010> a

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
what a lot of people do today which is a

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.400 
what a lot of people do today which is a
horizontal<00:00:09.450> section<00:00:11.330> that<00:00:12.330> pretty<00:00:12.929> much<00:00:13.080> runs

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
horizontal section that pretty much runs

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.950 
horizontal section that pretty much runs
horizontal<00:00:14.070> on<00:00:14.240> the<00:00:15.240> sides<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.780> head

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
horizontal on the sides of the head

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.570 
horizontal on the sides of the head
coming<00:00:16.410> up<00:00:16.619> through<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.920> back<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.430> then

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
coming up through the back and then

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.470 
coming up through the back and then
continuing<00:00:18.270> on<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.470> front<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> hair

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
continuing on to the front of the hair

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.880 
continuing on to the front of the hair
interesting<00:00:21.480> thing<00:00:21.750> about<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:22.230> section<00:00:22.650> is

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
interesting thing about this section is

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.019 
interesting thing about this section is
because<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.119> widely<00:00:24.869> used<00:00:26.029> typically

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
because it is widely used typically

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.509 
because it is widely used typically
we'll<00:00:27.330> get<00:00:27.599> ribbons<00:00:27.990> are<00:00:28.439> these<00:00:28.740> streaks<00:00:29.250> in

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
we'll get ribbons are these streaks in

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.240 
we'll get ribbons are these streaks in
the<00:00:29.640> hair<00:00:29.880> when<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> hair<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.449> pulled<00:00:30.750> back

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
the hair when the hair is pulled back

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.190 
the hair when the hair is pulled back
because<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.399> hair<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.880> done<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> horizontal

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
because the hair is done on a horizontal

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.940 
because the hair is done on a horizontal
are<00:00:34.710> foiled<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.670> horizontal<00:00:36.260> we<00:00:37.260> get<00:00:37.500> sheets

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
are foiled on a horizontal we get sheets

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.220 
are foiled on a horizontal we get sheets
of<00:00:38.250> color<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.270> actually<00:00:39.840> gives<00:00:39.870> us

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
of color and so this actually gives us

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.080 
of color and so this actually gives us
the<00:00:40.290> illusion<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:41.160> having<00:00:41.430> more<00:00:41.820> weight

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
the illusion of having more weight

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.810 
the illusion of having more weight
around<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.719> perimeter<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:44.160> head<00:00:44.520> form

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
around the perimeter of the head form

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.020 
around the perimeter of the head form
the<00:00:45.570> next<00:00:45.840> type<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:45.989> foil<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.559> we<00:00:46.739> could<00:00:47.070> we

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the next type of foil that we could we

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.060 
the next type of foil that we could we
could<00:00:48.210> place<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.750> what<00:00:49.289> we<00:00:49.440> would<00:00:49.559> call<00:00:49.620> a

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
could place is what we would call a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.680 
could place is what we would call a
vertical<00:00:50.700> section<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.320> section

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
vertical section in this section

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.020 
vertical section in this section
actually<00:00:54.690> runs<00:00:55.020> parallel<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.399> wall<00:00:56.699> if

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
actually runs parallel to the wall if

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.540 
actually runs parallel to the wall if
you<00:00:57.149> will<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.930> basically<00:00:58.320> take<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:59.039> straight

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
you will we basically take a straight

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.939 
you will we basically take a straight
line<00:00:59.789> coming<00:01:00.570> from<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.989> top<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> head<00:01:01.620> to

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
line coming from the top of the head to

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.429 
line coming from the top of the head to
the<00:01:02.100> bottom<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> head<00:01:02.809> are<00:01:03.809> somewhere<00:01:04.379> in

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the bottom of the head are somewhere in

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.280 
the bottom of the head are somewhere in
between<00:01:04.710> them<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:05.519> basically<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.540> foil

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
between them but basically it's a foil

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.130 
between them but basically it's a foil
that<00:01:07.500> runs<00:01:07.970> not<00:01:08.970> horizontal<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.990> had

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
that runs not horizontal like we had

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.190 
that runs not horizontal like we had
before<00:01:10.350> but<00:01:11.159> runs<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.939> down<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.869> type<00:01:13.170> of

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
before but runs up and down this type of

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.890 
before but runs up and down this type of
foil<00:01:13.820> section<00:01:14.820> would<00:01:14.970> actually<00:01:15.360> give<00:01:15.540> us<00:01:15.659> more

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
foil section would actually give us more

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.929 
foil section would actually give us more
of<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.350> ribbon<00:01:16.710> type<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.220> section<00:01:17.610> where<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
of a ribbon type of a section where the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.620 
of a ribbon type of a section where the
hair<00:01:18.180> falls<00:01:19.020> down<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.830> we've<00:01:20.189> get<00:01:20.630> some

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
hair falls down and we've get some

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.780 
hair falls down and we've get some
ribbon<00:01:21.990> types<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.500> effect<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.310> gives<00:01:23.610> us

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
ribbon types of effect but that gives us

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.120 
ribbon types of effect but that gives us
the<00:01:23.970> illusion<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.659> having<00:01:24.869> elongation<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the illusion of having elongation in the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.070 
the illusion of having elongation in the
hair<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.880> vertical<00:01:27.119> types<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.720> foils

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
hair so vertical types of foils

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.940 
hair so vertical types of foils
definitely<00:01:29.040> give<00:01:29.250> us<00:01:29.280> more<00:01:30.150> look<00:01:30.720> for<00:01:31.079> longer

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
definitely give us more look for longer

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.249 
definitely give us more look for longer
type<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.340> hair<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:33.119> create<00:01:33.600> more<00:01:33.810> ribbon

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
type of hair to create more ribbon

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.640 
type of hair to create more ribbon
effect<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:35.460> next<00:01:35.729> type<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.259> foiling<00:01:37.259> section

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
effect the next type of foiling section

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.069 
effect the next type of foiling section
that<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:37.890> could<00:01:38.070> use<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.659> diagonal<00:01:39.659> section

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
that we could use is a diagonal section

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.200 
that we could use is a diagonal section
and<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.770> diagonal<00:01:41.310> section<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.850> one<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
and the diagonal section is one of the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.969 
and the diagonal section is one of the
best<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.570> use<00:01:42.780> when<00:01:43.020> foiling<00:01:43.500> because<00:01:43.829> we're

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
best to use when foiling because we're

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.639 
best to use when foiling because we're
working<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> round<00:01:44.820> surface<00:01:45.649> versus

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
working on a round surface versus

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.399 
working on a round surface versus
working<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> square<00:01:47.579> surface<00:01:47.990> because<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
working on a square surface because the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.499 
working on a square surface because the
head<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.770> round<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.340> diagonal<00:01:51.060> gives<00:01:51.240> us

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
head is round the diagonal gives us

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.420 
head is round the diagonal gives us
color<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.079> would<00:01:52.200> actually<00:01:52.560> start<00:01:52.860> here<00:01:53.280> and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
color that would actually start here and

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.969 
color that would actually start here and
then<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:54.210> gradually<00:01:54.479> fall<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.470> gives<00:01:55.770> us

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
then just gradually fall so it gives us

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.130 
then just gradually fall so it gives us
the<00:01:56.250> illusion<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.850> having<00:01:57.030> more<00:01:57.420> movement<00:01:57.990> in

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
the illusion of having more movement in

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.260 
the illusion of having more movement in
the<00:01:58.259> hair<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:59.159> haircuts<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.700> have<00:01:59.939> a
