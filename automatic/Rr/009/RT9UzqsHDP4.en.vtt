actually do high intensity level of
output<00:02:56.350> it's<00:02:57.350> going<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.620> be<00:02:57.709> at<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.010> top

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
output it's going to be at the top

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.640 
output it's going to be at the top
specially<00:02:58.640> that's<00:02:58.850> one<00:02:59.060> set<00:02:59.299> your<00:02:59.510> head<00:02:59.720> five

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
specially that's one set your head five

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.650 
specially that's one set your head five
times<00:03:00.680> three<00:03:01.549> to<00:03:01.640> five<00:03:01.820> times<00:03:02.030> character<00:03:02.540> that

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
times three to five times character that

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.210 
times three to five times character that
and<00:03:03.500> it's<00:03:03.680> great
