00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.139
 let's proceed to vote the two-story letter for which we start from the base 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.179
 of which we have already put an eva rubber sheet 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:12.329
 we have already stuck 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:14.779
 it happens that they hit with the butt 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.929
 or with diluted cmc 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:21.339
 on this basis we are going to put 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.800
 the first evenings of mommy cupcakes the base below that already 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.189
 we had put 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.339
 on a short contract basis for August 5 we will introduce you 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.410
 morning 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.410
 for this we will be able to 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.190
 a little air was impregnated reserved because as we said we 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.880
 like to go hitting 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.450
 always cut the barbastro bars the rocket so that the 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.450
 dismantled tartana do not move anymore attacked to travel 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.770
 we assembled then 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.830
 the first stuttering we are going to do a double base with two heights zeltia more 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.090
 nice of a base more security 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.590
 the next step 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.360
 is to know where you are going 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.040
 the top-down part appear work also one side 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.640
 depending on what we decide 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.290
 we will have to put the supports in one way or another 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.520
 how can we do it 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.600
 for example 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.990
 in that letter 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.950
 let's put it in the center 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.620
 then we take a disc that that same disc that takes inside inside 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.860
 the other basis and what we do is 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.860
 mark it 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.050
 we understand that it is putting the different pillars min 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.410
 we mark four points 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.250
 we remove the disk 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.880
 and from here what we do is we put pupil in the center 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.380
 we as a pillar are going to put straws of soda straws 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.300
 what we do is we put the pillar 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.440
 we put it to be with gift and we mark it with a marker 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.670
 we mark with marker 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.180
 we take it out 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.010
 if we force 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.140
 at the height that the marker is signed from there what we do how 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.790
 let's put five games 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.239
 it's amazing yesterday cut all the same 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.489
 it's better 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.870
 that doing it directly on the letter because we could not do it is 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.489
 include in streams 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.929
 in unevenness 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:23.029
 so we are cutting different items I said in this case five 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.930
 if we go putting the chips first we had already cut and then as if 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.049
 outside a veil one before and one behind and then at the sides 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:36.929
 we try to do it 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:38.519
 as straight as possible 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.279
 as we see a little more inside what we had marked ball the score in 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.139
 the external part 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.719
 once we have done these two stretches despite a little more air without 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.159
 stop as we said that can be generated 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.159
 the top part the sponge cake 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.319
 we put on the ice and what we are going to do now 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.389
 it's 100 catch the base up 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.999
 it was not up to the second floor in our letter 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:09.879
 i put it on, let's try to make it as centered as possible 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.479
 thus 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.579
 we would have a structure of a letter of two heights 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.849
 we take 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.459
 the second letter that as we have already said from below on the disk 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.509
 of gold also makes it easier to add 

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:30.539
 we put on 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:32.859
 central 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.839
 and we already had built 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.969
 our slow heights 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:39.579
 that is very difficult kieny 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.219
 the height of rivas 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.959
 between the second after this construction we have done
