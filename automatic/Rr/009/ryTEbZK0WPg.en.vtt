 Hello my name is Marcel Norton and I am 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.459
 nutritionist the language and today you 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.309
 I want to talk about how your body burns 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.990
 fat for your power to burn fat the 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.850
 fat that you have in your body in your 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.890
 waist and your hips on your legs 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.369
 There needs to be a very important process 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.880
 what is called lipolysis what happens with the 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.310
 lipolysis 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.320
 this metabolic way secrete mona 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.260
 secretes enzymes but there is an enzyme that 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.660
 it's very very important to secrete what is 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.240
 the enzyme responsible for metabolizing the 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.760
 fat and turn it into energy 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.800
 I have control of that enzyme my 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.550
 which I can activate or you can 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.190
 active if I have that enzyme active 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.450
 logically I will be burning fat 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.050
 constantly but if I have 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.270
 deactivate enzyme logically I'm going to 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.160
 start to increase my volume I'm going to 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.900
 start to go up in sizes I'm going to start 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.600
 to increase the volume of my cells 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.030
 of fat because I do not have 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.950
 activated the enzyme then what is it 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.950
 I have to activate the enzyme 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.330
 as the number 1 asset is very good 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.120
 hydrated is something extremely important 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.780
 number 2 do your three times of 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.710
 eat breakfast lunch and dinner because if 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.250
 you stop eating 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.100
 it is active 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.680
 People who spend more than 68 9 hours 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.440
 without food they have their 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.840
 suso cells above but being 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.240
 turn off the enzyme you're not 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.180
 metabolizing tussam fat that you 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.910
 you're low on calories or doing 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.280
 a lot of exercise you have some 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.140
 prolonged your metabolism becomes slow 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.660
 and another very important thing is the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.720
 exercise the exercise makes it 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.300
 activate this enzyme then if I am 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.690
 in the plan to lose weight decrease of 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.210
 carvings I need to pay attention to this 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.160
 enzyme and have it activated all the time 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.420
 because the moment you have it 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.250
 deactivated is when the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.560
 frustration that he did not lose weight a 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.320
 work of measures no diet me 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.750
 it works but it's not the diet if it's not 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.040
 what are you doing to activate your 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.560
 enzyme 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.390
 in the metabolism that is why it 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.120
 You need a perfect plan 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.370
 feeding because if you do not have it and 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.500
 you are consuming few calories 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.709
 obviously not lose weight or good 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.720
 You can lose weight temporarily but 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.000
 then the body can recover it 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.810
 then I hope I invite you to 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.550
 activate your lipase and you're 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.550
 metabolizing fat consists
