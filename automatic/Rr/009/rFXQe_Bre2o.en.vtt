this is the implementation of Kingdom
Hearts<00:00:24.240> 3<00:00:24.510> free<00:00:24.930> run<00:00:25.140> feature<00:00:25.439> being<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.550> bit

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.040 
Hearts 3 free run feature being a bit
more<00:00:26.910> obvious<00:00:27.449> when<00:00:27.960> it's<00:00:28.740> very<00:00:29.220> very<00:00:29.580> like

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
more obvious when it's very very like

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.659 
more obvious when it's very very like
tidally<00:00:31.050> hidden<00:00:31.349> like<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:31.740> it's<00:00:32.309> hard<00:00:32.520> to

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
tidally hidden like it's it's hard to

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.389 
tidally hidden like it's it's hard to
see<00:00:32.880> but<00:00:33.120> if<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.320> look<00:00:34.860> very<00:00:34.890> carefully

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
see but if we just look very carefully

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.130 
see but if we just look very carefully
at<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> moments<00:00:36.300> where<00:00:36.420> Sora<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.750> about<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
at the moments where Sora is about to

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.190 
at the moments where Sora is about to
run<00:00:37.290> up<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.530> wall<00:00:37.790> mainly<00:00:38.790> before<00:00:39.090> Sora<00:00:39.809> runs<00:00:40.020> up

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
run up a wall mainly before Sora runs up

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.020 
run up a wall mainly before Sora runs up
the<00:00:40.230> first<00:00:40.590> wall<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> gameplay<00:00:41.370> segment

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the first wall in the gameplay segment

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.750 
the first wall in the gameplay segment
and<00:00:42.320> before<00:00:43.320> Sora<00:00:43.770> runs<00:00:44.040> up<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.219> wall<00:00:44.340> to

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and before Sora runs up the wall to

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.369 
and before Sora runs up the wall to
attack<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.239> rock<00:00:45.450> Titan<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:45.960> can<00:00:46.140> see<00:00:46.350> a

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
attack the rock Titan we can see a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.270 
attack the rock Titan we can see a
little<00:00:46.649> tiny<00:00:47.300> sparkle<00:00:48.300> against<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> wall

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
little tiny sparkle against the wall

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.670 
little tiny sparkle against the wall
this<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.550> obviously<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.570> signal<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.469> can

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
this is obviously to signal that you can

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.189 
this is obviously to signal that you can
do<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.010> free<00:00:53.340> roam<00:00:53.640> or<00:00:53.940> free<00:00:54.510> run<00:00:54.690> movement

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
do the free roam or free run movement

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.170 
do the free roam or free run movement
here<00:00:55.350> as<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.680> Mora<00:00:55.890> has<00:00:56.010> called<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
here as the Mora has called it and the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.060 
here as the Mora has called it and the
more<00:00:57.329> has<00:00:57.510> also<00:00:57.690> given<00:00:57.930> us<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> little<00:00:58.800> bit<00:00:58.949> of

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
more has also given us a little bit of

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.069 
more has also given us a little bit of
insight<00:00:59.520> into<00:00:59.730> it<00:01:00.000> based<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.539> interviews<00:01:00.870> and

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
insight into it based on interviews and

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.529 
insight into it based on interviews and
it'll<00:01:01.530> be<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.890> basically<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.489> new<00:01:02.969> way<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> get

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
it'll be just basically a new way to get

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.149 
it'll be just basically a new way to get
around<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.930> environment<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.799> want<00:01:05.040> to

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
around the environment and I want to

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.359 
around the environment and I want to
make<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.939> clear<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.210> free<00:01:06.659> run<00:01:07.369> obviously

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
make it clear that free run obviously

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.070 
make it clear that free run obviously
looks<00:01:08.580> very<00:01:08.880> different<00:01:09.270> from<00:01:09.510> full-motion

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
looks very different from full-motion

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.380 
looks very different from full-motion
free<00:01:10.470> run<00:01:10.650> has<00:01:10.920> these<00:01:11.250> little<00:01:11.670> sparkles<00:01:12.150> on

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
free run has these little sparkles on

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.750 
free run has these little sparkles on
objects<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.590> do<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.979> obviously<00:01:14.130> and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
objects that can do it obviously and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.550 
objects that can do it obviously and
there's<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.479> whole<00:01:15.720> segment<00:01:16.080> through<00:01:16.470> this

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
there's a whole segment through this

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.749 
there's a whole segment through this
video<00:01:16.860> where<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.189> can<00:01:17.340> see<00:01:17.490> Sora

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
video where we can see Sora

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.149 
video where we can see Sora
demonstrating<00:01:18.509> free<00:01:18.689> Ron<00:01:18.960> now<00:01:19.110> obviously<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
demonstrating free Ron now obviously the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.560 
demonstrating free Ron now obviously the
sparkles<00:01:20.549> don't<00:01:20.729> show<00:01:20.909> up<00:01:21.030> every<00:01:21.360> time

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
sparkles don't show up every time

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.330 
sparkles don't show up every time
because<00:01:21.840> either<00:01:22.290> Sora<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.799> already<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
because either Sora is already in the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.030 
because either Sora is already in the
middle<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.610> doing<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.000> action<00:01:24.390> or<00:01:24.650> Sora<00:01:25.650> is

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
middle of doing the action or Sora is

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.219 
middle of doing the action or Sora is
too<00:01:26.610> far<00:01:26.850> away<00:01:27.030> from<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.390> wall<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.840> show<00:01:28.200> a

too far away from the wall to show a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.819 
too far away from the wall to show a
sparkle<00:01:28.680> yet<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:29.460> assume<00:01:30.470> you<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:31.740> you

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
sparkle yet I just assume you but you

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.289 
sparkle yet I just assume you but you
can<00:01:32.009> tell<00:01:32.220> when<00:01:32.400> watching<00:01:32.670> these<00:01:32.970> other

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
can tell when watching these other

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.240 
can tell when watching these other
platforming<00:01:34.140> instances<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.979> the

platforming instances that the

platforming instances that the
platforming<00:01:35.790> doesn't<00:01:36.150> look<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:36.420> someone<00:01:36.689> is

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
jumping with the controller Sora is like

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.520 
jumping with the controller Sora is like
hopping<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.840> these<00:01:40.020> little<00:01:40.170> wooden

tiptoeing there's no way that someone's

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.190 
tiptoeing there's no way that someone's
controlling<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.329> that's<00:01:45.570> specifically

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
controlling that that's specifically

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.530 
controlling that that's specifically
same<00:01:47.189> thing<00:01:47.430> where<00:01:47.610> when<00:01:47.759> he's<00:01:47.939> jumping<00:01:48.180> over

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
same thing where when he's jumping over

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.359 
same thing where when he's jumping over
the<00:01:48.659> rocks<00:01:48.869> with<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.590> beautiful<00:01:50.040> view<00:01:50.189> down

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
the rocks with the beautiful view down

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.340 
the rocks with the beautiful view down
below<00:01:50.700> Sora<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.299> doing<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.960> sort<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
below Sora is doing it and sort of a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.920 
below Sora is doing it and sort of a
tiptoe<00:01:52.710> type<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.189> motion<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:54.420> leads<00:01:54.810> me

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
tiptoe type of motion and that leads me

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.480 
tiptoe type of motion and that leads me
to<00:01:54.960> believe<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.320> these<00:01:55.680> segments<00:01:56.189> are<00:01:56.310> also

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
to believe that these segments are also

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.719 
to believe that these segments are also
a<00:01:56.939> demonstration<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.110> free<00:01:58.409> run<00:01:58.740> mechanic

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
a demonstration of the free run mechanic

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.950 
a demonstration of the free run mechanic
because<00:01:59.850> if<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.180> see<00:02:00.329> later<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.780> trailer

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
because if you see later in the trailer

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.130 
because if you see later in the trailer
so<00:02:01.200> actually<00:02:01.619> does<00:02:01.770> do<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> normal<00:02:02.280> jump<00:02:02.700> and

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
so actually does do a normal jump and

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.330 
so actually does do a normal jump and
yeah<00:02:04.140> that's<00:02:04.380> what<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.649> normal<00:02:04.860> jump<00:02:05.189> would

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
yeah that's what a normal jump would

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.880 
yeah that's what a normal jump would
look<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.640> not<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.540> little<00:02:07.110> tiptoe<00:02:07.560> things

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
look like not the little tiptoe things

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.550 
look like not the little tiptoe things
which<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.580> completely<00:02:09.330> recognize<00:02:09.840> now<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.110> be

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
which I completely recognize now to be

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.949 
which I completely recognize now to be
the<00:02:10.800> free<00:02:11.099> run<00:02:11.310> mechanic<00:02:12.030> now<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.690> little

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
the free run mechanic now the little

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.490 
the free run mechanic now the little
sparkle

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
sparkle

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.130 
sparkle

that show up actually remind me a lot of

see these blue sparkles from time to
time<00:02:37.050> on<00:02:37.530> like<00:02:37.890> wires<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:38.580> can<00:02:38.790> walk<00:02:38.970> on

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
time on like wires that you can walk on

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.260 
time on like wires that you can walk on
spiral<00:02:39.750> jumps<00:02:40.080> or<00:02:40.170> whatever<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:41.270> Bentley

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
spiral jumps or whatever and Bentley

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.850 
spiral jumps or whatever and Bentley
would<00:02:42.450> always<00:02:42.630> say<00:02:42.900> jump<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.320> hit<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.560> circle

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
would always say jump and hit the circle

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.770 
would always say jump and hit the circle
button<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.280> remember<00:02:44.730> that's<00:02:45.120> how<00:02:45.270> I<00:02:45.360> pull<00:02:45.630> off

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
button I remember that's how I pull off

button I remember that's how I pull off
some<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:45.989> my<00:02:46.170> best<00:02:46.470> moves<00:02:47.150> at<00:02:48.150> door<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.630> not

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
some of my best moves at door and not

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.830 
some of my best moves at door and not
Sora<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:49.890> it's<00:02:50.100> not<00:02:50.220> Sora<00:02:50.580> Cooper<00:02:50.940> sly<00:02:51.150> with

Sora so it's not Sora Cooper sly with

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.320 
Sora so it's not Sora Cooper sly with
jump<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.440> would<00:02:53.010> do<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.340> associated<00:02:53.970> action

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
jump and would do the associated action

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.000 
jump and would do the associated action
with<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.720> specific<00:02:55.260> thing<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.650> that's<00:02:55.739> what

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
with that specific thing and that's what

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.380 
with that specific thing and that's what
this<00:02:56.610> free<00:02:56.970> run<00:02:57.239> feature<00:02:57.660> is<00:02:59.030> looking<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.209> to

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
this free run feature is looking like to

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.660 
this free run feature is looking like to
me<00:03:00.480> it's<00:03:00.630> looking<00:03:00.930> very<00:03:00.959> sly<00:03:01.560> cooper<00:03:01.830> esque<00:03:02.250> in

Cooper<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:07.950> looks<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.970> much<00:03:09.300> faster<00:03:09.810> like<00:03:09.989> so

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
Cooper this looks so much faster like so

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.979 
Cooper this looks so much faster like so
much<00:03:10.440> faster<00:03:10.800> Sly<00:03:10.980> Cooper<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.400> typically<00:03:11.820> a

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130

what<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.519> mean<00:03:26.580> Sora<00:03:27.000> is<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.510> lot<00:03:27.780> more<00:03:27.989> fast<00:03:28.830> when

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
what I mean Sora is a lot more fast when

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.890 
what I mean Sora is a lot more fast when
he<00:03:29.340> does<00:03:29.610> these<00:03:29.820> little<00:03:30.030> platforming<00:03:30.690> things

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
he does these little platforming things

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.550 
he does these little platforming things
but<00:03:31.560> um<00:03:31.799> this<00:03:32.250> doesn't<00:03:33.019> I<00:03:34.019> doesn't

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
but um this doesn't I doesn't

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.990 
but um this doesn't I doesn't
necessarily<00:03:35.280> lead<00:03:35.459> me<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.730> believe<00:03:35.850> that

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
necessarily lead me to believe that

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.699 
necessarily lead me to believe that
regular<00:03:36.570> platforming<00:03:37.110> is<00:03:37.200> going<00:03:37.350> to<00:03:37.410> be<00:03:37.530> gone

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
regular platforming is going to be gone

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.979 
regular platforming is going to be gone
I<00:03:38.010> hope<00:03:38.730> not<00:03:38.970> but<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.360> know<00:03:39.480> we<00:03:39.600> haven't<00:03:39.810> seen

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
I hope not but you know we haven't seen

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.140 
I hope not but you know we haven't seen
much<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.890> game<00:03:41.040> you<00:03:41.190> can't<00:03:41.400> base<00:03:41.640> regular

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
much of the game you can't base regular

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.490 
much of the game you can't base regular
platforming<00:03:42.720> completely<00:03:43.140> off<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.290> this

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
platforming completely off of this

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.500

trailer so we're still has a high job

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.180 
trailer so we're still has a high job
though<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.019> goes<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:46.410> means<00:03:46.680> something

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
though so it goes that means something

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.100
