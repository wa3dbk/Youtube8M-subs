avocado<00:00:23.189> tree<00:00:23.250> problem<00:00:24.000> during<00:00:24.449> leads<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:27.170> mean

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
avocado tree problem during leads I mean

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.179 
avocado tree problem during leads I mean
you<00:00:28.230> talk<00:00:28.380> about<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.590> final<00:00:29.250> tree<00:00:29.730> avocado

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
you talk about a final tree avocado

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.709 
you talk about a final tree avocado
finally<00:00:32.189> we<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.850> cut<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.059> trees<00:00:33.270> down<00:00:33.300> if

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
finally we have to cut the trees down if

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.240 
finally we have to cut the trees down if
you<00:00:33.840> take<00:00:34.110> them<00:00:34.230> out<00:00:34.290> with<00:00:34.590> too<00:00:34.770> many<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.160> them

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
you take them out with too many of them

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.180 
you take them out with too many of them
they<00:00:35.579> grow<00:00:35.730> too<00:00:35.910> fast<00:00:36.149> too<00:00:36.450> strong<00:00:36.920> bit<00:00:37.920> more

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
they grow too fast too strong bit more

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.500 
they grow too fast too strong bit more
than<00:00:38.340> enough

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.930 

and<00:00:44.379> then<00:00:44.920> what<00:00:45.070> happened<00:00:45.399> at<00:00:45.519> the<00:00:45.640> top<00:00:45.910> of

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
and then what happened at the top of

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.779 
and then what happened at the top of
that<00:00:46.300> chain<00:00:46.719> is<00:00:47.199> our<00:00:47.530> counter<00:00:47.890> power<00:00:48.339> right

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
that chain is our counter power right

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:54.060 
that chain is our counter power right
there<00:00:52.289> because<00:00:53.289> what<00:00:53.469> they're<00:00:53.649> doing<00:00:53.710> all

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
there because what they're doing all

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.319 
there because what they're doing all
those<00:00:54.190> minerals<00:00:54.579> that<00:00:54.670> then<00:00:54.850> get<00:00:55.030> into<00:00:55.210> those

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
those minerals that then get into those

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:56.819 
those minerals that then get into those
plants<00:00:55.750> that<00:00:55.899> these<00:00:56.050> pick<00:00:56.379> up<00:00:56.500> all<00:00:56.680> those

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
plants that these pick up all those

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.349 
plants that these pick up all those
minerals<00:00:57.370> they<00:00:57.640> take<00:00:57.879> it<00:00:58.030> into<00:00:58.149> vitamin

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
minerals they take it into vitamin

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.840 
minerals they take it into vitamin
conducive<00:00:58.960> lack<00:00:59.109> of<00:01:02.280> research<00:01:03.280> on<00:01:03.489> dark<00:01:03.670> on

conducive lack of research on dark on
these<00:01:03.969> you'll<00:01:04.149> see<00:01:04.269> on<00:01:04.390> blinders<00:01:04.869> we<00:01:05.049> research

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
these you'll see on blinders we research

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.170 
these you'll see on blinders we research
it<00:01:05.649> says<00:01:05.950> dark<00:01:06.399> lenders<00:01:06.670> are<00:01:06.759> better<00:01:07.000> than

it says dark lenders are better than

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.460 
it says dark lenders are better than

empty forget it then we take that we

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.029 
empty forget it then we take that we
blend<00:01:24.460> it<00:01:24.550> into<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:25.179> cow<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:26.860> we<00:01:26.920> say

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
blend it into the cow and then we say

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.770 
blend it into the cow and then we say
that<00:01:27.069> we<00:01:27.310> can<00:01:27.610> take<00:01:27.789> a<00:01:28.030> look<00:01:28.360> at<00:01:28.509> amaka

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
you know there's a hormone factor with

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.850 
you know there's a hormone factor with
mineralization<00:01:34.630> we<00:01:35.140> heard<00:01:35.259> that<00:01:35.409> tour<00:01:35.679> before

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
mineralization we heard that tour before

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.830 
mineralization we heard that tour before
you<00:01:36.520> didn't<00:01:36.700> hear<00:01:36.789> for<00:01:36.970> me<00:01:37.060> actually<00:01:37.299> anything

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
you didn't hear for me actually anything

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
equivalent and then you take that you

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.130 
equivalent and then you take that you
put<00:01:45.190> it<00:01:45.280> into<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.670> sunlight<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.539> you<00:01:46.750> drink

honey singh up your copy just do a
bitter<00:01:50.709> press<00:01:51.039> one<00:01:51.220> and<00:01:51.459> then<00:01:51.910> you<00:01:52.179> could<00:01:52.390> load

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
bitter press one and then you could load

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.089 
bitter press one and then you could load
what<00:01:52.780> I<00:01:52.840> money<00:01:53.020> or<00:01:53.170> whatever<00:01:53.440> you<00:01:53.739> want<00:01:53.920> in
