00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.650
 gambling presents 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.760
 welcome to cronos 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.930
 galactic polygon don't live here 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.420
 here only these battles fight 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.880
 determine the fate of dozens of planets each 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.730
 time with the death of the galactic ruler 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.599
 empire claimants to the throne 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.689
 send troops here 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.600
 the one who takes over the planet will be new 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.870
 emperor but planning scale 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.989
 campaigns and the more war for 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.110
 succession 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.630
 not at all about us modest 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.140
 officer role tactic commander 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.090
 our planetâ€™s surface operations 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.670
 full tooling services 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.440
 stepping mode card broken into 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.350
 hexagons hex and 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.750
 and several troops and 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.660
 the number of the army is exactly as much as 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.630
 need to perform a combat mission and not 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.080
 fighter more be captured by enemy 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.630
 bases 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.259
 destroying a specific target defense 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.869
 important milestone or anything else the game 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.780
 don't waste time introducing us to the course 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.289
 To do this, press the left button to select 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.170
 fighter 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:24.530
 press right to give the order here 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.569
 all learning yes at first we will see 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.869
 a lot of tooltips 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:32.929
 like this you need to capture buildings like this 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.780
 repair the equipment but the task will be 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:38.539
 the most that either there is no fighting 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.909
 discounts on inexperience is the second mission 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.729
 will put before us an almost impracticable 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.670
 a task that not every tactician will solve 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.020
 at least from the second attempt to beginners in the genre 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.329
 will be hard 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.219
 however, even an experienced war gamer 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.429
 will have to get used to the original 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:58.039
 control system for every fighter here 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.060
 There are two action points and they are 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.299
 different types 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.539
 attack move or joker which 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.539
 can spend for anything that's easy 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.910
 tank cerberus with it all just during 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.700
 move it can move once and 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.670
 shoot once but brisk 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.220
 rocket bugs rogue he is much more 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.360
 flexible can drive a little and 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.030
 can shoot palnut twice while standing 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.060
 on the spot and can spend both actions 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.120
 to move classic wargame ah 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.879
 sort of panzer general battle tied 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.750
 on the use of terrain giving advantages 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.519
 or minuses to the characteristics of the units 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.189
 to the futuristic soldiers of kronos on 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.890
 local with almost spit for them 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:48.500
 the landscape only affects the permeability and 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.870
 movement speed and success in battle 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.930
 achieved by proper construction and 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.329
 skillful positioning and that is 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.489
 several reasons first 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.310
 surrounded by a soldier gets much 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.739
 more damage the more enemies are worth 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.590
 next to him the more vulnerable he becomes 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.390
 Secondly, almost every fighter 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.819
 your attack range 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.099
 for example rocket launchers beat on 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.040
 whole three cells but absolutely 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.469
 helpless point blank wounded 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.159
 soldier or damaged combat vehicle 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:24.170
 shoot weaker than healthy 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:27.230
 this means that all things being equal 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.769
 advantage always then who hit 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.170
 the first 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.569
 well, by itself every kind of troops 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.599
 effective against certain 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.790
 opponents heavy tank turns into 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.620
 dust of their light brothers but from 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.620
 bombers are shooting back 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.200
 unconvincingly these seemingly simple 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.109
 rules make you eventually plan 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.599
 most difficult tactics who block 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.219
 enemy tanks so they don't break through 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.469
 to allied artillery 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:56.900
 where to place bugs to give them 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:58.340
 ability to shoot and at the same time save 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.590
 them from return fire 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.930
 where to send an airstrike to 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.319
 bombers managed to return to base 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.870
 before the fuel runs out of errors 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.769
 kronos doesn't forgive here is not even 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.299
 the usual buttons cancel 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.719
 autosave does not work every 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.900
 move 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:20.209
 but the plot is simple and rather naive 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.980
 manifests itself with unexpectedly good 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.350
 hand he is original 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.389
 that is, it does not boil down to the expected 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.990
 here we have a war so let's 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.419
 destroy all enemies 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.400
 to the glory of the future emperor us 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.000
 throw a couple of unexpected turns 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.849
 and most importantly provide a mountain of dialogue right 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.819
 during missions kronos is real 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.979
 gift for all lovers of step by step 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:46.259
 strategies and no matter how funny this 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.020
 lies and the main disadvantage of the game she 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:51.539
 totally adapted to that 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.789
 someone other than connoisseurs will play it 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:59.389
 if you don't like turn-based strategies 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:59.389
 as we love them, we boldly pass by 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.990
 Mama
