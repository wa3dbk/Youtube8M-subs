00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.310 
cool the only downside is the game is
more<00:05:36.940> style<00:05:37.390> over<00:05:37.720> substance<00:05:37.750> and<00:05:38.640> sadly<00:05:39.640> is

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
more style over substance and sadly is

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.990 
more style over substance and sadly is
kind<00:05:41.320> of<00:05:41.500> following<00:05:41.890> in<00:05:42.040> the<00:05:42.130> footsteps<00:05:42.669> as<00:05:42.970> a

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
kind of following in the footsteps as a

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.940 
kind of following in the footsteps as a
third<00:05:43.300> and<00:05:43.540> first<00:05:43.780> person<00:05:44.260> shooter<00:05:44.650> I<00:05:44.680> don't

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
third and first person shooter I don't

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.520 
third and first person shooter I don't
want<00:05:45.070> to<00:05:45.160> keep<00:05:45.280> saying<00:05:45.580> it<00:05:45.729> but<00:05:45.760> it<00:05:46.000> is<00:05:46.530> and

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
want to keep saying it but it is and

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.750 
want to keep saying it but it is and
it's<00:05:47.680> just<00:05:47.890> like<00:05:48.070> a<00:05:48.100> down<00:05:48.660> full<00:05:49.660> crash<00:05:50.760> it

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
it's just like a down full crash it

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.370 
it's just like a down full crash it
simply<00:05:52.180> wasn't<00:05:52.330> the<00:05:52.510> Ace<00:05:52.630> Combat<00:05:52.840> I<00:05:53.229> was

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
simply wasn't the Ace Combat I was

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.960 
simply wasn't the Ace Combat I was
expecting<00:05:53.740> so<00:05:54.130> although<00:05:54.310> I<00:05:54.520> give<00:05:54.790> it<00:05:54.880> a<00:05:54.910> six

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
expecting so although I give it a six

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.610 
expecting so although I give it a six
