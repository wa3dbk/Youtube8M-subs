00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
450 degree temperature I did deep

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.510 
450 degree temperature I did deep
condition<00:02:52.390> my<00:02:52.420> hair<00:02:52.720> first

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.630 

applying<00:02:56.850> heat<00:02:57.270> I<00:02:57.510> would<00:02:58.380> suggest<00:02:58.530> never<00:02:59.220> heat

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
applying heat I would suggest never heat

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.270 
applying heat I would suggest never heat
style<00:03:00.000> your<00:03:00.180> hair<00:03:00.420> without<00:03:01.170> doing<00:03:01.710> a<00:03:01.860> deep

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
conditioning first I guess in a sense

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.080 
conditioning first I guess in a sense
deep<00:03:05.790> conditioning<00:03:06.330> is<00:03:06.510> my<00:03:06.840> heat<00:03:07.050> protectant

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
deep conditioning is my heat protectant

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.160 
deep conditioning is my heat protectant
