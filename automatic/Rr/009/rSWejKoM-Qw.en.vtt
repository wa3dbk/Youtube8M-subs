00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.680
 hello everyone from technophone diego to 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.180
 punto it this day I show you the two 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.240
 accessories that I got into 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.450
 tribute from samsung because why I have 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.520
 booked at the time the galaxy s 6 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.070
 I registered it on yes on the samsung site 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.710
 people and cannot then or validated the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.420
 my proof of purchase and this is 1 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.329
 May the welcome tribute that was 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.120
 reserved, let's tell everyone 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.780
 these passages there is also the claire 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.390
 cover because if in the past you have 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.699
 purchased a galaxy smartphone galaxy e 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.149
 you have registered on the samsung in site 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.710
 tribute in addition to the top-up of 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.750
 wireless charger itself was also the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.859
 claire cover but call to ciance e 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.839
 this is the note where made a 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.530
 thanks we go to open the two 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.970
 packaging and begin with the cover of the 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.800
 cover is a clear product 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.560
 samsung original and it's a cover really 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.380
 beautiful and elegant as you see design 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.170
 very very minimal and protects the edges i 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.810
 sides of the smartphone are not protected 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.750
 however once we insert into the 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.580
 galaxy s 6 the effect is really great 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.460
 stuff 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.700
 as you can see the profile remains unchanged 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.160
 we have this shiny effect that when 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.290
 there is the sun that unfortunately is missing today 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.700
 we see the color that varies from black to 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.190
 blue in a really very much way 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.030
 very beautiful and first of all we have one 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.690
 very good handling of the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.750
 device 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.580
 also because we always go anyway 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.690
 have the grip on the metal that it is anyway 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.700
 really a great grip this cover is the 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.920
 I see very minimal and protects the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.490
 device clearly only in 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.140
 corners 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.820
 it's not really one of those covers 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.350
 protective though I have to say that really 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.720
 very beautiful especially when it 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:12.150
 support the camera remains 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.750
 inside as you see it remains 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.680
 slightly submitted ok so not 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.390
 we risk ruining 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.799
 at the base we say that then it goes to touch 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.269
 always when we put it on a 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.459
 coffee table and the same when it 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.590
 we lean down there are the 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.260
 protruding edges prevent it from being 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.819
 display go to touch to say on the 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.400
 surface so this is the first one 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.150
 accessory that really very nice are 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.519
 very happy 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.040
 I was joking and having received it we go to 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.620
 see the wireless charger instead 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.349
 wireless charger that looks like 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.420
 a ufo is really very nice 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.329
 practically and its operation is 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.269
 as trivial as it is simple or 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:55.400
 we connect any battery charger 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.799
 you don't need to use that 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.400
 samsung clearly if there was one 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.200
 possibility to add it immediately to the first one 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.849
 towards the wrong once connected 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:11.060
 at the charger we place it in the center 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.530
 I'll take a good one and start charging 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.689
 The charging time is a little more 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.079
 long will not be like using the 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:19.519
 quick charger as you see about 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.409
 mine in completing the top-up 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.659
 I am now at 30 percent so there 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:26.109
 it takes about two and a half hours 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:30.169
 very beautiful is this led you see 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:32.540
 turned on that when in charge of this 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.729
 value while at the end 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.709
 charging turns green and nothing like this 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:39.319
 on the bedside table it is really very very cool 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.889
 in accessory that bought separately costs 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.799
 70 euros so really a great May 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.299
 as far as samsung is concerned 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.669
 finally understood that the tributes 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.349
 they must be done at day one 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:53.569
 or rather to those who buy first 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.739
 that those who lakes after maybe me 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.389
 I'd do them even to those whose 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.579
 story after but maybe a little bit more 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.900
 in there so maybe and my name is that 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.449
 devaluation that is always with i 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.780
 samsung devices for the moment is 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.919
 all 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.919
 hello from diego
