00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:08.750
 It 's the 6th time I've got a mother-of-pear vending machine . 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.559
 I have a cameraman right now. 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:19.070
 It used to be two. 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:22.270
 It 's the shortest vending machine I've ever made. 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.270
 There is such a work 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.470
 And the simplest is the simplest. 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.769
 I am 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.769

 I'm sorry . 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:46.170
 So here is the reason for this . 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.410
 It comes out. 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.410
 because 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:56.210
 now 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.210
 Pulling out the coin got rid of the lock. 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.649
 I can get out of here like this. 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:09.860
 Designers who look only at their writers do more fitting 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.860
 It's easy. One more. 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.930
 Ah 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:21.860

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:32.630
 That I may cause errors shoulder 2 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:35.080
 Minus real tone, it could lose its way gently placed his press 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.420
 It's not a bad thing. 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:42.100
 Let's dry it a couple of times. 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.670
 Oh, I think I 'm excellent here. 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.670
 Please access 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.040
 This is a bad thing . 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.280
 I do not have a thorough security 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.540
 character 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.540
 I 'll let you know. 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.549
 My father 9 as you can see 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.149
 So that's how it is. 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:11.769
 So now 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:15.730
 Only one coin is pushed back. 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:18.750
 Can you only fall so the brain can press 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.750

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.069
 Here they glows 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:34.799
 Another annex Why Own 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.220
 So this is so going back again for the Deaf 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.210
 Is that it? 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.210
 The principle is simple 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.870
 character 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.670
