hey<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.660> jg<00:00:13.049> i'm<00:00:13.259> over<00:00:13.530> at<00:00:13.650> BMC<00:00:14.099> working

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
hey this is jg i'm over at BMC working

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.279 
hey this is jg i'm over at BMC working
on<00:00:14.580> some<00:00:14.759> prototypes<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.480> fish<00:00:15.719> we<00:00:16.109> got<00:00:16.260> a

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
on some prototypes of the fish we got a

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.840 
on some prototypes of the fish we got a
few<00:00:16.650> different<00:00:17.010> features<00:00:17.340> coming<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.789> you

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
few different features coming that you

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.429 
few different features coming that you
haven't<00:00:18.060> seen<00:00:18.270> before<00:00:18.300> throughout<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.260> last

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
haven't seen before throughout the last

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.870 
haven't seen before throughout the last
couple<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.770> years<00:00:19.830> I've<00:00:20.250> been<00:00:20.310> working<00:00:20.789> on

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
couple of years I've been working on

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.939 
couple of years I've been working on
some<00:00:21.270> different<00:00:21.630> tale<00:00:21.990> shapes<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.680> first

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
some different tale shapes the first

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.439 
some different tale shapes the first
shape<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.760> came<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.510> was<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.140> deep<00:00:25.680> swallowtail

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
shape I came to was the deep swallowtail

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.820 
shape I came to was the deep swallowtail
you<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.570> see<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.869> deep<00:00:28.050> swallowtail<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
you can see the deep swallowtail in the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.490 
you can see the deep swallowtail in the
resemblance<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.609> my<00:00:29.789> 510<00:00:30.300> fish<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.320> that

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
resemblance of my 510 fish and that

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.680 
resemblance of my 510 fish and that
allows<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> lot<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.460> snow<00:00:32.669> devine<00:00:33.030> released<00:00:33.480> out

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
allows a lot of snow devine released out

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.270 
allows a lot of snow devine released out
of<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.899> tail<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.770> worked<00:00:34.980> really<00:00:35.160> good

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
of the tail and this worked really good

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.280 
of the tail and this worked really good
for<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.670> deep<00:00:35.850> snow<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.600> made<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.050> little

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
for the deep snow it made it a little

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.560 
for the deep snow it made it a little
bit<00:00:37.469> too<00:00:37.590> twitchy<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.280> landings<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.300> next

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
bit too twitchy on landings the next

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.049 
bit too twitchy on landings the next
tale<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.020> came<00:00:40.469> up<00:00:40.530> with<00:00:40.710> what<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.610> called<00:00:41.969> a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
tale that I came up with what I called a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.389 
tale that I came up with what I called a
mini<00:00:42.239> swallow<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.620> based<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.040> directly

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
mini swallow and it based this directly

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.930 
mini swallow and it based this directly
off<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.930> Maya<00:00:45.930> 64<00:00:46.559> flyer<00:00:46.920> there<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.550> this

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
off the Maya 64 flyer there and this

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.450 
off the Maya 64 flyer there and this
tale<00:00:48.300> allows<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.410> pad<00:00:49.860> will<00:00:50.039> sink<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.340> little

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
tale allows the pad will sink a little

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.160 
tale allows the pad will sink a little
bit<00:00:50.640> more<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:50.940> powder<00:00:51.239> which<00:00:51.809> brings<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
bit more on the powder which brings the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.439 
bit more on the powder which brings the
nose<00:00:52.469> up<00:00:52.770> also<00:00:53.160> aesthetically<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.969> was<00:00:54.180> one

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
nose up also aesthetically this was one

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.510 
nose up also aesthetically this was one
that<00:00:54.660> seemed<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> work<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.379> best<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:56.250> next

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
that seemed to work the best the next

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.400 
that seemed to work the best the next
tale<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.940> did<00:00:57.180> was<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.510> squash<00:00:57.809> tail<00:00:58.170> and

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
tale that I did was the squash tail and

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.139 
tale that I did was the squash tail and
this<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.160> coming<00:00:59.399> right<00:00:59.609> from<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> squash

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
this is it coming right from the squash

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.090 
this is it coming right from the squash
tail<00:01:00.449> off<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.809> flyer<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:01.890> worked

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
tail off the flyer this one worked

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.189 
tail off the flyer this one worked
really<00:01:02.370> great<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> landings<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:03.870> not<00:01:04.019> so

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
really great on the landings but not so

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.960 
really great on the landings but not so
much<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.530> turn<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.309> next<00:01:05.460> tale<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.909> I

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
much in the turn the next tale that I

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.300 
much in the turn the next tale that I
did<00:01:06.210> was<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.049> ck<00:01:07.470> tail<00:01:07.740> based<00:01:08.070> off<00:01:08.280> of

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
did was the the ck tail based off of

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.370 
did was the the ck tail based off of
someone<00:01:08.670> Craig<00:01:08.850> Kelly's<00:01:09.240> old<00:01:09.420> boards<00:01:09.869> which<00:01:10.229> I

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
someone Craig Kelly's old boards which I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.320 
someone Craig Kelly's old boards which I
knew<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.710> tail<00:01:10.920> worked<00:01:11.189> really<00:01:11.430> well<00:01:11.580> this

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
knew the tail worked really well this

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.719 
knew the tail worked really well this
one<00:01:12.630> made<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> tail<00:01:13.500> seem<00:01:13.770> really<00:01:14.220> loose<00:01:14.460> for

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
one made the tail seem really loose for

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.370 
one made the tail seem really loose for
slashing<00:01:15.060> could<00:01:15.420> really<00:01:15.720> punch<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.140> tail

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
slashing could really punch the tail

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.140 
slashing could really punch the tail
into<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.799> turn<00:01:17.009> but<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.580> were<00:01:17.670> slowing<00:01:17.939> them

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
into the turn but you were slowing them

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.670 
into the turn but you were slowing them
down<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.390> little<00:01:18.720> bit<00:01:18.900> too<00:01:19.049> much<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.470> term

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
down a little bit too much in the term

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.280 
down a little bit too much in the term
when<00:01:19.890> you'd<00:01:20.040> come<00:01:20.070> out<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:22.020> next

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
when you'd come out of it the next

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.260 
when you'd come out of it the next
boards<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> stock<00:01:23.159> fish<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.090> is

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
boards the stock fish and this is

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.899 
boards the stock fish and this is
resemblance<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.290> some<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> other<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
resemblance to some of the other to the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.960 
resemblance to some of the other to the
M<00:01:27.119> 13s<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.049> some<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.470> other<00:01:28.650> round<00:01:28.979> round

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
M 13s and some of the other round round

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.690 
M 13s and some of the other round round
pin<00:01:30.299> tailed<00:01:30.540> surfboards<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.549> where

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
pin tailed surfboards so this is where

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.690 
pin tailed surfboards so this is where
we<00:01:32.790> ended<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.619> 2009<00:01:34.619> fish<00:01:35.100> with<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> mini

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
we ended up the 2009 fish with the mini

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.120 
we ended up the 2009 fish with the mini
swallowtail<00:01:36.329> ICS<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.560> s<00:01:37.680> camber<00:01:38.100> shape

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
swallowtail ICS and the s camber shape

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.399 
swallowtail ICS and the s camber shape
while<00:01:38.610> tail<00:01:38.909> here<00:01:39.240> really<00:01:39.780> allows<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.200> board

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
while tail here really allows the board

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.679 
while tail here really allows the board
to<00:01:40.670> you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.820> stick<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.150> tail<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> little<00:01:42.479> bit

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
to you can stick the tail a little bit

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.749 
to you can stick the tail a little bit
