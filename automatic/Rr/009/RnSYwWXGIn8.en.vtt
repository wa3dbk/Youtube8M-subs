going to need two of these eight of

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.140 
going to need two of these eight of
these

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.690 

12<00:00:19.840> of<00:00:20.080> these

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.310 

three<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.510> these

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.230 

one<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.439> these

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.240 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:39.150 

one<00:00:32.810> of<00:00:32.960> these

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:46.200 

and<00:00:40.230> one<00:00:41.230> of<00:00:41.410> these

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.090 

let's<00:00:46.660> get<00:00:46.840> started<00:00:47.070> name<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.219> top<00:00:48.430> and<00:00:49.000> get

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
let's get started name the top and get

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.010 
let's get started name the top and get
both<00:00:51.100> of<00:00:51.280> these<00:00:51.510> stick<00:00:52.510> them<00:00:52.629> together<00:00:52.780> like

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
both of these stick them together like

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.770 
both of these stick them together like
that<00:00:53.850> then<00:00:54.850> stick<00:00:55.449> on<00:00:56.100> top<00:00:57.100> it<00:00:57.340> like<00:00:57.730> that<00:00:57.790> so

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
that then stick on top it like that so

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.869 
that then stick on top it like that so
that's<00:00:59.019> the<00:00:59.170> top<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.940> you<00:01:01.690> need<00:01:01.840> to<00:01:01.989> stick<00:01:02.260> on

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
that's the top and you need to stick on

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.620 
that's the top and you need to stick on
all<00:01:03.879> these<00:01:04.210> bits<00:01:04.659> around<00:01:04.900> the<00:01:05.229> edge<00:01:06.420> make<00:01:07.420> sure

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
all these bits around the edge make sure

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.580 
all these bits around the edge make sure
you<00:01:07.750> don't<00:01:07.899> use<00:01:08.259> all<00:01:08.560> of<00:01:09.250> them<00:01:09.490> at<00:01:09.729> these<00:01:10.590> as

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
you don't use all of them at these as

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.940 
you don't use all of them at these as
you<00:01:11.740> need<00:01:11.920> them<00:01:11.950> flare<00:01:12.640> up

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.610 

then

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.310 

then

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.020 

yeah<00:01:27.110> all<00:01:28.110> right<00:01:28.260> there<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.800> is<00:01:28.890> I'm<00:01:29.159> missing<00:01:29.970> a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
yeah all right there it is I'm missing a

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.600 
yeah all right there it is I'm missing a
piece<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:31.500> could<00:01:31.710> include<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.340> that

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
piece so you could include that that

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.570 
piece so you could include that that
would<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:32.760> great<00:01:33.860> all<00:01:34.860> right<00:01:35.120> next<00:01:36.120> you<00:01:36.420> need

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
would be great all right next you need

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:46.960 
would be great all right next you need
fill<00:01:38.580> out<00:01:40.520> this<00:01:41.520> bit<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.780> then<00:01:46.140> all

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
fill out this bit like this so then all

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.860 
fill out this bit like this so then all
happen<00:01:47.970> is

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:02:08.230 

you'll<00:01:51.500> get<00:01:51.770> something<00:01:53.890> which<00:01:54.890> looks<00:01:55.250> like

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.980 

get<00:02:08.870> something<00:02:09.350> like<00:02:09.470> that

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
get something like that

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.190 
get something like that
but<00:02:11.650> this<00:02:12.460> is<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.030> fusion<00:02:13.390> wheel<00:02:13.630> isn't<00:02:13.960> like

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
but this is a fusion wheel isn't like

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.520 
but this is a fusion wheel isn't like
that<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:15.060> take<00:02:16.060> some<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.630> blocks<00:02:16.900> off<00:02:17.200> and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
that so take some of the blocks off and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.200 
that so take some of the blocks off and
replace<00:02:17.890> them<00:02:18.070> with<00:02:18.600> these<00:02:20.850> need<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:22.060> make

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
replace them with these need to make

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:31.840 
replace them with these need to make
sure<00:02:22.240> that's<00:02:22.840> free<00:02:23.110> gaps<00:02:24.180> fusion<00:02:25.180> wheel

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:43.400 

that<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:32.600> cool

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.460 

right<00:02:44.040> but<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.520> that's<00:02:45.360> my<00:02:45.870> fusion<00:02:46.350> wheel

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
right but that that's my fusion wheel

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.180 
right but that that's my fusion wheel
which<00:02:46.710> I<00:02:46.830> need<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:49.170> can<00:02:49.350> make<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.650> however<00:02:49.770> you

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
which I need you can make it however you

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.770 
which I need you can make it however you
like<00:02:51.050> then<00:02:52.070> stick<00:02:53.070> on<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.550> little<00:02:54.120> all<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.600> way

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
like then stick on a little all the way

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:03.170 
like then stick on a little all the way
out<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:57.080> make<00:02:58.080> sure<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.860> that<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.150> a

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
out to make sure that that that is a

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.570 
out to make sure that that that is a
little<00:03:03.570> dent<00:03:03.930> because<00:03:04.680> if<00:03:04.890> there<00:03:05.070> is<00:03:05.190> an<00:03:05.400> oil

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
little dent because if there is an oil

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:13.310 
little dent because if there is an oil
dim<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.630> won't<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:08.280> won't<00:03:08.340> be<00:03:08.790> partly<00:03:12.320> little

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
dim it won't it won't be partly little

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.050 
dim it won't it won't be partly little
dink<00:03:13.590> means<00:03:14.070> that<00:03:14.490> it's<00:03:14.790> um<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:17.060> it's

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
dink means that it's um that it's

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.110 
dink means that it's um that it's
finishing<00:03:18.950> so<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.010> need<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.520> make<00:03:20.550> sure<00:03:20.730> that

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
finishing so you need to make sure that

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:28.210 
finishing so you need to make sure that
there's<00:03:21.420> some<00:03:21.930> dents<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.560> them<00:03:22.790> whoa<00:03:23.790> all<00:03:24.360> that

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.130 

not<00:03:29.220> having<00:03:29.370> very<00:03:29.760> much<00:03:30.090> look<00:03:30.540> for<00:03:30.750> this<00:03:30.900> one

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
not having very much look for this one

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:41.590 
not having very much look for this one
you<00:03:32.000> might<00:03:33.000> have<00:03:33.300> looked<00:03:33.720> with<00:03:33.930> yours<00:03:34.170> but

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.930 

really<00:03:42.380> all<00:03:42.500> I<00:03:42.770> say<00:03:43.190> it's<00:03:43.490> hot<00:03:43.910> it's<00:03:44.360> it's<00:03:44.840> hard

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
really all I say it's hot it's it's hard

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.640 
really all I say it's hot it's it's hard
because<00:03:46.940> Pegasus<00:03:47.510> is<00:03:47.660> one<00:03:47.870> of<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.110> hard<00:03:48.350> bass

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
because Pegasus is one of the hard bass

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.640 
because Pegasus is one of the hard bass
to<00:03:48.920> create<00:03:50.500> so<00:03:51.500> I'm<00:03:51.710> making<00:03:51.890> as<00:03:52.190> best<00:03:52.460> as<00:03:52.640> I<00:03:52.760> can

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
to create so I'm making as best as I can

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.770 
to create so I'm making as best as I can
but<00:03:54.650> that's<00:03:55.550> my<00:03:55.790> steering<00:03:56.180> wheel<00:03:56.210> then

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
but that's my steering wheel then

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.120 
but that's my steering wheel then
underneath<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.830> fill<00:03:58.130> it<00:03:58.250> in<00:03:59.080> so<00:04:00.080> no<00:04:00.890> one

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
underneath and fill it in so no one

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.520 
underneath and fill it in so no one
there<00:04:02.860> then<00:04:03.860> there<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:05.510> might<00:04:05.720> not<00:04:05.900> use<00:04:06.200> some

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
there then there you might not use some

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.660 
there then there you might not use some
of<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.680> big<00:04:06.920> pieces<00:04:07.310> but<00:04:07.940> just<00:04:08.750> make<00:04:08.990> sure

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
of the big pieces but just make sure

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.220 
of the big pieces but just make sure
these<00:04:10.670> are<00:04:10.850> all<00:04:10.970> pieces<00:04:11.270> which<00:04:11.570> I<00:04:11.720> started<00:04:12.110> off

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
these are all pieces which I started off
