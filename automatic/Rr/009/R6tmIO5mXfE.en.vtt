00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
going to talk about how we can start to

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.990 
going to talk about how we can start to
do<00:01:09.899> all<00:01:10.140> these<00:01:10.350> different<00:01:10.649> shifts<00:01:11.460> so

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
do all these different shifts so

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.850 
do all these different shifts so
basically<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.509> shift<00:01:12.869> between<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.350> right<00:01:13.590> hand

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
basically a shift between the right hand

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.499 
basically a shift between the right hand
and<00:01:14.039> the<00:01:14.100> left<00:01:14.160> hand<00:01:14.520> bringing<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.970> both<00:01:15.180> hands

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
and the left hand bringing in both hands

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
but then creating that rhythmic of

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.350 
but then creating that rhythmic of
fluidity<00:01:20.160> and<00:01:20.399> you're<00:01:20.580> playing<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.240> when
