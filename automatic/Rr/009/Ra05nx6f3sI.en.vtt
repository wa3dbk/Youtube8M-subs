00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
 without 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.500
 the astronomer is almost certain 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.840
 that there is no life in our solar system except on earth in mine 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.839
 Man maybe outside of ours 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.249
 the system is 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:17.429
 In order to pursue this question one must look into the depths of the universe 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.619
 for example with the huge telescope in Kahla attitude in Spain 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.410
 Felix and Peter are allowed to see the telescope up close and 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.649
 are impressed 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.970
 The telescope is so large that it extends over several floors 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.970
 At one end sits a highly sensitive camera 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.550
 The most important component, however, first shows up in the researchers' telescope 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.850
 have aligned 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.600
 Protection slats open and give the view of the heart of the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.080
 Telescopes free 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.330
 a three and a half meter big hat mirror 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.050
 By now the camera, every point of light from the space far beyond the 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.200
 magnified a thousand times the mirror reflects the light to the camera 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.230
 the lead the picture into the computer the astronomer 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.690
 Season tickets for Sous Le Pen is to look at the shots from space and 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.160
 evaluate 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.110
 Somewhat more interesting in Romania seems to be the photos and films sent to 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.890
 Colleagues around the world 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.860
 After Felix and Peter have looked at the telescope they go to 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.340
 Christ praise St. in the command center 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.360
 he shows the two the pictures he made today are stars too 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.869
 see 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.869
 some of which may not exist anymore 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.799
 because the light that they have sent out takes many years to get it 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.909
 Earth reaches so we sometimes see stars that are long gone extinct 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.510
 with the telescope you can not only recognize stars and planets 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.560
 in the depths of that it will take from the gas around in countless others 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.019
 galaxies 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.930
 So good shots can make the telescope in Kahla old and not always often 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.509
 the station shrouded in clouds for several days 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:18.209
 Picture and the view should obstruct
