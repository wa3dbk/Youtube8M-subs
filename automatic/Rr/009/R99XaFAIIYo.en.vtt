we have been looking for some

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.830 
we have been looking for some
consistency<00:00:14.760> offensively<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.570> we<00:00:15.660> knew<00:00:15.809> that

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
consistency offensively and we knew that

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.160 
consistency offensively and we knew that
come<00:00:16.320> into<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.740> game<00:00:17.270> we<00:00:18.270> have<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.840> control

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
come into this game we have to control

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.230 
come into this game we have to control
the<00:00:19.380> football<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.980> keep<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.640> offense<00:00:21.060> off

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
the football and keep that offense off

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.420 
the football and keep that offense off
the<00:00:21.270> field<00:00:21.450> I<00:00:21.779> thought<00:00:21.960> we<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.920> started<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
the field I thought we we started the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.370 
the field I thought we we started the
game<00:00:23.610> on<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> long<00:00:24.210> drive<00:00:24.450> which<00:00:24.810> kind<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.169> set

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
game on a long drive which kind of set

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.439 
game on a long drive which kind of set
the<00:00:25.410> tone<00:00:25.560> for<00:00:25.770> the<00:00:26.130> game<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.340> limiting<00:00:27.210> some

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
the tone for the game and limiting some

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.259 
the tone for the game and limiting some
possessions<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:28.199> them<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:29.550> think<00:00:30.000> that

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
possessions for them and I think that

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.710 
possessions for them and I think that
really<00:00:30.300> helped<00:00:30.779> kind<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.050> set<00:00:31.320> us<00:00:31.560> into<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.720> you

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
really helped kind of set us into a you

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.750 
really helped kind of set us into a you
know<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> flow<00:00:34.620> offensively<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.580> then

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
know a flow offensively and then

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.009 
know a flow offensively and then
defensively<00:00:37.129> you<00:00:38.129> know<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.900> thought<00:00:39.900> we<00:00:39.989> played

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
difficult offense to to defend and do so

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.210

this week I don't think you timid was
just<00:01:34.620> this<00:01:34.740> week<00:01:34.980> I<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.310> felt<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.610> we<00:01:35.790> were

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
just this week I just felt like we were

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.040 
just this week I just felt like we were
getting<00:01:36.240> better<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.770> know<00:01:37.890> not<00:01:38.850> not<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
getting better you know not not to the

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.950 
getting better you know not not to the
level<00:01:40.230> where<00:01:40.909> we<00:01:41.909> feel<00:01:42.120> like<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.480> arrived

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
level where we feel like we have arrived

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.830 
level where we feel like we have arrived
we<00:01:43.350> think<00:01:43.590> there's<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.950> lot<00:01:44.250> left<00:01:44.700> out<00:01:45.540> there

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
we think there's a lot left out there

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.350 
we think there's a lot left out there
that<00:01:46.050> needs<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.440> get<00:01:46.590> better<00:01:47.360> certainly

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
that needs to get better certainly

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.020 
that needs to get better certainly
disappointed<00:01:48.900> to<00:01:49.050> to<00:01:49.980> lose<00:01:50.159> jerk<00:01:50.460> race<00:01:50.760> today

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.000 
disappointed to to lose jerk race today
it<00:01:51.270> looks<00:01:51.300> like<00:01:51.570> he's<00:01:51.840> probably<00:01:52.530> going<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.920> be

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
it looks like he's probably going to be

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.690 
it looks like he's probably going to be
lost<00:01:53.159> for<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.460> season<00:01:54.770> but<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.340> know<00:01:56.430> Danny

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.669 
a pass rush today that we hadn't seen
most<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.580> year<00:02:08.879> which<00:02:09.390> obviously<00:02:09.810> changes

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
most of the year which obviously changes

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.590 
most of the year which obviously changes
the<00:02:10.799> way<00:02:10.920> we<00:02:10.950> look

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
the way we look

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.290 
the way we look
late<00:02:11.930> I<00:02:12.740> thought<00:02:13.310> we<00:02:13.430> triggered<00:02:13.850> much<00:02:14.030> better

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
late I thought we triggered much better

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.980 
late I thought we triggered much better
in<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.600> secondary<00:02:15.080> tackled<00:02:16.570> much<00:02:17.570> better<00:02:17.840> as

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
in the secondary tackled much better as

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.950 
in the secondary tackled much better as
well<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:19.130> guess<00:02:19.460> to<00:02:19.640> go<00:02:19.820> strictly<00:02:20.720> to

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
well and and I guess to go strictly to

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.930 
well and and I guess to go strictly to
your<00:02:21.080> question<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.560> just<00:02:21.590> felt<00:02:22.040> like<00:02:22.130> the
