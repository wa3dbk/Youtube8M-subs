00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.050 
stay on the strings that we need for
this<00:01:41.539> example<00:01:42.009> so<00:01:43.009> let's<00:01:43.159> look<00:01:43.310> at<00:01:43.430> example<00:01:43.880> 1

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
this example so let's look at example 1

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.630 
this example so let's look at example 1
the<00:01:44.240> tablature<00:01:44.799> now<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:45.920> 5<00:01:46.250> that's<00:01:46.490> in

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
the tablature now the 5 that's in

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.880 
the tablature now the 5 that's in
parenthesis<00:01:47.180> on<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.360> 4th<00:01:47.659> string<00:01:47.929> 4<00:01:48.259> now<00:01:48.439> take

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
parenthesis on the 4th string 4 now take

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.169 
parenthesis on the 4th string 4 now take
away<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.189> parentheses<00:01:49.610> I'll<00:01:49.789> explain<00:01:50.030> what

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
away the parentheses I'll explain what

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.880 
away the parentheses I'll explain what
that's<00:01:50.360> about<00:01:50.450> in<00:01:50.659> just<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:50.990> minute<00:01:51.020> you're

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
that's about in just a minute you're

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.789 
that's about in just a minute you're
going<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.100> start<00:01:52.399> off<00:01:52.579> playing<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:54.500> we<00:01:54.619> want

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
going to start off playing and we want

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.169 
going to start off playing and we want
this<00:01:54.890> heart<00:01:55.130> beat<00:01:55.369> feel<00:01:55.579> so<00:01:55.789> we<00:01:55.909> play<00:01:56.119> two

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
this heart beat feel so we play two

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:02.230 
this heart beat feel so we play two
voices<00:01:56.600> then<00:01:57.259> one<00:02:00.579> just<00:02:01.579> get<00:02:01.729> that<00:02:01.909> going

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
voices then one just get that going

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.080 
voices then one just get that going
that's<00:02:03.229> just<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.679> first<00:02:03.920> three<00:02:04.579> lines<00:02:05.179> of<00:02:07.090> the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
that's just the first three lines of the

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.020 
that's just the first three lines of the
five<00:02:08.330> seven<00:02:08.840> eight<00:02:09.049> the<00:02:09.530> GE<00:02:09.769> a<00:02:10.039> B<00:02:10.369> that's<00:02:10.880> the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
five seven eight the GE a B that's the

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.160 
five seven eight the GE a B that's the
same<00:02:11.090> as<00:02:11.480> our<00:02:11.540> traditional<00:02:11.750> the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
same as our traditional the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.710 
same as our traditional the
boogie-woogie<00:02:12.500> on<00:02:12.950> adjacent<00:02:13.459> string<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:14.569> has

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
boogie-woogie on adjacent string it has

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.000 
boogie-woogie on adjacent string it has
a<00:02:14.750> little<00:02:14.900> different<00:02:15.019> sound<00:02:15.500> because<00:02:15.799> now<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
a little different sound because now the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.280 
a little different sound because now the
five<00:02:16.700> six<00:02:17.000> flat<00:02:17.209> seven<00:02:17.450> comes<00:02:17.810> out<00:02:17.989> brighter

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
five six flat seven comes out brighter

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.839 
five six flat seven comes out brighter
you're<00:02:18.530> on<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.620> thinner<00:02:18.920> diameter<00:02:19.190> string

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.280 

you've<00:02:22.849> got<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.090> get<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.330> staccato

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
you've got to get that staccato

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.059 
you've got to get that staccato
and<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.890> won't<00:02:25.980> sound<00:02:26.250> right<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.680> suggest

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
and that won't sound right so I suggest

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.390 
and that won't sound right so I suggest
you<00:02:29.159> do<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.489> first<00:02:30.379> and<00:02:31.379> then<00:02:34.189> the<00:02:35.189> lick

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
you do that first and then the lick

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.710 
you do that first and then the lick
could<00:02:35.610> be<00:02:35.700> played<00:02:35.939> a<00:02:35.970> couple<00:02:36.299> of<00:02:36.450> different

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
could be played a couple of different

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.509 
could be played a couple of different
ways<00:02:36.810> it's<00:02:37.079> a<00:02:37.170> flat<00:02:37.470> three<00:02:37.799> to<00:02:37.890> three<00:02:38.129> to<00:02:38.159> five

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
ways it's a flat three to three to five

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.910 
ways it's a flat three to three to five
lick<00:02:38.939> you<00:02:39.659> could<00:02:39.840> go<00:02:39.959> first<00:02:40.319> finger<00:02:40.680> on<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.829> E

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
lick you could go first finger on the E

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.520 
lick you could go first finger on the E
flat<00:02:41.040> hammer<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.269> e<00:02:42.299> while<00:02:43.170> that's<00:02:43.349> being

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
flat hammer the e while that's being

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.899 
flat hammer the e while that's being
played<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:43.890> reach<00:02:44.220> back<00:02:44.430> with<00:02:44.579> your<00:02:44.700> first

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
played you reach back with your first

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.119 
played you reach back with your first
finger<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.750> then<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.019> play<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.379> G<00:02:46.560> or<00:02:46.950> you

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
finger and then you play the G or you

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.670 
finger and then you play the G or you
can<00:02:47.250> play<00:02:47.400> legato<00:02:47.640> slide<00:02:48.299> with<00:02:49.170> your<00:02:49.319> second

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
can play legato slide with your second

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.210 
can play legato slide with your second
finger<00:02:52.700> now<00:02:53.700> putting<00:02:53.970> kick<00:02:54.439> one<00:02:55.439> and<00:02:55.739> two<00:02:55.950> and

finger now putting kick one and two and
three<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.670> four<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.269> so<00:02:57.629> I've<00:02:57.690> got<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:58.019> kick

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
three and four and so I've got that kick

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.289 
three and four and so I've got that kick
on<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.500> end<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.950> four<00:02:59.190> we<00:02:59.670> have<00:02:59.790> an<00:02:59.879> upstroke

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
on the end of four we have an upstroke

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.300 
on the end of four we have an upstroke
mark<00:03:00.629> right<00:03:01.290> there<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.709> have<00:03:01.859> some<00:03:02.069> options

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
mark right there you have some options

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.039 
mark right there you have some options
we're<00:03:03.000> gonna<00:03:03.090> talk<00:03:03.329> about<00:03:03.359> this<00:03:03.720> in<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:03.900> minute

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
we're gonna talk about this in a minute

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.170 
we're gonna talk about this in a minute
but<00:03:04.650> then<00:03:04.859> let's<00:03:05.129> look<00:03:05.250> at<00:03:05.400> those<00:03:05.549> parentheses

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
but then let's look at those parentheses

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.710 
but then let's look at those parentheses
the<00:03:06.900> first<00:03:07.260> G<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:08.849> occurs<00:03:09.120> on<00:03:09.269> beat<00:03:09.480> one<00:03:09.690> I

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
the first G that occurs on beat one I

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.330 
the first G that occurs on beat one I
have<00:03:09.989> in<00:03:10.109> parentheses<00:03:10.560> that's<00:03:10.829> because<00:03:11.159> when

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
have in parentheses that's because when

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.280 
have in parentheses that's because when
you<00:03:11.430> start<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.849> over<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.659> might<00:03:12.989> not<00:03:13.260> even

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
you start it over you might not even

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.050 
you start it over you might not even
play<00:03:13.799> that<00:03:14.069> note<00:03:14.280> because<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.639> just<00:03:14.819> played

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
play that note because you just played

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:24.470 
play that note because you just played
it<00:03:15.090> for<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.420> kick<00:03:15.629> listen<00:03:16.260> up<00:03:23.239> I'm<00:03:24.239> not<00:03:24.359> gonna

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
it for the kick listen up I'm not gonna

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.539 
it for the kick listen up I'm not gonna
hit<00:03:24.629> it<00:03:24.750> again<00:03:25.049> so<00:03:25.829> that's<00:03:26.010> what<00:03:26.190> that's<00:03:26.370> all

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
hit it again so that's what that's all

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.099 
hit it again so that's what that's all
about

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
about

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.839
