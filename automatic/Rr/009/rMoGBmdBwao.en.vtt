00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
out there trying to do it we had to just

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.219 
out there trying to do it we had to just
keep<00:02:01.259> going<00:02:01.499> and<00:02:01.710> keep<00:02:02.219> trying<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.020> we<00:02:04.020> made

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
keep going and keep trying and we made

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.690 
keep going and keep trying and we made
it<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.469> plenty<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.859> time<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.159> spare<00:02:05.399> I

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
it with plenty of time to spare I

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.760 
it with plenty of time to spare I
realize<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.569> wasn't<00:02:06.719> his<00:02:06.959> fault<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.439> know<00:02:07.619> two

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770

like I'm a second lap high side on the
cold<00:02:11.410> tire<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:12.100> I<00:02:12.640> also<00:02:13.030> think<00:02:13.210> it<00:02:13.480> hoped<00:02:13.630> for

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810
