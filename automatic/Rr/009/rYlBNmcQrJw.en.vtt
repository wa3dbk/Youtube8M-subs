00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:08.300
 [Music] 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.480
 hello friends how are we now 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.700
 Sometimes I bring a small video about 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.779
 of 5 points why buy the iphone 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.630
 5 s now that iphone 6 has come out and 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.609
 iphone 6 plus good before you start already 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.859
 report with the video I have always said 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.199
 that the lifetime of an ios device 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.560
 unai device an iphone an ipod touch or a 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.410
 iPad is two years inside these two 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.809
 years we will be able to enjoy all the 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.180
 updates that your system has 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.430
 100% operational 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.649
 you are going to simply occupy your device 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.350
 As if you will finish it out of the box 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.020
 very hard to be encouraged is going to 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.809
 to put on is really two years is the 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.910
 lifespan of an ied and you go to my point of 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.469
 sight but good let's go straight 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.570
 now yes with the video after this 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.670
 small parentheses and we can find 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.620
 the lowest price 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.750
 now that iphone 6 has come out and the 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.960
 iphone 6 plus we can find the 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.880
 iphone 5 s with many discounts in 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.790
 virtual stores or in physical stores 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.280
 I've seen several pages where to get to 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.390
 put the iphone 5 s with a 30 or up 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.149
 with a 40% discount or very cheap 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.850
 really very very cheap and it's worth 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.890
 completely worth it at point number 2 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.729
 we can find one more screen 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.590
 little 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.600
 many users had been demanding 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.909
 a larger screen but 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.039
 there are also many others who prefer 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.770
 the comfort of being able to occupy that 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.409
 one- hand screen by garca 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.060
 to be able to charge the phone with only one 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.459
 hand to be able to occupy with the thumb 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.090
 and that already reach the whole screen in 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:50.390
 truth is incredibly comfortable in point 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.280
 number 3 we could talk about ios 8 the 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.310
 iphone 5 that has a relationship 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.340
 quality-price as good as in your 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.319
 launch and well it is also possible 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.630
 that in future versions follow 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.970
 updating without any problem since 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.280
 the iphone 6 and the iphone 6 plus 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.910
 they incorporate the same amount of memory 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.560
 ram that the iphone 5 s being this one of 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.750
 the main reasons why 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.780
 many phones do not get updated 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.240
 and they end up being thrown away too 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.300
 pretty good factor of hardware is the 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.220
 touch aid and will be used in the 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.100
 news that I want to take Paul out 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.280
 future this all this hyde and really 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:35.060
 can have very good things we find 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.120
 also design key point the design 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.950
 the new iphone has introduced a design 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.200
 more rounded that is like I do not know or 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.720
 be the nice design of iphone 6 and 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.980
 iphone 6 plus but if you see those lines 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.909
 behind 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.720
 I do not always know not like it does not come to you 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:01.950
 convince so much and instead the iphone5 s 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.140
 It has an incredibly nice design ok 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.700
 a lot of people I remember when 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.620
 came out the iphone 5 that they said is 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.629
 design horrible that does not and that not today that 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.450
 no and they stayed with their old 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.819
 iphone 4 and I do not know that really not 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.019
 it can be either the aluminum design 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:20.700
 crystal that looks on the iphone 5 that is 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.670
 incredibly beautiful only for the 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.660
 design is really worth buying 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.390
 we also find in the last point to 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.060
 the power and benefits that it gives us 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.519
 this terminal the tests that have 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.560
 given throughout all this time 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.250
 since he has left the iPhone 5 s the 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.670
 iphone 6 iphone 6 plus has shown 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.220
 something that had shown us the 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.250
 agent supports for several years that 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.160
 is what you could call it a 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.310
 good user experience is a 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:00.209
 experience that will not disappoint you 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:03.810
 from this point of view the iphone5 s 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.910
 is a tremendously powerful mobile to the 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.200
 height of many range android phones 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:12.959
 high that have come out recently and even 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.360
 It is comparable with the same iPhone 6 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.519
 for most users there are 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.269
 although it must be said that not for all 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:24.180
 aspects like the nfc that the iphone 5 s 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.450
 does not have are not available yet out 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.750
 from the USA and many of us who live in 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.490
 latin america in europe water I feel that 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.139
 will get there faster but in 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.169
 Latin America we will have to wait 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.139
 a lot of time to be able to make use of 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:43.620
 that chip nfc and good as an added 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:46.650
 we have to say that it is available in 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.490
 the 32 gig version very suitable for 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:53.220
 those looking for something more than 16 bone but 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.620
 that do not need 64 gigabytes or that already 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.240
 you have to remember that with the iPhone 6 it 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.440
 they eliminated the 32 gigas 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.340
 ok of 16 give 164 and 10 and from there to 128 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.060
 gb 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:10.080
 when the iphone5 s we can have 16 32 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.840
 or 64 ok what you prefer is really 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.690
 a very good iphone if you want it 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.169
 buy still ahead if you do not want 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:22.169
 spend money in excess for an iPhone 6 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:25.260
 the iphone 5 s will work for you 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.870
 any problem but good friends now 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.229

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.580

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.889
 you want to buy an iphone and you do not want 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.410

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.820
