special<00:01:09.930> breaks<00:01:10.370> VX<00:01:11.370> points<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:11.940> a

special breaks VX points we have a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.450 
special breaks VX points we have a
pretty<00:01:12.270> complex<00:01:13.020> braking<00:01:13.590> system<00:01:14.010> which

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
pretty complex braking system which

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.140 
pretty complex braking system which
allows<00:01:15.120> us<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.510> spin<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.900> bars<00:01:16.250> 360<00:01:17.250> degrees

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
allows us to spin the bars 360 degrees

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.510 
allows us to spin the bars 360 degrees
and<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.690> have<00:01:18.870> our<00:01:18.900> cables<00:01:19.380> tangle<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.070> they

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
and I have our cables tangle up and they

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.480 
and I have our cables tangle up and they
call<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.880> gyro<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.290> piece<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.190> has

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
call it a gyro it's a piece that has

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.550 
call it a gyro it's a piece that has
bearings<00:01:23.910> in<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.120> and<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.750> cables<00:01:25.380> come

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
bearings in it and then the cables come

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.990 
bearings in it and then the cables come
from<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> top<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.220> bottom<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.610> then<00:01:26.670> split

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
from the top and bottom and then split

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.690 
from the top and bottom and then split
off<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.380> then<00:01:28.500> they<00:01:28.800> match<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.490> when

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
off so and then they match up so when

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.480 
off so and then they match up so when
you<00:01:29.790> pull<00:01:30.060> your<00:01:30.360> brakes<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.470> pulls<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.010> thing

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
you pull your brakes it pulls the thing

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.060 
you pull your brakes it pulls the thing
which<00:01:32.790> continues<00:01:33.570> our<00:01:33.720> brake<00:01:33.930> cables<00:01:34.890> down

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
which continues our brake cables down
