00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 in the previous letter we had seen 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.609
 in general as it did as format 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.680
 the blood from what it is made up of 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.599
 we saw in the heavens now let's see 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.429
 the plasma as I told you the plasma from 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.280
 liquid components where the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.789
 chance of accessing the plasma is 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.590
 consisting of a few certain elements 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.420
 important to know online 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.029
 general plasma essentially water 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.849
 90 percent therefore all this 55 per 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.640
 90 percent up to this point e 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.460
 all water in the plasma for I hope 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.969
 we find other other important elements 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.850
 of loose that will be in the chicks c i 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.790
 book the electrolytes then in the plaza 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.250
 lennon we find essentially water 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.809
 pure distilled water but we find water 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.000
 with within voters td shop 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.899
 of these are basically these 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.210
 sodium chlorine potassium calcium magnesium 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.879
 surely the dream is the most 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.960
 represented and is the fundamental point 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.300
 as well as chlorine the potager is found 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.589
 little the plasma above all is 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.030
 inside the cells 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.979
 calcium is present in the interior 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.979
 it is present in the plasma and is 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.840
 very important for coagulation and it is 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.200
 little present inside the cells 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.240
 like calcium book in the cytoplasm while 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.189
 it is found in, for example, reserves 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.640
 intracellular calcium for example i 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.860
 ridiculous and mitochondria however important 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.759
 especially at the level of the own plasma 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.320
 for the clear function of the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.400
 this coagulation for magnets is also 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.930
 important for example for alcoholism is 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.640
 so however to remember this that is 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.170
 in the applause and we find water with the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.500
 electrolytes of choices how to take 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.000
 practically water to be added 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.409
 the kitchen is the same thing 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.850
 basically more these other ions 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.700
 remember in general that i comes 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.979
 tourists are champions and money then 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.659
 without mind sodium potassium calcium every 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.619
 day positive charges colo birth 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.880
 negative 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.150
 another major voter 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.540
 remember that baking soda 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:09.050
 which is present point locksmith concerns 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.940
 instead the pd what we can say the pd 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.740
 they are mentally say awards 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.090
 of cholesterol we say those are i 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.350
 most important 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.060
 remember that triglycerides and 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.000
 cholesterol are transported without the 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.440
 mind through brute type onwards 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.330
 we have the slides in particular 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.330
 essentially they are fundamental things 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.180
 which you say less for alice my proteins 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.890
 it doesn't hold up as you can see it can be established 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.690
 has precisely through the track 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.380
 electrophoretic, i.e. take them 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.459
 proteins and are arranged practically in 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.770
 such that we can have it 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.560
 applying it a current migration in 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.730
 based on protein fillers 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.580
 in particular the charge of theirs 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.930
 amino acids what is described 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.060
 we are practically say this 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.420
 we find a normal normal shape 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.520
 a peak that is practically very high 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.530
 made up mentally from the albums 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.200
 in and then we will find the other globulins 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.070
 alpha beta and clinical bleu ranges are 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.170
 antibodies 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.270
 so we will find the albumin that 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.120
 this is the most present in the blood 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:12.110
 the very important protein then we will draw 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.030
 alpha globulins 1 and then le 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.350
 immunoglobulins the immunoglobulins of 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.430
 bonuses are also caller 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.410
 gamma globulin forward these bodies 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.420
 basically constitute the various 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.030
 types of various subclasses we say of 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.640
 monogroup lines that are the gigi le gpm 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.769
 of glg of gigi are the most present 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.660
 they are already less present in the genres still 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.720
 Less of the uncertain impact very little 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.700
 laws of ancona or not we say that 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.220
 these can also be avoided 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.680
 consider almost and more imported only 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.180
 in the days and the gm essentially and her 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.320
 look for what concerns then 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.019
 I said in general therefore it is necessary 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.690
 regards this now we come 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.030
 therefore always central must remind us 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.640
 this plasma is formed by water 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.630
 inside the water we will find 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.240
 these practically 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.990
 electrolytes in particular the sun a lot 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.120
 abundant the most abundant electrolyte 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.770
 then find nicolas naughty wives 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.180
 terol lcd 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.950
 in particular, they are proteins 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.920
 therefore we find all practically the 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.110
 all of them biomolecules 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.560
 we will find albumin globulin he 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:26.040
 protein immunoglobulins and tests 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.470
 without complaining precisely this fact 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.390
 essential component remember that the 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.430
 find urine proteins and others 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.600
 proteins as food today moved her 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.600
 nel and lipoprotein
