00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 two to all welcome to repeat 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.000
 episodes 203 of the anime define a 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.340
 episode where we have seen a little more 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.750
 the past step of visca how it is that 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.639
 states met and how is it that 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.530
 finally got to enter the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.880
 kingdom of fairytale blue episode in the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.619
 that we have had all kinds of 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.570
 feeling whether it's sadness either 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.410
 joy whether it's a bit of comedy what 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.609
 good as in the episode 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.109
 earlier I think that what more 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.820
 We could highlight your feelings 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.500
 it's the comedy that we saw and he does a good 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.970
 episode that is a bit of filling already 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.080
 that this reminds us in the manga of 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.910
 I've heard that this stuffing is 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.529
 supervised by de facto maximum turn 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.149
 this filling is quite accomplished is a 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.739
 filling that does not hurt at all see 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.180
 as he says about these things already 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.860
 let's talk a little bit about the most 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.960
 highlighted that we can extract from this 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.280
 episode the first place we know a 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.899
 little the step of erez to how liked 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.700
 quite how you have introduced this past 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.930
 to be related to a reward 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.700
 that they had given him credit after 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.440
 complete a mission that is a table of 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.090
 Billiards not others completely a vision 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.860
 because he starts playing pool and 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.270
 earth to see that pool ball and you see 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.640
 that pool table begins to remember what 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.530
 what happened to her is that this one was found 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.480
 with a pool table just because 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.070
 he was wrong to locate I already wanted to go 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.439
 to a candy store and was not bad and 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.570
 suddenly he was wrong I do not know why who 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.050
 he knows why a non-typical oversight and he 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.430
 outside 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.410
 locality where there was a pool table 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.970
 and from then on he left 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.580
 informing of the villa of this episode 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.230
 that we see that it is seen that it really is 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.270
 a hazelnut but we the whale in plan 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.610
 that causes havoc for fun but 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.340
 that causes havoc to try to steal or 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.230
 approve that amount necessary 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.120
 try to pay for your pet's operation 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.250
 since he has no means to 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.020
 pay and if new pay well we know 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.600
 what will happen not to the poor pet 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.730
 we see basically that the villain is this 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.020
 but for good reasons and in fact 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.460
 here we also see a confrontation of 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.860
 this one with travis since I liked it a lot 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.240
 in plan roll comedy in plan a bit of 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.820
 Take host here like this or for 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.860
 there and above all it is the shock of bullets 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.840
 against the swords of the state where 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.700
 super falsely what happens that is 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.740
 like what the fuck when sight starts 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.870
 to throw good bullets starts basically 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.520
 to shoot alert and this one starts good 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.230
 that I do not miss it is not the fact that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.940
 we know it is very strong and we know 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.170
 that very skilled with their armors and 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.940
 with his sword and that starts at 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.010
 counterattack those bullets and start 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.720
 throw them out there make them bounce that 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.730
 it is not false that false is that if not 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.440
 I remember badly those bullets will give you a 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.180
 billiard ball and said billiard ball 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.410
 then start giving to another polar of 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.480
 pool and just like that 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.340
 based on bullet in the billiard balls 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.620
 on their corresponding sites our 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.390
 as the supreme avenged and we see nothing 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.280
 that finally obviously can not 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.660
 do nothing against is what comes 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.340
 being visca in fact bis that there was 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.930
 supplanted the identity that she does not 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.120
 was a definitive magician when really 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.860
 it was no longer a definitive sleeve support 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.420
 we fear that a little light quake 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.980
 running around like that a little stuffing 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.540
 but I like it a lot, not because the 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.340
 fact that before it entered 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.620
 the chrome of felipe and lucy you can 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.960
 find just connect because not 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.760
 I know it's something curious, not the least and 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.070
 nothing is what finally gets 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.290
 is coming to beat this view and 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.730
 tell him it 's a prize after taking a 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.160
 anger of the host for supplanting the 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.650
 definitive identity and I like no 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.420
 because inside that tough girl of this one 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.740
 there is also a heart and thanks 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.410
 fact is thanks to her not to which 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.180
 got that it will work on what 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.190
 comes being end and terol in which you 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.050
 proposed to enter and well this began to 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.060
 see to love and nothing just always 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.040
 arguing to and without a shirt of all 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.480
 these things that we already know and also 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.100
 one thing that was to comment is that we see 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.110
 a bit of fans services obviously 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.850
 because fucking sense is serious 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.620
 tell me what exactly when air 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.390
 center for the first time 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.069
 this place where playing pool is 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.780
 of rabbit costumes that is to remove their 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.489
 typical armor of her good I understand 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.500
 that in a certain way not to be less 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.269
 heavy and being less heavy she 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.220
 that you can already accommodate improves what 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.140
 come and feel with the stick to the ball or not 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.580
 but just disguise as a rabbit and 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.349
 then we also see a little too 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.299
 service loft when it is disguised 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.970
 of waitress and one also a little when 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.590
 it takes away some clothes as collards and 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.879
 what you see being seen so for 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.799
 people who like you also have there is a 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.390
 little fan service everywhere and 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.519
 nothing basically that what it deals with 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.890
 this episode the lord divider we are going to 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.690
 see a little lucy and also to the 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.370
 celestial spirits we will see these 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.019
 they want I think the next 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.239
 episode also in fact do not know the 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.500
 manga and that is anime stuffing so 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.359
 good to wait a bit because this 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.799
 filling are not not bad in fact in 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.450
 the next one pulls out that data that's going to 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.250
 be the village of the sun if I do not go wrong 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.659
 you will know me a little more about the past of 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.220
 Those who are being frei have already 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.409
 commented on previous reviews 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.090
 basically that you have to see this saga 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.739
 one pulled a little short but that is not 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.510
 nothing wrong and after that saga you will have the 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.100
 of Tartars which is a saga to the sea ​​of 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.840
 interesting as well as you need these 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.280
