00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.710 
price for it is 20 euros it's already
cut<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.390> because<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:22.109> bit<00:00:22.289> hard<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:24.330> get<00:00:24.510> in

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
cut that because a bit hard so to get in

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.340 
cut that because a bit hard so to get in
the<00:00:24.840> box

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
the box

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.910 
the box
or<00:00:25.980> here<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:26.939> says<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:29.480> tell<00:00:30.480> what<00:00:30.750> USB<00:00:31.650> power

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
or here it says just tell what USB power

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.240 
or here it says just tell what USB power
adapter<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:33.360> different<00:00:33.780> languages<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.620> how

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
adapter in different languages and how

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.840 
adapter in different languages and how
to<00:00:35.309> use<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:40.200> says<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.860> which<00:00:41.340> device

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
to use it so it says with which device

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.080 
to use it so it says with which device
it's<00:00:42.149> comfortable<00:00:43.110> rate<00:00:43.820> compared<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
it's comfortable rate compared to the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.670 
it's comfortable rate compared to the
room<00:00:45.350> 208

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
room 208

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.310 
room 208
so<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.969> works<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.690> iPads<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:50.899> it<00:00:51.899> charge

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
so it works with the iPads so it charge

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.500 
so it works with the iPads so it charge
charges<00:00:53.309> your<00:00:53.520> iPad<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.660> full<00:00:54.989> 12<00:00:55.739> watt

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
charges your iPad in the full 12 watt

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.040 
charges your iPad in the full 12 watt
energy<00:00:57.739> but<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.920> iPhone<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.690> iPhone<00:01:00.690> battery

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
energy but the iPhone the iPhone battery

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.690 
energy but the iPhone the iPhone battery
doesn't<00:01:01.620> allow<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.879> an<00:01:03.030> watt<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.300> energy<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.260> it

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
doesn't allow to an watt of energy so it

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.670 
doesn't allow to an watt of energy so it
goes<00:01:05.700> down<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.180> 5<00:01:06.450> watts<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.409> charge

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
goes down to 5 watts so you can charge

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.570 
goes down to 5 watts so you can charge
it<00:01:07.890> with<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.280> but<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:09.450> same<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.049> video

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
it with that but it's same as the video

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.300 
it with that but it's same as the video
so<00:01:11.580> let's<00:01:12.299> open<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.780> everyone's<00:01:13.770> get<00:01:13.979> out<00:01:14.130> the

nothing special to assemble just like

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.080 
nothing special to assemble just like
that<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.880> timed<00:02:01.130> how<00:02:02.130> long<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.430> takes<00:02:02.909> to

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
that and I timed how long it takes to

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.260 
that and I timed how long it takes to
charge<00:02:03.689> my<00:02:04.079> iPad<00:02:04.259> Mini<00:02:04.880> puppet<00:02:05.880> for

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
charge my iPad Mini puppet for

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.410 
charge my iPad Mini puppet for
generation<00:02:06.990> doesn't<00:02:07.350> matter<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:08.270> tried<00:02:09.270> it

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
generation doesn't matter I tried it

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.640 
generation doesn't matter I tried it
with<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.690> iPad<00:02:10.140> Mini<00:02:10.580> because<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.730> mean

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
with the iPad Mini because I mean

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.860 
with the iPad Mini because I mean
because<00:02:12.890> they<00:02:13.069> get<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.459> iPad<00:02:14.090> Mini<00:02:14.299> with<00:02:14.569> the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
because they get the iPad Mini with the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.649 
because they get the iPad Mini with the
five<00:02:15.200> watt<00:02:15.470> charger<00:02:15.909> so<00:02:16.909> I<00:02:17.000> think<00:02:17.180> with<00:02:17.480> the

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
five watt charger so I think with the

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.569 
five watt charger so I think with the
original<00:02:18.409> five<00:02:18.680> watts<00:02:19.510> charger<00:02:20.650> charges<00:02:21.650> from

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
original five watts charger charges from

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:23.970 
original five watts charger charges from
zero

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
zero

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.880 
zero
battery<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.250> 100<00:02:25.970> percent<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:26.569> battery<00:02:26.890> about

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
battery to 100 percent of battery about

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.539 
battery to 100 percent of battery about
four<00:02:28.340> hours<00:02:28.489> that's<00:02:29.329> a<00:02:29.569> lot<00:02:29.750> with<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:30.950> you

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
four hours that's a lot with that you

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.670 
four hours that's a lot with that you
get<00:02:32.200> half<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.409> that

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
get half of that

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.929 
get half of that
let's<00:02:33.980> say<00:02:34.159> two<00:02:34.549> hours<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.599> bit<00:02:36.319> less<00:02:36.909> so<00:02:37.909> here

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:37.939 
let's say two hours a bit less so here

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:45.069 
let's say two hours a bit less so here
it<00:02:38.329> says<00:02:40.180> focus<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:43.150> tell<00:02:44.150> what<00:02:44.450> USB<00:02:44.840> power

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
it says focus that tell what USB power

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.030 
it says focus that tell what USB power
adapter<00:02:45.819> so<00:02:46.819> very<00:02:47.569> useful<00:02:47.750> stuff<00:02:48.170> if<00:02:48.349> you<00:02:48.859> own

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
adapter so very useful stuff if you own

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.699 
adapter so very useful stuff if you own
the<00:02:49.280> an<00:02:49.879> iPad<00:02:50.299> Mini<00:02:50.859> worth<00:02:51.859> of<00:02:52.099> money<00:02:53.500> but<00:02:54.500> if

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
the an iPad Mini worth of money but if

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.440 
the an iPad Mini worth of money but if
you<00:02:54.859> have<00:02:55.099> an<00:02:55.370> iPad<00:02:56.150> one<00:02:57.019> two<00:02:58.450> third
