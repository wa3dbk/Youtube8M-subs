endurance with my running my energy is

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.590 
endurance with my running my energy is
definitely<00:03:12.799> not<00:03:12.950> where<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:13.370> was<00:03:13.420> because<00:03:14.420> I'm

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
definitely not where it was because I'm

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.870 
definitely not where it was because I'm
not<00:03:14.750> getting<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.799> carbohydrates<00:03:16.640> that<00:03:18.880> my

but too much fruit sugar even then sets

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.870 
but too much fruit sugar even then sets
me<00:03:28.609> over<00:03:29.090> on<00:03:29.799> something<00:03:30.799> in<00:03:30.920> my<00:03:31.069> gut<00:03:31.280> is<00:03:31.489> very

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
same way I was one of those people that

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.509

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.439 
close to what I think is ok but you
never<00:05:11.139> know<00:05:11.320> what<00:05:11.470> they<00:05:11.590> put<00:05:11.919> in<00:05:12.130> there<00:05:12.400> so<00:05:12.940> you
