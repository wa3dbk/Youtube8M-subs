00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 Hello friends with you, Sergey Lakes 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:11.160
 and today I decided to write such 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:17.660
 small life fishing video 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.109
 let it be you today is april 30th 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.789
 3:20 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.630
 of the day I drove in before bought a motel 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.390
 worms 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.349
 I took the float rod and I was no longer 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.309
 eager to open the fishing season by open 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:39.390
 water on the float rod but what of 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.920
 this will result in seeing well 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.920
 Okay, go to the place of fishing 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.250
 Well, we ate as broke into place 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.700
 because the road to gravity once was 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.750
 all the more today went by in the rain 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.530
 okay general on the spot now 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.070
 change clothes tackle but we will 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:51.690
 sample 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:56.490
 so we drove up let 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:00.549
 America sense or tula 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.720
 right here i think we will try 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.720
 to fish 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.530
 Well, our fishing started working 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.040
 today at the six meter float 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.040
 fishing rod 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.810
 Well, let's see what will be the result I 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:33.430
 just thrown in while planted a profit 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:39.970
 more will be seen windshield course 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:42.730
 today is just awful further on 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.690
 let's see it just come out of 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.690
 our fishing 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.629
 with other anglers sitting 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:08.630
 here it is our beautiful city from here 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:12.830
 opens here passed about 20 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.950
 swim while the company is true 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.580
 some single poke 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:23.870
 I saw no further development 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.750
 I followed wait on at 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.700
 as the rest cool pave recently 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.700
 comrade she became a fish 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.180
 so we will wait but even already 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.870
 open summer season 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.970
 behind the bait today I use it 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.890
 in principle, there is 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.440
 to the song if left with him will be bad well 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.770
 then we will try to feed 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.770
 somehow 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.320
 someone fails 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:38.139
 Here is season 1 open 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.139
 that's the kind of thing and caught 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:49.060
 2 had to shuffle it for a long time now he 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.060
 put down 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:07.410
 so here is the dump truck 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.410
 nothing seasons green and continue any 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:20.860
 the weather whispers well though the wind is almost 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:23.800
 so better yes to him actually 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.070
 space in general friends than I can say 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.140
 generally still the rain and also 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.930
 passed pretty decent I don't know 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:37.000
 as told back what the road is there 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.450
 who as they have seen is not very well what can 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.320
 to tell 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:43.030
 summer fishing was open was caught 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.490
 fish also 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.890
 but no matter which fish of course 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.040
 which I caught from the bottom shot because 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:54.790
 that it was raining and the camera could not be 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.980
 so use rain 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:00.070
 actually my fun as from a tour 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:05.170
 I got in the end that is, here we are 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:08.080
 I just caught all four of them. 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:10.210
 here is skirt Alice horn 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.050
 Well, something like that weather, of course 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.860
 let you down today but fishing 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.350
 took place 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.309
 all cameras finally get wet in general 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:23.779
 okay 

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:27.110
