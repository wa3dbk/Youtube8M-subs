00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 desire for evil but time has come 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.359
 don't let us know what you know 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.610
 let's take the sea 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.300
 directly into the dish preparing a 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.790
 nice meal of mussels to prepare 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.800
 coasts is not that difficult indeed 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.320
 cooking is very very fast 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.600
 the only drawback is the cleanliness that 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.310
 must be flawless to prevent that 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.630
 any sand grains there 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.060
 get under your teeth 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.920
 so today we will learn recognize one 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.929
 good thing is a bad thing 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.790
 we will learn above all to clean them 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.860
 perfectly already that we are there 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.660
 we will also see how to prepare a bel 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.840
 impepata of mussels let's see what there 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.230
 needed to prepare the impepata of 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.860
 Mussels with tomatoes are needed 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.590
 kilo of very fresh runs 200 g of 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.809
 those cherry tomatoes or cherry tomatoes 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.230
 which I like best a bunch of 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.500
 abundant parsley pepper a couple of 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.750
 cloves of garlic a couple of tablespoons of 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.850
 extra virgin olive oil half 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.180
 glass of white wine if like for 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.630
 end up accompanying even around 100 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.580
 grams of rustic bread when we go to 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.020
 do the shopping 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.990
 we must choose cups 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.670
 fresh and the freshness of the race 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.920
 it is recognized not only by appearance 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.009
 also from the smell so they don't have to 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.920
 first stink what you have to 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.579
 choose only the mussels inter and then 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.700
 not broken like this not opened like 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.090
 this one but they must be so then 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.520
 perfect closed and without breaks 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.600
 otherwise inside you will find a 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.409
 sand sack 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.930
 Now let's see how we can clean them 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.700
 therefore with the cleaning of the races 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.610
 then first with a small knife 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.710
 we always remove the gaiter simply 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.020
 pulling a little ok then this race does not 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.479
 has many imperfections here not 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.960
 need not even scraped excessively 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.920
 but you will need only to brush it like this 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.920
 with a brush 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.880
 or with a scratching sponge 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.580
 very much then the wings dive 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.150
 in the water this thing for example 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.560
 you see that this fillet 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.700
 it will have to be removed with a small knife 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.670
 doing some attention and removing 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.770
 for good the imperfections we scratch a 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.770
 another bit like that 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.480
 then clearly all things will have to 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:44.960
 to be passed under running water from 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.140
 let's brush this then too 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.900
 so let's proceed with all the mussels and only 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.640
 this is the operation has a little long 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.980
 but if you clean them properly 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.030
 you will see that no traces of will remain 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.709
 sand and now that we have put the 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.850
 things inside a basin with 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.220
 water 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:09.200
 we have to pass them under water 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.690
 current in the we have for good and then 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.480
 merit we are always in the water controlled 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.620
 that the water must be absolutely 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.890
 clear now we can proceed with the 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.140
 preparation of the soaked skin 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.640
 then I already thought a couple of 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.250
 tablespoons of oil that would be my 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.220
 book on the bottom of one of a casserole 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.880
 I already put the two cloves of garlic 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.650
 now I put the tomatoes in it 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.650
 titled pan and already very hot 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.210
 we make you take a little bit the 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.570
 sauce was not necessary to add 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:53.430
 salt because things are already salt of 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:55.770
 for them very well and now we can well 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.300
 he also knows all things attention to 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:07.160
 splashes and so always rather flame 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:11.450
 tall and now we see the passion 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:16.350
 to facilitate the opening of things 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.510
 we close with the lid and lelli 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.830
 let us leave them a few moments from when 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:25.200
 in short, you will begin to hatch the 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.090
 original recipe of the surge of things 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.800
 does not require the use of cherry tomatoes 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.720
 but since I like it 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.420
 particularly the contrast between the 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.700
 tomato and the coast I put it then 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.430
 you can also replace white wine 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.920
 that going now we will go to spill but 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.610
 blend with white wine with juice 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.610
 of lemon 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.330
 then put plenty of pepper 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:58.560
 ok always on a high heat we turn a 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.840
 pupillo and we wait a while are served 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.600
 very few minutes our coasts 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:09.870
 they opened before serving one 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:14.190
 nice sprinkling of fresh parsley and 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:16.620
 then they are difficult to prepare 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.330
 mussels will make a great impression using 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.950
 very little time and also spending 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.080
 very few pennies 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.700
 indeed, you want to know something for me 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.260
 realization of this dish I have not 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.210
 had to spend not even a penny 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.310
 because the coasts have been given to me 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.080
 from a certain person who has 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.550
 brilliantly won a race 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.550
 thanks hello
