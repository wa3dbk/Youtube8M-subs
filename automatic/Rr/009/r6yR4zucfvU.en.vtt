 in the to choose a terrible christ that 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.190

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.850
 a gigantic casting where they called 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.009
 but to all kinds 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.200

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.850
 physical characteristics that he had and 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.100
 when they saw it fly and from there also 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.960
 came out the motto of the first movie you're going 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.960
 to see that a man can fly jumps 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.360
 the sun descriptor is transformed into a 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.830
 red giant consuming all these 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.950
 extraterrestrials of human characteristic 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.870
 still despite all its tables technology not 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.930

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.990
 brand of more talking than part looks at the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.600

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.660
 going away look at the special effects 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.640
 once a lot years later when the 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.850
 Sun from the front in Christ ends 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.600
 consuming all this civilization is me 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.600

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.810
 take the opportunity to review ahead 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.600
 we would remove digital the real 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.220
 we go during adolescence the calero 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.370
 which is the real name of the 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.620
 Italian superman here clark the see 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.580

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.550

 we are watching the one tape the year 78 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.030
 [Music] 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.700
 a year after the star of the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.700
 galaxy the triumph of fantastic cinema 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.840

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.710
 using that music for another person 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.930
 insurmountable because they inspire something of 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.640
 you really have to have because some 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.420
 part and about their video games but look 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.760
 I think 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.550
 is very well integrated look we are 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.220
 seeing in the youngest preadolescence 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.250
 here superman starting to enjoy 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.830
 his superpowers plus he still does not know that 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.020
 can fly as you will discover it already 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.850
 knows that having super strength that can 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.280
 see at a distance through the object of 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.920
 supervision exactly but does not know that 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.959
 can fly up to this moment great 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.959
 instant of the movie of the year 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.100
 I want to remember a lot someone does 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:51.510
 the box like the first time 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.340
 old man for instinct he covers himself and ends 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.030
 discovering that he can float to 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.710
 will and obviously can fly hey he has 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.110
 produced the layer came with the ship 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.840
 because in the s is the symbol of the 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:08.910
 supermario family christ christ exact 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:11.540
 so let's go then to the first moment 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.190
 superman that is made of school 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.620
 [Music] 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.950
 Inspired by very well- made threads 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.620
 at the moment when 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:24.600
 luisa are you points of this 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.600
 old helicopter looks 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:33.260
 the classic phone booth that he was 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.360
 like the lukewarm reporter for good 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.360
 [Music] 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.750
 and they recorded the essays the first one 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.750

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.789
 once to use to exhibit guilty 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.889

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:55.860
 for 10 - of hobby movies the 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:58.259
 school obviously with the classic club a 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.960
 the entire background image is nothing more than 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.820
 a projected film caused that in 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.650
 a moment more after saving this 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.650
 helicopter will fly away 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.480
 if it dominates perfectly with the sky the 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.509
 roll 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:25.090

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.370
 fly with super strength

 An alien
