00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:10.580
 think that simply is normal and 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.760
 tension is there what good the work 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.460
 was relatively concentrated and I think 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.190
 that the boys know so somehow 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.449
 what have screwed up and are willing 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.029
 somehow eradicate again 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.369
 So at first I did that 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.160
 because I do not just like that 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.699
 wants to stand and wants and 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.920
 Of course you can not just do that 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.849
 Forgot make but football is 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.859
 stop them week by week 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.329
 you have to go forward then 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:37.760
 focus and we actually have 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.280
 done and I believe that from the middle 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.429
 the week then a bit different 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.989
 mood then drafted 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:48.079
 we said we'll check it off now 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.420
 as hard as it is and need to go 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.739
 look ahead and I think that if you can 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.760
 really nice this week 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.649
 We are really made to do that 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.119
 Concentrated that was that we as 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.440
 and everyone too 

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:00.289
 to see 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.600
 and that is currently the task 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.369
 be for us that we really are 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.130
 weld together as a heap and that 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.649
 was about to come into play again and 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.270
 then do what for what actually stand 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.340
 for fast game and for 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.439
 Attractive opportunities 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.000
 but that will not be as easy as 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.619
 It's easy to say things here are sometimes 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.280
 has seen play in my last 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.649
 or hard 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.060
 I expect that somehow 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.740
 performance enhancement goes on and on 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.929
 that we are almost the order 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.380
 concerns and cohesion on the 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:32.689
 a significant increase of 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.460
 what's important is us 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.380
 they have to do a very simple thing 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.850
 So the seemingly simple things only 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.860
 make it right again and 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.409
 us as a team in the place so 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.770
 to reunite that was about this 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.270
 simple things come into play and on 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.520
 our quality we then quite 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.850
 have to play meet two 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.320
 teams on each other also for 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.990
 militant stand and also for the 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.970
 but we have to stand the passion 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.970
 proof now bring the first again 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.180
 was standing for it and will certainly be one 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.259
 interesting game but for us it has 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.450
 Definitely in the right direction 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.039
 character so well we 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.230
 want to take something that is for sure 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.850
 but it is important that we as a team 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.989
 occur differently than in the last two 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.410
 play and then could too 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.200
 theoretical better result 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.450
 of course we want to come out 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.250
 of course want to bring what is clear 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.860
 I mean we are footballers we drive 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.569
 We always play the game around that 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.920
 Best possible result with home too 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.340
 and that would of course be the case 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.380
 the case of the victory but limits point 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.430
 then it and we and neat 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.010
 then you can do that 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.230
 maybe be satisfied but that 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.970
 as I said a very very difficult 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.070
 gone because his Paul II 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.590
 in my opinion much stronger 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.690
 is last year and yes i mean 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.190
 we finally need to talk about that 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.130
 what make the audience know this 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.750
 we from our own stadium and 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.850
 that's why it's really going to be a difficult one 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.350
 So the serious of the situation once the forest 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.590
 said in south bavaria table 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.940
 I think so, I think relatively 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.010
 many talks took place 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.660
 but that was about content 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.430
 things concerning footballing 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.170
 have tried but so 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.300
 obvious weaknesses to work on 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.070
 which was absolutely right we found 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.320
 have a lot in the tactical field 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.090
 worked then just tried how 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.070
 said to put the spaces tight so that 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.500
 We returned so that was unpleasant 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.300
 as AuswÃ¤rtsteam so that was that 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.910
 one can help the other to the other 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.740
 because I think that's that 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.110
 Bad was what we were in the last few weeks 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.880
 weeks had as we said 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.200
 all mistakes and other crews 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.150
 also make mistakes but we have 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.340
 just does not give the feeling that 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.080
 of participating to the fault of the 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.820
 iron out others again and that must 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.560
 just come back and it works 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.070
 easiest if the roads are short 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.300
 and if the spaces are tight and that the 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.459
 We now simply want conditions 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.170
 to really get back together then as one 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.989
 to act as a unit 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.870
 So I assume that we 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.890
 as soon as possible ours 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.510
 complete trainee and then the 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.709
 I also change again 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.000
 I said that I generally 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.340
 nothing will say neither 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.560
 interim innovation which others 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.790
 notes and I think that's that 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.790
 one drives well and sticks to it
