three and a half turns great position in

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.100 
three and a half turns great position in
the<00:05:17.000> air

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.240 

beautiful<00:05:22.110> and<00:05:22.350> she<00:05:22.530> was<00:05:22.560> off<00:05:22.860> to<00:05:22.980> the<00:05:23.010> races

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
then thought she might have got a triple

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.390 
then thought she might have got a triple
loop<00:05:25.290> on<00:05:25.410> the<00:05:25.470> end<00:05:25.530> of<00:05:25.710> this<00:05:25.800> to<00:05:26.040> be<00:05:26.160> honest

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
loop on the end of this to be honest

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.900 
loop on the end of this to be honest
with<00:05:26.490> you<00:05:26.780> she<00:05:27.780> could<00:05:27.930> have<00:05:28.050> done

in the lead is she going to bid it I

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.780 
in the lead is she going to bid it I
think<00:06:27.110> it<00:06:27.200> could<00:06:27.380> be<00:06:27.470> cool<00:06:27.680> head<00:06:27.890> away<00:06:28.160> then

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:28.790 
think it could be cool head away then

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.430 
think it could be cool head away then
the<00:06:28.940> second<00:06:29.360> mark<00:06:29.570> is<00:06:29.750> gonna<00:06:29.900> help<00:06:30.170> and<00:06:30.350> their

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
the second mark is gonna help and their

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.860 
the second mark is gonna help and their
first<00:06:30.680> mouths<00:06:30.890> got<00:06:31.100> to<00:06:31.220> be<00:06:31.310> good<00:06:31.490> because

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
first mouths got to be good because

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.970 
first mouths got to be good because
what's<00:06:32.870> the<00:06:32.930> base<00:06:33.140> value<00:06:33.380> for<00:06:33.680> the<00:06:33.740> triple

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980 
what's the base value for the triple

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.320 
what's the base value for the triple
axel<00:06:34.070> eight<00:06:34.280> eight<00:06:34.520> and<00:06:34.730> a<00:06:34.760> half<00:06:34.880> points<00:06:35.240> I

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
axel eight eight and a half points I

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.360 
axel eight eight and a half points I
think<00:06:35.360> something<00:06:35.930> like<00:06:36.080> that<00:06:36.230> yeah<00:06:37.220> eight

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
think something like that yeah eight

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.869 
think something like that yeah eight
point<00:06:37.640> five

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:38.879 
point five

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:41.449 
point five
and<00:06:39.330> she's<00:06:39.509> likely<00:06:39.749> to<00:06:39.929> get<00:06:40.199> positive<00:06:40.949> grade

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:41.459 
and she's likely to get positive grade

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:42.739 
and she's likely to get positive grade
of<00:06:41.610> execution<00:06:41.669> from<00:06:42.149> the<00:06:42.300> judgments<00:06:42.719> that

of execution from the judgments that

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:44.449 
of execution from the judgments that
eight-point-five<00:06:43.619> could<00:06:43.860> go<00:06:44.009> up<00:06:44.159> that's<00:06:44.399> just

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:44.459 
eight-point-five could go up that's just

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:46.909 
eight-point-five could go up that's just
on<00:06:44.699> one<00:06:44.879> element<00:06:45.270> you<00:06:45.539> casados<00:06:46.529> parents
