00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
useful for me from meeting its leaders

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.380 
useful for me from meeting its leaders
of<00:02:19.770> all<00:02:19.950> hair<00:02:20.190> says<00:02:20.430> euro<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.030> overall

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
of all hair says euro and the overall

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.449 
of all hair says euro and the overall
projects<00:02:22.020> have<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> serious<00:02:22.709> long-term<00:02:22.950> goal

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
projects have a serious long-term goal

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.270 
projects have a serious long-term goal
it's<00:02:23.970> not<00:02:24.239> about<00:02:24.540> developing<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.560> commercial

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
it's not about developing a commercial

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.900 
it's not about developing a commercial
product<00:02:26.670> but<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.180> really<00:02:27.660> about

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
product but it is really about

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.640 
product but it is really about
investigating<00:02:29.910> fundamental<00:02:30.810> abilities<00:02:31.350> like

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
investigating fundamental abilities like

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.699 
investigating fundamental abilities like
interaction<00:02:32.640> with<00:02:32.850> humans<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.709> action

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
interaction with humans and action

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.559 
interaction with humans and action
navigation<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.580> dynamically<00:02:36.030> changing

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
navigation in dynamically changing

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.750 
navigation in dynamically changing
environments<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.319> means<00:02:37.760> navigation

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
environments that means navigation

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.300 
environments that means navigation
amongst<00:02:39.360> humans<00:02:39.810> on<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:39.989> sidewalk<00:02:40.310> our

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
amongst humans on a sidewalk our

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.289 
amongst humans on a sidewalk our
long-term<00:02:42.180> vision<00:02:42.480> maybe<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.620> develop

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
long-term vision maybe is to develop

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.059 
long-term vision maybe is to develop
robots<00:02:45.299> that<00:02:45.600> can<00:02:45.870> actually<00:02:46.170> act<00:02:46.650> and

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
robots that can actually act and

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.270 
robots that can actually act and
interact<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:48.660> human<00:02:49.170> environments<00:02:49.890> like<00:02:49.920> your

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
interact in human environments like your

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.520 
interact in human environments like your
private<00:02:51.230> household<00:02:52.230> where<00:02:52.830> it<00:02:52.980> helps<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.400> in

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
private household where it helps you in

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.789 
private household where it helps you in
undesired<00:02:55.530> tasks<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:57.510> far<00:02:57.780> he<00:02:57.930> says<00:02:58.200> euro

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
undesired tasks and so far he says euro

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.800 
undesired tasks and so far he says euro
is<00:02:59.040> proving<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.670> future<00:03:00.209> where<00:03:00.420> humans

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
is proving that a future where humans

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.410 
is proving that a future where humans
and<00:03:00.959> robots<00:03:01.230> coexist<00:03:02.040> in<00:03:02.160> daily<00:03:02.549> life<00:03:02.579> might

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
and robots coexist in daily life might

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.670 
and robots coexist in daily life might
be<00:03:03.450> closer<00:03:03.900> than<00:03:04.110> most<00:03:04.470> people<00:03:04.920> imagine

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680
