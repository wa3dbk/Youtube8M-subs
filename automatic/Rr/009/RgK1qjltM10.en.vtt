work<00:01:48.960> at<00:01:49.259> all<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:49.680> power<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.040> up<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.670> ethereal

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
work at all we power it up the ethereal

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.359 
work at all we power it up the ethereal
funneling<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.320> thing<00:01:52.500> provides<00:01:52.860> will<00:01:53.130> give

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
funneling this thing provides will give

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.950 
funneling this thing provides will give
us<00:01:53.520> what<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.729> yeah<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.000> didn't<00:01:54.420> even<00:01:54.540> try<00:01:54.930> to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
us what we yeah I didn't even try to

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.660 
us what we yeah I didn't even try to
understand<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.740> well<00:01:56.009> being<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.460> largest

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
understand that well being the largest

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.459 
understand that well being the largest
superstructure<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.960> pyramid<00:01:58.320> can

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
superstructure we have the pyramid can

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.050 
superstructure we have the pyramid can
focus<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.860> energy<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.369> domain<00:01:59.640> around<00:01:59.880> it

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
focus the energy of the domain around it

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.490 
focus the energy of the domain around it
and<00:02:00.180> we<00:02:00.360> can<00:02:00.509> manipulate<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.200> provide<00:02:01.469> a

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
and we can manipulate that to provide a

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.069 
and we can manipulate that to provide a
desired<00:02:01.920> effect<00:02:02.219> huh<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.820> magic<00:02:03.240> we<00:02:03.750> turn<00:02:03.930> it

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
desired effect huh it's magic we turn it

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.170 
desired effect huh it's magic we turn it
on<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.409> does<00:02:04.590> things<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.280> how<00:02:05.430> exactly<00:02:05.579> do<00:02:06.119> we

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
on it does things and how exactly do we

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.940 
on it does things and how exactly do we
do<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.810> mean<00:02:06.990> only<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.320> quarter<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.829> this

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
do that I mean only a quarter of this

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.010 
do that I mean only a quarter of this
thing<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.369> built<00:02:08.610> obviously<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:09.660> full<00:02:09.840> out

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
thing is built obviously it's full out

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.839 
thing is built obviously it's full out
apocalyptic<00:02:10.649> power<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.069> not<00:02:11.220> yet<00:02:11.430> ready<00:02:11.580> for

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
apocalyptic power is not yet ready for

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.750 
apocalyptic power is not yet ready for
use

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
use

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.490 
use
what<00:02:13.209> we<00:02:13.330> have<00:02:13.510> should<00:02:13.810> be<00:02:14.049> enough<00:02:14.260> for<00:02:14.379> our

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
what we have should be enough for our

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.220 
what we have should be enough for our
purposes<00:02:14.530> yeah<00:02:15.310> sounds<00:02:15.879> good<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.120> me<00:02:16.269> how<00:02:17.170> do

purposes yeah sounds good to me how do

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.470 
purposes yeah sounds good to me how do
we<00:02:17.379> turn<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:17.860> on<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.280> don't<00:02:18.700> know<00:02:18.760> but<00:02:19.209> this<00:02:19.420> was

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
we turn it on I don't know but this was

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.050 
we turn it on I don't know but this was

could<00:02:48.220> die<00:02:48.430> in<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.790> future<00:02:49.090> use<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.049> fish

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
could die in the future use the fish

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.110 
could die in the future use the fish
yeah<00:02:50.680> what<00:02:50.950> does<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.190> fish<00:02:51.370> do<00:02:51.609> make<00:02:51.849> me

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
yeah what does the fish do make me

relive the worst moment I ever

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.190 
relive the worst moment I ever
experienced<00:02:54.040> no<00:02:54.609> it<00:02:54.909> just<00:02:55.120> focuses<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.900> in<00:02:56.049> on

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
experienced no it just focuses you in on

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.470 
experienced no it just focuses you in on
a<00:02:56.230> point<00:02:56.560> in<00:02:56.739> space-time<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.459> point<00:02:58.239> in

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
a point in space-time a point in

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.780 
a point in space-time a point in
space-time<00:02:58.930> how<00:02:59.709> do<00:02:59.769> I<00:02:59.920> get<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.159> to<00:03:00.190> focus<00:03:00.430> on

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
space-time how do I get it to focus on

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.960 
space-time how do I get it to focus on
what<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:00.970> want<00:03:01.269> simple<00:03:02.109> use<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:03.099> cooked<00:03:03.430> fish

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
what I want simple use the cooked fish

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.360 
what I want simple use the cooked fish
right<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:04.750> course<00:03:05.049> because<00:03:05.799> this<00:03:05.980> whole<00:03:06.129> thing

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370

right of course because this whole thing
makes<00:03:06.489> so<00:03:06.760> much<00:03:06.909> sense<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.870> cooked<00:03:08.139> fish

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
makes so much sense the cooked fish

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.069 
makes so much sense the cooked fish
right<00:03:08.739> obviously<00:03:09.250> hey<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.329> don't<00:03:10.840> write<00:03:10.959> the

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
are getting a little out of hand how so

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.339 
are getting a little out of hand how so
well<00:03:24.299> remember<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.419> other<00:03:25.569> day<00:03:25.690> when<00:03:26.019> I<00:03:26.049> said

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
well remember the other day when I said

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:27.839 
well remember the other day when I said
that<00:03:26.379> we<00:03:26.590> should<00:03:26.769> harvest<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.280> Gopher<00:03:27.639> when

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
that we should harvest the Gopher when

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.449 
that we should harvest the Gopher when
we<00:03:28.000> leave<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.599> wasn't<00:03:29.379> expecting<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:30.069> to<00:03:30.340> do

we leave I wasn't expecting you to do
the<00:03:30.609> exact<00:03:31.000> opposite<00:03:31.660> but<00:03:31.989> it's<00:03:32.019> a<00:03:32.290> very

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319

more<00:03:36.430> work<00:03:36.730> into<00:03:36.970> accepting<00:03:37.599> our<00:03:37.720> fate<00:03:38.079> here

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
more work into accepting our fate here

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.129 
more work into accepting our fate here
on<00:03:39.129> the<00:03:39.340> ground<00:03:39.639> that<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.120> aren't<00:03:40.569> escaping

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
our situation it's true we're going

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.750 
our situation it's true we're going
through<00:03:43.480> that<00:03:43.569> here<00:03:43.780> but<00:03:44.019> Sir<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:45.099> walls<00:03:45.459> are

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
through that here but Sir the walls are

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.000 
through that here but Sir the walls are
lined<00:03:46.150> with<00:03:46.389> gold<00:03:46.750> I<00:03:47.260> didn't<00:03:47.709> know<00:03:47.799> what<00:03:47.980> else

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
lined with gold I didn't know what else

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.680 
lined with gold I didn't know what else
to<00:03:48.190> do<00:03:48.430> with<00:03:48.639> all<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.879> gold<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.209> thought<00:03:49.449> if

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
to do with all the gold I thought if

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.080 
to do with all the gold I thought if
we'd<00:03:50.079> put<00:03:50.349> this<00:03:50.500> much<00:03:50.769> time<00:03:51.129> into<00:03:51.340> escaping

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
we'd put this much time into escaping

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.729 
we'd put this much time into escaping
we'd<00:03:52.629> probably<00:03:52.870> have<00:03:53.049> a<00:03:53.139> way<00:03:53.349> out<00:03:53.379> of<00:03:53.590> here

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
we'd probably have a way out of here

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.460 
we'd probably have a way out of here
already<00:03:54.250> well<00:03:54.940> it's<00:03:55.329> any<00:03:55.540> consolation<00:03:55.750> we<00:03:56.230> are

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
already well it's any consolation we are

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.110 
already well it's any consolation we are
still<00:03:56.709> definitely<00:03:56.919> lost<00:03:57.370> but<00:03:57.760> at<00:03:57.819> least<00:03:57.909> we're

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
still definitely lost but at least we're

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.670 
still definitely lost but at least we're
lost<00:03:58.269> in<00:03:58.419> style<00:03:58.750> it's<00:03:59.049> only<00:03:59.260> slightly

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
lost in style it's only slightly

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.409 
lost in style it's only slightly
consoling<00:04:00.519> what<00:04:00.760> could<00:04:00.940> make<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:01.209> further

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:01.419

consoling<00:04:02.079> freedom<00:04:02.680> sir<00:04:03.040> okay<00:04:03.609> maybe<00:04:04.030> we<00:04:04.269> can

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
consoling freedom sir okay maybe we can

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:05.939 
consoling freedom sir okay maybe we can
do<00:04:04.510> something<00:04:04.750> with<00:04:04.900> that<00:04:05.019> just<00:04:05.560> bear<00:04:05.799> in<00:04:05.919> mind

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
do something with that just bear in mind

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:07.649 
do something with that just bear in mind
that<00:04:06.220> freedom<00:04:06.639> is<00:04:06.730> probably<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.209> relative

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
that freedom is probably a relative

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.559 
that freedom is probably a relative
illusion<00:04:08.609> do<00:04:09.609> you<00:04:09.760> think<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.239> others<00:04:10.540> are

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
illusion do you think the others are

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.439

think we may be able to escape through

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.120 
think we may be able to escape through
the<00:04:47.840> nether<00:04:48.110> which<00:04:48.380> is<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.590> step<00:04:48.830> in<00:04:48.889> a

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
the nether which is a step in a

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.129 
the nether which is a step in a
direction<00:04:49.490> whether<00:04:49.849> right<00:04:50.150> or<00:04:50.180> wrong<00:04:50.539> I<00:04:50.780> was

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
direction whether right or wrong I was

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.040 
direction whether right or wrong I was
wondering<00:04:51.470> what<00:04:51.919> this<00:04:52.039> was<00:04:52.280> for<00:04:52.360> but<00:04:53.360> Sir<00:04:53.660> I

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.260 
wondering what this was for but Sir I
don't<00:04:54.500> think<00:04:54.680> this<00:04:54.740> portable<00:04:55.130> work<00:04:55.550> of<00:04:55.940> course

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
don't think this portable work of course

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.909 
don't think this portable work of course
will<00:04:56.660> it's<00:04:56.990> even<00:04:57.229> nicer<00:04:57.349> than<00:04:57.620> a<00:04:57.740> regular

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
will it's even nicer than a regular

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.529 
will it's even nicer than a regular
portal<00:04:58.460> although<00:04:58.849> it<00:04:58.970> doesn't<00:04:59.150> need<00:04:59.300> a<00:04:59.330> lot

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
portal although it doesn't need a lot

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:00.879 
portal although it doesn't need a lot
more<00:04:59.569> maintenance<00:04:59.870> and<00:05:00.259> gets<00:05:00.409> much<00:05:00.590> poorer

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
more maintenance and gets much poorer

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.710 
more maintenance and gets much poorer
mileage<00:05:01.130> but<00:05:01.550> you<00:05:01.699> need<00:05:01.880> obsidian<00:05:02.449> sir
