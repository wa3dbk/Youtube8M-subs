00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.990
 walk away sandro towards 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.460
 enter the masses thank you is 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:28.460
 in this case the truth is pretty good 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.520
 because we already have the s60 again in 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.460
 our hands let's start talking 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.120
 a little of your physical appearance as you see 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.070
 we have in this case a version in 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.460
 yellow color but it is also 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.170
 available in white or black 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.200
 and the truth is that it has to be said that 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.500
 it looks pretty old iphone 5 c already 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.480
 that the appearance is the same and the touch 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.870
 of plastic is very similar for the 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.730
 same but exactly 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.390
 today we have a 5-inch screen 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.579
 with resolution hd that the truth is that 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.420
 answer pretty well 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.310
 and good is a resolution something something else 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.110
 lower than usual but for one for a 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.070
 mid-range device as you go to 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.590
 see below for your 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.939
 specifications is pretty good the 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.700
 screen is quite normal with a little 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:24.729
 from your camera a 3 megapixel camera 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.360
 with flash led and the front would be 5 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.490
 megapixels 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.560
 the truth is that the camera to be a 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.650
 mid-range device has us 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.870
 surprised a little bit worked a little 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.200
 better than we expected the truth 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:42.220
 both in shots as in everything in the 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:48.620
 theme of adjustments and others 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:51.860
 It goes very well and has enough of its 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.260
 specifications we found as I have 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.580
 said before with the mean and therefore 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.220
 carries a processor of the 410 range of 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.340
 qualcomm 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.230
 I have always said exactly 400 is 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.290
 a factor to one as a search for God 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.149
 64-bit is a thinker who are 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.550
 starting to assemble some mobiles of 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.040
 mid-range and that the truth is that the 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.140
 overall performance is pretty 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.760
 acceptable also accompanies you 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.370
 8 gigas of internal storage such 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.340
 once this internal storage stays 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.170
 something short for some users too 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.730
 we have 4g gps connectivity and good what 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.730
 typical in the phones that come out today in 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.070
 day let's talk a little about your battery 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.650
 a battery of 2 thousand 150 milliamps 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.320
 that maybe something is short by the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.610
 screen size that are 5 inches 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.680
 but let's hope that this processor 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.380
 Qualcomm do good management of the 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.750
 same 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.940
 and finally you have to say that no 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.180
 we have android lollipop in this case 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.600
 but we have android 44 45 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.640
 let's hope that lenovo updates it 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.640
 and good in general because it is a 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.680
 mid-range device that sits 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.680
 very good in the hand works quite 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.450
 well I do not know maybe it's me 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.000
 would compare at best with a motorcycle gp 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.890
 but with a slightly more premium finish 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.010
 and a little better specifications 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.980
 fixed both on camera and so on so 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.100
 nothing up here the lenovo until here the 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.810
 Lennovo's forgiveness video is the s60 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.810
 hopefully you have enjoyed a greeting
