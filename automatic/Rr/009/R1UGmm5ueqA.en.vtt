the roof of the outdoor living room and

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.460 
the roof of the outdoor living room and
it<00:02:14.680> also<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:15.670> creating<00:02:16.360> power<00:02:16.600> it's<00:02:17.230> nice

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
it also is creating power it's nice

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.110 
it also is creating power it's nice

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
rustic to kind of have that direct

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.720 
rustic to kind of have that direct
correlation<00:02:19.690> like<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:20.730> the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
correlation like that so the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.640 
correlation like that so the

be with putting it over them cabana was
a<00:02:31.000> natural<00:02:31.570> I<00:02:31.720> think<00:02:32.019> you<00:02:32.230> know<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.680> then

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
a natural I think you know and then

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.000 
a natural I think you know and then
what's<00:02:34.720> above<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.110> bedroom<00:02:35.470> wing<00:02:35.620> right<00:02:35.830> now

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
what's above the bedroom wing right now

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.150 
what's above the bedroom wing right now
is<00:02:36.220> probably<00:02:37.180> for<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.720> pools<00:02:38.019> when<00:02:38.829> we<00:02:38.950> try<00:02:39.130> to

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
is probably for the pools when we try to

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.460 
is probably for the pools when we try to
create<00:02:39.489> these<00:02:39.640> little<00:02:40.000> outdoor<00:02:40.470> experiences

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
pocket doors that kind of disappear so

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.870 
pocket doors that kind of disappear so
that<00:02:50.200> it's<00:02:50.950> kind<00:02:51.220> of<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.400> seamless

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
that it's kind of a seamless

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.550 
that it's kind of a seamless
relationship<00:02:52.540> from<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.930> inside<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.290> the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
relationship from the inside to the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.890 
relationship from the inside to the
outside<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:54.280> then<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.060> backyard<00:02:55.510> as<00:02:55.690> well

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
outside and then the backyard as well

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.960 
outside and then the backyard as well
we've<00:02:56.170> got<00:02:56.200> kind<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.860> home<00:02:57.370> sort<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:57.760> wraps

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
we've got kind of a home sort of wraps

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.420 
we've got kind of a home sort of wraps
around<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.480> yard<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:59.079> end<00:02:59.530> up<00:02:59.950> with<00:03:00.130> kind<00:03:00.340> of

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
around the yard and end up with kind of

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.190 
around the yard and end up with kind of
that<00:03:00.519> feeling<00:03:01.060> where<00:03:01.209> your<00:03:01.540> outdoor<00:03:01.900> space<00:03:01.959> is

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
that feeling where your outdoor space is

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.890 
that feeling where your outdoor space is
another<00:03:02.860> place<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.160> live<00:03:03.519> versus<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.780> know

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
another place to live versus you know

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.080 
another place to live versus you know
walking<00:03:05.290> from<00:03:05.650> inside<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.100> out<00:03:06.400> it's<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.820> sort

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
walking from inside to out it's a sort

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.170 
walking from inside to out it's a sort
of<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.440> seamless<00:03:08.579> relationship<00:03:09.579> is<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.880> idea

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
of a seamless relationship is the idea

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.360 
of a seamless relationship is the idea
probably<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.049> first<00:03:11.260> thing<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:11.530> learned<00:03:11.799> is<00:03:12.070> I

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
probably the first thing I learned is I

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.009 
probably the first thing I learned is I
already<00:03:13.030> knew<00:03:13.269> that<00:03:13.480> because<00:03:13.630> I've<00:03:13.840> done<00:03:13.870> a

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
already knew that because I've done a

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.069 
already knew that because I've done a
similar<00:03:14.320> home<00:03:14.590> but<00:03:15.130> is<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.670> what<00:03:16.660> people<00:03:16.959> can

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
similar home but is the what people can

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.569 
similar home but is the what people can
do<00:03:17.230> when<00:03:17.380> they<00:03:17.470> actually<00:03:17.650> pull<00:03:17.980> together<00:03:18.130> and

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
do when they actually pull together and

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.580 
do when they actually pull together and
the<00:03:19.299> old<00:03:19.450> common<00:03:19.810> cause<00:03:19.989> I<00:03:20.200> know<00:03:20.320> it<00:03:20.410> sounds

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
the old common cause I know it sounds

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.860 
the old common cause I know it sounds
cliché<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.430> corny<00:03:21.519> but<00:03:22.000> it's<00:03:22.660> pretty

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
cliché and corny but it's pretty

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.870 
cliché and corny but it's pretty
inspiring<00:03:23.110> to<00:03:23.500> watch<00:03:23.530> people<00:03:23.890> work<00:03:24.220> all<00:03:24.489> night

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880

integrate solar within the design of the

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.740 
integrate solar within the design of the

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
home figuring out what the right

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.080 
home figuring out what the right
footprint<00:04:00.380> is<00:04:00.680> for<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.100> solar<00:04:01.340> energy<00:04:01.700> system

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
footprint is for the solar energy system

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.840 
footprint is for the solar energy system
and<00:04:02.240> we're<00:04:02.450> going<00:04:02.570> to<00:04:02.600> place<00:04:02.840> it<00:04:03.790> making<00:04:04.790> sure

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
and we're going to place it making sure

and we're going to place it making sure
the<00:04:05.150> aesthetics<00:04:05.690> are<00:04:05.900> of<00:04:06.440> key<00:04:07.040> concern<00:04:07.520> and

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
the aesthetics are of key concern and

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.240 
the aesthetics are of key concern and
then<00:04:08.180> and<00:04:08.450> then<00:04:08.540> just<00:04:09.140> equally<00:04:09.500> as<00:04:09.650> important

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250

pleased that this electric system was

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.950 
pleased that this electric system was
installed<00:04:52.760> on<00:04:52.970> this<00:04:53.150> home<00:04:53.330> i<00:04:53.540> would<00:04:53.780> say

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
installed on this home i would say

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.469 
installed on this home i would say
consumers<00:04:54.800> are<00:04:55.479> our<00:04:56.680> most<00:04:57.680> likely<00:04:58.190> not

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
consumers are our most likely not

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.390 
consumers are our most likely not
getting<00:04:59.479> into<00:04:59.750> solar<00:04:59.990> because<00:05:00.500> nobody's

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
getting into solar because nobody's

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.980 
getting into solar because nobody's
explaining<00:05:02.120> it<00:05:02.240> to<00:05:02.270> them<00:05:02.450> i<00:05:02.690> mean<00:05:02.720> their

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
explaining it to them i mean their

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.659 
explaining it to them i mean their
builders<00:05:03.380> don't<00:05:03.620> understand<00:05:04.070> it<00:05:04.220> builders

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
builders don't understand it builders

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.310 
builders don't understand it builders
aren't<00:05:04.940> offering<00:05:05.390> it<00:05:05.570> the<00:05:05.750> builders<00:05:06.080> don't

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
aren't offering it the builders don't

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.710 
aren't offering it the builders don't
know<00:05:06.440> how<00:05:06.560> to<00:05:06.620> do<00:05:06.830> it<00:05:07.010> so<00:05:07.040> if<00:05:07.640> the<00:05:08.180> builders<00:05:08.510> not

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
know how to do it so if the builders not

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.210 
know how to do it so if the builders not
going<00:05:08.900> to<00:05:08.960> walk<00:05:09.080> in<00:05:09.260> through<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.440> process<00:05:10.010> and

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
going to walk in through the process and

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.240 
going to walk in through the process and
explain<00:05:10.640> the<00:05:10.820> costs<00:05:11.510> and<00:05:11.630> the<00:05:11.690> benefits<00:05:12.250> then

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
explain the costs and the benefits then

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.330 
explain the costs and the benefits then
you<00:05:14.030> know<00:05:14.150> likelihood<00:05:14.810> have<00:05:14.930> been<00:05:15.220> doing<00:05:16.220> that

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
you know likelihood have been doing that

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.710 
you know likelihood have been doing that
research<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:16.970> then<00:05:17.030> you're<00:05:17.210> standing<00:05:17.540> it<00:05:17.630> on

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
research and then you're standing it on

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.680 
research and then you're standing it on
their<00:05:17.930> own<00:05:17.960> is<00:05:18.290> pretty<00:05:18.530> small<00:05:18.860> and<00:05:19.220> I<00:05:19.970> think

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
their own is pretty small and I think

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.200 
their own is pretty small and I think
the<00:05:20.750> builders<00:05:21.110> just<00:05:21.380> you<00:05:21.560> know<00:05:22.090> typically<00:05:23.090> a

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
the builders just you know typically a

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.719 
the builders just you know typically a
kind<00:05:23.630> of<00:05:23.720> a<00:05:23.810> slow<00:05:24.080> group<00:05:24.380> to<00:05:24.710> change<00:05:25.310> direction

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
kind of a slow group to change direction

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.880 
kind of a slow group to change direction
so<00:05:26.120> i<00:05:26.180> think<00:05:26.360> it<00:05:26.450> just<00:05:26.479> said<00:05:26.900> it's<00:05:27.530> taken<00:05:27.830> a

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
so i think it just said it's taken a

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.980 
so i think it just said it's taken a
long<00:05:28.160> time<00:05:28.220> to<00:05:28.460> realize<00:05:28.850> that<00:05:29.330> it's<00:05:29.479> important

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
long time to realize that it's important

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.660 
long time to realize that it's important
and

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
and

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.330 
and
so<00:05:30.940> needs<00:05:31.870> to<00:05:32.020> needs<00:05:32.560> to<00:05:32.740> be<00:05:32.830> a<00:05:32.890> shift<00:05:33.160> in<00:05:33.310> the

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
so needs to needs to be a shift in the

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.190 
so needs to needs to be a shift in the
industry<00:05:33.850> so<00:05:34.090> but<00:05:34.720> I<00:05:34.750> think<00:05:34.930> it's<00:05:35.050> happening

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
industry so but I think it's happening

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.930 
industry so but I think it's happening
now<00:05:35.500> I<00:05:35.620> think<00:05:35.800> people<00:05:36.160> are<00:05:36.400> finally<00:05:36.790> getting

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
now I think people are finally getting

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.300 
now I think people are finally getting
its<00:05:37.270> I<00:05:37.990> think<00:05:38.440> one<00:05:38.560> of<00:05:38.590> the<00:05:38.710> main<00:05:38.740> things<00:05:39.130> is

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
its I think one of the main things is

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.190 
its I think one of the main things is
that<00:05:39.340> the<00:05:39.880> perception<00:05:40.450> is<00:05:40.540> that<00:05:40.600> it's<00:05:40.840> harder

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
that the perception is that it's harder

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.610 
that the perception is that it's harder
and<00:05:41.740> more<00:05:41.890> costly<00:05:42.780> either<00:05:43.780> one<00:05:44.110> of<00:05:44.140> those<00:05:44.350> is

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
and more costly either one of those is

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.770 
and more costly either one of those is
enough<00:05:45.520> of<00:05:45.640> a<00:05:45.760> deterrent<00:05:45.910> for<00:05:46.360> I<00:05:46.390> think<00:05:46.600> a<00:05:46.630> lot

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
enough of a deterrent for I think a lot

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.210 
enough of a deterrent for I think a lot
of<00:05:46.810> builders<00:05:47.170> to<00:05:47.290> even<00:05:47.470> take<00:05:47.560> a<00:05:47.620> good<00:05:47.830> look<00:05:48.010> at

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
of builders to even take a good look at

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.210 
of builders to even take a good look at
it<00:05:48.250> because<00:05:48.850> we<00:05:49.090> certainly<00:05:49.800> you<00:05:50.800> know<00:05:50.830> found

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
it because we certainly you know found

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.190 
it because we certainly you know found
out<00:05:51.370> a<00:05:51.400> lot<00:05:51.790> of<00:05:51.940> information<00:05:52.540> that<00:05:52.570> really<00:05:53.050> is

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
out a lot of information that really is

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.520 
out a lot of information that really is
not<00:05:53.410> out<00:05:53.590> on<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:53.860> street<00:05:54.750> such<00:05:55.750> as<00:05:55.990> like<00:05:56.200> I<00:05:56.230> say

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
not out on the street such as like I say

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.650 
not out on the street such as like I say
procuring<00:05:57.340> your<00:05:57.520> product<00:05:57.910> locally<00:05:58.270> if<00:05:58.540> you

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
procuring your product locally if you

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.440 
procuring your product locally if you
can<00:05:58.870> and<00:05:59.290> then<00:05:59.890> also<00:06:00.300> specking<00:06:01.300> into

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
can and then also specking into

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.890 
can and then also specking into
materials<00:06:01.900> that<00:06:02.050> you<00:06:02.200> want<00:06:02.500> at<00:06:02.800> our<00:06:02.920> green<00:06:03.310> and

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
materials that you want at our green and

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.590 
materials that you want at our green and
and<00:06:04.900> but<00:06:05.410> it's<00:06:05.560> basically<00:06:05.950> more<00:06:06.310> of<00:06:06.400> a

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
and but it's basically more of a

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.090 
and but it's basically more of a
practice<00:06:07.600> of<00:06:07.750> the<00:06:07.870> way<00:06:08.020> you<00:06:08.080> your<00:06:08.680> methodology

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
practice of the way you your methodology

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.790 
practice of the way you your methodology
of<00:06:09.490> building<00:06:09.850> the<00:06:09.940> home<00:06:10.120> has<00:06:10.810> changed<00:06:11.440> doesn't

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
of building the home has changed doesn't

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.890 
of building the home has changed doesn't
mean<00:06:11.860> it's<00:06:12.070> worse<00:06:12.280> in<00:06:12.670> fact<00:06:12.880> in<00:06:13.090> ways<00:06:13.330> it's

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
mean it's worse in fact in ways it's

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.500 
mean it's worse in fact in ways it's
easier<00:06:14.130> yeah<00:06:15.130> well<00:06:15.400> all<00:06:15.880> starts<00:06:16.300> with<00:06:16.450> a

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
easier yeah well all starts with a

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.500 
easier yeah well all starts with a
vision<00:06:16.930> and<00:06:17.310> so<00:06:18.310> often<00:06:18.670> that<00:06:18.700> vision<00:06:19.210> begins

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
vision and so often that vision begins

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.980 
vision and so often that vision begins
with<00:06:19.780> the<00:06:19.930> architect<00:06:20.230> and<00:06:20.800> the<00:06:20.920> developer<00:06:21.990> and

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
with the architect and the developer and

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.410 
with the architect and the developer and
and<00:06:23.500> right<00:06:23.950> about<00:06:24.160> that<00:06:24.220> time<00:06:24.460> that's<00:06:25.180> when

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420 
and right about that time that's when

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.300 
and right about that time that's when
sountracks<00:06:25.960> brought<00:06:26.230> into<00:06:26.620> the<00:06:26.740> equation

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
sountracks brought into the equation

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.060 
sountracks brought into the equation
because<00:06:28.150> we<00:06:28.480> bring<00:06:28.720> in<00:06:28.900> the<00:06:29.140> solar<00:06:29.710> energy

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
because we bring in the solar energy

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.580 
because we bring in the solar energy
