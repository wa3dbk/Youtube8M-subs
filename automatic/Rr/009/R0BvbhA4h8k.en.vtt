00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
happening it just like first the middle

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.670 
happening it just like first the middle
block<00:01:24.360> disappears<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.259> then<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.530> outer

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
block disappears and then the outer

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.310 
block disappears and then the outer
blocks<00:01:26.040> disappear<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.790> that's<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:28.080> that

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
blocks disappear and that's just that

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.830 
blocks disappear and that's just that
it's<00:01:28.770> done<00:01:29.040> there's<00:01:29.670> nothing<00:01:30.119> new<00:01:30.360> here

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
it's done there's nothing new here

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.530

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
there's nothing in here before it does

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.749 
there's nothing in here before it does
anything<00:01:33.920> there's<00:01:34.920> nothing<00:01:35.250> here

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
anything there's nothing here

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.319 
anything there's nothing here
after<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.540> done<00:01:36.600> doing<00:01:37.170> anything<00:01:37.640> so<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.670> took

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
after it's done doing anything so I took

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.250 
after it's done doing anything so I took
care<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.600> all<00:01:39.810> that

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
care of all that

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.960 
care of all that
it's<00:01:42.260> a<00:01:42.410> little<00:01:42.740> bit<00:01:42.860> complicated<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.700> way<00:01:43.730> it

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
it's a little bit complicated the way it

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.270 
it's a little bit complicated the way it
works<00:01:44.240> but<00:01:44.540> I'll<00:01:44.720> do<00:01:44.930> my<00:01:44.960> best<00:01:45.140> explaining<00:01:46.070> I

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
works but I'll do my best explaining I

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.970 
works but I'll do my best explaining I
always<00:01:47.240> work<00:01:47.480> so<00:01:47.750> I<00:01:47.780> made<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.380> little<00:01:48.590> test

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
always work so I made a little test

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.090 
always work so I made a little test
setup<00:01:49.340> right<00:01:49.580> here<00:01:50.110> so<00:01:51.110> if<00:01:51.290> I<00:01:51.500> click<00:01:51.980> this

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
setup right here so if I click this

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.710 
setup right here so if I click this
lever<00:01:52.430> you<00:01:52.700> can<00:01:52.730> see<00:01:53.060> some<00:01:53.270> random<00:01:53.540> stuff

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
lever you can see some random stuff

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.710 
lever you can see some random stuff
happens<00:01:54.140> but<00:01:54.290> when<00:01:54.440> I<00:01:54.500> turn<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:54.860> off<00:01:55.270> then<00:01:56.270> all

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
happens but when I turn it off then all

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.320 
happens but when I turn it off then all
these<00:01:56.990> business<00:01:57.470> are<00:01:57.710> going<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:58.220> turn<00:01:58.760> off<00:01:58.970> in

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
these business are going to turn off in

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.290 
these business are going to turn off in
the<00:01:59.800> same<00:02:00.800> game<00:02:01.100> tick<00:02:01.370> I'm<00:02:01.820> going<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.090> say<00:02:02.240> it

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
the same game tick I'm going to say it

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.000 
the same game tick I'm going to say it
like<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:02.690> because<00:02:02.960> they're<00:02:03.440> not<00:02:03.620> actually

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
like that because they're not actually

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.610 
like that because they're not actually
turning<00:02:04.190> off<00:02:04.370> at<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.610> same<00:02:04.850> time<00:02:05.560> they<00:02:06.560> do

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
turning off at the same time they do

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.590 
turning off at the same time they do
actually<00:02:07.070> kind<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:07.640> turn<00:02:07.790> off<00:02:08.000> at<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.390> same

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
actually kind of turn off at the same

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.960 
actually kind of turn off at the same
time<00:02:08.869> if<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:09.770> look<00:02:09.830> at<00:02:10.160> like<00:02:10.460> how<00:02:10.610> this<00:02:10.759> works

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
time if you look at like how this works

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.480 
time if you look at like how this works
because<00:02:11.150> all<00:02:11.330> these<00:02:11.420> businesses<00:02:11.870> are

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
because all these businesses are

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.880 
because all these businesses are
instants<00:02:13.490> off<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.150> then<00:02:14.270> instant<00:02:14.780> pause<00:02:14.959> but

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
instants off and then instant pause but

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.199 
instants off and then instant pause but
it<00:02:16.190> just<00:02:16.400> needs<00:02:16.640> death<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:18.260> if<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:18.500> do<00:02:18.680> that

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
it just needs death so if you do that

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.410 
it just needs death so if you do that
you<00:02:20.209> get<00:02:20.360> this<00:02:20.540> sort<00:02:20.840> of<00:02:20.900> thing<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:22.730> makes

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
you get this sort of thing and it makes

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.240 
you get this sort of thing and it makes
a<00:02:23.630> little<00:02:23.780> bit<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:24.020> sense<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.650> way<00:02:24.770> this<00:02:24.950> works

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
a little bit of sense the way this works

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.300 
a little bit of sense the way this works
because<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:25.910> don't<00:02:26.090> know<00:02:26.180> if<00:02:26.240> you've<00:02:26.360> ever<00:02:26.510> seen

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
because I don't know if you've ever seen

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.460 
because I don't know if you've ever seen
what's<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.270> called<00:02:29.450> again<00:02:29.600> zero<00:02:29.900> six<00:02:30.170> zero

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
what's it called again zero six zero

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.740 
what's it called again zero six zero
tick<00:02:31.070> pulses<00:02:31.520> it's<00:02:31.760> basically<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.510> same

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
tick pulses it's basically the same

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.910 
tick pulses it's basically the same
thing<00:02:33.040> just<00:02:34.040> without<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:35.150> monostable<00:02:35.920> you

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
thing just without the monostable you

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.430 
thing just without the monostable you
just<00:02:37.130> have<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.459> delay<00:02:37.910> which<00:02:38.450> is<00:02:38.480> between<00:02:39.200> them

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
just have to delay which is between them

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.580 
just have to delay which is between them
and<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:40.120> causes<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.300> same<00:02:41.600> effect<00:02:42.440> here<00:02:44.590> so

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
and that causes the same effect here so

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.040 
and that causes the same effect here so
I've<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:47.180> they're<00:02:47.360> just<00:02:47.600> quickly<00:02:47.750> go<00:02:48.019> through

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
I've and they're just quickly go through

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.190 
I've and they're just quickly go through
this<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.910> goes<00:02:50.269> into<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.780> piston

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
this so this goes into that piston

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.350 
this so this goes into that piston
immediately<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:52.010> then<00:02:52.489> that<00:02:52.730> piston<00:02:53.090> here

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
immediately and then that piston here

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.400 
immediately and then that piston here
updates<00:02:53.870> this<00:02:54.290> piston<00:02:54.739> so<00:02:54.920> that's<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.780> 0<00:02:56.780> tick

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
updates this piston so that's a 0 tick

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.880 
updates this piston so that's a 0 tick
update<00:02:58.190> delay<00:02:58.550> and<00:02:59.420> then<00:03:00.320> this<00:03:00.500> piston<00:03:00.860> here

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
update delay and then this piston here

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.250 
update delay and then this piston here
itself<00:03:01.550> is<00:03:01.760> another<00:03:02.030> zero<00:03:02.390> take<00:03:02.630> up<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.959> delay

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
itself is another zero take up a delay

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.590 
itself is another zero take up a delay
and<00:03:03.650> this<00:03:04.010> one<00:03:04.220> as<00:03:04.340> well<00:03:04.550> and<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:05.239> one<00:03:05.480> as

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
and this one as well and that one as

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.949 
and this one as well and that one as
well<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.100> then<00:03:07.100> you<00:03:07.130> have<00:03:07.250> after<00:03:07.790> four<00:03:08.300> 0<00:03:08.660> tick

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
well and then you have after four 0 tick

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.320 
well and then you have after four 0 tick
delays<00:03:09.260> which<00:03:09.560> I<00:03:09.830> have<00:03:10.070> no<00:03:10.400> idea<00:03:10.700> how<00:03:10.940> you<00:03:11.000> want

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
delays which I have no idea how you want

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.020 
delays which I have no idea how you want
me<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:12.530> explain<00:03:12.950> what<00:03:13.250> that<00:03:13.310> is<00:03:13.730> but<00:03:14.000> just

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
me to explain what that is but just

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.320 
me to explain what that is but just
think<00:03:17.030> it's<00:03:17.239> it's<00:03:17.570> a<00:03:17.989> delay<00:03:18.320> so<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.850> update<00:03:20.180> is

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
think it's it's a delay so the update is

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.750 
think it's it's a delay so the update is
later<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:20.930> then<00:03:21.680> here<00:03:21.920> we<00:03:22.190> have<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.519> same

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
later and then here we have the same

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.160 
later and then here we have the same
kind<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.060> setup<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:24.470> goes<00:03:24.650> up<00:03:24.890> over<00:03:25.310> there

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
kind of setup it goes up over there

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.089 
kind of setup it goes up over there
um<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:29.060> there<00:03:29.510> will<00:03:29.720> be<00:03:29.750> a<00:03:29.900> world<00:03:30.349> download<00:03:30.890> in

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
um so there will be a world download in

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.710 
um so there will be a world download in
the<00:03:31.160> description<00:03:31.280> down<00:03:32.000> below<00:03:32.030> if<00:03:32.360> you<00:03:32.510> want

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
the description down below if you want

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.380 
the description down below if you want
to<00:03:32.780> check<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.110> out<00:03:33.170> for<00:03:33.380> yourself<00:03:33.800> and<00:03:34.209> as<00:03:35.209> I

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
to check it out for yourself and as I

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.910 
to check it out for yourself and as I
already<00:03:35.540> mentioned<00:03:35.660> I'm<00:03:36.110> driving<00:03:36.590> off<00:03:36.739> to

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
already mentioned I'm driving off to

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.850 
already mentioned I'm driving off to
Luxembourg<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:38.540> yes<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:39.080> did<00:03:39.319> look<00:03:39.590> up<00:03:39.739> the

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
Luxembourg and yes I did look up the

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.500 
Luxembourg and yes I did look up the
pronunciation<00:03:40.040> for<00:03:40.700> that<00:03:40.880> word<00:03:41.150> on<00:03:41.360> the

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
pronunciation for that word on the

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.949 
pronunciation for that word on the
internet<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.260> few<00:03:42.380> minutes<00:03:42.860> ago<00:03:42.980> but<00:03:43.720> yes<00:03:44.720> I'll

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
internet a few minutes ago but yes I'll

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.640 
internet a few minutes ago but yes I'll
be<00:03:45.050> there<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.890> next<00:03:46.400> couple<00:03:46.850> of<00:03:46.880> days<00:03:47.180> and

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
be there the next couple of days and

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.320 
be there the next couple of days and
that<00:03:48.650> probably<00:03:49.190> means<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:49.610> I<00:03:49.760> won't<00:03:49.940> be<00:03:50.150> able

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
that probably means that I won't be able

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.309 
that probably means that I won't be able
to<00:03:50.660> reply<00:03:51.590> to<00:03:51.620> your<00:03:51.920> comments<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:54.019> upcoming

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
days as well I think it'll be like a
