00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.990
 Y 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.240
 then I will use these shadows 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:45.240
 for eyebrows in dark brown tone I'm going to 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.630
 apply only in the natural way of 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.630
 my eyebrows 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.650
 and I'm going to brush them to blur the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.650
 a little and that they are not very marked 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.630

 It has very good coverage and above all 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.849

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.300
