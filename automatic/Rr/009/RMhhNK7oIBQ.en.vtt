00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
all right I got my f 27 Q here I had

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.020 
all right I got my f 27 Q here I had
done<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.680> speed<00:00:07.980> brake<00:00:08.220> upgrade<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.700> hadn't

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
done the speed brake upgrade I hadn't

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.270 
done the speed brake upgrade I hadn't
seen<00:00:09.179> anybody<00:00:09.360> do<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:09.719> on<00:00:09.929> YouTube<00:00:10.349> yet<00:00:10.620> so<00:00:11.010> I

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
seen anybody do it on YouTube yet so I

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.089 
seen anybody do it on YouTube yet so I
figured<00:00:12.090> I'd<00:00:12.210> try<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.480> out<00:00:12.719> I'm<00:00:12.900> posted<00:00:13.410> see

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
figured I'd try it out I'm posted see

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.530 
figured I'd try it out I'm posted see
some<00:00:14.370> people<00:00:14.549> wanted<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:14.969> see<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.389> or<00:00:15.509> not

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
some people wanted to see that or not

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.790 
some people wanted to see that or not
but<00:00:15.960> anyways<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:18.470> disconnected<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.529> Y

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
but anyways I disconnected that Y

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.230 
but anyways I disconnected that Y
connector<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:21.359> plugged<00:00:22.189> the<00:00:23.189> right<00:00:26.240> cable

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
connector and I plugged the right cable

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.910 
connector and I plugged the right cable
into<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.720> plug<00:00:27.930> where<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.199> Y<00:00:28.320> connector<00:00:28.769> was

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
into the plug where the Y connector was

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.250 
into the plug where the Y connector was
on<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> left<00:00:29.400> into<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.939> left<00:00:30.840> connector

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
on the left into the left connector

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.840 
on the left into the left connector
right<00:00:31.439> directly<00:00:31.769> next<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> Y<00:00:32.369> connector

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
right directly next to the Y connector

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.190 
right directly next to the Y connector
and<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.690> board<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:35.750> they<00:00:36.750> seem<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.079> be

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
and the board and they seem to be

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.260 
and the board and they seem to be
working<00:00:37.399> how<00:00:38.399> they're<00:00:38.550> supposed<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:39.059> I

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
working how they're supposed to I

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.569 
working how they're supposed to I
haven't<00:00:39.930> had<00:00:40.020> any<00:00:40.140> problems<00:00:40.590> still<00:00:40.920> got<00:00:41.190> full

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
haven't had any problems still got full

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.229 
haven't had any problems still got full
rudder<00:00:42.020> control<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.950> I'm<00:00:44.129> going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
rudder control but I'm going to do a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.240 
rudder control but I'm going to do a
test<00:00:45.539> video<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.260> see<00:00:46.620> what<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.829> guys<00:00:46.950> think

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
test video and see what you guys think

00:00:47.250 --> 00:01:02.180 
test video and see what you guys think
so<00:00:47.399> here<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.149> go

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:40.420 

all<00:01:02.790> right<00:01:03.410> and

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:48.819 

kind<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.550> windy<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.660> deal<00:01:43.260> with<00:01:43.440> it

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.350 

turn<00:01:49.400> the<00:01:49.490> high<00:01:49.640> rates<00:01:49.939> on<00:01:50.180> see<00:01:50.450> what<00:01:50.600> happens

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
turn the high rates on see what happens

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.749 
turn the high rates on see what happens
okay<00:01:53.360> speed<00:01:53.750> brakes<00:01:53.960> are<00:01:54.170> on<00:01:54.320> now<00:01:57.670> kind<00:01:58.670> of

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
okay speed brakes are on now kind of

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.840 
okay speed brakes are on now kind of
more<00:01:58.939> mellow

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.570 

definitely<00:02:05.660> slower<00:02:06.130> might<00:02:07.130> have<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.340> make<00:02:07.430> an

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
definitely slower might have to make an

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.330 
definitely slower might have to make an
adjustment<00:02:08.260> so<00:02:09.260> the<00:02:09.380> nose<00:02:09.560> doesn't<00:02:09.830> dive<00:02:10.100> down

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
adjustment so the nose doesn't dive down

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.560 
adjustment so the nose doesn't dive down
as<00:02:10.550> much<00:02:10.760> but<00:02:11.090> they're<00:02:11.270> on<00:02:13.270> kind<00:02:14.270> of<00:02:14.330> cruise

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
as much but they're on kind of cruise

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.150 
as much but they're on kind of cruise
around<00:02:14.720> ride<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.320> wind<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.590> little<00:02:15.680> bit<00:02:15.920> longer

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
around ride the wind a little bit longer

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.670 
around ride the wind a little bit longer
when<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.150> got<00:02:17.300> these<00:02:17.480> on<00:02:17.750> with<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.290> little<00:02:18.560> bit

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
when you got these on with a little bit

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.980 
when you got these on with a little bit
more<00:02:18.890> speed<00:02:19.370> input<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.600> doesn't<00:02:23.900> seem<00:02:24.110> to

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
more speed input and it doesn't seem to

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.550 
more speed input and it doesn't seem to
you<00:02:26.990> having<00:02:27.230> any<00:02:27.350> problem<00:02:29.140> that's<00:02:30.140> with<00:02:30.440> them

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
you having any problem that's with them

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.200 
you having any problem that's with them
out<00:02:30.740> that's<00:02:31.010> what<00:02:31.130> them<00:02:31.250> in<00:02:31.400> now<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:31.850> seems<00:02:32.090> to

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
out that's what them in now it seems to

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.610 
out that's what them in now it seems to
work<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.450> lot<00:02:32.630> better<00:02:32.780> with<00:02:33.080> them<00:02:33.260> turned

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
work a lot better with them turned

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.120 
work a lot better with them turned
inwards<00:02:34.100> towards<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:34.550> propeller<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.860> flies<00:02:37.100> a

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
inwards towards the propeller it flies a

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.880 
inwards towards the propeller it flies a
lot<00:02:37.460> smoother<00:02:37.940> a<00:02:38.180> lot<00:02:38.930> slower<00:02:39.260> more<00:02:39.770> of<00:02:39.830> a

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
lot smoother a lot slower more of a

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.840 
lot smoother a lot slower more of a
glide<00:02:44.020> but<00:02:45.020> yeah<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.530> don't<00:02:46.400> know<00:02:46.580> if<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:46.730> can

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
glide but yeah I don't know if you can

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.220 
glide but yeah I don't know if you can
really<00:02:47.120> see<00:02:47.330> it<00:02:47.450> I'll<00:02:47.570> try<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.780> bring<00:02:47.990> it<00:02:48.110> back

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
really see it I'll try to bring it back

00:02:48.230 --> 00:03:04.350 
really see it I'll try to bring it back
by<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.470> camera<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:48.920> little<00:02:49.040> bit<00:02:49.190> more

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.550 

that's<00:03:05.360> them<00:03:05.630> on<00:03:07.720> it<00:03:08.720> also<00:03:08.870> flies<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.320> lot

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
that's them on it also flies a lot

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.920 
that's them on it also flies a lot
slower<00:03:10.150> up<00:03:11.150> in<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.390> air<00:03:11.480> that's<00:03:11.690> full

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
slower up in the air that's full

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.390 
slower up in the air that's full
throttle<00:03:12.410> it's<00:03:13.070> not<00:03:13.250> really<00:03:13.550> cooking<00:03:15.400> not

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
throttle it's not really cooking not

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.920 
throttle it's not really cooking not
getting<00:03:16.700> too<00:03:16.820> much<00:03:16.940> out<00:03:17.180> not<00:03:17.600> getting<00:03:17.810> too

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
getting too much out not getting too

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.760 
getting too much out not getting too
much<00:03:17.960> speed<00:03:18.380> then<00:03:19.160> I<00:03:19.220> take<00:03:19.430> them<00:03:19.520> off<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:21.620> it's

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
much speed then I take them off and it's

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:44.430 
much speed then I take them off and it's
like<00:03:21.830> a<00:03:21.920> whole<00:03:22.160> nother<00:03:22.280> plane<00:03:23.260> way<00:03:24.260> faster

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.520 

and<00:03:44.950> I<00:03:45.010> turned<00:03:45.280> my<00:03:45.370> expo<00:03:45.820> down<00:03:46.030> to<00:03:46.210> 45<00:03:46.690> it's<00:03:47.500> a

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
and I turned my expo down to 45 it's a

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.160 
and I turned my expo down to 45 it's a
lot<00:03:47.740> more<00:03:47.920> responsive<00:03:48.580> a<00:03:48.760> lot<00:03:49.630> more<00:03:49.810> touchy<00:03:52.170> it

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
lot more responsive a lot more touchy it

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.770 
lot more responsive a lot more touchy it
seems<00:03:53.440> to<00:03:53.650> roll<00:03:53.890> a<00:03:53.920> lot<00:03:54.280> better<00:03:54.520> and<00:03:54.970> just

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
seems to roll a lot better and just

00:03:55.780 --> 00:06:17.840 
seems to roll a lot better and just
all-around<00:03:55.960> fly<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.560> lot<00:03:56.860> more<00:03:57.480> strong<00:04:01.440> so
