00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.750
hello namaste

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.389
salaamwalekum and satsriyakaal;  welcome to another episode with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com.

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.480
Today I'm not cooking today

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.380
let's just mess around with some ladies
holding hands especially their lovely long

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.220
fingers

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.060
hey got you I'm talking about lady's
fingers

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.079
today we're going to make a dish with
Okras

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.089
some people are like me they like crispy accompaniments to their food. I love

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.030
eating crispy fried pakodas with my food

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.010
sometimes i even add boondi to my rice and curd today we'll make a nice

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.749
accompaniment with okra called Bhendi Jaipuri as the name Jaipuri suggest

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:56.579
this dish comes from Rajasthan. This Okra which is a versatile vegetable

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.190
which is called by many names

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.519
Okra, bendakaya, bhendi, bhindi and in
the southwest of US it is also called

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.369
Gumbo. This vegetable is more famously
known by its rows of tiny seeds and

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.360
slimy and sticky texture when you cut open. To make this dish

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.430
Bhendi Jaipuri, you can cut Okra into thin slices like this or you can make

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.509
nice roundels thin roundels like this and
keep it aside

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.780
you need gram flour which is called besan or you can buy on the Indian

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.200
stores you can go and ask for besan you can buy this flour, cumin seeds, salt

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.750
chilli powder

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.810
amchoor powder and little vinegar. See both of these adds tinge of sourness to your

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.500
dish

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.409
if you don't have vinegar just use amchoor powder and if you don't have amchoor

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.749
powder you could just use the vinegar

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:55.740
I'm going use little bit of both of them are slightly broken cashew nut

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.229
this is not a must it's optional but you
know you could use it because I love

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.090
cashew nut and i'm going to use some of
this

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.990
this dish is very easy to make all you need
to do is

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:14.630
take okra add your cashew nuts, a teaspoon full of Cumin seeds

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:23.060
Amchoor powder, add salt ,add chilli powder,chilli powder add it to your taste if you

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.590
like it spicy add little more if you have
to add besan flour now you may have

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.790
to add little water

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.190
so what I prefer is, I like to sprinkle
little bit of vinegar

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.390
ok and then mix it up real good

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.380
adding this salt and little vinegar what it
does is it brings out little moisture from

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.880
this okra so when you add flour besan
flour you don't need any more extra

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.310
water if you like to add some onions

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.799
you could also add some sliced onion but
this is not what a traditional

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.000
recipe calls for i love to add a little
onion and I love onion pakoda

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.500
so I'm just adding a little bit of onion
to this preparation.Cutting okra is a

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.459
kind of a skill

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.359
remember the more you cut it the slimier it becomes okra

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.590
Is commonly used as a thickening agent in soups and stews because of its sticky

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.650
nature there are a couple of ways you can
minimize the slime

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.739
simply trim of the end and avoid

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.930
cutting or puncturing the okra
capsules I always find a best way to

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.880
Avoid this slimy nature is slightly
soute in the oil and then add it to my

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.390
dishes and that doesn't bring any of the
sliminess to the dish and this okra is

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.040
very widely used in Africa Middle
Eastern Greek Turkish Caribbean and

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.799
South American cuisines apart from
indian cuisine

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.310
Okra is a powerhouse of valuable
nutrients

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.079
it is a good source of vitamin C low in
calories and completely fat free

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.450
it has plenty of vitamin A calcium and
fiber.A perfect candidate for a healthy

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.459
cooking on Vahrehvah.com

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.329
but how healthy it is depends upon what
you're going to cook.Today we are going to

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.079
deep fry

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:14.930
So to make a deep-fry healthy always
try to use, You know fresh oil

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.130
make sure you fry at a right
temperature for a right amount of time

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.229
that is when your vegetables absorb
minimum amount of oil into them

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.729
now the vegetables are sitting here for
two minutes so the salt has been brought out

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.169
a little bit moisture

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.009
so what you do take little besan and
just sprinkle on top

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:40.009
Ok don't mix it, overly mix it, just
sprinkle a little bit okay

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.750
there's no quantity to see from this i'm
using may be less than 1 cup maybe so

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:52.370
just sprinkle it like this and just let
it sit for another few minutes okay

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.310
now if your Okra is dry so then you
can add sprinkle a little bit few drops

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.210
of water

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.770
just make sure limit it to just just few drops of water you do not just crush them or try

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.570
to mix them squeeze it hard just slightly
toss them over and then you will see this

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.840
okra nicely coated with besan

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.370
now the mixture is ready so how about
frying this Okra

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.020
so all you do is, As I told you don't you
know just toss them a little bit but

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.960
not overly mix them and then drop your
Okra into the oil

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.500
Do not drop all the Okra  at once just
to drop few enough just to fry and

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.950
Fry it at a medium heat. Fry them till they are slightly golden brown

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:58.550
ah look at this Okra, uff and also
remember that do not make large

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.020
quantities if you're going to fry these
Okra  for a party do not mix all these

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.360
ingredients and keep it for a long time

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.050
make sure between the mixing and cooking
time we should not be more than 10

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.770
minutes

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.660
always make sure that you mix them in
small batches because once you mix in

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.210
large batches and try to fry they will all get sticky. Now that you have fried them really

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.100
good cool

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.250
look at this look at this wow

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:33.740
boom boom boom boom!! While I'm cooking I think of this song you know this is my lovely lady lumps by

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.540
Black Eyed Peas

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.990

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:46.010

Okra for parties and all that

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.780
what I do I add little extra cashew nuts and after frying i'll pick up all those

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:03.320
okras which the cashew nut is stick
and I keep it aside and eat with my

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.220

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.700

lady fingers

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.100
I hope you'll love making this quick and easy dish. Okra may also be

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:24.260
steamed boiled pickled sauteed stir fried as a whole and you can make so

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.700
many wonderful dishes with oka and we're going to make all these dishes in our

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:35.390
show but remember these ladies are very
sensitive these okras should not

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:40.160
be cooked in pan made of iron copper and brass since the chemical reaction take

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.690
this okra little bit black

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:46.120
so always try to use a steel vessel or a non-stick pan. I hop

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.919
you have enjoyed today's session of learning how to make this crispy accompaniment to
