00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.290
 welcome to a new video tutorial of 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.870
 magnetecs bonis today we will learn to do 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.179
 a handbag in the shape of an envelope 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.400
 you have the pattern to make the bag in 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.350
 our blog we will leave the link in 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.690
 the description the materials that we're going 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.450
 will need to be the fabric that 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.320
 let's choose cut with the pattern a lining 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.120
 cut in the same way tape 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.130
 decorative elements a piece of 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.320
 velcro and thermo adhesive gun 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.010
 fuse the first step we will make will be 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.870
 paste the lining to the fabric below 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.210
 facing the two parts from within 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.210
 we will be putting tail 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:03.820
 and hitting 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.820
 and we will do this together with the forum 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.210
 when we have already put the lining 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.130
 let's put a ribbon around to 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.130
 to ensure what is more beautiful 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.500
 we put the glue 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.740
 we will stick the tape 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.409
 then we will turn around and stick it 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.409
 on the other side 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.159
 as you see we will go little by little giving him the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.860
 back until we get to the end with 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.520
 the lining and the tape already put on 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.420
 two sides we are going to assemble the bag 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:10.200
 we will put the bottom part up 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.350
 and then we will stick the two sides on top 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.340
 of the tape and not 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.340
 and the 8 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.170
 thus 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.930
 we do not put 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.930
 and we carefully press 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.290
 and now they cried 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.330
 we put glue on top of the tape 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:02.550
 and we match the piece of tape 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.550
 with the other piece of tape 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.800
 and we press 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.950
 we already have the shape of the bag made 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.870
 cover and now let's put the piece of 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.870
 Velcro here to be able to close it 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.870
 we love you 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.100
 and in this way we have the bag 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.750
 we could leave it like that or decorate it like 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.050
 let's do us 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.630
 we are going to decorate it by putting a 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.050
 piece of pompom ribbon around 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.880
 the lid and a piece of tape you enjoy in 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.520

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.400
 ornaments and good looking we already have the bag 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.230
