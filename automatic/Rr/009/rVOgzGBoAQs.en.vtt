00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
what makes this so cool is the way that

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.320 
what makes this so cool is the way that
you<00:00:22.949> actually<00:00:23.189> charge<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.060> there<00:00:24.210> are

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
you actually charge it and there are

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.779 
you actually charge it and there are
three<00:00:24.600> different<00:00:24.810> ways<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.320> do<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.529> first<00:00:26.519> off

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
three different ways to do so first off

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.599 
three different ways to do so first off
this<00:00:27.000> solar<00:00:27.300> panel<00:00:27.810> design<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.439> just<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.400> it

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
this solar panel design is just that it

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.510 
this solar panel design is just that it
uses<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.150> Sun<00:00:30.630> or<00:00:30.900> lights<00:00:31.380> around<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.070> to

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
uses the Sun or lights around you to

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.700 
uses the Sun or lights around you to
actually<00:00:32.700> charge<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.570> battery<00:00:33.960> at<00:00:34.200> hand<00:00:34.530> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
actually charge the battery at hand and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.200 
actually charge the battery at hand and
you<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:35.010> see<00:00:35.219> if<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.430> actually<00:00:35.640> receiving

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
you can see if it's actually receiving

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.450 
you can see if it's actually receiving
power<00:00:36.630> by<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.230> green<00:00:37.530> little<00:00:37.920> dot<00:00:38.190> right

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
power by this green little dot right

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.549 
power by this green little dot right
here<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.820> see<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.180> light<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.930> brighter<00:00:40.260> it

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
here you see that light the brighter it

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.350 
here you see that light the brighter it
is<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.070> more<00:00:41.309> power<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.910> actually

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
is the more power it's actually

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.840 
is the more power it's actually
receiving<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.110> already<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.219> room<00:00:44.550> it's

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
receiving so already in this room it's

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.150 
receiving so already in this room it's
receiving<00:00:45.300> some<00:00:45.629> power<00:00:45.870> from<00:00:46.559> these<00:00:46.739> lights

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
receiving some power from these lights

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.740 
receiving some power from these lights

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
tells you how much battery power is left

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.800 
tells you how much battery power is left
in<00:01:29.700> your<00:01:29.820> battery<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.450> when<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.659> actually

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
in your battery and when you actually

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.630

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
plug in your charger to your battery it

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.399 
plug in your charger to your battery it
lets<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.030> know<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.810> battery<00:01:34.140> pack<00:01:34.200> is

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
lets you know that the battery pack is

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.960 
lets you know that the battery pack is
actually<00:01:34.950> being<00:01:35.159> charged<00:01:35.640> through<00:01:35.880> an

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
actually being charged through an

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.760 
actually being charged through an
animation<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.840> battery<00:01:37.140> pack<00:01:37.229> along<00:01:37.590> with

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
animation the battery pack along with

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.010 
animation the battery pack along with
the<00:01:37.890> solar<00:01:38.130> panel<00:01:38.780> resistant<00:01:39.780> they're<00:01:39.900> all

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
the solar panel resistant they're all

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.929 
the solar panel resistant they're all
made<00:01:40.200> out<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.619> sort<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.950> rubber<00:01:41.250> material

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
made out of this sort of rubber material

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.160 
made out of this sort of rubber material
so<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.180> don't<00:01:42.360> really<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.720> worry<00:01:42.840> about

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
so you don't really have to worry about

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.899 
so you don't really have to worry about
them<00:01:43.439> getting<00:01:43.470> wet<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.009> use<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.399> power<00:01:44.610> monkey

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
them getting wet I use the power monkey

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.850 
them getting wet I use the power monkey
during<00:01:45.180> comic-con<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.930> charge<00:01:46.229> two<00:01:46.500> different

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
during comic-con to charge two different

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.380 
during comic-con to charge two different
iphones<00:01:46.979> while<00:01:47.490> we<00:01:47.670> were<00:01:47.759> waiting<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.210> line

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
iphones while we were waiting in line

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.090 
iphones while we were waiting in line
and<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.720> totally<00:01:48.930> drained<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.590> battery<00:01:49.740> so

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
and that totally drained the battery so

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.830 
and that totally drained the battery so
we<00:01:50.220> had<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.460> go<00:01:50.610> about<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.119> actually<00:01:51.240> recharge

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
we had to go about and actually recharge

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.170 
we had to go about and actually recharge
it<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.229> using<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.890> solar<00:01:53.100> power<00:01:53.399> panels<00:01:54.000> it

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
it and using the solar power panels it

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.090 
it and using the solar power panels it
actually<00:01:54.479> does<00:01:54.659> take<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> little<00:01:55.259> long<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.649> do

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
actually does take a little long to do

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.920 
actually does take a little long to do
this<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.460> mean<00:01:56.579> several<00:01:57.000> hours<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.479> fully

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
this I mean several hours to fully

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.929 
this I mean several hours to fully
charge<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.439> battery<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.280> if<00:01:59.579> you're<00:01:59.759> using

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
charge the battery and if you're using

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.090 
charge the battery and if you're using
like<00:02:00.149> an<00:02:00.540> actual<00:02:00.810> power<00:02:01.140> plug<00:02:01.500> it's<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:02.070> to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
like an actual power plug it's going to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.190 
like an actual power plug it's going to
be<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.250> little<00:02:02.579> bit<00:02:02.759> faster<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:03.810> still<00:02:03.990> a

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
be a little bit faster but it's still a

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.050 
be a little bit faster but it's still a
couple<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.890> hours<00:02:05.219> at<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.820> can't

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
couple of hours at that you can't

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.730 
couple of hours at that you can't
actually<00:02:06.240> charge<00:02:06.780> para<00:02:07.140> monkey<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.590> then

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
actually charge para monkey and then

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.740 
actually charge para monkey and then
charge<00:02:08.039> your<00:02:08.250> external<00:02:08.759> device<00:02:09.179> at<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.450> same

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
charge your external device at the same

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.390 
charge your external device at the same
time<00:02:09.989> which<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.379> kind<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.679> frustrating<00:02:10.860> but

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
time which is kind of frustrating but

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.470 
time which is kind of frustrating but
slightly<00:02:11.760> understand

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
slightly understand

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.940 
slightly understand
overall<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.080> think<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:13.860> great

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950
