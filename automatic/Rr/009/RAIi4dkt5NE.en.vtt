down and again I'm gonna draw that exact

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.710 
down and again I'm gonna draw that exact
same<00:01:27.210> V<00:01:27.960> again<00:01:28.290> right<00:01:29.040> here<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.939> close<00:01:30.210> off<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
same V again right here to close off the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.020 
same V again right here to close off the
shape<00:01:30.960> now<00:01:31.409> there<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.680> go<00:01:31.860> that's<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.490> box<00:01:32.729> how

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
shape now there you go that's a box how

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.490 
shape now there you go that's a box how
easy<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.509> now<00:01:33.930> you'll<00:01:34.110> want<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.350> make<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
tall box you make a tall why

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.780 
tall box you make a tall why
check<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.930> out<00:01:37.200> here's<00:01:37.920> your<00:01:38.100> Y<00:01:38.280> right<00:01:38.729> here

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
check this out here's your Y right here

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.350 
check this out here's your Y right here
across<00:01:39.570> and

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
across and

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.499 
across and
then<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:41.810> draw<00:01:42.049> a<00:01:42.320> V<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:43.250> same<00:01:43.610> size<00:01:43.970> as<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.360> Y

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
then you draw a V the same size as the Y

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.859 
then you draw a V the same size as the Y
up<00:01:44.750> there<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.380> draw<00:01:45.710> long<00:01:46.100> ones<00:01:47.030> connecting

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
up there you draw long ones connecting

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.749 
up there you draw long ones connecting
the<00:01:47.990> two<00:01:48.170> points<00:01:48.200> like<00:01:48.649> this<00:01:48.890> turn<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.610> page

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
the two points like this turn the page

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.170 
the two points like this turn the page
upside<00:01:50.180> down<00:01:50.360> draw<00:01:51.049> that<00:01:51.439> V<00:01:51.950> again<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:52.970> there

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
upside down draw that V again and there

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.719 
upside down draw that V again and there
you<00:01:53.299> go<00:01:53.479> there's<00:01:53.869> a<00:01:53.960> long<00:01:54.289> box<00:01:54.649> now<00:01:55.130> one<00:01:55.520> more

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
you go there's a long box now one more

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.789 
you go there's a long box now one more
trick<00:01:56.090> especially<00:01:56.750> for<00:01:56.960> steams<00:01:57.200> hat<00:01:57.500> check

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
trick especially for steams hat check

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.950 
trick especially for steams hat check
this<00:01:57.950> out<00:01:58.159> you're<00:01:58.789> gonna<00:01:58.880> draw<00:01:59.210> Y<00:01:59.539> right

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
this out you're gonna draw Y right

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.450 
this out you're gonna draw Y right
around<00:02:00.140> here<00:02:00.500> but<00:02:00.649> we're<00:02:00.740> gonna<00:02:00.799> make<00:02:01.100> one

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
around here but we're gonna make one

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.779 
around here but we're gonna make one
part<00:02:01.700> of<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:01.970> Y<00:02:02.149> very<00:02:03.020> very<00:02:03.649> very<00:02:04.369> long

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
part of the Y very very very long

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.639 
part of the Y very very very long
instead<00:02:05.570> of<00:02:05.689> stopping<00:02:05.990> here<00:02:06.380> we're<00:02:06.530> gonna

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
instead of stopping here we're gonna

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.160 
instead of stopping here we're gonna
keep<00:02:06.920> going<00:02:06.979> okay<00:02:07.759> same<00:02:08.509> thing<00:02:08.750> with<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.989> B

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
keep going okay same thing with the B

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.320 
keep going okay same thing with the B
beneath<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:09.769> the<00:02:10.069> B<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.429> gonna<00:02:10.670> be<00:02:10.819> small<00:02:11.150> but

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
beneath it the B is gonna be small but

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.930 
beneath it the B is gonna be small but
it's<00:02:11.480> gonna<00:02:11.599> be<00:02:11.810> very<00:02:12.110> long<00:02:12.800> just<00:02:13.459> as<00:02:13.580> long<00:02:13.790> as

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
it's gonna be very long just as long as

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.900 
it's gonna be very long just as long as
that<00:02:14.090> Y<00:02:14.330> is<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.870> then<00:02:15.260> again<00:02:15.380> use<00:02:16.280> your<00:02:16.310> ones

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
that Y is and then again use your ones

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.030 
that Y is and then again use your ones
here<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.480> close<00:02:17.660> off<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.080> shape<00:02:18.290> turn<00:02:18.890> your

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
here to close off the shape turn your
