00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
believe that you know fighters should

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.440 
believe that you know fighters should
fight<00:00:43.559> at<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> level<00:00:43.980> or<00:00:44.250> wait<00:00:45.000> where<00:00:45.180> they<00:00:45.270> feel

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
fight at a level or wait where they feel

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.389

that<00:00:45.570> their<00:00:45.719> strongest<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.890> don't<00:00:47.219> want<00:00:47.340> to

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
that their strongest you don't want to

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.950 
that their strongest you don't want to
get<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> bigger<00:00:47.730> guy<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.210> reduce<00:00:48.780> them<00:00:48.930> to

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
get a bigger guy and reduce them to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.389 
get a bigger guy and reduce them to
nothing<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.680> where<00:00:49.829> he's<00:00:49.950> weaker<00:00:50.280> and

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
nothing and to where he's weaker and

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.160 
nothing and to where he's weaker and
more<00:00:50.520> susceptible<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.180> getting<00:00:51.210> injured<00:00:51.660> we

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
more susceptible to getting injured we

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.569 
more susceptible to getting injured we
like<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.469> build<00:00:52.620> our<00:00:52.770> fighters<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.250> make<00:00:53.460> him

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
like to build our fighters to make him

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.779 
like to build our fighters to make him
better<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.910> stronger<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:55.309> again<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.340> think<00:00:56.489> Bob
