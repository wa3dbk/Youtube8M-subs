00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.840 
their own you know what I mean so this
past

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
past

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.540 
past
I<00:02:08.880> was<00:02:09.210> doing<00:02:09.480> that<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.960> I<00:02:10.770> was<00:02:10.980> just<00:02:11.010> using

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
I was doing that and I was just using

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.120 
I was doing that and I was just using
this<00:02:11.640> black<00:02:11.880> point<00:02:12.330> one<00:02:12.570> alone<00:02:13.560> which<00:02:13.980> I

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
this black point one alone which I

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.890 
this black point one alone which I
haven't<00:02:14.340> done<00:02:14.490> with<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.940> pencil<00:02:15.210> eyeliner<00:02:15.450> in

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
like probably a year and a half so it's

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.410 
like probably a year and a half so it's
very<00:02:18.510> odd<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.170> like<00:02:19.290> gosh<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:19.920> easy

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
very odd it is like gosh this is so easy

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.180 
very odd it is like gosh this is so easy
but<00:02:21.440> this<00:02:22.440> lasted<00:02:23.430> all<00:02:23.640> day<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:25.020> stayed<00:02:25.440> black

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.930 
highly enough about these so with that
being<00:03:45.660> said<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.440> only<00:03:46.620> downside<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.520> only

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
being said the only downside the only

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.700 
being said the only downside the only
downside<00:03:48.420> is<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.960> these<00:03:49.230> might<00:03:49.380> be<00:03:49.530> hard

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
downside is that a these might be hard

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.260 
downside is that a these might be hard
to<00:03:49.770> find<00:03:49.950> depending<00:03:50.730> on<00:03:50.820> where<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.000> are<00:03:51.030> they

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
to find depending on where you are they

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.910 
to find depending on where you are they
are<00:03:51.300> a<00:03:51.480> sort<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.840> new<00:03:52.050> product<00:03:52.530> and<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.710> lot<00:03:52.890> of

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
are a sort of new product and a lot of

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.620 
are a sort of new product and a lot of
these<00:03:53.130> like<00:03:53.640> every<00:03:53.910> time<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.090> look<00:03:54.330> for<00:03:54.510> more

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
these like every time I look for more

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.810 
these like every time I look for more
shades<00:03:54.870> they're<00:03:55.050> like<00:03:55.170> sold<00:03:55.380> out<00:03:55.500> so<00:03:56.490> that's<00:03:56.670> a

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
shades they're like sold out so that's a

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.590 
shades they're like sold out so that's a
little<00:03:57.030> tricky

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
little tricky

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.570 
little tricky
your<00:03:58.230> Walgreens<00:03:58.680> might<00:03:58.890> not<00:03:59.070> sell<00:03:59.340> them

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
your Walgreens might not sell them

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
your Walgreens might not sell them
frankly<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:01.500> then<00:04:01.800> what<00:04:02.010> else<00:04:02.160> oh<00:04:02.390> just<00:04:03.390> that

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
frankly and then what else oh just that

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.350 
frankly and then what else oh just that
because<00:04:04.590> they're<00:04:04.830> so<00:04:04.860> creamy<00:04:05.400> they<00:04:05.880> wear<00:04:06.180> down

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
because they're so creamy they wear down

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.970 
because they're so creamy they wear down
quickly<00:04:06.750> meaning<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.530> have<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.680> sharpen

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
quickly meaning you have to sharpen

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.370 
quickly meaning you have to sharpen
these<00:04:08.220> like<00:04:08.460> once<00:04:08.940> every<00:04:09.270> other<00:04:09.300> day<00:04:09.510> which

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
these like once every other day which

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.710 
these like once every other day which
you<00:04:10.770> know<00:04:11.490> I<00:04:11.700> kind<00:04:12.210> of<00:04:12.270> wish<00:04:12.420> these<00:04:12.570> are

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
you know I kind of wish these are

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.150 
you know I kind of wish these are
retractable<00:04:13.170> but<00:04:13.380> at<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.530> same<00:04:13.680> time<00:04:13.860> I<00:04:14.010> feel

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
retractable but at the same time I feel

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.230 
retractable but at the same time I feel
like<00:04:14.250> it<00:04:14.370> wouldn't<00:04:14.520> be<00:04:14.610> as<00:04:14.730> creamy<00:04:15.000> if<00:04:15.120> they

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
like it wouldn't be as creamy if they

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.490 
like it wouldn't be as creamy if they
weren't<00:04:15.450> there's<00:04:15.690> something<00:04:16.080> about<00:04:16.260> these

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
weren't there's something about these

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.610 
weren't there's something about these
and<00:04:16.830> of<00:04:17.160> course<00:04:17.370> these<00:04:17.609> are<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:18.380> very

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
and of course these are a very

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.219 
and of course these are a very
expensive<00:04:20.190> dupe<00:04:20.880> for<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.870> Urban<00:04:22.139> Decay

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
expensive dupe for the Urban Decay

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.150

24-hour pencils as well as the NYX slide
on<00:04:26.340> pencils<00:04:26.790> I<00:04:27.000> might<00:04:27.990> venture<00:04:28.139> to<00:04:28.380> say<00:04:28.500> these

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
on pencils I might venture to say these

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.219 
on pencils I might venture to say these
are<00:04:28.800> better<00:04:28.919> I<00:04:29.220> really<00:04:30.060> might<00:04:30.510> now<00:04:30.750> I<00:04:30.780> only

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
are better I really might now I only

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.840 
are better I really might now I only
tried<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.590> Urban<00:04:31.800> Decay<00:04:31.860> ones<00:04:32.160> once<00:04:32.520> and<00:04:32.790> I

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
tried the Urban Decay ones once and I

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.629 
tried the Urban Decay ones once and I
don't<00:04:32.910> even<00:04:33.090> own<00:04:33.330> any<00:04:33.570> currently<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:35.100> NYX

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639

don't even own any currently and the NYX
ones<00:04:35.910> I've<00:04:36.210> tried<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:36.810> I<00:04:36.870> love<00:04:37.229> them<00:04:37.560> but<00:04:37.770> I

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
ones I've tried and I love them but I

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.409 
ones I've tried and I love them but I
think<00:04:38.280> these<00:04:38.400> are<00:04:38.460> better<00:04:38.760> and<00:04:39.030> they're<00:04:39.180> still

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
think these are better and they're still

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.600 
think these are better and they're still
cheaper<00:04:39.840> I<00:04:40.050> hope<00:04:40.590> that<00:04:40.770> you<00:04:40.830> guys<00:04:41.010> go<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.490> give
