00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.850 
were meant to be an easy one then this
is<00:02:45.390> getting<00:02:45.660> me<00:02:45.750> loads<00:02:45.960> of<00:02:46.050> cash<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.440> points

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
is getting me loads of cash and points

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.410 
is getting me loads of cash and points
going<00:02:47.490> through<00:02:47.730> these<00:02:47.850> bucket<00:02:48.270> list

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
going through these bucket list

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.660 
going through these bucket list
challenges<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.770> where<00:02:50.100> that<00:02:50.130> wraps<00:02:50.520> up

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
challenges so where that wraps up

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.100 
challenges so where that wraps up
another<00:02:50.760> one<00:02:51.060> anyway<00:02:51.270> I<00:02:51.360> hope<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.510> enjoyed<00:02:51.930> it

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
another one anyway I hope you enjoyed it

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.230 
another one anyway I hope you enjoyed it
if<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.500> did<00:02:52.620> stay<00:02:53.130> tuned<00:02:53.430> for<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.820> next<00:02:53.940> one<00:02:54.210> I

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
if you did stay tuned for the next one I

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.120 
if you did stay tuned for the next one I
think<00:02:54.570> there's<00:02:54.750> only<00:02:54.780> one<00:02:55.050> or<00:02:55.170> two<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.530> go<00:02:55.680> so

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
think there's only one or two to go so

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.310 
think there's only one or two to go so
we're<00:02:56.550> as<00:02:57.000> always<00:02:57.360> thanks<00:02:57.690> for<00:02:57.720> watching<00:02:58.110> and
