 and now we will talk about come play shooter 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.410
 plan king 2 whose release in russia was 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.360
 just recently a game developer studio 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.940
 sony online entertainment famous 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.750
 Work was also the first series of the game 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.970
 zeit plan 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.710
 like the predecessor plan site 2 this 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.990
 open world first person shooter 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.369
 which lead a nonstop war for 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.710
 resources three factions 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.900
 new freedom-loving conglomerate 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.949
 idealists thirsting for self and 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.349
 of independence 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.719
 Iran Republic of hereditary war 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.480
 soldiers by vocation of a state of mind that 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.610
 this tradition of military duty and sovereignty 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.649
 Wang scientists who launched a grand 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.110
 alien civilization mechanisms 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.420
 believed in a new stage of development 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.190
 human fighting fractions for 3 pretty 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.629
 large continents divided into 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.649
 sectors that we have to 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.020
 grab 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.210
 and it happens so we go on 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.370
 enemy base and capture key 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.809
 same task owners base points 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.090
 protect accordingly 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.280
 the more captured our sectors 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.350
 fractions the more resources we get 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.720
 which in turn are divided into three 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.030
 types of infantry used to buy 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.790
 various equipment such as grenades 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.140
 or technical kits technical with the help of them we 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.920
 will buy a different ground 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.880
 technique for example tanks or combat and 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.650
 aviation for them as follows from 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.080
 titles are acquired various 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.130
 aircrafts 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.380
 therefore the player can at any time 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.110
 battlefield cause a tank or fighter and 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.450
 break through the enemy's defense addition to 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.280
 this technique can be modified 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.670
 for example btr after upgrade will be able 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.460
 perform the role of respawn for the soldiers 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.320
 also to enslave the world planet side 2 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.310
 we are offered 6 classes each of 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.979
 which has its own unique 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.540
 saboteur abilities use 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.210
 sniper rifle and can become 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.009
 invisible paratrooper ordinary soldier with 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.090
 a machine of unique abilities 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.210
 flies on the jetpack 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.380
 so very mobile 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.030
 attack machine gunner with increased 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.619
 survival rate which can also 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.009
 effectively destroy enemy equipment 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.950
 using a grenade launcher, the doctor heals and 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.899
 resurrects allies engineer puts 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.660
 turrets repair equipment as well 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.789
 throws cartridges to allies and max 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.190
 very high survival exoskeleton 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.560
 and powerful weapons but it is bought 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.130
 cram resources and has a limit 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.330
 reuse time 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.400
 graphic design could be 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.590
 call good if not one but to 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.569
 terrible engine optimization 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.670
 that is, at the maximum settings the game 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.500
 looks pretty good but play 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.110
 on them you can only if available 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.400
 very powerful computer otherwise 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.350
 case will have to be content 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.019
 soapy textures and poor 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.489
 special effects donat in the Russian version on 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.590
 the moment is 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.989
 only premium account increasing 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.790
 pumping speed but judging because 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.100
 there is on the euro later will be added 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.260
 unlocker trunks set then possible and 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.150
 something else 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.190
 summarizing the plan site 2 shows 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.359
 we are truly a large-scale war in everything 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.519
 its diversity 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:01.640
 everyone will like players for whom 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.650
 the battlefield was not mass enough 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.970
 Whether the review prepared the hands specifically for 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.970
 wet point
