00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.940
 great I certainly heard that the Poles 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:17.270
 savvy guys but to such 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.270
 degrees 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:31.920
 Fuck what the fuck you know all the same 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.230
 for good reason in Russian and Polish 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.149
 there are similar words i'm pretty sure that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.100
 the thought of making such a gun of these guys in 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.480
 head in Russian sounded you look 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.480
 this is purely our invention 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.770
 but now the Poles will have no problems with 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.320
 trash make a few thousand such 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.120
 guns and all the garbage problem now in 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.890
 germany and how powerful is this cool 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.280
 the blast sounded now I know how 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.899
 record sounds for all shooters by the way 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.730
 notice u dude who tank 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.379
 kept the hand bandaged apparently in 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.210
 last time he held his right i 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.039
 imagine the scene when he comes home 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.229
 horn what happened why you hands 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.090
 bandaged that 5 blew this 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.670
 stupid tank first did not blow a 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.440
 they made a gun out of him, and secondly we donâ€™t 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.150
 just got drunk and got into a fight at all 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.920
 cool fun for guys the whole week 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.760
 garbage saves to make a weekend 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.760
 holiday hall 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.950
 and now I shut up and show you 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.950
 video 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.800
 that's what i call really explosive 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:45.280
 it seems to me this time the Poles are a bit 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:47.230
 overdone but now you know how 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.060
 bombing the farts i'm straight dragged on how 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.650
 with the explosion, the reserve takes off 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.630
 the wheel you are free now 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.700
 you no longer have to lie in close 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.410
 the trunk and to enhance the brightness of this 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.150
 joyful moment at the end of falling growth 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.130
 as serpentine expose both 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.600
 dudes in the cabin ohuyu I think the degree 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.700
 their sho mare at the level of sensations after 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.500
 view 9 episodes 3 seasons of the game 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.300
 of thrones although in this explosion there was one 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.040
 small positive moment all the dust 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.840
 and the dirt from the car shook out 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.340
 balloon exploded down can become with you 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.350
 witnessing the appearance of the first in the world 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.030
 flying pelvis I think after this video 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.740
 many who have no desire to ride 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.780
 gas and still very cool to watch this 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.780
 scenic moment evil sleeves 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.420
 and now I seem to know why she is 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.420
 typewriters years sticker hammer normally 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.849
 damn out chat is hot in the mosh studio window 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.849
 open 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.840
 Yes, we probably have all the shooting 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.239
 soaring here these windows are a good example 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.590
 video games which are poorly tested then 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.000
 there is something that we now saw with you 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.500
 can be called gods at home 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.550
 surely there is another one in this building 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.290
 dirt with which you can 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.120
 infinitely money stuff at all this 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.769
 chip construction company so we 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:21.400
 present you our new option 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:23.620
 useless windows us dick you open fucking 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.180
 how was it possible to sag under 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.890
 who made windows setting handles 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.599
 really suspected nothing they 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.670
 look like they even turn 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.410
 it is impossible though it seems I know why everything is so 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.000
 strangely made on most likely this house 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.829
 is somewhere far to the north where 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.329
 summer lasts only a few days 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.920
 the designer decided that this window is wider 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.569
 it makes no sense to open it all inside 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.819
 unites well or there in all rooms 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.530
 air conditioners are interesting to me 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.180
 for what purpose did the man shoot this video 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.890
 hardly only to stupidly in 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.569
 Inet lay perhaps have complained in 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.489
 technical support of ati construction company 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.140
 did not believe that this is possible here he is 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:04:01.780
 provided evidence 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:03.370
 but in general it is the house of chuck norris because 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.560
 ordinary varnish on this mainstream for 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.019
 weaklings chuck is not looking for easy ways and 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.989
 opens any windows even if instead 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.639
 them brick wall and now you 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.670
 experience gastronomic envy 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:20.079
 especially if you are dieting 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:24.550
 great just great she's so 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:27.250
 This delicious pizza at home I'm a bitch 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.110
 I want to eat some strange pizza 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.849
 not well, it is more serious in the vast 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.650
 the sandwich looks like a half loaf of bread 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.590
 poured ketchup added tomatoes cheese 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.030
 Sausage is your home 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.680
 although you know if the dishes add 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.000
 Prefix at home you can do 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.099
 Anything like that 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.960
 assign for example ordinary rice with 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.000
 a piece of fish can be called sushi 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.919
 home-made or fried chicken will 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.539
 buffalo wings at home 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:54.340

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.919

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.930
 here is real now probably half the people 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.669
 paused and ran himself a bottle 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.260
 wrap honestly still not 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.789
 I can understand why I took this video in 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.650
 episode apparently at that moment I am very 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.330
