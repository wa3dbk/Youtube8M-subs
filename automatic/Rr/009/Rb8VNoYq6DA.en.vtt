different<00:01:37.049> versions<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.470> him<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.280> know<00:01:38.850> how

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
different versions of him and I know how

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.359 
different versions of him and I know how
how<00:01:39.329> how<00:01:39.720> saturated<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.470> wanted<00:01:40.740> make<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.130> Pens

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
how how saturated I wanted make the Pens

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.190 
how how saturated I wanted make the Pens
to<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.240> know<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.360> kept<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> pants<00:01:42.960> like

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
to be so you know I kept the pants like

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.380 
to be so you know I kept the pants like
I<00:01:43.290> faded<00:01:43.590> out<00:01:43.799> blue<00:01:44.310> color<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.030> makes<00:01:45.240> it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
I faded out blue color and that makes it

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.090 
I faded out blue color and that makes it
look<00:01:45.570> more<00:01:45.780> legit<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.380> guess<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.950> would<00:01:47.070> call

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
look more legit I guess you would call

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.420 
look more legit I guess you would call
it<00:01:47.570> for<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> top<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.110> actually<00:01:49.409> shows<00:01:49.920> that

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
it for the top I actually shows that

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.260 
it for the top I actually shows that
dragged<00:01:52.000> up<00:01:52.300> old-looking<00:01:53.230> thing<00:01:53.650> because

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
dragged up old-looking thing because

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.110 
dragged up old-looking thing because
there's<00:01:55.270> really<00:01:55.600> no<00:01:55.960> no<00:01:56.440> pole<00:01:56.770> shirt<00:01:57.160> that<00:01:57.580> you

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
there's really no no pole shirt that you

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.080 
there's really no no pole shirt that you
can<00:01:58.150> put<00:01:58.540> on<00:01:58.720> and<00:01:58.990> goes<00:01:59.560> I<00:02:00.100> think<00:02:00.520> I<00:02:00.790> think<00:02:01.000> the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
can put on and goes I think I think the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.940 
can put on and goes I think I think the
regular<00:02:01.450> t-shirt<00:02:01.660> that<00:02:02.020> you<00:02:02.080> have<00:02:02.350> on<00:02:02.530> in<00:02:02.800> the

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
regular t-shirt that you have on in the

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.110 
regular t-shirt that you have on in the
game<00:02:03.100> where<00:02:03.310> you<00:02:03.370> can<00:02:03.520> actually<00:02:03.640> put<00:02:03.940> on<00:02:04.090> your

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
game where you can actually put on your

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.750 
game where you can actually put on your
character<00:02:04.680> not<00:02:05.680> regular<00:02:06.040> t-shirt<00:02:06.220> you<00:02:06.460> put<00:02:06.670> on

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
character not regular t-shirt you put on

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.820 
character not regular t-shirt you put on
it<00:02:06.910> actually<00:02:07.030> goes<00:02:07.420> over<00:02:08.259> your<00:02:08.410> ability<00:02:08.770> it

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
it actually goes over your ability it

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.080 
it actually goes over your ability it
doesn't<00:02:09.070> go<00:02:09.130> underneath<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.700> belt<00:02:09.910> which<00:02:10.060> is

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
doesn't go underneath the belt which is

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.940 
doesn't go underneath the belt which is
actually<00:02:10.509> kind<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.690> weird<00:02:10.869> I've<00:02:11.620> always

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
actually kind of weird I've always

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.100 
actually kind of weird I've always
thought<00:02:12.130> about<00:02:12.850> that<00:02:13.450> in<00:02:13.630> this<00:02:13.750> game<00:02:13.959> you're

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
thought about that in this game you're

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.540 
thought about that in this game you're
like<00:02:14.260> we<00:02:14.380> always<00:02:14.590> wondered<00:02:15.040> why<00:02:15.280> they've<00:02:15.520> made

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
like we always wondered why they've made

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.370 
like we always wondered why they've made
that<00:02:15.850> choice<00:02:16.000> for<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.390> regular<00:02:16.720> polo<00:02:17.050> shirt

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
that choice for the regular polo shirt

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.530 
that choice for the regular polo shirt
they<00:02:17.530> put<00:02:17.740> on<00:02:17.920> but<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.670> regular<00:02:19.000> t-shirt<00:02:19.240> you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
they put on but the regular t-shirt you

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.090 
they put on but the regular t-shirt you
put<00:02:19.720> on<00:02:19.840> why<00:02:20.080> do<00:02:20.140> they<00:02:20.350> make<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:20.890> where<00:02:21.010> it

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
put on why do they make it to where it

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.350 
put on why do they make it to where it
almost<00:02:21.310> goes<00:02:21.550> over<00:02:21.910> your<00:02:22.060> belt

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
almost goes over your belt

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.729 
almost goes over your belt
why<00:02:22.510> can't<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:22.900> like<00:02:23.110> have<00:02:23.290> an<00:02:23.410> option<00:02:23.709> to

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
why can't you like have an option to

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.890 
why can't you like have an option to
like<00:02:24.040> tucking<00:02:24.520> your<00:02:24.610> tuck<00:02:24.940> in<00:02:25.090> your<00:02:25.209> shirt<00:02:25.270> or

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
like tucking your tuck in your shirt or

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.300 
like tucking your tuck in your shirt or
leave<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.350> tucked<00:02:26.560> down<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:26.890> know<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.190> would

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
leave it tucked down you know that would

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.860 
leave it tucked down you know that would
actually<00:02:27.550> make<00:02:27.730> some<00:02:28.239> of<00:02:28.330> these<00:02:28.450> great<00:02:28.720> shows

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
actually make some of these great shows

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.540 
actually make some of these great shows
a<00:02:28.930> lot<00:02:29.110> easier<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:30.100> wouldn't<00:02:30.340> have<00:02:30.459> to

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
a lot easier and I wouldn't have to

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.910 
a lot easier and I wouldn't have to
resort<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:31.030> using<00:02:31.209> such<00:02:31.840> recreations<00:02:32.410> and

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
resort to using such recreations and

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.040 
resort to using such recreations and
such<00:02:33.250> closest<00:02:33.820> this<00:02:34.120> one<00:02:34.360> because<00:02:34.959> the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
such closest this one because the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.330 
such closest this one because the
problem<00:02:35.350> with<00:02:35.470> using<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:35.860> course<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.280> that

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
problem with using this course is that

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.250 
problem with using this course is that
you'll<00:02:36.700> see<00:02:36.910> when<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.239> get<00:02:37.390> really<00:02:37.630> close

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
you'll see when you get really close

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.229 
you'll see when you get really close
it<00:02:38.590> actually<00:02:38.770> fades<00:02:39.190> through<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.760> jacket<00:02:40.030> a

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
it actually fades through the jacket a

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.580 
it actually fades through the jacket a
little<00:02:40.600> bit<00:02:40.750> in<00:02:40.870> green<00:02:41.080> right<00:02:41.110> there<00:02:41.410> as<00:02:41.530> you

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
little bit in green right there as you

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.520 
little bit in green right there as you
can<00:02:41.770> see<00:02:42.010> because<00:02:42.640> it's<00:02:43.150> actually<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:44.200> nature

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
can see because it's actually the nature

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.199 
can see because it's actually the nature
of<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.739> game<00:02:44.830> you<00:02:44.980> know<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.280> clothes<00:02:45.550> the

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
of the game you know it clothes the

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.330 
of the game you know it clothes the
clothes<00:02:46.420> aren't<00:02:46.630> they<00:02:46.750> got<00:02:46.870> different

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
clothes aren't they got different

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.620 
clothes aren't they got different
thickness<00:02:48.340> they<00:02:48.850> actually<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.300> colors

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
thickness they actually the colors

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.150 
thickness they actually the colors
actually<00:02:49.989> overlap<00:02:50.590> each<00:02:50.770> other<00:02:50.890> which

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
actually overlap each other which

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.729 
actually overlap each other which
actually<00:02:51.459> no<00:02:51.970> messes<00:02:52.840> around<00:02:52.989> with<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.590> way

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
actually no messes around with the way

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.500 
actually no messes around with the way
the<00:02:53.920> creation<00:02:54.310> should<00:02:54.520> look<00:02:54.760> now<00:02:55.030> I'm<00:02:55.330> from

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
the creation should look now I'm from

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.850 
the creation should look now I'm from
far<00:02:55.720> away<00:02:55.840> you<00:02:55.959> will<00:02:56.200> never<00:02:56.380> be<00:02:56.530> able<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.739> see

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
far away you will never be able to see

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.140 
far away you will never be able to see
the<00:02:56.980> difference<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:57.430> know<00:02:57.549> we<00:02:57.670> will<00:02:57.820> see<00:02:57.850> the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
the difference you know we will see the

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.199 
the difference you know we will see the
mistake<00:02:58.570> but<00:02:59.500> from<00:03:00.370> close<00:03:00.580> up<00:03:00.790> you'll<00:03:01.000> be<00:03:01.120> able

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
mistake but from close up you'll be able

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.300 
mistake but from close up you'll be able
to<00:03:01.360> see<00:03:01.510> it<00:03:01.680> but<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.739> know<00:03:02.860> this<00:03:03.010> is<00:03:03.130> pretty

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
to see it but you know this is pretty

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.100 
to see it but you know this is pretty
much<00:03:03.489> as<00:03:03.610> close<00:03:03.700> as<00:03:04.060> possible<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.660> can<00:03:04.840> get<00:03:04.989> to

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
much as close as possible you can get to

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.050 
much as close as possible you can get to
