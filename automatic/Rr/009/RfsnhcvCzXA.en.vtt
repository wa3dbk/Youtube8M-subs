00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
is pretty simplistic I think this is one

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.819 
is pretty simplistic I think this is one
of<00:02:28.829> the<00:02:28.980> first<00:02:29.280> ones<00:02:29.489> with<00:02:29.639> only<00:02:29.819> two<00:02:30.829> graphics

tool<00:02:32.400> Rangers<00:02:33.000> on<00:02:33.180> here<00:02:33.359> so<00:02:33.569> it<00:02:34.260> comes<00:02:34.500> with

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
tool Rangers on here so it comes with

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.059 
tool Rangers on here so it comes with
the<00:02:34.799> power<00:02:35.130> sword<00:02:35.660> dragon<00:02:36.660> dagger<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.200> a

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
the power sword dragon dagger and a

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.390 
the power sword dragon dagger and a
blade<00:02:38.849> blaster<00:02:39.680> so<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.799> course<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.160> can't

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
blade blaster so of course you can't

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.159 
blade blaster so of course you can't
really<00:02:41.639> put<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.030> blade<00:02:42.209> blaster<00:02:42.419> to<00:02:42.840> open<00:02:43.109> the

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:43.169 
really put the blade blaster to open the

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.430 
really put the blade blaster to open the
blade<00:02:43.349> blaster<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:44.540> that's<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.139> let's<00:02:46.319> get

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
blade blaster and that's it so let's get

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
going to do I'm probably doing this

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.559

here<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:25.079> armored<00:03:25.410> Red<00:03:25.590> Ranger<00:03:26.060> it<00:03:27.060> looks

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
here is the armored Red Ranger it looks

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.060 
here is the armored Red Ranger it looks
a<00:03:27.419> little<00:03:27.600> bit<00:03:27.780> lighter<00:03:28.019> red<00:03:28.289> but<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.650> darker

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
a little bit lighter red but is a darker

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.729 
a little bit lighter red but is a darker
red<00:03:29.299> there<00:03:30.299> is<00:03:30.479> the<00:03:30.630> power<00:03:30.870> sword<00:03:31.259> it's

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
red there is the power sword it's

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:32.010 
red there is the power sword it's
probably

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
probably

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.010 
probably
the<00:03:32.470> same<00:03:32.770> one<00:03:33.100> from<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.240> original<00:03:34.690> red

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
the same one from the original red

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.710 
the same one from the original red
ranger<00:03:35.490> dragon<00:03:36.490> dagger<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.450> blade

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
ranger dragon dagger and the blade

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.180 
ranger dragon dagger and the blade
blaster<00:03:37.900> in<00:03:38.260> there<00:03:38.440> as<00:03:38.530> well<00:03:38.710> so<00:03:38.740> this<00:03:39.040> is

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
blaster in there as well so this is

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.500 
blaster in there as well so this is
probably<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.520> green<00:03:39.790> ranger<00:03:39.910> and<00:03:40.240> this<00:03:40.360> is

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
probably the green ranger and this is

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.740 
probably the green ranger and this is
from<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.750> regular<00:03:41.050> red<00:03:41.860> ranger<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:43.210> armor<00:03:43.600> is

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
from the regular red ranger the armor is

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.960 
from the regular red ranger the armor is
removable<00:03:44.590> just<00:03:45.160> want<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.400> say<00:03:45.550> that<00:03:45.760> right

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.720 
removable just want to say that right
now<00:03:46.000> but<00:03:46.450> it<00:03:46.570> takes<00:03:46.840> a<00:03:47.050> lot<00:03:47.380> of<00:03:47.410> work<00:03:47.860> to<00:03:48.100> do<00:03:48.250> the
