00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.240 

I'm<00:00:07.480> gonna<00:00:07.660> no<00:00:07.900> heat<00:00:08.110> call<00:00:08.350> my<00:00:08.770> name<00:00:08.920> is<00:00:09.070> Tony

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.250 
I'm gonna no heat call my name is Tony

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.030 
I'm gonna no heat call my name is Tony
Diploma<00:00:10.380> first<00:00:11.380> thing<00:00:11.530> I'm<00:00:11.590> checking<00:00:11.830> is

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.040 
Diploma first thing I'm checking is

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.130 
Diploma first thing I'm checking is
making<00:00:12.340> sure<00:00:12.520> that<00:00:12.760> is<00:00:13.090> oil<00:00:13.330> on<00:00:13.450> the<00:00:13.570> tank<00:00:13.840> a

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.140 
making sure that is oil on the tank a

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.580 
making sure that is oil on the tank a
lot<00:00:14.950> of<00:00:15.040> times<00:00:15.250> these<00:00:15.400> gauges<00:00:15.670> don't<00:00:16.029> work

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
lot of times these gauges don't work

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.990 
lot of times these gauges don't work
this<00:00:17.590> is<00:00:17.710> a<00:00:17.740> gauge<00:00:17.980> indicator<00:00:18.520> it<00:00:18.640> shows<00:00:18.820> how

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
this is a gauge indicator it shows how

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.390 
this is a gauge indicator it shows how
much<00:00:19.119> oil<00:00:19.330> you<00:00:19.510> should<00:00:19.720> have<00:00:19.869> in<00:00:19.990> the<00:00:20.080> tank<00:00:20.400> my

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
much oil you should have in the tank my

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.380 
much oil you should have in the tank my
trick<00:00:21.699> is<00:00:21.730> let's<00:00:22.570> open<00:00:22.810> up<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:24.119> little<00:00:25.119> plug

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
trick is let's open up the little plug

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.630 
trick is let's open up the little plug
with<00:00:25.690> a<00:00:25.720> pair<00:00:25.900> of<00:00:25.930> pliers<00:00:26.310> when<00:00:27.310> I<00:00:27.369> stick<00:00:27.610> my

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
with a pair of pliers when I stick my

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.970 
with a pair of pliers when I stick my
rule<00:00:28.000> down<00:00:28.300> to<00:00:28.480> half<00:00:28.600> it'll<00:00:29.590> actually<00:00:29.680> could

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
rule down to half it'll actually could

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.369 
rule down to half it'll actually could
tell<00:00:30.130> me<00:00:30.250> how<00:00:30.400> much<00:00:30.550> oil<00:00:30.699> is<00:00:30.910> in<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:31.029> tank<00:00:31.379> and

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
tell me how much oil is in the tank and

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.500 
tell me how much oil is in the tank and
I<00:00:32.470> have<00:00:32.590> a<00:00:32.619> little<00:00:32.830> chart<00:00:33.129> and<00:00:34.030> it<00:00:34.120> goes<00:00:34.330> by

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
I have a little chart and it goes by

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.880 
I have a little chart and it goes by
inches<00:00:35.160> more<00:00:36.160> inches<00:00:36.550> the<00:00:36.730> more<00:00:36.910> oil<00:00:37.210> so<00:00:37.770> if<00:00:38.770> we

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
inches more inches the more oil so if we

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.500 
inches more inches the more oil so if we
came<00:00:39.010> across<00:00:39.280> all<00:00:39.520> that<00:00:39.760> and<00:00:39.910> all<00:00:40.059> that's<00:00:40.239> good

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
came across all that and all that's good

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.319 
came across all that and all that's good
I<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.950> to<00:00:42.070> put<00:00:42.220> a<00:00:42.250> chemical<00:00:42.489> inside<00:00:43.059> there

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
I like to put a chemical inside there

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.479 
I like to put a chemical inside there
that<00:00:43.600> eats<00:00:44.260> up<00:00:44.410> all<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:44.800> sludge<00:00:45.070> because<00:00:45.280> that

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
that eats up all the sludge because that

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:46.740 
that eats up all the sludge because that
could<00:00:45.640> be<00:00:45.760> another<00:00:45.969> problem<00:00:46.450> while<00:00:46.600> you're

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
could be another problem while you're

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.810 
could be another problem while you're
not<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:47.020> heats<00:00:47.200> not<00:00:47.320> working<00:00:47.469> I<00:00:48.070> have<00:00:48.760> a

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
not the heats not working I have a

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.090 
not the heats not working I have a
chemical<00:00:49.210> here<00:00:49.360> called

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
chemical here called

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.990 
chemical here called
superheat<00:00:51.960> you're<00:00:52.960> pouring<00:00:53.200> in<00:00:53.500> your<00:00:53.649> tank<00:00:54.000> it

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
superheat you're pouring in your tank it

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.520 
superheat you're pouring in your tank it
tells<00:00:55.239> you<00:00:55.390> in<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.570> background<00:00:56.020> how<00:00:56.200> to<00:00:56.260> use

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
tells you in the background how to use

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.270 
tells you in the background how to use
it<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.879> can<00:00:58.030> buy<00:00:58.149> it<00:00:58.210> in<00:00:58.360> any<00:00:58.539> home<00:00:58.809> center<00:00:59.280> or

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
it you can buy it in any home center or

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.469 
it you can buy it in any home center or
even<00:01:00.700> look<00:01:00.850> on<00:01:01.000> my<00:01:01.090> website<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:02.710> it<00:01:02.800> does<00:01:02.980> it

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
even look on my website what it does it

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.600 
even look on my website what it does it
it<00:01:04.479> loosens<00:01:04.869> up<00:01:04.989> all<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.440> sludge<00:01:05.710> that<00:01:06.460> would

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
it loosens up all the sludge that would

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.840 
it loosens up all the sludge that would
burn<00:01:06.850> up<00:01:07.090> into<00:01:07.479> your<00:01:07.570> burner<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:08.490> lot<00:01:09.490> of<00:01:09.640> people

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
burn up into your burner a lot of people

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.510 
burn up into your burner a lot of people
like<00:01:09.970> to<00:01:10.000> put<00:01:10.149> the<00:01:10.390> tanks<00:01:10.830> back<00:01:11.830> pitch<00:01:12.160> so<00:01:12.369> all

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
like to put the tanks back pitch so all

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.710 
like to put the tanks back pitch so all
the<00:01:12.670> sludge<00:01:12.940> leads<00:01:13.330> away<00:01:13.959> from<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.500> valve

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
the sludge leads away from the valve

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.139 
the sludge leads away from the valve
doesn't<00:01:16.720> believe<00:01:17.050> in<00:01:17.170> that<00:01:17.289> theory<00:01:17.590> I<00:01:18.149> think

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
doesn't believe in that theory I think

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.960 
doesn't believe in that theory I think
it<00:01:19.390> should<00:01:19.509> be<00:01:19.569> pitched<00:01:19.899> towards<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.679> valve

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
it should be pitched towards the valve

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.150 
it should be pitched towards the valve
so<00:01:21.970> if<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:22.119> have<00:01:22.240> any<00:01:22.420> sludge<00:01:22.780> it<00:01:23.289> burns

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
so if you have any sludge it burns

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.339 
so if you have any sludge it burns
slowly<00:01:24.550> if<00:01:25.539> you<00:01:25.599> get<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.810> good<00:01:25.990> amount<00:01:26.170> of

00:01:26.339 --> 00:01:26.349 
slowly if you get a good amount of

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:27.809 
slowly if you get a good amount of
sludge<00:01:26.530> in<00:01:26.740> that<00:01:26.890> if<00:01:27.099> there's<00:01:27.369> being<00:01:27.550> back

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819 
sludge in that if there's being back

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.330 
sludge in that if there's being back
pitch<00:01:28.090> for<00:01:28.300> 20<00:01:28.630> years<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:29.770> start<00:01:30.069> to<00:01:30.160> get<00:01:30.280> a

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
pitch for 20 years you start to get a

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.380 
pitch for 20 years you start to get a
leak<00:01:30.610> in<00:01:30.849> that<00:01:31.390> tank<00:01:31.660> you've<00:01:32.560> got<00:01:32.709> problems

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
leak in that tank you've got problems

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.410 
leak in that tank you've got problems
that's<00:01:34.390> my<00:01:34.630> theory<00:01:35.550> this<00:01:36.550> here<00:01:36.789> is<00:01:36.910> a<00:01:36.940> fill<00:01:37.270> an

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
that's my theory this here is a fill an

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.440 
that's my theory this here is a fill an
event<00:01:37.750> life<00:01:38.550> okay<00:01:39.550> what<00:01:39.729> the<00:01:39.819> vent<00:01:40.000> line<00:01:40.179> does

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
event life okay what the vent line does

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.779 
event life okay what the vent line does
it<00:01:40.690> has<00:01:40.840> a<00:01:40.869> whistle<00:01:41.289> on<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.590> it<00:01:42.429> tells<00:01:42.640> the

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
it has a whistle on it it tells the

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.690 
it has a whistle on it it tells the
driver<00:01:43.060> outside<00:01:43.740> how<00:01:44.740> much<00:01:44.920> oil<00:01:45.039> you<00:01:45.280> can<00:01:45.490> put

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
driver outside how much oil you can put

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.359 
driver outside how much oil you can put
in<00:01:45.759> the<00:01:45.849> tank<00:01:46.060> when<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.959> whistle<00:01:47.319> stops<00:01:47.590> oil

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
in the tank when the whistle stops oil

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.430 
in the tank when the whistle stops oil
tank<00:01:48.640> is<00:01:48.759> filled<00:01:49.030> that's<00:01:49.599> very<00:01:49.869> important<00:01:50.380> to

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
tank is filled that's very important to

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.399 
tank is filled that's very important to
have<00:01:50.590> out<00:01:50.800> an<00:01:50.890> oil<00:01:51.099> tank
