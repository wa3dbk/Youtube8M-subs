00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
continuation bets and these small games

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.900 
continuation bets and these small games
don't<00:00:55.290> work<00:00:55.440> nearly<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.920> well<00:00:56.190> as<00:00:56.399> they<00:00:56.790> would

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
don't work nearly as well as they would

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.090 
don't work nearly as well as they would
in<00:00:57.030> bigger<00:00:57.210> games<00:00:57.480> because<00:00:57.870> people<00:00:58.500> find<00:00:58.800> all

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
in bigger games because people find all

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.979 
in bigger games because people find all
sorts<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.460> excuses<00:00:59.670> to<00:01:00.000> call<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.450> the<00:01:00.540> flop<00:01:00.750> so

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
sorts of excuses to call on the flop so

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.510 
sorts of excuses to call on the flop so
if<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.410> make<00:01:01.559> continuation<00:01:02.129> bet<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.399> flop

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
if you make continuation bet on the flop

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.770 
if you make continuation bet on the flop
then<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.180> be<00:01:03.270> committed<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.629> doing

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
then you have to be committed to doing

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.389 
then you have to be committed to doing
it<00:01:03.930> on<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.079> turn<00:01:04.289> and<00:01:04.320> then<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:05.159> know<00:01:05.250> make

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
it on the turn and then you know make

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.770 
it on the turn and then you know make
another<00:01:05.640> decision<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.149> river<00:01:06.360> should<00:01:06.659> I

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
another decision on the river should I

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.050 
another decision on the river should I
Bluff<00:01:07.079> and<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:07.680> find<00:01:07.860> yourself<00:01:08.060> in

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
Bluff and you just find yourself in

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.359 
Bluff and you just find yourself in
no-man's<00:01:09.720> land<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.200> really<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.950> best<00:01:11.100> way<00:01:11.340> to

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
no-man's land so really the best way to

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.850 
no-man's land so really the best way to
play<00:01:11.750> these<00:01:12.750> games<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.290> think<00:01:13.500> about<00:01:13.710> in

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
play these games is to think about in

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.700 
play these games is to think about in
terms<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.479> what<00:01:15.479> used<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.960> played<00:01:16.500> which

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
terms of what used to be played which

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.469 
terms of what used to be played which
was<00:01:16.860> like<00:01:17.010> a<00:01:17.040> spread<00:01:17.400> limit<00:01:17.640> game<00:01:17.820> okay<00:01:18.330> a

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
was like a spread limit game okay a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.230 
was like a spread limit game okay a
spread<00:01:18.930> limit<00:01:19.200> game<00:01:19.460> was<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> game<00:01:20.760> where<00:01:21.000> it

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
spread limit game was a game where it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.179 
spread limit game was a game where it
was<00:01:21.360> limit<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.869> sense<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:23.070> know

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
was limit in the sense that you know

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.980 
was limit in the sense that you know
yeah<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.640> bit<00:01:24.150> max<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.540> was<00:01:24.630> like<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.780> dollar

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
yeah the bit max if it was like a dollar

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.539 
yeah the bit max if it was like a dollar
before<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.500> flop<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> dollar<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.369> flop

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
before the flop a dollar on the flop

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.820 
before the flop a dollar on the flop
then<00:01:26.729> for<00:01:27.000> eight<00:01:27.180> now<00:01:27.810> think<00:01:28.080> about<00:01:28.200> how<00:01:28.530> big

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
then for eight now think about how big

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.560 
then for eight now think about how big
of<00:01:28.860> an<00:01:29.010> advantage<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:30.030> professional<00:01:30.479> players

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
of an advantage the professional players

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.300 
of an advantage the professional players
have<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.080> this<00:01:31.200> case<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.680> know<00:01:31.799> you're<00:01:32.130> making

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
have in this case you know you're making

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.130 
have in this case you know you're making
a<00:01:32.490> lotta<00:01:32.670> you're<00:01:32.909> playing<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.210> lot<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.509> $1<00:01:33.869> pots

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
a lotta you're playing a lot of $1 pots

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.270 
a lotta you're playing a lot of $1 pots
but<00:01:34.320> then<00:01:34.439> when<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.590> put<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.830> four<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.189> eight

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
but then when you put the four and eight

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.679 
but then when you put the four and eight
in<00:01:35.460> you've<00:01:35.670> always<00:01:35.820> got<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.450> know<00:01:36.540> you're

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
in you've always got it you know you're

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.120 
in you've always got it you know you're
always<00:01:36.810> there<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.530> amateurs<00:01:37.890> don't

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
always there and the amateurs don't

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.800 
always there and the amateurs don't
really<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.580> know<00:01:38.670> differentiate<00:01:39.330> properly

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
really you know differentiate properly

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.480 
really you know differentiate properly
so<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.259> would<00:01:40.560> probably<00:01:40.799> approach<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.369> with<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
so I would probably approach it with the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.370 
so I would probably approach it with the
same<00:01:41.549> sort<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.060> strategy<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.659> know<00:01:42.750> playing<00:01:43.290> a

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
same sort of strategy you know playing a

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.570 
same sort of strategy you know playing a
lot<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> little<00:01:43.860> I'm<00:01:43.979> gonna<00:01:44.070> play<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.369> many

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
lot a little I'm gonna play this many

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.219 
lot a little I'm gonna play this many
hands<00:01:44.790> as<00:01:44.909> possible<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:45.630> profit<00:01:46.020> because

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
hands as possible for profit because

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.929 
hands as possible for profit because
there's<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.680> lot<00:01:46.890> more<00:01:47.159> hands<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:47.729> play

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
there's a lot more hands you can play

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.850 
there's a lot more hands you can play
for<00:01:48.000> profit<00:01:48.570> against<00:01:49.079> weaker<00:01:49.320> players<00:01:49.560> but

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
for profit against weaker players but

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.280 
for profit against weaker players but
again<00:01:50.070> pretty<00:01:50.670> much<00:01:50.759> rule<00:01:51.119> out<00:01:51.240> bluffing

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
stealing lines is not even a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.210 
stealing lines is not even a
