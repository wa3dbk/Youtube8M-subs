00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.929
 make a lot of money and he will help 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.109
 you sell your car 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.199
 for the full price you get shorter 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.720
 money for selling new will not lose your 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.109
 the car is generally based on this glich 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.349
 all unfortunately just can not do two 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.070
 times on the same cars 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.110
 it is clear if you have a garage there and you have there 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.530
 10 cars are expensive you can sell them 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.480
 only once once all these 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.469
 ten cars one at a time you can 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.899
 you can't sell it more than once 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.710
 in short, sell them and don't lose them all 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.140
 I'll start explaining what needs to be done so what 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.940
 drive up to santos custom on that 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.969
 the car you want to sell and 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.309
 do not lose drive up like this 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.020
 done on video here and so we stopped at 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.210
 this moment as we stopped push 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.460
 quick 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.280
 such a button in the middle and so round 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.850
 she will let you hide the game in short 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.070
 hidden game on stocks wings again 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.860
 press the same button and return to 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.580
 the game all this is necessary in order to 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.610
 call in los santos custom without animation 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.640
 tuning here and so supplies it all 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.040
 did just continue to call here in 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.320
 this is the garage and we put the car so 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.310
 as done on the video or rather to 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.220
 I left the door where we were sitting 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.310
 blocked here and so after all 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.189
 it did put the car out of the exit 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:48.380
 car out-out of the car 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.430
 and here not at all from the first time it will turn out 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.369
 maybe someone will succeed from the first 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.500
 times but not everyone will succeed in general 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.430
 here you need finger dexterity and quick 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.189
 pushing buttons 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.020
 buttons on sony playstation and these are 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.299
 buttons two buttons in short need to be clamped 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.590
 more precisely do not clamp dolt dolt 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.390
 very quickly press this button 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.060

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.830
 allow you to enter your car 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.340
 right will enable animation 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.890
 tuning in general, even on video from the dude 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.790
 two times fail 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:27.989
 it turned out 2 did not work but 3 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.440
 work out in general so here you come out 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:35.640
 car and click mean triangle 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:39.420
 and this right these two buttons we have a long 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.530
 right long hard now I'm more accurate 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.269

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.830

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.590

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.640
 long-long-long how to say 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.799
 continuously push them, and that's as 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.319
 until you get this 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.720

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.410

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.959
