00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.250
 hello dear students 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.619
 I'm a teacher, JosÃ© Elias. 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.270
 Let's start the math course. 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.119
 financial 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:32.320
 Let's give some concepts some 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.580
 important definitions for mathematics 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.739
 financial 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.600
 let's see the first definition let's 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.830
 over there 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.190
 the first definition is definition of interest 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.420
 swear 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:53.339
 let's represent interest by the letter j 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:58.089
 that means I swear what the interest would be 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:01:01.449
 interest is the remuneration for the 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:05.549
 loan of a financial asset 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:09.310
 this is when you rent a house 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.830
 month at the end of the month you can 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.390
 develop the house and pay the rent 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:19.570
 are you going to travel, do you rent a car? 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.149
 I use a car for a month at the end of the month 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.689
 You give the car back and pay the rent. 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:28.329
 Money is the same, I need 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.659
 Money, I'll go there on the bank. 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.770
 itaÃº fel and said 'if I need 500 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.710
 one thousand reais 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.460
 the girl gets a bag of 500 thousand reais and 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.939
 me of 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.520
 I take home 500 000 us real 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:46.210
 at the end of the month I put 500 thousand reais 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.969
 in a back bag and I owe the girl there I 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.640
 I speak thank you, girl, she says thank you. 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.850
 Nothing can rent the bag of 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.929
 money from the rent of this resource 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.689
 financial 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:02.679
 I say that the rent I swear that 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:05.649
 we rent a house rent a car but 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.939
 we also rent the money and value of the 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.729
 let lease 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.790
 we call interest then I swear it 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.080
 simply the rental value of a 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.069
 financial resource 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:22.120
 so we can say we can 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:25.299
 set the interest as the romi 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.180
 remuneration of the loan of an asset 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.830
 financial this 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.430
 We can approach the game as the 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.630
 rent paid or received for the use of a 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:42.220
 financial resource 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.430
 let's go to another capital means 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.340
 capital for financial mathematics 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.550
 here for us capital will be the resource 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.940
 that this relationship began. 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.500
 the feature that started this transaction 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.470
 The time I needed the money was 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.160
 girl there in Brazil or mp 500 thousand 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.530
 real 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.500
 the girl filled the sack with 500 grand 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.530
 and gave me at the end of the month I 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.870
 I returned that bag turning that bag with 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.080
 five hundred thousand reais that was returned was 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.020
 the capital it is constant it goes and 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.520
 back is the financial resource that is 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.520
 being transacted 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.900
 so we call it capital or 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.970
 to the financial resource 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:35.260
 transacted then capital the principal 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:39.190
 is the financial resource transacted 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:42.090
 for us is that bag of money 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:49.080
 interest rate 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:49.080
 Let's represent by the letter e and
