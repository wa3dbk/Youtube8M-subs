on<00:00:11.630> my<00:00:12.630> protein<00:00:13.290> skimmer<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:13.950> got<00:00:14.280> off

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
on my protein skimmer that I got off

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.439 
on my protein skimmer that I got off
ebay<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:16.130> aqua<00:00:17.130> serum<00:00:17.460> aura<00:00:17.699> there's<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
ebay it's a aqua serum aura there's the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.830 
ebay it's a aqua serum aura there's the
maxi<00:00:18.960> jet<00:00:19.140> 1,200<00:00:19.710> per<00:00:19.890> head<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.910> there's<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
maxi jet 1,200 per head and there's the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.779 
maxi jet 1,200 per head and there's the
Remora<00:00:24.019> it<00:00:25.019> was<00:00:25.170> cheap<00:00:25.529> there's<00:00:26.279> only<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.490> hard

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
Remora it was cheap there's only a hard

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.609 
Remora it was cheap there's only a hard
box<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:27.990> i<00:00:28.019> would<00:00:28.230> definitely<00:00:28.470> recommend

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
box so i would definitely recommend

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.140 
box so i would definitely recommend
getting<00:00:29.070> one<00:00:29.220> use<00:00:29.580> if<00:00:29.849> you're<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> budget

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
getting one use if you're on a budget

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.310 
getting one use if you're on a budget
like<00:00:30.510> i<00:00:30.810> am<00:00:31.009> the<00:00:32.009> only<00:00:32.160> problem<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.899> didn't

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
like i am the only problem is it didn't

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.560 
like i am the only problem is it didn't
come<00:00:34.469> with<00:00:34.500> o-ring<00:00:35.130> which<00:00:35.430> positions<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
come with o-ring which positions the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.959 
come with o-ring which positions the
collection<00:00:37.020> cup<00:00:37.370> but<00:00:38.370> that's<00:00:38.489> how<00:00:38.610> big<00:00:38.820> do<00:00:38.940> i

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
collection cup but that's how big do i

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.490 
collection cup but that's how big do i
just<00:00:39.180> put<00:00:39.390> some<00:00:39.510> rubber<00:00:39.660> bands<00:00:39.899> around<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.379> and

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
just put some rubber bands around it and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.250 
just put some rubber bands around it and
that's<00:00:40.649> doing<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:40.980> trick<00:00:44.000> but<00:00:45.000> already<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.750> 24

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
that's doing the trick but already in 24

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.910 
that's doing the trick but already in 24
hours<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:47.219> gotten<00:00:47.579> all<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.730> cookout

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
hours it's gotten all that cookout

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.529 
hours it's gotten all that cookout
pretty<00:00:49.920> nasty<00:00:50.460> i'm<00:00:50.610> really<00:00:51.000> excited<00:00:51.149> about

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
pretty nasty i'm really excited about

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.430 
pretty nasty i'm really excited about
cleaning<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.110> out<00:00:52.699> just<00:00:53.699> kidding<00:00:55.219> um<00:00:56.239> and

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
cleaning that out just kidding um and

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.139 
cleaning that out just kidding um and
since<00:00:58.440> its<00:00:58.590> new<00:00:58.800> i<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.609> micro<00:00:59.940> bubbles

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
since its new i have the micro bubbles

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.619 
since its new i have the micro bubbles
that<00:01:00.539> i've<00:01:00.690> read<00:01:00.899> about<00:01:00.930> getting<00:01:01.590> when<00:01:02.629> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
that i've read about getting when the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.380 
that i've read about getting when the
power<00:01:03.809> head<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.379> break-in<00:01:04.739> period<00:01:05.390> but

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
power head is in the break-in period but

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.420 
power head is in the break-in period but
on<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.900> my<00:01:06.990> question<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.700> now<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.570> have<00:01:10.430> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
on to my question so now that I have the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.660 
on to my question so now that I have the
protein<00:01:11.850> skimmer<00:01:12.500> do<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.560> still<00:01:14.040> need<00:01:14.070> this

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
protein skimmer do I still need this

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.929 
protein skimmer do I still need this
piece<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.780> crap<00:01:16.040> hang<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> back<00:01:17.460> filter

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
piece of crap hang on the back filter

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.170 
piece of crap hang on the back filter
that<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.479> hate<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.170> much<00:01:19.229> because<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.549> loud

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
that I hate so much because it is loud

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.380 
that I hate so much because it is loud
and<00:01:21.540> just<00:01:21.930> really<00:01:22.470> annoying<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.950> cheap<00:01:23.880> um

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.179 

can<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.479> give<00:01:27.659> by<00:01:27.869> which<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.470> having<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.829> protein

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
can I give by which is having a protein

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.160 
can I give by which is having a protein
skimmer<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:30.619> no<00:01:31.619> other<00:01:32.090> filtration<00:01:33.380> um<00:01:34.400> I

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
skimmer and no other filtration um I

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.649 
skimmer and no other filtration um I
know<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.439> live<00:01:37.590> rock<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.340> biological<00:01:39.799> and

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
know the live rock is the biological and

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.780 
know the live rock is the biological and
I<00:01:42.659> guess<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.710> filter<00:01:44.159> really<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.670> only

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
I guess this filter really it's only

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.670 
I guess this filter really it's only
purpose<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.840> mechanical<00:01:46.110> filtration

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
purpose is the mechanical filtration

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.200 
purpose is the mechanical filtration
with<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.880> carbon<00:01:48.210> pad<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.899> do<00:01:49.290> i<00:01:49.350> need<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:50.210> or

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
with the carbon pad so do i need that or

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.270 
with the carbon pad so do i need that or
do<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.570> not<00:01:51.780> now<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> protein

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
do I not now that I have the protein

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.350 
do I not now that I have the protein
skimmer<00:01:54.049> that<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.290> my<00:01:55.500> question<00:01:55.640> so<00:01:56.640> if<00:01:57.060> you

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
skimmer that is my question so if you

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.010 
skimmer that is my question so if you
could<00:01:57.509> help<00:01:57.659> me<00:01:57.780> out<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.939> tell<00:01:59.939> me<00:02:00.090> what<00:02:00.450> you

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
could help me out and tell me what you

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.370 
could help me out and tell me what you
know<00:02:01.290> from<00:02:01.320> experience<00:02:01.710> or<00:02:02.520> whatever<00:02:03.380> you

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
know from experience or whatever you

know from experience or whatever you
know<00:02:04.409> if<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:04.860> get<00:02:04.950> rid<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.310> stupid

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549
