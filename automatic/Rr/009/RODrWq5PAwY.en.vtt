00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
vectors have your own server where you

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.960 
vectors have your own server where you
can<00:02:11.130> do<00:02:11.250> things<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:13.700> people<00:02:14.700> act<00:02:14.880> like

built to this their games most of the
games<00:02:21.600> they<00:02:21.720> create<00:02:22.020> don't<00:02:22.500> need<00:02:22.680> patches<00:02:24.380> all

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380
