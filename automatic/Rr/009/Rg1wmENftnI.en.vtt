and<00:02:23.000> things<00:02:23.480> already<00:02:23.930> wider<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.500> thicker

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
and things already wider and thicker

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.600 
and things already wider and thicker
fatter<00:02:26.710> on<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.890> old<00:02:28.040> one<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:28.340> this<00:02:28.460> thing<00:02:28.580> is

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
fatter on the old one so this thing is

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.360 
fatter on the old one so this thing is
really<00:02:28.820> light<00:02:29.120> really<00:02:29.330> nice<00:02:30.130> not<00:02:31.130> like<00:02:31.250> that

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
really light really nice not like that

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.580 
really light really nice not like that
feels<00:02:31.730> really<00:02:31.880> good<00:02:32.170> feels<00:02:33.170> really<00:02:33.350> easy

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
feels really good feels really easy

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.660 
feels really good feels really easy
using<00:02:33.860> them<00:02:34.070> hand<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.840> hand<00:02:36.130> you<00:02:37.130> know<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.550> use

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
using them hand to hand you know to use

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.830 
using them hand to hand you know to use
it<00:02:37.760> like<00:02:37.850> this<00:02:37.970> with<00:02:38.030> your<00:02:38.270> thumbs<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:38.660> now<00:02:38.810> a

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
it like this with your thumbs is now a

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.900 
it like this with your thumbs is now a
lot<00:02:39.110> easier<00:02:39.320> compared<00:02:39.800> to<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:39.980> old<00:02:40.130> one<00:02:40.570> so

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
lot easier compared to the old one so

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.060 
lot easier compared to the old one so
there<00:02:43.910> is<00:02:43.940> right<00:02:44.480> there<00:02:44.690> once<00:02:45.140> once<00:02:45.830> I<00:02:45.920> get

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
there is right there once once I get

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.210 
there is right there once once I get
this<00:02:46.220> thing<00:02:46.490> up<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.180> running<00:02:47.860> I'll<00:02:48.860> go<00:02:49.070> into

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
this thing up and running I'll go into

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.180 
this thing up and running I'll go into
some<00:02:49.460> of<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.730> some<00:02:50.210> of<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.360> features<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.950> let

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
some of the some of the features so let

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.260 
some of the some of the features so let
me<00:02:52.280> get<00:02:52.400> this<00:02:52.430> thing<00:02:52.550> up<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:52.820> running<00:02:52.910> and

me get this thing up and running and
stay<00:02:54.200> tuned<00:02:54.380> okay<00:02:55.130> guys<00:02:55.310> now<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.640> we<00:02:55.700> have

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
stay tuned okay guys now that we have

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.790 
stay tuned okay guys now that we have
the<00:02:56.150> ipad<00:02:56.480> air<00:02:56.690> set<00:02:56.960> up<00:02:57.080> I<00:02:57.260> thought<00:02:57.530> I'd<00:02:57.650> just

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
the ipad air set up I thought I'd just

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.550 
the ipad air set up I thought I'd just
give<00:02:58.640> you<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.760> better<00:02:58.910> look<00:02:59.720> at<00:02:59.900> it<00:03:00.050> because<00:03:00.170> how

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
give you a better look at it because how

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.540 
give you a better look at it because how
do<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.680> want<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:00.890> go<00:03:00.950> through<00:03:01.160> all<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.340> setup

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
do you want to go through all the setup

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.120 
do you want to go through all the setup
process<00:03:01.700> on<00:03:02.000> camera<00:03:02.330> so<00:03:02.870> here<00:03:03.350> it<00:03:03.440> is<00:03:03.470> so<00:03:04.010> this

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
process on camera so here it is so this

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.650 
process on camera so here it is so this
thing<00:03:04.310> is<00:03:04.340> a<00:03:04.460> 20-percent<00:03:05.270> thinner

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
thing is a 20-percent thinner

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.480 
thing is a 20-percent thinner
twenty-eight<00:03:06.260> percent<00:03:06.380> lighter<00:03:06.800> in<00:03:07.070> forty

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
twenty-eight percent lighter in forty

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.340 
twenty-eight percent lighter in forty
three<00:03:07.520> percent<00:03:07.730> smaller<00:03:08.180> bezel<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:08.870> that's

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
three percent smaller bezel and that's

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.450 
three percent smaller bezel and that's
where<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.500> can<00:03:09.620> see<00:03:09.800> that<00:03:09.830> that<00:03:10.070> smaller

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
where you can see that that smaller

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.190 
where you can see that that smaller
bezel<00:03:10.880> sizer<00:03:11.060> check<00:03:11.540> that<00:03:11.690> out<00:03:11.720> fits<00:03:12.080> right

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
bezel sizer check that out fits right

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.830 
bezel sizer check that out fits right
inside<00:03:12.380> there<00:03:12.680> nice<00:03:13.510> so<00:03:14.510> let's<00:03:14.630> get<00:03:14.690> through

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
inside there nice so let's get through

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.360 
inside there nice so let's get through
the<00:03:14.930> rest<00:03:15.080> of<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.590> rest<00:03:15.860> of<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.010> stats<00:03:16.250> on

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
the rest of the the rest of the stats on

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.280 
the rest of the the rest of the stats on
here<00:03:16.610> so<00:03:16.730> you<00:03:16.820> have<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:17.300> same<00:03:17.480> 5<00:03:17.720> megapixel

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
here so you have the same 5 megapixel

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.920 
here so you have the same 5 megapixel
iSight<00:03:18.410> camera<00:03:19.010> at<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.000> same<00:03:20.270> 1.2

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
iSight camera at the same 1.2

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.320 
iSight camera at the same 1.2
front-facing<00:03:21.710> camera<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.580> big<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:23.300> big

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
front-facing camera the big the big

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.750 
front-facing camera the big the big
thing<00:03:23.660> besides<00:03:24.020> the<00:03:24.260> actual<00:03:24.410> hardware<00:03:25.340> like

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
thing besides the actual hardware like

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.730 
thing besides the actual hardware like
the<00:03:25.910> actual<00:03:26.150> outside<00:03:26.420> hardware<00:03:26.810> is<00:03:26.960> the<00:03:27.590> new

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
the actual outside hardware is the new

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.920 
the actual outside hardware is the new
a7<00:03:28.610> chip<00:03:28.790> under<00:03:28.910> hood<00:03:29.210> so<00:03:29.330> you<00:03:29.390> get<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.600> same

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
a7 chip under hood so you get the same

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.000 
a7 chip under hood so you get the same
a7<00:03:30.740> chip<00:03:31.460> that's<00:03:32.390> found<00:03:33.380> in<00:03:33.530> this<00:03:33.680> little<00:03:33.860> guy

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
a7 chip that's found in this little guy

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.440 
a7 chip that's found in this little guy
so<00:03:34.300> these<00:03:35.300> two<00:03:35.510> now<00:03:35.960> pretty<00:03:36.500> much<00:03:37.270> go<00:03:38.270> well

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
so these two now pretty much go well

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.530 
so these two now pretty much go well
together<00:03:38.660> so<00:03:39.440> you<00:03:39.500> have<00:03:39.740> the<00:03:40.100> a7<00:03:40.640> chip<00:03:40.850> that's

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
together so you have the a7 chip that's

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.580 
together so you have the a7 chip that's
found<00:03:41.780> in<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.110> in<00:03:42.740> the<00:03:42.880> iphone<00:03:43.880> 5s<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.750> m7
