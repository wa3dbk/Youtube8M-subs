the<00:03:12.870> head<00:03:12.959> actually<00:03:13.080> cuz<00:03:13.320> I've<00:03:13.380> had<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.620> hard

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
the head actually cuz I've had a hard

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.440 
the head actually cuz I've had a hard
tunnel<00:03:14.100> for<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.459> while<00:03:14.700> now<00:03:14.880> figuring<00:03:15.209> out<00:03:15.299> what

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
tunnel for a while now figuring out what

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.240 
tunnel for a while now figuring out what
this<00:03:15.570> actually<00:03:15.930> tastes<00:03:16.230> like<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.769> kind<00:03:17.070> of<00:03:17.130> is

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
this actually tastes like it kind of is

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.210 
this actually tastes like it kind of is
cream<00:03:17.549> soda<00:03:17.820> dial<00:03:18.150> up<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.420> citrus<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:20.010> I

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
cream soda dial up the citrus and I

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.530 
cream soda dial up the citrus and I
think<00:03:20.430> it's<00:03:20.519> almost<00:03:20.700> hard<00:03:21.000> for<00:03:21.060> your<00:03:21.299> brain<00:03:21.510> to

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
think it's almost hard for your brain to

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.180 
think it's almost hard for your brain to
realize<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.230> cream<00:03:22.440> soda<00:03:22.680> part<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.100> it

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
realize the cream soda part of it

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.259 
realize the cream soda part of it
because<00:03:23.400> you're<00:03:23.519> used<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.790> looking<00:03:24.000> cream

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
because you're used to looking cream

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.000 
because you're used to looking cream
soda<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.810> it's<00:03:25.019> cream<00:03:25.260> colored<00:03:25.680> right

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
soda and it's cream colored right

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.009 
soda and it's cream colored right
whereas<00:03:26.370> this<00:03:26.519> is<00:03:26.580> orange<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.239> orange<00:03:27.570> you

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
whereas this is orange the orange you

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.509 
whereas this is orange the orange you
see<00:03:28.049> on<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.470> label<00:03:28.620> someone's<00:03:28.950> writing<00:03:29.310> about

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
see on the label someone's writing about

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.090 
see on the label someone's writing about
being<00:03:29.700> citrus<00:03:30.000> flavored<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:31.290> expect<00:03:31.680> citrus

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
being citrus flavored you expect citrus

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.009

it's<00:03:50.130> not<00:03:50.340> as<00:03:50.489> efficient<00:03:50.880> so<00:03:51.090> hard<00:03:51.330> enough<00:03:51.450> so

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
it's not as efficient so hard enough so

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.970
