00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
that went missing and I've been to one

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.639 
that went missing and I've been to one
of<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.189> places<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:33.270> I'd<00:00:33.450> rather<00:00:33.690> do<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.230> I

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
of the places but I'd rather do this I

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.860 
of the places but I'd rather do this I
was<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.550> process<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.149> doing<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.600> and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
was in the process of doing this and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.720 
was in the process of doing this and
that's<00:00:37.020> why<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.320> came<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.860> Hidden<00:00:38.340> Valley<00:00:38.489> to

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
that's why I came to Hidden Valley to

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.790 
that's why I came to Hidden Valley to
begin<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.210> which<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.870> make<00:00:40.050> contact<00:00:40.649> with

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
begin with which is to make contact with

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.910 
begin with which is to make contact with
all<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.700> different<00:00:41.879> factions<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:43.200> we<00:00:43.649> showed

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
all the different factions so we showed

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.729 
all the different factions so we showed
the<00:00:44.040> location<00:00:44.670> god<00:00:45.329> what<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> mess<00:00:45.809> okay

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
the location god what a mess okay

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.610 
the location god what a mess okay
so<00:00:47.129> we<00:00:47.910> still<00:00:48.239> got<00:00:48.390> three<00:00:48.719> or<00:00:48.840> four<00:00:48.870> places<00:00:49.350> to

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
so we still got three or four places to

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.900 
so we still got three or four places to
go<00:00:49.770> one<00:00:50.219> two<00:00:50.370> three<00:00:50.399> four<00:00:51.090> five<00:00:51.449> action

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
go one two three four five action

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.670 
go one two three four five action
so<00:00:54.910> something<00:00:55.910> I'm<00:00:56.240> gonna<00:00:56.510> start<00:00:56.840> here<00:00:57.050> first

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
so something I'm gonna start here first

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.590 
so something I'm gonna start here first
it<00:00:57.920> looks<00:00:58.190> like<00:00:58.310> it's<00:00:58.520> in<00:00:58.730> Nellis<00:00:59.360> Air<00:00:59.570> Force

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
it looks like it's in Nellis Air Force

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.590 
it looks like it's in Nellis Air Force
Base<00:01:00.730> let's<00:01:01.730> fast<00:01:02.270> travel<00:01:02.780> to<00:01:02.900> free<00:01:03.140> side<00:01:03.440> and

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
Base let's fast travel to free side and

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.110 
Base let's fast travel to free side and
I<00:01:05.600> think<00:01:06.170> there's<00:01:06.560> we've<00:01:07.250> done<00:01:07.430> all<00:01:07.640> we<00:01:07.670> can<00:01:07.970> do

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
I think there's we've done all we can do

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.319 
I think there's we've done all we can do
here<00:01:08.330> for<00:01:08.600> right<00:01:08.750> now

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.649 

and<00:01:11.509> then<00:01:12.579> traveling<00:01:13.579> to<00:01:13.670> freeside<00:01:14.179> gets<00:01:14.479> us

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
and then traveling to freeside gets us

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.039 
and then traveling to freeside gets us
pretty<00:01:14.869> close<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.469> the<00:01:15.590> Air<00:01:15.710> Force<00:01:15.979> Base

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
pretty close to the Air Force Base

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.740 
pretty close to the Air Force Base
normally<00:01:18.049> averages<00:01:18.439> fast<00:01:18.740> travel<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:19.750> plop

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
normally averages fast travel and plop

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.450 
normally averages fast travel and plop
right<00:01:21.110> in<00:01:21.289> there<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:21.799> you<00:01:21.860> wouldn't<00:01:22.159> have<00:01:22.340> to

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
right in there so you wouldn't have to

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.580 
right in there so you wouldn't have to
watch<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.939> traveling<00:01:23.390> but<00:01:23.659> I<00:01:23.899> haven't<00:01:24.409> been

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
watch the traveling but I haven't been

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.950 
watch the traveling but I haven't been
up<00:01:24.950> that<00:01:25.189> far<00:01:25.399> yet<00:01:25.640> so<00:01:26.000> I'm<00:01:26.240> just<00:01:26.479> going<00:01:26.689> to<00:01:26.780> go

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
up that far yet so I'm just going to go

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.050 
up that far yet so I'm just going to go
and<00:01:27.289> walk<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:28.899> record<00:01:29.899> the<00:01:30.110> walk<00:01:30.289> along<00:01:31.060> the

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
and walk and record the walk along the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.410 
and walk and record the walk along the
way<00:01:33.880> come<00:01:34.880> on

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.480 

there<00:01:38.080> we<00:01:38.200> go<00:01:38.350> okay<00:01:39.119> so

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.380 

we've<00:01:44.030> got<00:01:44.450> I<00:01:45.190> think<00:01:46.190> it's<00:01:46.340> up<00:01:46.490> this<00:01:46.730> way<00:01:46.790> yeah

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
we've got I think it's up this way yeah

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.800 
we've got I think it's up this way yeah
so<00:01:48.350> it's<00:01:48.560> that<00:01:48.800> like<00:01:49.340> this<00:01:49.640> direction<00:01:50.240> I<00:01:50.420> just

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
so it's that like this direction I just

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.100 
so it's that like this direction I just
have<00:01:50.930> to<00:01:51.050> go<00:01:51.200> around<00:01:51.560> this<00:01:51.860> big<00:01:52.190> building<00:01:52.700> and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
have to go around this big building and

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.140 
have to go around this big building and
what<00:01:54.110> is<00:01:54.260> this<00:01:54.500> oh<00:01:54.770> it's<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.520> crimson<00:01:55.970> caravan
