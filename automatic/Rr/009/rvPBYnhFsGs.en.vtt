00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
there you go ladies and gentlemen the

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.089 
there you go ladies and gentlemen the
finished<00:02:35.890> product<00:02:36.749> now<00:02:37.749> if<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:38.019> were<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.260> print

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
finished product now if I were to print

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.559 
finished product now if I were to print
this<00:02:39.280> again<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.700> would<00:02:39.909> do<00:02:40.120> two<00:02:40.359> things

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
this again I would do two things

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.039 
this again I would do two things
differently<00:02:41.730> first<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:43.060> would<00:02:43.269> print<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.569> about

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
differently first I would print it about

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.489 
differently first I would print it about
10%<00:02:44.889> larger<00:02:45.099> I<00:02:45.579> don't<00:02:46.060> have<00:02:46.269> big<00:02:46.719> hands<00:02:46.989> by<00:02:47.290> any

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:47.499 
10% larger I don't have big hands by any

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.920 
10% larger I don't have big hands by any
means<00:02:47.769> but<00:02:48.219> it's<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.639> little<00:02:49.060> small<00:02:49.480> for<00:02:49.810> my

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
means but it's a little small for my

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.819 
means but it's a little small for my
hand<00:02:50.200> still<00:02:51.540> second<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.959> underside<00:02:53.590> is

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
hand still second the underside is

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.069 
hand still second the underside is
really<00:02:54.489> gnarly<00:02:54.790> because<00:02:55.389> I<00:02:55.480> printed<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:55.930> with

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
really gnarly because I printed it with

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.319 
really gnarly because I printed it with
support<00:02:56.500> if<00:02:56.799> I<00:02:57.010> printed<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:57.579> again<00:02:57.879> I<00:02:57.909> would

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
support if I printed it again I would

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.349 
support if I printed it again I would
not<00:02:58.599> use<00:02:58.810> support<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.859> guy<00:03:00.040> who<00:03:00.099> created<00:03:01.000> it

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
not use support the guy who created it

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.369 
not use support the guy who created it
actually<00:03:02.139> has<00:03:02.499> to<00:03:03.189> STL<00:03:03.730> files<00:03:04.030> up<00:03:04.329> and<00:03:04.540> the

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
actually has to STL files up and the

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.319 
actually has to STL files up and the
second<00:03:05.739> one<00:03:05.829> is<00:03:05.950> actually<00:03:06.159> the<00:03:06.579> knife<00:03:06.819> split

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
second one is actually the knife split

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.690 
second one is actually the knife split
in<00:03:07.540> half<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.409> if<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.769> printing<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.459> again<00:03:09.669> I

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
in half so if I printing it again I

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.649 
in half so if I printing it again I
would<00:03:10.030> definitely<00:03:10.859> print<00:03:11.859> that<00:03:11.980> one<00:03:12.189> instead

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
would definitely print that one instead

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.550 
would definitely print that one instead
so<00:03:13.659> I<00:03:13.689> didn't<00:03:14.079> have<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.379> use<00:03:14.730> support<00:03:16.260> so<00:03:17.260> there

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
so I didn't have to use support so there

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.259 
so I didn't have to use support so there
you<00:03:17.680> go<00:03:17.859> if<00:03:18.400> there's<00:03:18.639> anything<00:03:18.879> you<00:03:19.120> guys

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
you go if there's anything you guys

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.140 
you go if there's anything you guys
would<00:03:19.510> like<00:03:19.689> to<00:03:19.719> see<00:03:20.019> me<00:03:20.769> print<00:03:21.340> just<00:03:21.849> leave<00:03:22.120> a

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
would like to see me print just leave a

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.270 
would like to see me print just leave a
comment<00:03:22.599> down<00:03:22.659> below<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.469> I'll<00:03:23.859> see<00:03:24.099> what<00:03:24.250> I

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
comment down below and I'll see what I

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.020 
comment down below and I'll see what I
can<00:03:24.340> do<00:03:25.230> once<00:03:26.230> upon<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.709> time<00:03:27.010> there<00:03:27.519> was<00:03:27.699> a<00:03:27.730> man

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
can do once upon a time there was a man

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.179 
can do once upon a time there was a man
who<00:03:28.299> did<00:03:28.480> not<00:03:28.629> subscribe<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.260> Doctor<00:03:29.859> Buddha's

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:30.189 
who did not subscribe to Doctor Buddha's

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:34.350 
who did not subscribe to Doctor Buddha's
channel<00:03:30.579> and<00:03:31.299> then<00:03:31.480> he<00:03:31.599> died

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.500 

you
