00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:15.220 
so mix it really well and I am adding
this<00:02:09.320> salt<00:02:09.679> I<00:02:12.550> want<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.760> mix<00:02:13.940> both<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.630> energy

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
this salt I want to mix both the energy

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.790 
this salt I want to mix both the energy
floor<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:15.800> wouldn't
