00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.269
 of the centro slow down and relatively thin 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.740
 and vo light jam mitigates 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.960

 morphology of each the pads

 particularly flexible participates in the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.799
 general comfort when listening to the beautiful 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.409
 center will have to say very a slight bet 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.579
 ahead of the grave register 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.399
 it's more like an aesthetic 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.929
 sound that a defect he also shows himself to 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.240
 comfortable listening to music soothed 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.350
 as a jazz quartet than on 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.110
 more dynamic pieces 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.240
 like the last daft punk there is 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.830
 more detailed more refined but what 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.960
 headset has the advantage of being adapted to 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.060
 many musical tics to finish 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.530
 sound insulation and medium on 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.149
 hear ambient noise without this 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.369
 bothers the musical listener 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.049
 the buzz is a headphone that does more than 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.860
 defend yourself in terms of audio rendering 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.090
 its main asset is its versatility 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.740
 we would have liked a 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.180
 presentation more rewarding account 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.180
 given its tariff position
