00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:18.779

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.460
 Mr. Director has a guy while 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.230

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.119
 little one with broken arm in mine 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.320
 sorceress has fallen doing the dance of the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.650
 rain really against the result is 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.320
 that a small tornado is coming 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.140

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.300
 back dinho you exact a small back 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.620
 he would be so kind to host us here 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.780
 during his passage 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.680
 but you will stay out and look for one 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.680
 solution understood 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.820
 taranto 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.390
 we could take refuge in the cellar 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.000
 but invoicing to prevent prisoners 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:46.479
 strange ideas came of those who serve one 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:53.250
 gallery or wrong a formula must 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:55.430
 be this other gago but also this one 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.430

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.730
 kitchen reading here and below 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.950

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.890
 will call in the office because doria placÃ¬ 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.810
 club has yielded that we risk of 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:03:00.709
 we also fall asleep down 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:05.780
 someone then yes I feel 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.520
 perfectly the color but if we 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.660
 nervous there is chamomile a liter of 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.660
 what coffee will do to him 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:38.230
 needless to wait saying my strength 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:41.020
 voice already booking we have to stop them 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.680

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.680

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.190
 all 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.530
 this escape and a nice walk 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.450
 it is not dangerous to escape while there is a 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.320
 tornadoes and where I see no 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.320
