unmounted and this is for the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.730 
application of the sealant you'll also
notice<00:01:35.790> after<00:01:36.090> mounting<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> tire<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.439> went

notice after mounting the tire I went

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.260 
notice after mounting the tire I went
around<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:38.040> second<00:01:38.400> time<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.759> ensure<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
around a second time to ensure that the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.960 
around a second time to ensure that the
tire<00:01:39.509> has<00:01:40.020> seated<00:01:40.439> properly<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.520> channel

of<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.240> rim<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.079> slightly

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
of the rim this is slightly

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.440 
of the rim this is slightly
counterintuitive<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.729> will<00:01:44.790> be<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> very

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
counterintuitive but it will be a very

rotate<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:04.320> allow<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.560> fluid<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.009> collect

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
rotate it to allow the fluid to collect

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.340 
rotate it to allow the fluid to collect
at<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.670> bottom<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.180> tire<00:02:06.329> here<00:02:06.630> before

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
at the bottom of the tire here before

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.990 
at the bottom of the tire here before
you<00:02:07.439> pull<00:02:07.619> over<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> last<00:02:08.280> bit<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.819> bead

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
you pull over the last bit of the bead

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.880 
you pull over the last bit of the bead
I've<00:02:09.599> pulled<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.989> seal<00:02:10.229> off<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.590> container

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
I've pulled the seal off the container

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.280 
I've pulled the seal off the container
and<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.280> now<00:02:11.489> ready<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.030> be<00:02:12.209> used

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
and it's now ready to be used

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.110 
and it's now ready to be used
final<00:02:13.469> step<00:02:13.620> before<00:02:13.829> actually<00:02:14.459> pouring<00:02:14.939> it

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
final step before actually pouring it

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.850 
final step before actually pouring it
into<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.420> tire<00:02:15.599> is<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:16.140> make<00:02:16.290> sure<00:02:16.409> you<00:02:16.560> shake

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
into the tire is to make sure you shake

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.289 
into the tire is to make sure you shake
it<00:02:16.890> up<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.219> fair<00:02:17.459> bit<00:02:17.489> there's<00:02:18.030> actually

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
it up a fair bit there's actually

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.089 
it up a fair bit there's actually
particles<00:02:18.840> in<00:02:18.930> here<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.709> want<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:19.980> make

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
particles in here that you want to make

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.800 
particles in here that you want to make
sure<00:02:20.129> are<00:02:20.519> properly<00:02:21.030> suspended<00:02:21.599> in<00:02:21.689> the<00:02:21.780> fluid

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
sure are properly suspended in the fluid

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.190 
sure are properly suspended in the fluid
before<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.890> put<00:02:23.099> it<00:02:23.159> in<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.370> tire<00:02:24.200> that's

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
before you put it in the tire that's

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:35.300 
before you put it in the tire that's
about<00:02:25.530> half<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:33.510> tire<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:34.019> almost<00:02:34.739> ready<00:02:35.010> I

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
about half the tire is almost ready I

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.399 
about half the tire is almost ready I
did<00:02:35.970> have<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.180> use<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.390> tire<00:02:36.569> lever<00:02:36.810> that's

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
did have to use the tire lever that's

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:38.240 
did have to use the tire lever that's
only<00:02:37.590> because<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:37.799> didn't<00:02:37.950> want<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.129> take

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
only because I didn't want to take

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.270 
only because I didn't want to take
forever<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.760> do<00:02:38.849> it<00:02:38.939> by<00:02:39.060> hand<00:02:40.010> one<00:02:41.010> thing<00:02:41.189> to

around the bead to get it ready to be
inflated<00:03:01.709> this<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.459> crucial<00:03:02.970> step<00:03:03.060> which

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
inflated this is a crucial step which

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.000 
inflated this is a crucial step which
will<00:03:03.750> make<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:03.989> whole<00:03:04.169> thing<00:03:04.439> a<00:03:04.470> little<00:03:04.620> bit
