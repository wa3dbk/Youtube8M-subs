00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:03.600
 Nibelungen driven - 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.660
 the last choice 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.070
 the manufactured first one has to apply with 50 since Japan beat one with the point 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.799
 on 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:13.949
 the medical profession 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.949
 but I also wait for the Darup again 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.949
 it works like mountains 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.619
 struck like animal 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.619
 so what will be good for take approx 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.060
 not everyone does not care where Father Lawrence 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.460
 the two stood 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.800
 the own 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.920
 support half 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.920
 These people continue to work Dietz 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.560
 maybe ORF this is 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.980
 the Air style Arjen 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.340
 before the election 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.290
 how do not he sound like 1 Dr 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.450
 the tail comparison owns care the same in the 1 in denied the 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.290
 again at some maybe 12 o'clock 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.070
 That's how it should be 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.160
 but he starts this time with the weight loss on 2 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.120
 Round goes 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.850
 how can to 15 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.010
 So we start on double is nothing in the way 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.290
 Double error simply too young 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.290
 like sharing 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.340
 the one side 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.670
 like the fairest, we work again as Klum does 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.670
 the ECB is waiting there again 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.680
 and thus was not Oracle 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.120
 Polycom closes and now no 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.350
 knit 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.020
 well the quieter marched always 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.130
 Game honest he stoically lent OK 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.120
 and now it's allowed to enter 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.229
 but the next topics flow again judges 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.009
 the fuel-efficient 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:19.730
 so everything has weak round from Vorarlberg 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.469
 does not matter 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.469
 still sad 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:30.429
 this is also the staged 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.429
 Mayer also happens 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.809
 workaholic by baby flaps but i war you 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:44.259
 I think 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:45.979
 Rupprecht 7 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:49.119
 and also conducts third rek 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.119
 Picture back 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:57.369
 This time he was two 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:12.199
 Both top people always savor Mascher in the lecture series 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.889
 and so 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.149
 Nino Mardan breaks the loop and creates a mistake 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.829
 10 clock at 2 like to get Wiegand 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.159
 and there we have kick 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.609
 have given 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.009
 Gerd 50 Vacano May think now 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.349
 the return journey in a clockwise direction 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.349
 too slowly I have to clarify it with effort 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.659
 7 

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.529
 Riahi then deny again 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:08.779
 the two sleeping heat Dutta have feverish 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.309
 against this two will be noticed Babbel on the answer 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.509
 and it was the first requests 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:28.219
 ruled Brydon 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.259
 15 d 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:46.710
 70 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.469
 the doctors will have to come back 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.639
 Mesh less on both sides of the VfB 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.690
 we offer and 3 zel f and threesome 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.449
 is 14 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.240
 Sad 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.539
 like those 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.159
 for the purpose of 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.159
 it looks 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.240
 New Orleans 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.759
 you take 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:13.249
 image 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:14.719
 12 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.289
 13 14 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.169
 EKI forward 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:21.490
 both 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.249
 can be smart 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:26.249
 sleep on the other at approx 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:35.629
 spoof 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:41.499
 at 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.370
 I return to the series 60 4 SID 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.599
 where we go again EStG knee again a three 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:06.439
 how to endure 

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:12.240
 Other Christof and trick thieves have to be able to suffer from it exactly 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.639
 the cards are looking because not much has changed so far 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.909
 I see this 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:21.909
 the topics processes cuckoo clocks 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:23.569
 without you 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:25.139
 3 cloudy 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.150
 Salo 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.150
 knit off 

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:40.720
 that somebody equals me on the other side Ghana Ruch 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:44.939
 simply if the stitches are strictly stated only 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.960
 Pull off the rides so what is stuck 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:53.479
 and easy 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:56.889
 then the question about Lena 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:57.839
 You too 

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:59.879
 can earn 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:03.189
 and the Haiti Children's Home to the 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:06.610
 understands to wear 1 2 3 against Aarau 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.610
 Check against the work 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:12.189
 now the 

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:15.089
 4 to 13 wear 

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:17.879
 perhaps 

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:18.869
 Felix 

00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:20.860
 7 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.499
 Ahmad 

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:23.749
 the new 

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:26.610
 see 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:27.779
 12 

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:29.669
 13 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:33.270
 Ears more can dance further a decoupling 5 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.550
 the Stader 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.330
 Cut off colors 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.309
 then wait again doubled 

00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:42.270
 because two starts 

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.559
 Thirdly, thanks to their novelty, they go bilateral 

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:48.559
 to 15 offer back 

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:52.460
 start at Trier 

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.469
 here seven back again 

00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:56.339
 behind it stand the area 

00:07:56.339 --> 00:08:00.019
 and so on Wiesbaum made five to twelve Willsch 

00:08:01.619 --> 00:08:03.710
 we'll meet Again 

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:04.809
 then I will 

00:08:04.809 --> 00:08:08.460
 singles together Abdi plays them together area 

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.639
 I wish you much fun 

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:12.949
 and then MIS
