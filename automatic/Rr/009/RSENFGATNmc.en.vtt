all<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.009> guys<00:01:38.100> take<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> look<00:01:38.430> at<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
all so if you guys take a look at the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.039 
all so if you guys take a look at the
painting<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.150> guys<00:01:39.509> will<00:01:39.659> see<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.900> it's

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
painting you guys will see that it's

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.109 
painting you guys will see that it's
tipped<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.439> its<00:01:40.590> left<00:01:40.829> side<00:01:41.009> now<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.939> means

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
tipped to its left side now that means

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.520 
tipped to its left side now that means
that<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> painting<00:01:43.320> or<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> picture

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
that this is a painting or a picture

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.039 
that this is a painting or a picture
that<00:01:44.009> must<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.369> been<00:01:44.570> either<00:01:45.570> telling<00:01:45.899> us

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
that must have been either telling us

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.480 
that must have been either telling us
something<00:01:46.259> now<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:47.009> thing<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.430> took

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
something now the one thing that I took

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.399 
something now the one thing that I took
from<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.970> was<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.780> telling<00:01:49.049> us<00:01:49.140> where<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
from it was is it telling us where the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.410 
from it was is it telling us where the
weakest<00:01:49.770> part<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> iceberg<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.909> or<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.299> it

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
weakest part on the iceberg is or is it

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.780 
weakest part on the iceberg is or is it
telling<00:01:51.659> us<00:01:51.750> how<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.079> tip<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> iceberg<00:01:52.890> that's

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
telling us how to tip the iceberg that's

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.340 
telling us how to tip the iceberg that's
something<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.240> think<00:01:54.299> about<00:01:54.509> because<00:01:54.810> if<00:01:55.200> you

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
something to think about because if you

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.350 
something to think about because if you
guys<00:01:55.500> all<00:01:55.740> stand<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> left<00:01:56.579> side<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.060> that

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
guys all stand on the left side is that

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.999 
guys all stand on the left side is that
a<00:01:57.390> spot<00:01:57.750> where<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.110> actually<00:01:58.259> going<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.770> tip

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
a spot where it's actually going the tip

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.859 
a spot where it's actually going the tip
or<00:01:59.219> did<00:01:59.759> Club<00:01:59.969> Penguin<00:02:00.240> just<00:02:00.420> put<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.719> in

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
or did Club Penguin just put that in

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.870 
or did Club Penguin just put that in
there<00:02:01.079> because<00:02:01.110> they<00:02:01.680> did<00:02:01.920> that's<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.640> big

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
there because they did that's the big

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.399 
there because they did that's the big
mystery<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.450> what<00:02:03.780> they're<00:02:03.960> trying<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.200> tell

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
mystery is what they're trying to tell

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.249 
mystery is what they're trying to tell
us<00:02:04.439> here<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.240> first<00:02:06.450> mystery<00:02:06.930> to

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
us here so that is the first mystery to

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.770 
us here so that is the first mystery to
the<00:02:07.469> puffle<00:02:07.770> hotel<00:02:08.149> so<00:02:09.149> for<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.450> second

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
the puffle hotel so for the second

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.330 
the puffle hotel so for the second
mystery<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.289> has<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.619> do<00:02:10.800> with<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:11.129> ghost

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
mystery it has to do with a ghost

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.860 
mystery it has to do with a ghost
puffles<00:02:11.790> themselves<00:02:12.270> now<00:02:12.390> I'm<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:12.660> floor

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
puffles themselves now I'm on floor

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.020 
puffles themselves now I'm on floor
number<00:02:13.170> 11

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
number 11

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.000 
number 11
where<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.480> was<00:02:14.810> kind<00:02:15.080> of<00:02:15.140> spectating<00:02:15.770> some

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
where I was kind of spectating some

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.770 
where I was kind of spectating some
ghost<00:02:16.220> puffles<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.330> kind<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.540> got<00:02:17.660> me

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
ghost puffles and it kind of got me

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.340 
ghost puffles and it kind of got me
thinking

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
thinking

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.710 
thinking
we<00:02:18.680> haven't<00:02:19.010> origin<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.640> every<00:02:20.030> single<00:02:20.270> puffle

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
we haven't origin to every single puffle

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.750 
we haven't origin to every single puffle
that<00:02:20.900> there<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.290> so<00:02:21.950> whether<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.310> be<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.550> Dino

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
that there is so whether it be the Dino

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.370 
that there is so whether it be the Dino
puffles<00:02:23.270> we<00:02:23.450> have<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.720> origin<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.200> them

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
puffles we have the origin of them

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.230 
puffles we have the origin of them
coming<00:02:24.709> from<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:24.950> prehistoric<00:02:25.130> times<00:02:25.760> we

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
coming from the prehistoric times we

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.150 
coming from the prehistoric times we
have<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.540> origins<00:02:26.959> of<00:02:27.140> every<00:02:27.500> color<00:02:27.740> puffle

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
have the origins of every color puffle

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.460 
have the origins of every color puffle
because<00:02:29.030> they<00:02:29.209> came<00:02:29.480> from<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.990> public<00:02:30.140> force

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
because they came from the public force

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.870 
because they came from the public force
or<00:02:30.650> just<00:02:30.890> we've<00:02:31.040> discovered<00:02:31.400> them<00:02:31.640> on<00:02:31.670> the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
or just we've discovered them on the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.390 
or just we've discovered them on the
island<00:02:32.300> but<00:02:33.230> where<00:02:33.470> did<00:02:33.620> ghosts<00:02:33.860> puffles<00:02:34.250> come

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
island but where did ghosts puffles come

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.360 
island but where did ghosts puffles come
from<00:02:34.640> there<00:02:35.120> has<00:02:35.300> been<00:02:35.480> no<00:02:35.720> real<00:02:36.250> origin<00:02:37.250> to

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
from there has been no real origin to

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.560 
from there has been no real origin to
these<00:02:37.520> puzzles<00:02:37.820> that<00:02:37.850> have<00:02:37.970> been<00:02:38.120> discussed

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
these puzzles that have been discussed

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.310 
these puzzles that have been discussed
so<00:02:38.920> my<00:02:39.920> theory<00:02:40.370> was<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.630> ghost<00:02:41.840> puffles

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
so my theory was that the ghost puffles

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.830 
so my theory was that the ghost puffles
are<00:02:42.650> just<00:02:43.160> dead<00:02:43.459> puffles<00:02:44.000> now<00:02:44.300> it's<00:02:44.569> hard<00:02:44.780> to

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
are just dead puffles now it's hard to

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.240 
are just dead puffles now it's hard to
think<00:02:44.989> about<00:02:45.260> because<00:02:45.560> Club<00:02:45.770> Penguin<00:02:46.070> would

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
think about because Club Penguin would

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.220 
think about because Club Penguin would
never<00:02:46.459> have<00:02:46.700> something<00:02:47.420> like<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:47.690> involved

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
never have something like that involved

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.960 
never have something like that involved
in<00:02:48.350> their<00:02:48.470> game<00:02:48.709> but<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.400> only<00:02:49.550> logical

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
in their game but the only logical

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.150 
in their game but the only logical
explanation<00:02:50.120> as<00:02:50.780> of<00:02:50.959> right<00:02:51.140> now<00:02:51.410> that<00:02:51.709> we<00:02:51.950> know

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
explanation as of right now that we know

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.550 
explanation as of right now that we know
of<00:02:52.190> is<00:02:52.550> that<00:02:53.030> these<00:02:53.180> ghost<00:02:53.450> puffles<00:02:53.870> are<00:02:54.050> just

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
of is that these ghost puffles are just

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.680 
of is that these ghost puffles are just
dead<00:02:54.860> puffles<00:02:55.430> which<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:55.760> kind<00:02:56.030> of<00:02:56.150> like<00:02:56.570> I

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
dead puffles which is kind of like I

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.630 
dead puffles which is kind of like I
said<00:02:56.900> weird<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.320> think<00:02:57.350> about<00:02:57.830> but<00:02:58.250> it's<00:02:58.400> just

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
said weird to think about but it's just

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.430 
said weird to think about but it's just
a<00:02:58.760> theory<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.209> another<00:02:59.660> mystery<00:03:00.080> that<00:03:00.410> the

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
a theory and another mystery that the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.229 
a theory and another mystery that the
puffle<00:03:00.800> hotel<00:03:00.830> is<00:03:01.340> offering<00:03:02.060> us<00:03:03.610> so<00:03:04.610> for<00:03:05.030> this
