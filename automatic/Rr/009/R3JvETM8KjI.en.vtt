00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.060
Hello everyone I'm guido for football tricks online and today I'll show the following trick

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.520
This is a very famous trick because it is shocking and a lot of you want to learn this

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.120
We are going to do the following

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.500
Step on the ball with your dominant Foot

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.420
Life the ball at knee height as Minimum and waist height as Maximum

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.740
Like this...

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.760
that was waist height for example

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.800
You can also do it lower at knee height

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.680
As we did in previous tricks we are going to use the technique of lifting the ball

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.720
with a roll back and hard hit in the bottom

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.640
keep in mind the ball has to lift in a straight way

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.320
the ball cant go to the sides or forward, has to be straight

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.240
You can also perform the lift with your NON Dominant foot

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.600
Just roll it and lift it to get it ready for the hook

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.160
But with NON dominant foot is pretty hard so i will teach you with the Dominant foot lift up

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.440
So we are going to lift the ball to needed height

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.640
Now edu will get the ball for me to show you the trick correctly

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.440
Once the ball in the air you got to twist your body

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.840
and place your Dominant foot right under the ball

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.600
At this moment i got visual contact with the ball and can calculate where the ball will land

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.520
Ball has to land on your leg part, must not hit your heel or it will bounce

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.840
Once you calculated the perfect ball landing

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.080
We got to move to part 2 where we cant see the ball, its a blind move

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.720
When you feel the ball touches your leg

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.840
you got to stretch your leg to the outside

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.080
the ball will roll a bit on your leg in direction to your foot

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.160
then we just hit the ball forward

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.320
So part 1 should be like this

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.920
Roll and Lift, then Twist body and place Dominant Foot under the ball

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.040
with ball it should be like this

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.920
you see, there we place it under ball so its ready for part 2

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.040
then we stretch the leg and hit it forward with your foot

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.640
keep in mind, when i lift it up i perform a small jump

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.240
Placing support foot in good position so my dominant ends right under the ball

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.040
So i lift it and jump a bit to place dominant right under the ball

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.680
we got to cushion the ball so it wont bounce

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.400
so when the ball is falling we need to cushion it good to perform the trick correctly

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.560
To cushion it well you need to use the following technique

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.920
When you lift it up the ball will get to a point where it starts going down

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.920
So you need to place your foot under the ball right when it starts to go down

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.640
so it wont get speed and it will prevent the bounce

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.440
This is the hardest part, if you cushion it well the ball will have like a grip to your leg

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.000
that will let the ball follow your leg as you stretch it

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.080
lastly, keep you foot pointing forward so the ball can hit it and go forward

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.640
keep that in mind, foot pointing forward

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.880
This is a very difficult trick dont try to learn it in 10 minutes

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:35.440
Just practice it little by little and get used to each step of the trick

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.000
Warm up good when performing this trick because you do a lot of leg stretching

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.560
as you lift the ball your support leg stretches a lot and can injure you if didnt warm up

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.480
as you hit the ball you also do stretching

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.600
both legs stretch a lot so be carefull and warm up

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.200
what i learned by practicing this is the following

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.480
you got to the the first part fast to quickly place your dominant under the ball

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.680
but part 2 has to be slower

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.160
that was my error, wanted to do both parts as quick as possible and couldn't do it correctly

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.040
part 2, can be don slower at medium sleep

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.280
ball will follow your leg if its well cushioned

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.960
another thing that can happen is to hit it really high or really low

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.240
you just got to practice that

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.840
try performing all the step correctly

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.120
but body postion can help

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.960
if you place it looking down or looking up it will change direction of the ball

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.520
So body has to be stable as well

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.360
if you really want to do this trick you got to practice

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.720
its not just grabbing a ball for 2 days and if didn't just giving up

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.720
you got to practice constantly and continuously, those who practice are the once who can do it !

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.900
i hope you enjoyed the tutorial you have been asking for months for this tutorial
