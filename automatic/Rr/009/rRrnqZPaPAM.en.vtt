to<00:00:30.960> note<00:00:32.300> but<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.450> still<00:00:33.660> above<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.989> 50-day

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
to note but it's still above the 50-day

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.290 
to note but it's still above the 50-day
moving<00:00:34.890> average<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.579> look<00:00:35.760> at<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.969> weekly

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
moving average you look at the weekly

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.420 
moving average you look at the weekly
chart<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.989> wouldn't<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.739> actually<00:00:38.309> have

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
chart and wouldn't you actually have

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.490 
chart and wouldn't you actually have
liked<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:38.940> bought<00:00:39.360> every<00:00:39.989> one<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.350> these

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
liked to have bought every one of these

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.000 
liked to have bought every one of these
red<00:00:40.920> boxes<00:00:41.520> well<00:00:41.790> now<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.000> got<00:00:42.239> two<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.840> row

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
red boxes well now you got two in a row

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.850 
red boxes well now you got two in a row
okay<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.700> think<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.629> works<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.410> closer

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
okay so I think this works the closer

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.490 
okay so I think this works the closer
you<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.460> get<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.570> 50-day<00:00:49.230> moving

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
you can get it to the 50-day moving

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.069 
you can get it to the 50-day moving
average<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.340> be<00:00:50.520> right<00:00:50.730> around<00:00:50.879> 55<00:00:51.690> bucks

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
average you to be right around 55 bucks

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.160 
average you to be right around 55 bucks
that's<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.980> lower<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.579> risk<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.899> stock

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
that's the lower your risk is the stock

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.889 
that's the lower your risk is the stock
split<00:00:55.590> two<00:00:55.829> for<00:00:56.070> one<00:00:56.280> here<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.600> well

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
split two for one here and it's well

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.189 
split two for one here and it's well
above<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:59.430> pre<00:00:59.940> split<00:01:00.420> level<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
above that that pre split level and the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.319 
above that that pre split level and the
reason<00:01:01.530> that's<00:01:01.680> important<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.460> because<00:01:02.789> it

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
reason that's important is because it

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.219 
reason that's important is because it
tells<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.909> stock<00:01:06.299> was<00:01:06.840> not

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
tells you that that the stock was not

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.560 
tells you that that the stock was not
moving<00:01:07.650> up<00:01:08.010> simply<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:09.030> because<00:01:09.390> there

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
moving up simply just because there

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.750 
moving up simply just because there
weren't<00:01:09.720> enough<00:01:09.900> shares<00:01:10.290> trading<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.490> this

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
weren't enough shares trading so this

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.899 
weren't enough shares trading so this

Mountain<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:24.060> thing<00:01:24.299> scares<00:01:24.720> me<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.140> death

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
Mountain this thing scares me to death

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.640 
Mountain this thing scares me to death
it<00:01:26.250> absolutely<00:01:26.610> scares<00:01:27.540> me<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.930> death<00:01:27.960> I'd

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
it absolutely scares me to death I'd

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.219 
it absolutely scares me to death I'd
have<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> really<00:01:29.700> hard<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.450> mean<00:01:30.600> there's<00:01:30.810> no<00:01:31.049> way

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
have a really hard I mean there's no way

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.530 
have a really hard I mean there's no way
I<00:01:31.259> would<00:01:31.590> short<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.460> stock<00:01:32.520> would<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.420> been

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
I would short the stock would have been

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.380 
I would short the stock would have been
nice<00:01:33.720> if<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.049> was<00:01:34.290> short<00:01:34.590> here<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:35.610> my<00:01:35.909> point<00:01:36.210> is

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
nice if I was short here but my point is

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.420 
nice if I was short here but my point is
I<00:01:36.600> think<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.259> lot<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.439> shorts<00:01:37.890> are<00:01:38.070> covering

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
I think a lot of shorts are covering

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.910 
I think a lot of shorts are covering
right<00:01:39.060> now<00:01:39.290> I'm<00:01:40.290> sure<00:01:40.590> there<00:01:40.770> are<00:01:40.799> some

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
right now I'm sure there are some

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.100 
right now I'm sure there are some
committed<00:01:41.490> ones<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.000> say<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.540> even<00:01:42.930> go

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
committed ones that say it can even go

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.899 
committed ones that say it can even go
lower<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.500> they'll<00:01:43.799> probably<00:01:44.040> ultimately<00:01:44.310> be

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
lower and they'll probably ultimately be

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.789 
lower and they'll probably ultimately be
right<00:01:45.180> but<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.380> low<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.040> 50<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.329> 40<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
right but the low here is 50 to 40 the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.719 
right but the low here is 50 to 40 the
stock<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.280> trading<00:01:50.759> at<00:01:51.470> 5461<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.220> deeply

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
stock is trading at 5461 and is deeply

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.499 
stock is trading at 5461 and is deeply
oversold<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.600> think<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.939> can<00:01:57.149> put<00:01:57.360> on

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
oversold I think you can you can put on

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.039 
oversold I think you can you can put on
a<00:01:57.540> low<00:01:58.049> risk<00:01:58.439> trade<00:01:59.009> if<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.579> impose<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.270> stop

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.249
