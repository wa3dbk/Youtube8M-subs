00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.889
 this craft book project 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.830
 consisting of a collection of three titles 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.310
 in the first is a state book was the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.619
 in the simple heart the second is 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.890
 edgar allan poe or with murdered in the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.160
 dead street and a third is a book of 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.600
 called tchÃ©khov lights are these three 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.969
 titles in a limited numbered print 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.640
 only 200 copies were made 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.550
 all books were made through 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.160
 completely handcrafted processes and the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.399
 both cover artwork and won 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.890
 were made in woodcuts were 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.989
 made the woodcutting matrices already in 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.020
 exact size that would be printed 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.360
 directly on the level role to 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.079
 printing of the texts was done through 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.860
 typography 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.630
 they made the reasons is that the lines 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.080
 line by line of texts 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:15.150
 then the printer received the matrices of 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:18.810
 woodcut constructions and with the cover and 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.240
 a core of the book and in the type not all 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.000
 pages ready to print 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.729
 and binding was done manually 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.189
 so I made the whole covers ie 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.119
 will not be made with three-color fabrics 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.040
 different smooth layers ne 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.159
 We send to Sao Paulo and he sends everything. 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.369
 next to me, I'll take all 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.899
 material at once the printed cover already 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.840
 finished the middle where I have to 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.450
 folding holes this is how to make the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.060
 refit and then make the finishes 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.000
 In this email and then I'll have to 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.000
 analyze by placing the cover in this 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.510
 I also have a very strong position neither 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.470
 san that is of the same design concept 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.840
 what is the thing about you every person who 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.180
 acquires Olympic concludes that he gains such 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.010
 he feels he has a tactile thing he 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.530
 will pick up and feel the cotton fabric 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.330
 will highly relate to 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.820
 that will catch him will realize that 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.580
 that role it has an impression and that 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.150
 it has a relief really feels the 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.250
 mega lyrics can you feel lyrics by 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.690
 Letter is that when you take a book 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.300
 you open you smell the smell of a 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.580
 book that has a different type of ink 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.700
 and the people who will have that spirit 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.180
 you will not feel I'm going to touch a doll if 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.300
 relate a little more to this object 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.900
 the project is a proposal of the publisher art 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.730
 letter 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.720
 hence to the realization of this project 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.850
 He called daniel barbosa works 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.860
 in the notebook and from the 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.260
 daniel gente has arrived in other people at 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.890
 people came or anyone who is Jose 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.860

 I do not care for each book 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:26.220
