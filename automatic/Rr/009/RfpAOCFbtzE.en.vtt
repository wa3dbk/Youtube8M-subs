00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.460 
more serious approach in Europe for
gaming<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.970> catch<00:03:18.510> up<00:03:18.720> with<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.050> koreans<00:03:19.380> I

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
gaming to catch up with the koreans I

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.260 
gaming to catch up with the koreans I
think<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.770> need<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:19.950> yeah<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.760> don't<00:03:21.030> know<00:03:21.090> like

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
think you need to yeah I don't know like

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.820 
think you need to yeah I don't know like
the<00:03:21.390> Koreans<00:03:21.690> are<00:03:21.750> practicing<00:03:22.200> together<00:03:22.380> they

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
the Koreans are practicing together they

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.230 
the Koreans are practicing together they
are<00:03:22.920> living<00:03:23.040> together<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.880> would<00:03:24.030> be<00:03:24.120> nice

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
are living together and it would be nice

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.420 
are living together and it would be nice
to<00:03:24.390> see<00:03:24.540> stuff<00:03:24.900> like<00:03:24.959> that<00:03:25.110> coming<00:03:25.440> in<00:03:25.740> in

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
to see stuff like that coming in in

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.670 
to see stuff like that coming in in
Europe<00:03:26.850> okay<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.959> point<00:03:28.140> why<00:03:28.410> we<00:03:28.590> are

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
Europe okay this is the point why we are

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.949 
Europe okay this is the point why we are
not<00:03:28.709> on<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:28.920> same<00:03:29.010> level<00:03:29.190> right<00:03:29.670> now<00:03:29.720> it<00:03:30.720> might

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
not on the same level right now it might

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.220 
not on the same level right now it might
actually<00:03:31.200> be<00:03:31.470> because<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.570> think<00:03:33.570> it's<00:03:33.900> very

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
actually be because I think it's very

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.980 
actually be because I think it's very
different<00:03:34.530> just<00:03:35.490> practicing<00:03:35.940> alone<00:03:36.209> at<00:03:36.660> home

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
different just practicing alone at home

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.340 
different just practicing alone at home
or<00:03:37.230> like<00:03:37.970> basically<00:03:38.970> living<00:03:39.360> gaming<00:03:40.080> like

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
or like basically living gaming like

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.290 
or like basically living gaming like
living<00:03:40.980> in<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.100> gaming<00:03:41.340> house<00:03:41.610> I<00:03:41.850> think<00:03:42.120> it's

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
living in the gaming house I think it's

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.360 
living in the gaming house I think it's
doing<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.810> lot<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:42.959> your<00:03:43.230> mind<00:03:43.410> as<00:03:43.620> well<00:03:43.800> this

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
doing a lot of your mind as well this

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.400 
doing a lot of your mind as well this
means<00:03:44.610> being<00:03:45.000> addicted<00:03:45.540> like<00:03:45.720> day<00:03:45.930> 9<00:03:46.140> and

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
means being addicted like day 9 and

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.770 
means being addicted like day 9 and
casting<00:03:46.860> maybe<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:47.850> little<00:03:48.060> bit<00:03:48.270> addicted<00:03:48.660> yeah

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780
