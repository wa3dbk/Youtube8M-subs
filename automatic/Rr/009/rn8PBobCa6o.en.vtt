 we put to cook in abundant water 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.150
 salty and let's make a quick sauce 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.640
 very rich in a pan with a good fire 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.940
 we started with a little bit of oil 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.770
 calculate a tablespoon no more oil and 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.800
 there in that little amount of matter 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.200
 Fat we enter with chorizo ​​meat 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.810
 there's just a chorizo ​​that we take out 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:33.090
 pod we took the gut and we started it 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.850
 to cook there in that little amount of 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.340
 we cut it and we 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.330
 we also incorporate so that custom 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.840
 that will be cooking chorizo go 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.000
 cooking with an onion 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.380
 minimally chopped onion sausage 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.479
 little amount of oil 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.940
 while the pasta is cooking and 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.570
 that will look great, logically 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.320
 let's incorporate 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.440
 there on the onion and chorizo 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.890
 we sauté well that cooks the solicitous 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.280
 we are going to add a little garlic here 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.810
 we have chopped garlic there with a tooth 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.910
 but recontra lebra and is very tasty 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.430
 then we sauté a little is followed 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.060

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.990
 broccoli florets that we already had 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.360

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.490
 there is that pasta that we cook 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.310
 a few products and we take out the 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.950
 We are going to deliver it in this sauce 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.130
