00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.860 
type in player oops I'll fail dot dot um
I<00:00:58.489> think<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.969> oh<00:01:00.390> yes<00:01:00.660> set<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.379> V<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.609> then<00:01:03.539> some

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
I think it oh yes set a V and then some

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.250 
I think it oh yes set a V and then some
skill<00:01:04.439> I'm<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.460> do<00:01:05.640> block<00:01:06.260> because

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
skill I'm just going to do block because

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.219 
skill I'm just going to do block because
it's<00:01:07.619> probably<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.220> shortest<00:01:08.750> scale<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
it's probably the shortest scale to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.219 
it's probably the shortest scale to
spell<00:01:10.560> out<00:01:10.939> yeah<00:01:11.939> I'm<00:01:12.000> really<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.540> lazy<00:01:12.810> um

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
spell out yeah I'm really that lazy um

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.219 
spell out yeah I'm really that lazy um
and<00:01:14.479> then<00:01:15.479> set<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.350> one<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:18.240> then<00:01:18.659> you're

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
and then set it to one and then you're

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.130 
and then set it to one and then you're
going<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.439> enter<00:01:20.090> that's<00:01:21.090> going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.420> set<00:01:21.869> your

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
going to enter that's going to set your

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.280 
going to enter that's going to set your
block<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:23.040> level<00:01:23.909> one<00:01:24.180> or<00:01:24.450> whatever<00:01:24.780> skill<00:01:25.140> you

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.920 
block to level one or whatever skill you
did<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:26.580> what<00:01:26.970> you're<00:01:27.119> going<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:27.509> is

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
did and then what you're going to do is

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:39.249 
did and then what you're going to do is
player<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:31.700> advanced<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.689> its<00:01:34.880> advanced<00:01:37.700> pc

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
player that advanced so its advanced pc

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.950 
player that advanced so its advanced pc
skill<00:01:40.670> which<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.030> only<00:01:42.180> do<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
skill which you can only do this on the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.490 
skill which you can only do this on the
pc<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.799> kind<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.130> makes<00:01:44.189> sense<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:45.500> then

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
pc so that kind of makes sense and then

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.039 
pc so that kind of makes sense and then
you're<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.890> do<00:01:47.040> block<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.390> whatever

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049

you're going to do block or whatever
skill<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.799> did<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.430> then<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.509> some<00:01:51.990> really

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
skill you did and then like some really

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.480 
skill you did and then like some really
ridiculous<00:01:53.130> number<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.180> or<00:01:54.570> something

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
ridiculous number like that or something

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.880 
ridiculous number like that or something
that's<00:01:56.490> how<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.700> do<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.090> pc<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.899> then<00:01:58.530> on

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that's how you do on the pc and then on

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.319 
that's how you do on the pc and then on
the<00:02:00.530> which<00:02:01.530> i'm<00:02:01.710> not<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:02.219> hundred<00:02:02.729> percent<00:02:02.880> sure

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
the which i'm not a hundred percent sure

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.039 
the which i'm not a hundred percent sure
this<00:02:03.719> will<00:02:03.930> work<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.549> ps3<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.990> the
