00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
the warp prism and then also warp and

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.560 
the warp prism and then also warp and
sell<00:00:25.079> its<00:00:25.289> dome<00:00:26.070> okay<00:00:26.849> time<00:00:27.090> warp<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.419> so

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
sell its dome okay time warp is so

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.760 
sell its dome okay time warp is so

thing<00:03:39.489> with<00:03:39.610> Souza<00:03:39.850> floating<00:03:40.540> right<00:03:40.630> in<00:03:40.780> a

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
thing with Souza floating right in a

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.620 
thing with Souza floating right in a
little<00:03:41.019> bit<00:03:41.110> over<00:03:41.200> 1000<00:03:41.829> I<00:03:42.299> think<00:03:43.299> a<00:03:43.360> lot<00:03:43.390> of

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
little bit over 1000 I think a lot of

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.819 
little bit over 1000 I think a lot of
search<00:03:43.930> would<00:03:44.170> have<00:03:44.290> actually<00:03:44.440> killed<00:03:44.709> the

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
search would have actually killed the

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.770 
search would have actually killed the
hatch<00:03:45.040> there<00:03:45.340> he<00:03:45.610> could<00:03:45.850> have<00:03:45.940> well<00:03:46.450> but<00:03:46.660> then

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
hatch there he could have well but then

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.759 
hatch there he could have well but then
you<00:03:46.840> would<00:03:46.959> have<00:03:46.989> lost<00:03:47.200> a<00:03:47.380> lot<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:47.709> know

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
you would have lost a lot of you know

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.650 
you would have lost a lot of you know
you<00:03:47.980> know<00:03:48.100> but<00:03:48.250> these<00:03:48.700> cancels<00:03:49.239> he's<00:03:49.390> just

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
you know but these cancels he's just

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.509 
you know but these cancels he's just
taking<00:03:49.989> better<00:03:50.170> engage<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.739> Sue's<00:03:51.070> but<00:03:51.280> happy

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519

could<00:03:53.650> go<00:03:53.769> into<00:03:53.890> mutants<00:03:54.220> but<00:03:54.250> he<00:03:54.400> does<00:03:54.519> have

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
could go into mutants but he does have

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.370 
could go into mutants but he does have
