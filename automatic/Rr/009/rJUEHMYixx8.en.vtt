well it's light that's a little bit of

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.199 
well it's light that's a little bit of
sweetness<00:02:08.649> it<00:02:09.099> kind<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.369> protects<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.910> inside

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
overly chewy it's just the right amount

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.869

my ice cream and things like that I get

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.229 
my ice cream and things like that I get
to<00:03:40.620> be<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.709> little<00:03:40.890> bit<00:03:40.980> too<00:03:41.160> chewy<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.910> that's

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
to be a little bit too chewy and that's

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.370 
to be a little bit too chewy and that's
not<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:42.420> case<00:03:42.569> it<00:03:42.750> was<00:03:42.840> just<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.050> little<00:03:43.170> a

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
not the case it was just a little a

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.500 
not the case it was just a little a
light<00:03:43.560> sprinkling<00:03:44.160> like<00:03:44.459> sprinkling<00:03:45.390> of

light sprinkling like sprinkling of
peanut<00:03:45.959> loves<00:03:46.200> right<00:03:46.620> there<00:03:46.860> I<00:03:47.209> think<00:03:48.209> this

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
peanut loves right there I think this

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.580 
peanut loves right there I think this
