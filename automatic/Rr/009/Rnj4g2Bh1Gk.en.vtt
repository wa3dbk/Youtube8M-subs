 like every Wednesday we have a great 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.570
 roasted to share with you today I'm going 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.020
 to prepare a classic cut of the 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.250
 Argentine grill tail 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.410
 is a bit expensive through 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.019
 stay to taste because it comes out delicious 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.670
 It is ideal to invite many people 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.129
 many friends cut them into fries and 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.470
 buy it in sandwiches and a beauty 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.480
 let's start we have here the 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.670
 little tail of cuadril I went doing the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.399
 Duties investigating in Chile are 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.010
 llama tip of picacan already in peru steak 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.680
 of hip in Brazil more line and in 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.629
 Spain 'hip corner if you are 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.850
 from Colombia from another country that I did not mention 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.670
 look at the description please 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.630
 Help us and put what is called as seen 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.610
 has an elongated shape is not uniform 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.860
 20 thicker here and it is becoming more 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.570
 little girl that's why when we cook it we have 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.670
 to be careful that we do not know that 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.970
 one part and the other is very juicy at 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.310
 cook it well evenly 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.800
 It has a little fat but the richness of 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.830
 this is that once we cook it it 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.880
 melts and gives more flavor to the cut a 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.039
 we go to the grill 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.880
 we have to put the tail on first 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.729
 on the side that has more fat 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.000
 around 10 to 11 seconds have to 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.340
 hold your hand the heat of the grill 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.710
 we anoint it with salt it is very important that 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.040
 the salt was not thrown away not to be passed 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.500
 so that it stays and then while it goes 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.800
 cooking the same meat absorbs the salt 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.810
 and susana because they are how they fixed what 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.150
 only thing that I put to my tail is something 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.369
 really rich you do not need to put 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.010
 many things if you want can 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.300
 To flavor them with spices but today it comes out 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.300
 the traditional traditional 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.150
 They spent 25 minutes 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.390
 the fine crunchy grease disappeared 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:29.659
 everything melted giving flavor to all the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.640
 cut this we're going to leave about 15 to 20 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.640
 minutes more maybe a little less 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.130
 if tracking in a circular way 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.210
 with heat towards the grate in jumping towards 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.210
 the other side 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.890
 we do not cut it at any time in the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.170
 grill the idea is that all the juices 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.209
 stay inside the meat would crash in 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.030
 a little guy is going to take the games and leaves 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.969
 to dry and before cutting it to 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.160
 serve let rest 10 minutes 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:07.800
 so that the same juices 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.720
 king they own and they want the meat when 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.020
 we tell you do not lose them 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.360
 let's demonstrate this 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.490
 they always think that half of the 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.050
 balls where more was to be spent and some 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.860
 he likes a little more known than 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.860
 cut from the tips 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.930
 but I recommend 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.299
 good what we call closing the day of 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.609
 today I want to send a thank you 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.980
 a big hello to wilman mandorla 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:47.379
 who better comment I think that two 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.599
 or three short weeks as you know I read all 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.819
 your comments the truth that came to me 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.769
 heart told me not always 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.810
 elaborate recipes are the best 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.389
 sometimes you can go back to the basics that 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.709
 it's a luxury like the little tail we made 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:04.569
 today simply with salt comes out delicious 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.239
