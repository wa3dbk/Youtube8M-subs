painting<00:00:18.390> was<00:00:18.539> improvised<00:00:19.020> but<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.010> piece

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
painting was improvised but this piece

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.490

after the words improvisation 31 now if
we<00:00:27.900> look<00:00:28.080> at<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.320> painting<00:00:28.769> with<00:00:29.039> C<00:00:29.279> battle<00:00:29.640> in

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
we look at the painting with C battle in

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.120 
we look at the painting with C battle in
mind<00:00:30.000> we<00:00:30.599> can<00:00:30.810> interpret<00:00:31.199> those<00:00:31.439> two<00:00:31.769> thick

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
mind we can interpret those two thick

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.280 
mind we can interpret those two thick
vertical<00:00:32.730> black<00:00:33.000> lines<00:00:33.300> parallel<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.989> one

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
vertical black lines parallel to one

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.020 
vertical black lines parallel to one
another<00:00:34.320> as<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.100> mass<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.640> two<00:00:35.880> different

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
another as the mass on two different

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.119 
another as the mass on two different
ships<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.290> shapes<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.890> black

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
ships and the shapes that the black

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.260 
ships and the shapes that the black
lines<00:00:38.399> go<00:00:38.670> through<00:00:38.700> could<00:00:39.210> be<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.510> ship<00:00:39.719> sails

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
lines go through could be the ship sails

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.580 
lines go through could be the ship sails
the<00:00:42.270> ships<00:00:42.510> look<00:00:42.690> pretty<00:00:42.960> close<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.440> one

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the ships look pretty close to one

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.130 
the ships look pretty close to one
another<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.190> as<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.850> title<00:00:45.030> C<00:00:45.390> battle<00:00:45.780> implies

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
another so as the title C battle implies

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.170 
another so as the title C battle implies
we<00:00:46.800> could<00:00:47.010> assume<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.520> they<00:00:47.640> are<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:47.969> fact

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
we could assume that they are in fact

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.810 
we could assume that they are in fact
battling<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.410> two<00:00:49.649> short<00:00:50.010> diagonal<00:00:50.370> black

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
battling the two short diagonal black

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.610 
battling the two short diagonal black
lines<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.390> between<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.930> ships<00:00:52.170> might<00:00:52.440> be

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
lines in between the ships might be

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.680 
lines in between the ships might be
cannons<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.520> series<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.059> jagged<00:00:54.270> lines

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
cannons and the series of jagged lines

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.750 
cannons and the series of jagged lines
next<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> ships<00:00:55.590> look<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:56.039> splashes<00:00:56.640> in

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
next to the ships look like splashes in

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.760 
next to the ships look like splashes in
the<00:00:56.789> water<00:00:56.910> from<00:00:57.360> cannons<00:00:57.780> being<00:00:58.050> fired<00:00:58.410> or

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
the water from cannons being fired or

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.520 
the water from cannons being fired or
the<00:00:59.250> ships<00:00:59.520> rocking<00:00:59.940> back<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.149> forth<00:01:00.570> let's

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the ships rocking back and forth let's

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.110 
the ships rocking back and forth let's
think<00:01:01.710> about<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.129> lines<00:01:02.340> created<00:01:02.910> by<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
think about the lines created by the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.329 
think about the lines created by the
edges<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> red<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.290> yellow<00:01:04.409> triangles<00:01:05.189> in

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
edges of the red and yellow triangles in

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.039 
edges of the red and yellow triangles in
the<00:01:05.430> upper<00:01:05.760> corners<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> painting<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
the upper corners of the painting and

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.500 
the upper corners of the painting and
how<00:01:07.650> those<00:01:07.830> lines<00:01:08.130> create<00:01:08.549> depth<00:01:08.850> by<00:01:09.150> making

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
how those lines create depth by making

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.390 
how those lines create depth by making
the<00:01:09.659> space<00:01:09.930> between<00:01:10.140> them<00:01:10.530> seemed<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.890> recede

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the space between them seemed to recede

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.850 
the space between them seemed to recede
into<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> background<00:01:12.350> sticking<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.470> our<00:01:13.619> sea

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
into the background sticking to our sea

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.950 
into the background sticking to our sea
battle<00:01:14.220> theme<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:15.119> could<00:01:15.299> now<00:01:15.479> see<00:01:15.780> that

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
battle theme we could now see that

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.929 
battle theme we could now see that
spaces<00:01:16.500> being<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.920> river<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.520> ships<00:01:17.759> are

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
spaces being a river that the ships are

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.510 
spaces being a river that the ships are
floating<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:19.320> hold<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.680> second<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.369> is

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
floating on but hold on a second this is

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.370 
floating on but hold on a second this is
supposed<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.939> be<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> sea<00:01:21.479> battle<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.080> river

supposed to be a sea battle not a river

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.070 
supposed to be a sea battle not a river
battle<00:01:22.939> and<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.180> look<00:01:24.390> at<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> size<00:01:24.900> of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
battle and if you look at the size of

battle and if you look at the size of
the<00:01:25.259> ships<00:01:25.560> compared<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.189> how<00:01:26.310> wide<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.759> river

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the ships compared to how wide the river

the ships compared to how wide the river
is<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.780> river<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.140> not<00:01:28.320> very<00:01:28.560> big<00:01:28.799> at<00:01:28.950> all<00:01:29.180> the

the bottom kind of look like grass which

the bottom kind of look like grass which
makes<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.500> river<00:01:34.680> seem<00:01:34.979> pretty<00:01:35.220> shallow<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
makes the river seem pretty shallow to

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
seas not rivers now we can start to

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.450 
seas not rivers now we can start to
think<00:01:42.360> about<00:01:42.630> what<00:01:43.070> tendencies<00:01:44.070> message

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
think about what tendencies message

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
think about what tendencies message
might<00:01:44.729> be

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
might be
