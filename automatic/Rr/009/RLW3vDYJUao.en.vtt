notice<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.759> special<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.780> always<00:01:40.049> leaves<00:01:40.560> off<00:01:40.890> to

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
notice a special it always leaves off to

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.789 
notice a special it always leaves off to
like<00:01:41.400> one<00:01:41.759> HP<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.899> cannot<00:01:43.170> kill<00:01:43.470> an<00:01:43.590> enemy

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
like one HP you cannot kill an enemy

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.460 
like one HP you cannot kill an enemy
with<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.369> special<00:01:44.939> unless<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.570> guess<00:01:46.140> unless

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
with the special unless I guess unless

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.740 
with the special unless I guess unless
they<00:01:46.649> are<00:01:46.710> about<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.100> die<00:01:47.310> I'm<00:01:48.060> surprised

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
they are about to die I'm surprised

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:58.320 
they are about to die I'm surprised
about<00:01:48.780> how<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.290> thing<00:01:49.590> works<00:01:49.649> now

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.670 

all<00:01:59.330> right<00:01:59.509> maybe<00:01:59.720> we'll<00:01:59.900> look<00:02:00.049> at<00:02:00.200> his<00:02:00.320> second

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
all right maybe we'll look at his second

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.760 
all right maybe we'll look at his second
move<00:02:00.830> too<00:02:01.070> so<00:02:01.759> this<00:02:01.939> is<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.270> second<00:02:02.720> move<00:02:05.770> all

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
move too so this is the second move all

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.169 
move too so this is the second move all
right<00:02:06.890> there<00:02:07.100> we<00:02:07.189> go<00:02:07.220> we<00:02:07.490> got<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.790> look<00:02:08.000> at

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
right there we go we got to look at

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.910 
right there we go we got to look at
scorpions<00:02:08.509> first<00:02:08.929> move<00:02:09.200> in<00:02:09.380> second<00:02:09.770> move

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
scorpions first move in second move

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.040 
scorpions first move in second move
which<00:02:10.130> is<00:02:10.160> great<00:02:10.640> because<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.480> third<00:02:11.750> move

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
which is great because the third move

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.520 
which is great because the third move
will<00:02:12.830> require<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.280> number<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:14.720> will<00:02:14.959> require<00:02:15.350> a

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
will require a number it will require a

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.490 
will require a number it will require a
really<00:02:16.250> long<00:02:16.550> while<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:17.750> let's<00:02:17.959> go<00:02:18.080> in<00:02:18.230> here

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
really long while so let's go in here

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.949 
really long while so let's go in here
let's<00:02:18.739> look<00:02:18.890> at<00:02:19.069> scorpion<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.959> infernal

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959
