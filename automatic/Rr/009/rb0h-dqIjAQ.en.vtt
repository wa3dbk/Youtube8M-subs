before<00:00:02.909> we<00:00:03.000> begin<00:00:03.120> collimating<00:00:03.810> I<00:00:03.990> will<00:00:04.350> be

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
before we begin collimating I will be

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.079 
before we begin collimating I will be
introducing<00:00:04.589> you<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.190> some<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.879> tools

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
introducing you to some of the tools

pitching will be himself now you have to

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.940 
pitching will be himself now you have to
understand<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:09.420> by<00:00:09.929> collimating<00:00:10.590> we<00:00:10.830> have

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
understand that by collimating we have

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.220 
understand that by collimating we have
to<00:00:11.070> look<00:00:11.219> right<00:00:12.150> from<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.599> center<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.019> the

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230

the focuser and probably put some

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.780 
the focuser and probably put some
packing<00:04:25.290> inside<00:04:25.680> it<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:26.190> make<00:04:26.370> make<00:04:26.669> it

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
packing inside it to make make it

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.520 
packing inside it to make make it
perfectly<00:04:27.180> square

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.770 

so<00:04:32.530> let's<00:04:32.680> move<00:04:32.860> on<00:04:33.040> to<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.280> next<00:04:33.310> steps<00:04:33.780> right

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
so let's move on to the next steps right

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.110 
so let's move on to the next steps right
now<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.020> have<00:04:35.260> a<00:04:35.530> camera<00:04:35.800> pointing<00:04:36.610> right<00:04:36.820> into

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
now I have a camera pointing right into

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.060 
now I have a camera pointing right into
the<00:04:37.240> focuser<00:04:37.660> and<00:04:37.900> I<00:04:38.380> have<00:04:38.470> made<00:04:38.650> sure<00:04:38.890> that

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
the focuser and I have made sure that

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.920 
the focuser and I have made sure that
the<00:04:39.190> camera<00:04:39.520> is<00:04:39.580> precisely<00:04:40.120> aligned<00:04:40.360> along

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
the camera is precisely aligned along

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.090 
the camera is precisely aligned along
the<00:04:41.230> central<00:04:42.190> axis<00:04:42.340> of<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.700> focuser<00:04:44.100> actually

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
the central axis of the focuser actually

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.890 
the central axis of the focuser actually
you<00:04:45.190> should<00:04:45.370> be<00:04:45.460> doing<00:04:45.730> this<00:04:45.760> step<00:04:46.060> with<00:04:46.690> us

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
you should be doing this step with us

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.050 
you should be doing this step with us
with<00:04:47.230> those<00:04:47.350> tools<00:04:47.650> which<00:04:47.860> I<00:04:47.950> had<00:04:48.100> shown<00:04:48.370> but

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
with those tools which I had shown but

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.120 
with those tools which I had shown but
since<00:04:49.270> I<00:04:49.480> cannot<00:04:49.840> exactly<00:04:50.530> put<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:50.890> camera

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
since I cannot exactly put a camera

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.610 
since I cannot exactly put a camera
inside<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.850> P<00:04:52.000> phone<00:04:52.240> of<00:04:52.480> saying<00:04:53.290> je<00:04:53.440> serai

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
inside the P phone of saying je serai

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.220 
inside the P phone of saying je serai
piece<00:04:53.920> now<00:04:54.730> i<00:04:54.820> will<00:04:55.120> be<00:04:55.210> doing<00:04:55.330> the

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
piece now i will be doing the

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.770 
piece now i will be doing the
demonstration<00:04:56.860> like<00:04:57.580> this<00:04:57.820> so<00:04:58.570> on<00:04:58.690> the

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
demonstration like this so on the

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.240 
demonstration like this so on the
right-hand<00:04:58.990> side<00:04:59.200> of<00:04:59.350> the<00:04:59.530> focuser<00:04:59.920> you<00:05:00.070> can

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
right-hand side of the focuser you can

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.920 
right-hand side of the focuser you can
see<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:00.610> focusing<00:05:01.060> norm<00:05:01.300> and<00:05:01.510> on<00:05:01.810> the

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
see the focusing norm and on the

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.760 
see the focusing norm and on the
left-hand<00:05:02.200> side<00:05:02.350> you<00:05:03.250> can<00:05:03.430> see<00:05:03.460> a<00:05:03.640> thumbscrew

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
left-hand side you can see a thumbscrew

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.070 
left-hand side you can see a thumbscrew
now<00:05:05.770> we<00:05:05.830> are<00:05:06.010> zooming<00:05:06.190> in<00:05:06.660> this<00:05:07.660> is<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.900> inner

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
now we are zooming in this is the inner

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.860 
now we are zooming in this is the inner
ring<00:05:08.350> of<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.590> focuser<00:05:09.210> this<00:05:10.210> is<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.450> diagonal

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
ring of the focuser this is the diagonal

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.660 
ring of the focuser this is the diagonal
and<00:05:11.080> this<00:05:11.800> is<00:05:11.920> the<00:05:12.010> thickness<00:05:12.250> of<00:05:12.520> the

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
and this is the thickness of the

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.440 
and this is the thickness of the
diagonal<00:05:13.830> in<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:15.700> second<00:05:16.030> step<00:05:16.180> of<00:05:16.300> the

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
diagonal in the second step of the

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.020 
diagonal in the second step of the
collimation<00:05:16.840> I<00:05:17.170> have<00:05:17.920> to<00:05:18.070> Center<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.610> circle

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
collimation I have to Center the circle

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.960 
collimation I have to Center the circle
of<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:19.180> diagonal<00:05:19.690> in<00:05:19.900> the<00:05:20.500> inner<00:05:20.800> one<00:05:21.010> now<00:05:21.940> in

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
of the diagonal in the inner one now in

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.830 
of the diagonal in the inner one now in
my<00:05:22.270> case<00:05:22.330> it<00:05:22.780> seems<00:05:23.050> like<00:05:23.290> it<00:05:23.530> is<00:05:23.800> almost<00:05:24.190> done

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
my case it seems like it is almost done

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.950 
my case it seems like it is almost done
except<00:05:25.840> that<00:05:26.530> the<00:05:26.710> diagonal<00:05:27.370> is<00:05:27.550> little

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
except that the diagonal is little

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.990 
except that the diagonal is little
rotated<00:05:28.960> that<00:05:29.800> calls<00:05:30.070> for<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.460> third<00:05:30.730> step

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
rotated that calls for the third step

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.360 
rotated that calls for the third step
you<00:05:31.630> can<00:05:31.810> even<00:05:31.900> notice<00:05:32.320> that<00:05:32.350> I<00:05:32.620> can't<00:05:33.010> see<00:05:33.220> the

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
you can even notice that I can't see the

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.250 
you can even notice that I can't see the
reflection<00:05:33.850> of<00:05:33.970> the<00:05:34.150> primary<00:05:34.420> mirror<00:05:34.780> inside

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
reflection of the primary mirror inside

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.230 
reflection of the primary mirror inside
the<00:05:35.470> diagonal<00:05:35.860> so<00:05:36.310> in<00:05:36.400> the<00:05:36.520> third<00:05:36.760> step<00:05:37.000> I<00:05:37.210> will

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
the diagonal so in the third step I will

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.170 
the diagonal so in the third step I will
rotate<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:38.140> diagonal<00:05:38.530> or<00:05:38.740> use<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.820> tilting

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
rotate the diagonal or use the tilting

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.240 
rotate the diagonal or use the tilting
screws<00:05:40.480> to<00:05:41.170> perfectly<00:05:41.620> Center<00:05:42.070> the

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
screws to perfectly Center the

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.880 
screws to perfectly Center the
reflection<00:05:42.670> of<00:05:42.760> the<00:05:42.910> primary<00:05:43.740> so<00:05:44.740> I<00:05:44.770> am

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
reflection of the primary so I am

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.330 
reflection of the primary so I am
rotating<00:05:45.130> the<00:05:45.430> secondary<00:05:45.820> mirror<00:05:46.650> and<00:05:47.650> you

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
rotating the secondary mirror and you

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.540 
rotating the secondary mirror and you
can<00:05:48.520> see<00:05:48.730> the<00:05:48.910> reflection<00:05:49.390> of<00:05:49.480> the<00:05:49.600> primary<00:05:49.840> is

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
can see the reflection of the primary is

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:56.300 
can see the reflection of the primary is
coming<00:05:51.550> inside<00:05:51.820> it<00:05:52.000> it<00:05:52.900> is<00:05:53.290> almost<00:05:53.770> centered

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
coming inside it it is almost centered

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:04.779 
coming inside it it is almost centered
let<00:05:57.310> me<00:05:57.430> focus

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:04.789 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:07.879 

bingo<00:06:05.789> you<00:06:06.720> can<00:06:06.900> see<00:06:07.050> the<00:06:07.169> primary<00:06:07.560> mirror<00:06:07.710> and

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
bingo you can see the primary mirror and

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.159 
bingo you can see the primary mirror and
right<00:06:08.100> in<00:06:08.400> the<00:06:09.060> middle<00:06:09.210> of<00:06:09.660> the<00:06:09.720> secondary<00:06:12.169> but

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
right in the middle of the secondary but

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.469 
right in the middle of the secondary but
what<00:06:13.380> is<00:06:13.500> this<00:06:13.650> black<00:06:13.919> disk<00:06:14.490> you<00:06:15.060> can<00:06:15.090> see<00:06:15.449> that

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
what is this black disk you can see that

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.330 
what is this black disk you can see that
it<00:06:15.750> seems<00:06:15.990> that<00:06:16.169> I<00:06:16.380> have<00:06:16.410> an<00:06:16.830> oversized

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
it seems that I have an oversized

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.760 
it seems that I have an oversized
secondary<00:06:17.970> mirror<00:06:18.120> as<00:06:18.660> there<00:06:18.960> is<00:06:19.080> this<00:06:19.470> black

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
secondary mirror as there is this black

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.219 
secondary mirror as there is this black
marching<00:06:20.400> around<00:06:20.520> the<00:06:20.699> front<00:06:20.910> of<00:06:21.060> you

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229 
marching around the front of you

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:24.050 
marching around the front of you
actually<00:06:22.229> this<00:06:22.349> is<00:06:22.470> good<00:06:22.680> I<00:06:22.919> can<00:06:23.610> move<00:06:23.789> my<00:06:23.849> eye

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
actually this is good I can move my eye

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.059 
actually this is good I can move my eye
from<00:06:24.449> site<00:06:24.720> to<00:06:24.900> site<00:06:24.990> and<00:06:25.380> still<00:06:25.860> see<00:06:26.039> the

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:26.069 
from site to site and still see the

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:28.189 
from site to site and still see the
complete<00:06:26.490> primary<00:06:26.880> winner<00:06:27.060> this<00:06:27.870> means<00:06:28.110> that

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 
complete primary winner this means that

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:29.960 
complete primary winner this means that
