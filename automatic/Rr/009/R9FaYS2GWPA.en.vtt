00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.400 
light kit with two lights this is what I
recommend<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.480> do<00:00:15.630> if<00:00:15.990> you're<00:00:16.109> going<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.320> be

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
recommend to do if you're going to be

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.189 
recommend to do if you're going to be
shooting<00:00:17.130> some<00:00:17.340> video<00:00:17.609> just<00:00:18.150> yourself<00:00:18.539> so

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
shooting some video just yourself so

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.710 
shooting some video just yourself so
right<00:00:19.949> here<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.189> have<00:00:20.310> my<00:00:20.460> key<00:00:20.789> light<00:00:20.820> which<00:00:21.240> is

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
right here I have my key light which is

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.689 
right here I have my key light which is
the<00:00:21.840> closer<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.410> two<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:23.340> would<00:00:23.580> be

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
the closer of the two and it would be

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.400 
the closer of the two and it would be
brighter<00:00:23.939> because<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.420> closer<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.930> then

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
brighter because it is closer and then

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.170 
brighter because it is closer and then
over<00:00:25.710> here<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.890> have<00:00:25.949> my<00:00:26.130> fill<00:00:26.400> light<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.910> fill

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
over here I have my fill light that fill

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.179 
over here I have my fill light that fill
light<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.510> just<00:00:27.779> filling<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.619> shadows<00:00:29.010> that

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
light is just filling the shadows that

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.669 
light is just filling the shadows that
this<00:00:29.340> key<00:00:29.609> light<00:00:29.849> will<00:00:30.119> give<00:00:30.300> me<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.689> like<00:00:31.590> to

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
this key light will give me I like to

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.889 
this key light will give me I like to
keep<00:00:31.800> them<00:00:32.009> right<00:00:32.189> about<00:00:32.430> head<00:00:32.669> level<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.570> I

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
keep them right about head level so I

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.990 
keep them right about head level so I
don't<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.170> any<00:00:34.410> dark<00:00:35.340> shadows<00:00:35.700> underneath

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
I'm going to actually turn off this this

fill light here I'll have Todd do that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.119 
fill light here I'll have Todd do that
all<00:00:54.570> right<00:00:54.660> now<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:55.020> see<00:00:55.230> how<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.980> is

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
all right now you can see how this is

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.189 
all right now you can see how this is
much<00:00:56.340> darker<00:00:56.640> over<00:00:57.090> here<00:00:57.329> some<00:00:57.750> people<00:00:58.020> do

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
much darker over here some people do

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.720 
much darker over here some people do
like<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.440> little<00:00:58.590> bit<00:00:58.770> more<00:00:58.949> dramatic<00:00:59.520> lighting

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
like a little bit more dramatic lighting

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.490 
like a little bit more dramatic lighting
and<00:01:00.000> what<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.600> could<00:01:00.750> do<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:00.989> actually<00:01:01.109> take

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and what you could do is actually take

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.319 
and what you could do is actually take
that<00:01:01.680> fill<00:01:02.219> light<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.699> move<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.180> it's

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
that fill light you can move it so it's

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.579 
that fill light you can move it so it's
lighting<00:01:03.600> off<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> background<00:01:04.019> but<00:01:04.350> then<00:01:04.500> you

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
lighting off the background but then you

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.460 
lighting off the background but then you
go<00:01:05.580> past<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.630> still<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.110> little<00:01:07.380> bit

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
go past you you still have a little bit

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.440 
go past you you still have a little bit
of<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.400> probably<00:01:08.580> want<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.939> move

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
of this but you probably want to move

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.850 
of this but you probably want to move
your<00:01:09.630> light<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> little<00:01:10.170> bit<00:01:10.320> closer<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
your light a little bit closer to the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.429 
your light a little bit closer to the
camera<00:01:11.040> if<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.369> want<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.640> go<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:12.030> some<00:01:12.720> more

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
camera if you want to go for some more

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.380 
camera if you want to go for some more
dramatic<00:01:13.979> lighting<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.820> let's<00:01:15.030> turn<00:01:15.210> that

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
dramatic lighting so let's turn that

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.200 
dramatic lighting so let's turn that
fill<00:01:15.900> light<00:01:16.080> back<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.729> now<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:18.090> that

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
fill light back on now you can see that

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.850 
fill light back on now you can see that
fill<00:01:18.450> light<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:18.840> filled<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.500> all<00:01:19.680> those

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
fill light just filled in all those

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.320 
fill light just filled in all those
shadows<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.430> was<00:01:20.520> over<00:01:20.700> here<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.000> give<00:01:21.119> us<00:01:21.240> a

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
shadows that was over here to give us a

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.840 
shadows that was over here to give us a
nice<00:01:21.479> even<00:01:21.840> lighting<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.619> also<00:01:22.830> it's<00:01:23.520> taking

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
nice even lighting it's also it's taking

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.670 
nice even lighting it's also it's taking
care<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.240> shadow<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.259> key<00:01:25.470> light

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
care of that shadow that the key light

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.890 
care of that shadow that the key light
was<00:01:25.890> putting<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.220> behind<00:01:26.640> me<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:27.630> it's

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
was putting on behind me so it's it's

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.600 
was putting on behind me so it's it's
lighting<00:01:28.530> me<00:01:28.650> up<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:28.890> it's<00:01:29.009> also<00:01:29.159> lighting<00:01:29.520> up

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
lighting me up but it's also lighting up

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.990 
lighting me up but it's also lighting up
my<00:01:29.640> background<00:01:30.290> you<00:01:31.290> can<00:01:31.470> kind<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.070> experiment

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
my background you can kind of experiment

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.420 
my background you can kind of experiment
with<00:01:33.329> where<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.750> put<00:01:33.960> your<00:01:34.140> your<00:01:34.799> fill<00:01:35.220> light

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
with where you put your your fill light

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.890 
with where you put your your fill light
so<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:35.970> light<00:01:36.119> more<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> background

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900
