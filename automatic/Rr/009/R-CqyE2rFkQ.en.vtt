I<00:01:01.109> think<00:01:01.710> Nero<00:01:01.949> 11<00:01:02.520> takes<00:01:02.850> forever<00:01:03.180> I'm<00:01:03.660> just

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
I think Nero 11 takes forever I'm just

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.080 
I think Nero 11 takes forever I'm just
kind<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.439> an<00:01:04.589> impatient<00:01:05.100> person<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.580> think<00:01:05.790> just

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
kind of an impatient person I think just

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.210 
kind of an impatient person I think just
takes<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.659> long<00:01:06.840> time<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.260> do<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:08.130> just

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
takes for a long time to do it so I just

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.179 
takes for a long time to do it so I just
use<00:01:08.610> Nero<00:01:08.939> 11<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.960> for<00:01:10.260> burning<00:01:10.619> purposes

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
example these are the same files that I

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.609 
example these are the same files that I
showed<00:01:57.829> you<00:01:57.950> guys<00:01:57.979> previously<00:01:58.609> before<00:01:59.619> sync

so as you can see one two three four

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.889 
so as you can see one two three four
amount<00:02:04.459> of<00:02:04.549> count<00:02:04.729> this<00:02:04.880> one<00:02:04.939> this<00:02:05.240> is<00:02:05.299> our<00:02:05.569> we

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
amount of count this one this is our we

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:06.850 
amount of count this one this is our we
did<00:02:06.049> this<00:02:06.170> one<00:02:06.350> a<00:02:06.380> while<00:02:06.590> ago

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
did this one a while ago

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.309 
did this one a while ago

of<00:03:25.489> a<00:03:25.579> special<00:03:25.910> software<00:03:26.709> another<00:03:27.709> nice<00:03:27.980> thing

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
of a special software another nice thing

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.569 
of a special software another nice thing
about<00:03:28.310> this<00:03:28.760> is<00:03:29.319> it<00:03:30.319> doesn't<00:03:30.799> take<00:03:31.130> rule<00:03:31.459> a

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
about this is it doesn't take rule a

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.970 
about this is it doesn't take rule a
long<00:03:31.790> time<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:32.239> do<00:03:32.389> this<00:03:32.650> making<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.829> to<00:03:33.950> a

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
long time to do this making it to a

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.920 
long time to do this making it to a
single<00:03:34.160> file<00:03:34.489> and<00:03:34.730> once<00:03:35.359> you<00:03:35.510> do<00:03:35.660> you<00:03:35.780> can

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
single file and once you do you can

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.960 
single file and once you do you can
delete<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.319> rest<00:03:36.470> of<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.739> files<00:03:37.010> guess<00:03:37.849> you

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
delete the rest of the files guess you

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.259 
delete the rest of the files guess you
already<00:03:38.180> have<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.540> single<00:03:39.470> file<00:03:39.709> so<00:03:40.519> once

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
already have the single file so once

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.670 
already have the single file so once
again<00:03:41.389> it's<00:03:41.720> a<00:03:41.870> MTG<00:03:43.060> MPEG<00:03:44.060> stream<00:03:44.269> clip<00:03:44.680> you

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
again it's a MTG MPEG stream clip you

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.770 
again it's a MTG MPEG stream clip you
can<00:03:46.359> find<00:03:47.359> it<00:03:47.480> on<00:03:48.109> Google<00:03:48.470> squared<00:03:48.889> v<00:03:49.250> comm<00:03:49.780> you

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
can find it on Google squared v comm you

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.690 
can find it on Google squared v comm you
could<00:03:50.959> use<00:03:51.380> this<00:03:51.560> option<00:03:52.010> you<00:03:52.069> can<00:03:52.220> use<00:03:52.280> Nero

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
could use this option you can use Nero

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.449 
could use this option you can use Nero
11<00:03:53.209> I<00:03:53.750> think<00:03:54.319> new<00:03:54.500> or<00:03:54.560> level<00:03:54.889> just<00:03:55.010> takes<00:03:55.280> a

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
11 I think new or level just takes a

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.539 
11 I think new or level just takes a
little<00:03:55.610> bit<00:03:55.939> too<00:03:56.180> long<00:03:56.360> in<00:03:56.599> my<00:03:56.989> opinion<00:03:57.530> so<00:03:58.519> I

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
little bit too long in my opinion so I

00:03:58.549 --> 00:03:59.830 
little bit too long in my opinion so I
don't<00:03:58.969> recommend

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
don't recommend

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.350 
don't recommend
it<00:04:00.250> but<00:04:01.250> like<00:04:01.610> I<00:04:01.700> said<00:04:01.819> there's<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.090> lot<00:04:02.269> of

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
it but like I said there's a lot of

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.300 
it but like I said there's a lot of
options<00:04:02.480> one<00:04:03.170> of<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.379> reasons<00:04:03.739> why<00:04:03.980> I<00:04:04.010> like

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
options one of the reasons why I like

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.839 
options one of the reasons why I like
this<00:04:04.910> feature<00:04:05.480> is<00:04:05.840> when<00:04:06.440> I<00:04:06.500> convert<00:04:06.800> AVI<00:04:07.280> files

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
this feature is when I convert AVI files

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.650 
this feature is when I convert AVI files
into<00:04:08.360> Bob<00:04:08.660> or<00:04:09.019> a<00:04:09.080> DVD<00:04:09.560> disc<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.370> let's<00:04:11.150> say<00:04:11.420> I

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
into Bob or a DVD disc and let's say I

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.380 
into Bob or a DVD disc and let's say I
don't<00:04:12.140> want<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.680> burn<00:04:12.860> it<00:04:12.890> to<00:04:13.069> disk<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.670> lot<00:04:14.269> of

don't want to burn it to disk a lot of

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.910 
don't want to burn it to disk a lot of

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
burn it to disk well you can save it to
