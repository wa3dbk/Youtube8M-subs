friend kind of saying do you know old RB
once<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.430> learn<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.699> play<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.030> piano<00:00:54.059> properly

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
once I learn to play the piano properly

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.889 
once I learn to play the piano properly
and<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.739> friend<00:00:56.039> responded<00:00:56.520> no<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.780> I'm

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
and the friend responded no but I'm

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.689 
and the friend responded no but I'm
guessing<00:00:58.289> it'll<00:00:58.440> be<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> same<00:00:58.949> age<00:00:59.190> you'd<00:00:59.550> be

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
guessing it'll be the same age you'd be

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.869 
guessing it'll be the same age you'd be
if<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.239> never<00:01:00.539> learned<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.809> play<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.199> piano

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
if you never learned to play the piano

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.640 
if you never learned to play the piano
alright<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.090> luckily<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.870> lot<00:01:04.170> easier<00:01:04.500> to

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
alright so luckily it's a lot easier to

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.770 
alright so luckily it's a lot easier to
learn<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> guitar<00:01:05.010> than<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> piano<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.750> I

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
learn the guitar than the piano so I

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.750
