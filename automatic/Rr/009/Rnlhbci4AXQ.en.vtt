00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello to all, I deduce both vsky and 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.020
 today I want to do a little 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.679
 unpacking is also a first look at 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.960
 nexus 7 and this is not the normal version of this 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:18.420
 version 3g and 32 gigabytes which was 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.029
 presented much later 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:26.279
 first version 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.500
 asusa which came out in the summer of 2012 and in 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.470
 principle outwardly the box itself is practically 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.270
 no different from those basic versions in 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.960
 principle as it happens in others 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.010
 manufacturers but still let's 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.430
 look at how first look at this 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.950
 tablet and really what changed i 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.100
 will show 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:55.129
 added first opinion on this tablet 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:00.739
 when opening we see directly 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:04.830
 the tablet itself and what's different from 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.880
 previous generation but in more basic 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.479
 versions this is the inscription micro-sim 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.479
 This means that there is a 3g and you can 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.880
 use 3g module 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:21.659
 First of all I want to say on 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.570
 picking everything pretty nice 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.970
 I like packed 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.439
 black packaging as such as 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.470
 certain style is the only thing 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.689
 Now I look in the inside it is upakovochke 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.960
 such an empty feeling like 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.659
 like here 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:53.960
 Well, do not be manned so to speak 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:56.330
 here goes the giveaway itself instruction also 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.780
 clip on 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:05.240
 warranty for guarantees and 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.229
 and usb cable so it seems all yes all 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.009
 equipment 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:13.959
 I think we will need all this. 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:18.140
 except this one here clips 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:26.709
 directly the tablet device itself 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:29.080
 here it is what it is in unpacking polyethylene 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.580
 Lelenka 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.430
 I would not include it as this 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.069
 unpacking I literally through 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.739
 certain time I will review on 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.970
 which I will tell you in detail there 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.190
 hardware configuration in general 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.620
 the only thing I can say is that here 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.380
 quad-core processor installed 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.650
 nvidia tegra 3 with 1 and 2 hearts each 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.730
 core and 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:03.130
 what distinguishes it from the basic version is 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:05.840
 32 gigabytes of memory and slot for micro sim 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:11.230
 let's get such an interesting one 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.230
 plushyu goes goes fan 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:22.190
 wow you fell 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:26.150
 here it is those who saw the plush from they 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:29.480
 different this basically lies 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.840
 much more convenient than from ipad here 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.090
 so very easy by the way very 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.070
 easy unlike again comparison 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.540
 next comes 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.820
 here for micro sim 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:49.010
 easy to get 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:52.190
 and back is inserted further what else 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.180
 here it is interesting to eat so it is on the front 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.930
 parts is located chambers 1 and 2 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:04.370
 megapixel display no buttons 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:08.840
 Generally on the front there is no on the back 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.090
 parts we are other than the name and the dynamics themselves 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.930
 as well as the manufacturer is written here 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:19.400
 Here we do not see the bottom of this for 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:23.260
 headphone jack and slot for sorry 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.860
 slot for charging and connecting usb to 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.370
 computer 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.770
 on the right side is the adjustment 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.650
 volume and power on button 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.880
 switch on and by the way another microphone here 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.699
 above is a microphone I understand that 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.510
 here is another microphone this 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:49.760
 most likely two cool solutions 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:52.580
 at first glance 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.150
 that is, as for a first look, I think 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.389
 what information can I say enough about 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.600
 price at the price which is on the territory 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:06.199
 Ukraine, it costs 400 dollars or 3 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.030
 thousand 200 hryvnia is its price true 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:11.870
 price is online stores 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.310
 I think retail retailers have them. 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.729
 much more expensive 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:21.350
 hryvnia for three to four hundred somewhere up to 50 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:25.130
 dollars is even more expensive here is one such 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.940
 here is the first look at nexus 7 32 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.860
 gigabyte with 3g 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.690
 the next video will be directly 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.690
 review of this tablet 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.180
 if you're interested you can deliver 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.520
 Like and ask some questions and 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:43.980
 I also want to say that very soon 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:46.620
 I will make a comparison of nexus 7 with ipad mini 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.530
 so subscribe to my channel before 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.120
 See you soon thank you store them on a 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.220
