dolphins as all of us has evolved over
time<00:00:56.430> here<00:00:56.820> at<00:00:56.940> changed<00:00:57.360> over<00:00:57.660> time<00:00:58.520> this<00:00:59.520> is

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
time here at changed over time this is

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.310 
time here at changed over time this is
really<00:00:59.940> his<00:01:00.300> first<00:01:00.570> opportunity<00:01:00.900> with<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
really his first opportunity with the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.960 
really his first opportunity with the
fishes<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.680> we're<00:01:01.890> doing<00:01:02.160> right<00:01:02.340> now<00:01:02.610> so

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
fishes that we're doing right now so

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.149 
fishes that we're doing right now so
this<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.810> room<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.170> game<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.500> last<00:01:04.680> year<00:01:04.860> but

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
this is room in a game to last year but

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.030 
this is room in a game to last year but
he<00:01:06.090> handled<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.420> pretty<00:01:06.600> good<00:01:06.689> oh<00:01:07.079> so<00:01:07.530> bad<00:01:07.770> but

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
he handled it pretty good oh so bad but

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.679 
he handled it pretty good oh so bad but
I<00:01:08.250> think<00:01:08.759> he's<00:01:08.939> getting<00:01:09.090> more<00:01:09.390> comfortable

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
I think he's getting more comfortable

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.719 
I think he's getting more comfortable
because<00:01:10.319> he<00:01:10.499> was<00:01:10.590> more<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.859> a<00:01:10.950> backup<00:01:11.340> flashing

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
because he was more of a backup flashing

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.520 
because he was more of a backup flashing
got<00:01:11.880> back<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.240> grab<00:01:12.450> food<00:01:12.840> whenever<00:01:13.079> was<00:01:13.350> get

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
got back up grab food whenever was get

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.069 
got back up grab food whenever was get
all<00:01:13.649> the<00:01:13.740> starting<00:01:14.130> rep<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.789> think<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.539> the

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
all the starting rep so I think of the

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.289 
all the starting rep so I think of the
extra<00:01:16.350> reps<00:01:16.560> are<00:01:16.710> serving<00:01:17.009> home<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.909> get<00:01:18.060> out

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
extra reps are serving home and get out

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.330 
extra reps are serving home and get out
of<00:01:18.479> what<00:01:18.719> what<00:01:19.409> did<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.590> hear<00:01:19.829> what<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.189> hear

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
of what what did you hear what you hear

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.980 
of what what did you hear what you hear
and<00:01:20.399> obviously<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.210> rain<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.630> your<00:01:21.780> be

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and obviously the rain is your be

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.410 
and obviously the rain is your be
extracting<00:01:22.590> those<00:01:22.740> water<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.369> too<00:01:23.639> smart<00:01:23.999> all

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
extracting those water is too smart all

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.179 
extracting those water is too smart all
those<00:01:24.600> things<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:25.200> son<00:01:25.499> of<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.710> golfer

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
those things you son of a golfer

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.309 
those things you son of a golfer
assertion<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.700> much<00:01:27.060> loves<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.810> part<00:01:28.200> of

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
assertion that much loves that part of

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:29.690 
assertion that much loves that part of
the<00:01:28.439> gas<00:01:28.649> I<00:01:28.920> think<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.219> always<00:01:29.490> like<00:01:29.670> that

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the gas I think it's always like that

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.969 
the gas I think it's always like that
sort<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.179> this<00:01:30.359> level<00:01:30.539> is<00:01:30.810> well<00:01:31.469> beyond<00:01:31.829> his

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
sort of this level is well beyond his

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:32.929 
sort of this level is well beyond his
