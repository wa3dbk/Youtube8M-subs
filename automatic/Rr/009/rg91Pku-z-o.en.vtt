00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.580 

but<00:01:12.610> first<00:01:12.880> we<00:01:13.060> need<00:01:13.210> to<00:01:13.299> finish<00:01:14.080> this<00:01:14.350> level

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
but first we need to finish this level

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.690 
but first we need to finish this level
up<00:01:14.770> by<00:01:14.890> claiming<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.340> last<00:01:15.520> secret<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.640> we

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
up by claiming the last secret and we

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.590 
up by claiming the last secret and we
come<00:01:18.880> down<00:01:19.000> here<00:01:19.060> we<00:01:19.360> flip<00:01:19.570> this<00:01:19.750> lever<00:01:21.600> and
