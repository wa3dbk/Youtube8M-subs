 the French are no longer surprised by the bad news 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.539
 not a popular president whose 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.550
 nicknamed the mission normal blamed for 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.990
 inability to stop the trend when 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.859
 economic uncertainty 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.660
 become the norm 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.970
 public discontent is noticeable 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.980
 with the naked eye only 11 percent 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.440
 the French believe that in the coming year 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.660
 the state of the economy will improve to 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.309
 somehow revive her olland recently announced 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.620
 about investing three and a half billion 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.840
 euro in thirty four key sectors 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.579
 economy hoping to arrange a third 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.160
 industrial revolution but at the same 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.690
 time budget for 2014 had to 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.969
 reduce by 18 million euros so far 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.000
 people cope with the crisis because 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.600
 last 10 20 30 years france was 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.440
 rich country and the older generation 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.780
 proportionally more funds 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.970
 than young families observed 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.650
 interesting phenomenon 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.260
 grandparents help their grandchildren 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.450
 pay tuition but so more 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.939
 can not continue among the french 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.259
 skepticism towards c 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.040
 evidence of this and data 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.360
 polls and election results i 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.750
 addressed the president with a proposal 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.490
 hold a referendum in January 2014 and 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.560
 ask the French if they want to 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.579
 stay in the eu still have 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.770
 open borders 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.350
 do they want European laws 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.780
 were prior to the French Silverton 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.700
 levi's is here to discuss and 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.100
 make decisions on virtually any 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.720
 investment financing issues 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.670
 before unemployment and eurozone 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.470
 However, it seems that the decision is still 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.630
 more discussed than accepted 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.640
 so the head of mid France stated that 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.110
 this place needs a host but France does not 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.369
 can afford it for now 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.960
 president francois holland 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.850
 still under tremendous pressure 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.710
 from Berlin and Brussels 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.719
 they require him to perform their 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.250
 economic obligations text 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.780
 draft drawn up in April 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.759
 socialist olland party 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.709
 criticized the German chancellor angel 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.450
 merkel for her acetate selfish 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.370
 inflexibility and called for 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.200
 confrontation 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.000
 clay in matters of politics if 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.069
 economic situation in france 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.450
 compared with Germany is deteriorating 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.310
 it puts france on another 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.319
 political course different from courses 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.909
 Germany which in turn create 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.019
 difficult conflict situation inside 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.879
 European Union 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.269
 if this happens the voltage will be 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.340
 only grow these contradictions will shake and 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.079
 without that unstable situation itself 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.209
 Germany is now trying to cope with 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.519
 worsening situation around the euro and 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.670
 pull out of financial crisis neighboring 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.560
 bastard countries are we tied up in one 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.329
 node from Germany just because 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.579
 merkel never publicly said that 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:52.519
 france belong to southern europe by 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:55.030
 at least here it is orz or rt 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.030
