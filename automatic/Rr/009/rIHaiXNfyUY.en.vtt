00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.650
 hello and welcome to yours 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.840
 garden channel today i want to show how 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.370
 I plant my cucumbers though I do 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.830
 even vouching should not back mark 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.390
 The rich are no garden missing from 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.930
 meanwhile also state plants 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.640
 become 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.820
 two and a half weeks ago I got together 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.800
 be done yes one can recognize such 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.990
 he's pretty much rooted now 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.759
 In the middle of May you can also get out for rice 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.369
 problematic since the frost sensitive 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.260
 So are the cucumbers relationship 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.090
 small wooden post screw and 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.210
 Speaker cable is attached to it 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.720
 is and here in the construct should the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.300
 cucumber plants later hochranken here 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.370
 At the back one recognizes that cable so you 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.260
 alibi moderately attached but it is 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.730
 really power and, above all, I am pleased 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.200
 the upcycling of the speaker cable 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.660
 In the back I still have ned created before 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.120
 recently my entire free country 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.710
 says rocky yellow is being milled off the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.700
 snails and I hope that I will 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.070
 at least here are some carrots 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.650
 then you can reap 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.990
 and here is the garden's own compost 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.549
 so that plant holes fill that 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.859
 the substrate basis then later for 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.450
 the cucumbers he hopes will bring enough 

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:19.530
 nutrients that we really nice big 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.939
 customers get the combos but now 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.170
 a little potting clean 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.240
 world is 50 50 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.159
 that's not quite as annoying combos 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.270
 must the same potting soil in the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.890
 churches have been mixed 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.810
 Looks like I have the course 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.249
 gloves now use the same 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.639
 fill the holes with it I have mine 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:43.619
 but made each plant hole 

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:46.530
 five hands full of these earth combos 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.350
 Mixture and must be the ideal 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.329
 be burgen - loving ground of 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.600
 almost only from compost or well rot 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.399
 miss exists and they also need it 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.829
 you will be spending a lot of your growth period 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.479
 moisture and it stores natural 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:05.100
 this combo it is very beautiful and 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.770
 so that the soil is well researched 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.060
 you should dig up that deep and me 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.060
 think the hole is deep enough 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.240
 look now for a short time yes that suits now 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.640
 I'm still doing a bit of this here 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.710
 Soil it is nice too 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.190
 mixed is because the cow is here 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.450
 also get used to it and it will be yes 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.860
 anyway, sooner or later everything 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.380
 mixed when it rains and the 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.070
 earthworms hereby emphasize so 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.070
 stops 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.760
 I now continue with the plant 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.300
 earth filled in the seeds or 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.060
 the cucumber plants were pulled and 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.510
 Now the whole thing is still on film 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.100
 the garden would have an interesting one 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.230
 way cucumbers also attract 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.820
 you could see directly next to the 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.620
 place where you should grow later 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.020
 and then you stand so small 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.459
 jam jar over it or he does not have to 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.140
 be absolutely small jam jar 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.000
 and it should be such a small microclimate 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.530
 just created and the cucumbers too 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.790
 protect 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.920
 and when the plants are big enough 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.350
 so that the glass is taken away and then 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.090
 may they continue to grow so for 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.860
 someone who can not wait and already 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.580
 end of April were then delivered by the 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.390
 sende should press it firmly and then 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.860
 let's leave something special 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.860
 come up with something we'll see in a moment 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.090
 I have the cucumbers now 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.040
 lawn cutting mulched that if that 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.510
 do not fall on earth and fall 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.850
 in the mud and the leaves somehow 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.410
 They are crushed softly on the lawn 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.550
 fall 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.770
 and here I do not know if you are with the 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.180
 can detect camera as well as I have so 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.730
 a small earth wall around the bridges 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.070
 That's what the rainwater built 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.710
 collects or even the irrigation water and me 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.380
 in the area around as I said the 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.590
 castles like nice wet 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.880
 Therefore , it is the same time to pour 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.920
 what you should not do what i did 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.200
 Now here just like the cucumbers 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.850
 no wet feet as they like them 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.190
 not at all to look like that 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.780
 leaves not here pours okay 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.250
 the dull ones can not pour on now 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.740
 I would chopped each one fresh 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.630
 trample I hope it has you again 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.820
 please and ask criticism or 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.180
 suggestions at any time in the 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.180
