00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.029

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.109
 Are you sure that too I am 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.500
 really bad today 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.680
 finally let's go there is this update in me 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.320
 It was very enjoyable that it was not 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.809
 half trap bpn is one of gp to us 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.059
 personnel and as you know I'm not 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.670
 very different in this different mode 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.350
 way with a view to the things that I am not 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.760
 But that classic guy, right? 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.980
 I like to play seek and destroy the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.890
 and only I do not like 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.719
 to be a lot of grassi not but she 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.489
 is an update that greatly pleased the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.140
 public that does not like 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.879
 try new experiences 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.859
 horizons can say yes 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.510
 finally on the black market we had the 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.519
 Storm chest I'm going to put a photo 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.280
 here is a box that you 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.900
 goes with you will compete for three items that 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.290
 if I'm not mistaken it's the grenade 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.299
 storm to the nape of the neck a 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.369
 camouflage of the storm as well and a 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.549
 ax also anyone can of 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.850
 storm and also the rpk box 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.040
 red eagle that until I even did not 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.770
 I'm very fond of light machine gun curti 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.500
 enough camouflaged her and I'm going to try 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.070
 playing a box not knowing whether rolls 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.079
 to win even though you have never won anything 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.009
 and the waters were rewarded 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:44.130
 by Natal boss of this update was the 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.920
 fnf 2000 was a skull and crossbones camouflage 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.930
 desert eagle mutant camouflage 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.729
 The mg has 36 with the camouflage silver emi 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.799
 1216 which is a weapon is a shotgun if not 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.990
 I'm mistaken, but no camouflage at all. 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.119
 grace and the overwhelming fist that 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.030
 It's basically a boxing glove out there. 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.230
 You must hit your friend's house . 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.570
 It should be really cool with this already. 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.000
 and a map that came to know it only came 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.380
 a module map of the 1 life module that is 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.260
 the sea ​​you are watching the gameplay 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.720
 background there is the crater map and outside 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.490
 of it is that basically a meteor fell 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.830
 in the middle of the city and as you can see 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.130
 which has to change from subway or 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.760
 close the subway is a gift frei can a 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.730
 train 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.730
 finally a meteor fell, this story is 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.270
 a meteor in the city infected a 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.340
 guys and that 's what I found cooler 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.810
 although he does not like the modality, it is 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.330
 they innovated enough they brought a 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.160
 monster the new ones like that 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.470
 update we had the snake that is 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.980
 a boring bug that came up when you have 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.620
 there they appear after the tone to make 1 to 1 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.660
 Look there now, you see a smoke. 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.290
 that a strange animal came out so that's it 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.060
 hence it is snake it so boring and had 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.100
 also the disfigured which is an animal 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.310
 very boring holder and he comes running 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.690
 on the floor has an action dino did that is the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.670
 right name but that's what you are 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.400
 now seeing that in the story that they 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.410
 are a gorilla that has been infected with 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.840
 meteor just do not ask me what that 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.920
 gorillas were doing in the middle of the city 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.810
 no, not at all 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.090
 finally we have an amount that is a guy 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.830
 super bombadão is that it is legal to kill 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.270
 But he's taking a little while to 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.130
 die there they are seeing 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.540
 now he got out of the insured I did not tell 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.890
 he talks with a spider comes running 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.420
 madly very annoying and they are 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.280
 making a bonus mission of then was 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.280
 cool when you get on the wave of 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.690
 number 19 you do not know if it 's all 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.330
 parties but this was the only one I 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.070
 I played and had a good that is 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.989
 You have to kill everyone. 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.580
 disfigured appear and I knew 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.340
 hold on I do not know there's another dead 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.290
 is it appears thousands of insured you have 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.720
 to kill them all is I am playing 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.770
 a young man with a skull and 11 with the 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.709
 Caveiron with 11 games with African game 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.989
 with clothes remember to remember one 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.390
 back office and they helped me and 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.950
 I wanted to say thank you and there and we did not 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.350
 managed to complete the good mission to us 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.570
 Come here, you really know that you did not even show up. 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.070
 now it is the incomplete mission we are 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.950
 good, right? 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.359
 and now it will start the final way I found 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.019
 that something so difficult because it was 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.500
 playing bad 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.259
 at the easiest level, but at last I found 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.770
 thus our felton this shit is 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:29.840
 Impossible I just hung 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.599
 always win and succeed in making ends in 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.530
 everybody and nobody looks like they do not even climb 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.569
 to kill 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.110
 was very humiliating for him of course 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:40.250
 He'll talk when he gets home, right? 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.560
 hehehe guys I do not think it's a 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.930
 It's a fun thing to play until 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.470
 because I enjoyed zombie support yet 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.940
 Another vinyl arrived and I always have 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.150
 usual to talk to friends who 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.680
 a cool zombie is an objective billion 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.590
 today those unbundled ones who 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.300
 those an evil resident glass of the player 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.639

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.400
 joseph pump comes they are legal but 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.750

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.909

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.560
