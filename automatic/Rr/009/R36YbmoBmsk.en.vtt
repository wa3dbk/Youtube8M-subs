up a video and audio of what I consider

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.730 
up a video and audio of what I consider
a<00:00:14.870> lifter<00:00:15.870> tick<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:18.020> maybe<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.140> little<00:00:19.380> bit<00:00:19.619> of

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
a lifter tick and maybe a little bit of

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.590 
a lifter tick and maybe a little bit of
a<00:00:19.920> nose<00:00:20.160> noise<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.789> don't<00:00:20.850> think<00:00:21.180> there's<00:00:21.390> very

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
a nose noise I don't think there's very

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.560 
a nose noise I don't think there's very
much<00:00:21.840> vanos<00:00:22.439> noise<00:00:23.000> because<00:00:24.000> i<00:00:24.029> put<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.359> new

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
much vanos noise because i put a new

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.189 
much vanos noise because i put a new
vanos<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.500> car<00:00:25.859> or<00:00:26.220> about<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> year<00:00:26.880> ago

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
vanos in this car or about a year ago

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:35.319 
vanos in this car or about a year ago
doctor<00:00:28.199> vanos<00:00:31.189> and<00:00:32.210> it's<00:00:33.210> had<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> head<00:00:33.780> job<00:00:34.160> and

doctor vanos and it's had a head job and

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.630 
doctor vanos and it's had a head job and
the<00:00:36.329> lifters<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:36.899> all<00:00:37.050> been<00:00:37.260> cleaned<00:00:37.950> they

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
the lifters have all been cleaned they

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.430 
the lifters have all been cleaned they
were<00:00:38.730> not<00:00:38.910> replaced<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.760> got<00:00:41.910> about

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
were not replaced so and it's got about

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.639 
were not replaced so and it's got about
145,000<00:00:43.440> miles<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.840> what<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.110> want<00:00:46.500> you

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
145,000 miles on it so what I want you

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.670 
145,000 miles on it so what I want you
to<00:00:46.710> notice<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:48.379> how<00:00:49.579> the<00:00:50.579> lifter<00:00:51.000> noise<00:00:51.680> starts

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
to notice is how the lifter noise starts

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.270 
to notice is how the lifter noise starts
out<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.390> little<00:00:54.390> bit<00:00:54.600> loud<00:00:55.140> not<00:00:55.469> real<00:00:55.680> loud<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
out a little bit loud not real loud and

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.389 
out a little bit loud not real loud and
then<00:00:56.430> quiets<00:00:56.850> down<00:00:57.090> right<00:00:57.390> away<00:00:57.949> what<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.160> is

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
then quiets down right away what that is

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.889 
then quiets down right away what that is
is<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:01.489> motor<00:01:02.489> oil<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.940> getting<00:01:03.090> pumped<00:01:03.570> up

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
is the motor oil is getting pumped up

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.340 
is the motor oil is getting pumped up
into<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> lifters<00:01:05.400> their<00:01:05.850> hydraulic<00:01:06.600> lifters

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
into the lifters their hydraulic lifters

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.160 
into the lifters their hydraulic lifters
they're<00:01:07.590> not<00:01:07.799> mechanical<00:01:08.549> lifters<00:01:09.170> hydraulic

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
they're not mechanical lifters hydraulic

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.429 
they're not mechanical lifters hydraulic
lifters<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.070> some<00:01:11.340> oil<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.820> them<00:01:12.030> to

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
lifters have to have some oil on them to

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:18.800 
lifters have to have some oil on them to
oil<00:01:13.439> inside<00:01:13.950> them<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:16.130> cushion<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.810> demotion

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
oil inside them to cushion the demotion

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.530 
oil inside them to cushion the demotion
and<00:01:18.990> these<00:01:19.860> are<00:01:20.130> hydraulic<00:01:20.520> lifters<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.299> I

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
and these are hydraulic lifters so I

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.690 
and these are hydraulic lifters so I
just<00:01:22.200> want<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.409> put<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.710> up<00:01:22.950> for<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> reference

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
just want to put this up for a reference

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.830 
just want to put this up for a reference
basically<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> reference<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:26.509> what<00:01:27.509> I

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
basically this is a reference of what I

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.880 
basically this is a reference of what I
consider<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.890> normal<00:01:29.780> sounding<00:01:30.780> lifter<00:01:31.500> tick

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
consider a normal sounding lifter tick

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.770 
consider a normal sounding lifter tick
lift<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.640> tick<00:01:32.939> or<00:01:33.240> lifter<00:01:33.930> noise<00:01:35.570> so<00:01:36.570> that's

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
lift a tick or lifter noise so that's

00:01:36.780 --> 00:02:18.000 
lift a tick or lifter noise so that's
what<00:01:36.930> I'm<00:01:37.020> going<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.170> do<00:01:37.290> for<00:01:37.530> you

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.759 

so<00:02:18.519> I'll<00:02:18.760> have<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.090> post<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:19.569> up<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.140> see<00:02:20.500> if

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
so I'll have to post this up and see if

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.890 
so I'll have to post this up and see if
the<00:02:21.400> audio<00:02:21.730> came<00:02:22.000> through<00:02:22.239> okay

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
the audio came through okay

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.100 
the audio came through okay
but<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.920> lifted<00:02:24.340> tick<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.940> about<00:02:27.060> one<00:02:28.110> no

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
but the lifted tick is about one no

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.289 
but the lifted tick is about one no
about<00:02:29.470> two<00:02:29.709> or<00:02:29.830> three<00:02:29.890> seconds<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:30.970> then<00:02:31.150> the

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
about two or three seconds and then the

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.020 
about two or three seconds and then the
oil<00:02:31.330> pumps<00:02:32.019> in<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.769> this<00:02:33.190> is<00:02:33.250> what<00:02:33.549> it<00:02:33.670> sounds

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
oil pumps in and this is what it sounds

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.110 
oil pumps in and this is what it sounds
like<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:36.849> me<00:02:36.879> this<00:02:37.150> is<00:02:37.269> a<00:02:37.330> normal<00:02:37.810> sounding

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
like to me this is a normal sounding

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.259 
like to me this is a normal sounding
1995<00:02:40.140> m3<00:02:41.220> with<00:02:42.220> one<00:02:42.430> hundred<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:42.760> forty<00:02:43.090> five

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.160 
1995 m3 with one hundred and forty five
thousand<00:02:43.840> miles<00:02:44.019> on<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.319> so<00:02:45.239> they<00:02:46.239> go<00:02:46.540> posted

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
thousand miles on it so they go posted

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.420 
thousand miles on it so they go posted
up<00:02:47.319> there<00:02:47.560> for<00:02:47.920> reference

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.899 

I'm<00:02:53.269> going<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.569> rip<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:53.780> up<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.079> little<00:02:54.200> bit<00:02:54.500> and

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
I'm going to rip it up a little bit and
