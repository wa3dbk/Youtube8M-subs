what they try to do is to keep animals
in<00:02:07.679> order<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.190> highlight<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.720> older

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
in order to highlight the the older

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.140 
in order to highlight the the older
muscle<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.280> can<00:02:11.430> see<00:02:11.610> where<00:02:11.760> all<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.000> meat

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
muscle so you can see where all the meat

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.720 
muscle so you can see where all the meat
is<00:02:12.390> exactly<00:02:13.170> exactly<00:02:13.620> but<00:02:14.100> even<00:02:14.310> here<00:02:14.519> where

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
is exactly exactly but even here where

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.490 
is exactly exactly but even here where
they've<00:02:14.880> sort<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.180> trimmed<00:02:15.570> in<00:02:15.750> there<00:02:16.019> yeah<00:02:16.290> to

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
they've sort of trimmed in there yeah to

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.729 
they've sort of trimmed in there yeah to
highlight<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.280> highlight<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:18.329> muscle<00:02:18.810> has

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
highlight to highlight that muscle has

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.660 
highlight to highlight that muscle has
got<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:19.980> be<00:02:20.040> high<00:02:20.160> value<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:21.030> see<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:23.100> these

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
got to be high value you see and these

that's<00:02:28.049> right<00:02:28.230> without<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.590> when<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:28.920> look

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
that's right without you when you look

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.710 
that's right without you when you look
at<00:02:29.190> this<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.940> can't<00:02:30.150> help<00:02:30.329> thinking<00:02:30.630> of

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
at this you you can't help thinking of

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.060 
at this you you can't help thinking of
lunch<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.140> know<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.340> helping<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:34.410> media

intensive producing animal so this is

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.340 
intensive producing animal so this is
about<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.280> most<00:02:41.459> technological<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.930> we<00:02:43.110> can

about the most technological that we can

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.350 
about the most technological that we can
get<00:02:43.530> not<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.070> most<00:02:44.250> technological<00:02:44.910> in<00:02:45.180> terms

get not the most technological in terms
of<00:02:45.540> technology<00:02:46.079> we<00:02:46.200> talk<00:02:46.380> about<00:02:46.650> selection

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
so what is the science behind the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.440 
so what is the science behind the
Belgian<00:02:58.290> blues<00:03:01.940> there<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> gene<00:03:03.420> that

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
Belgian blues there is a gene that

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
artificial vagina and from there we will

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.770 
artificial vagina and from there we will
process<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:53.070> semen<00:03:53.400> in<00:03:53.820> order<00:03:54.270> to<00:03:54.390> be<00:03:54.510> able<00:03:54.600> to

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
process the semen in order to be able to

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.050 
process the semen in order to be able to
process<00:03:55.130> artificial<00:03:56.130> insemination<00:03:56.370> on<00:03:56.880> the

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
sperm camp that is permanecer it's now

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.530 
sperm camp that is permanecer it's now
checking<00:04:14.250> let's<00:04:14.550> say<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:14.970> quality<00:04:15.360> of<00:04:15.420> the

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
sperm we have been collecting this

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.460 
sperm we have been collecting this
morning<00:04:18.060> Green<00:04:18.690> is<00:04:18.780> good<00:04:18.900> because<00:04:19.080> you<00:04:19.260> see

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
morning Green is good because you see

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.440 
morning Green is good because you see
that<00:04:19.680> they<00:04:19.799> are<00:04:19.890> very<00:04:20.100> very<00:04:20.220> mobile<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:21.270> they

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
that they are very very mobile and they

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.660 
that they are very very mobile and they
are<00:04:21.630> looking<00:04:21.810> forward<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.500> to<00:04:22.710> move<00:04:22.890> towards

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
are looking forward to to move towards

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.130 
are looking forward to to move towards
the<00:04:23.760> eggs<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.390> is<00:04:24.720> enough<00:04:24.960> especially

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
the eggs and it is enough especially

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.830 
the eggs and it is enough especially
muscley<00:04:25.920> sperm<00:04:26.280> don't<00:04:27.150> you<00:04:27.240> find<00:04:27.480> that<00:04:27.690> they

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
muscley sperm don't you find that they

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.140 
muscley sperm don't you find that they
are<00:04:28.070> well<00:04:29.070> they<00:04:29.190> look<00:04:29.340> impressive<00:04:29.790> to<00:04:29.910> me<00:04:30.000> but

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
are well they look impressive to me but

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.410
