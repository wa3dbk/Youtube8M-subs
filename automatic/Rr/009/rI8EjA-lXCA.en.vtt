enemy and yeah this will be the last

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.950 
enemy and yeah this will be the last
part<00:00:05.339> of<00:00:05.520> gimmick<00:00:05.879> especial<00:00:06.450> how<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.690> make

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
part of gimmick especial how to make

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.400 
part of gimmick especial how to make
Pakman<00:00:07.470> so<00:00:07.799> let's<00:00:08.460> do<00:00:08.670> it<00:00:08.820> create<00:00:09.690> object<00:00:10.200> and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
Pakman so let's do it create object and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.690 
Pakman so let's do it create object and
emit<00:00:11.179> object<00:00:12.179> enemy<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.290> said<00:00:14.190> its<00:00:14.340> prior<00:00:14.549> to

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
emit object enemy and said its prior to

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.970 
emit object enemy and said its prior to
spread<00:00:15.000> enemy<00:00:15.389> now<00:00:15.870> let's<00:00:16.289> go<00:00:16.410> ahead<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.590> make

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
spread enemy now let's go ahead and make

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.660 
spread enemy now let's go ahead and make
at<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.699> event<00:00:18.119> create<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:20.449> now<00:00:21.449> say<00:00:21.900> image

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
at that event create and now say image

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.650 
at that event create and now say image
speed<00:00:23.670> equals<00:00:24.390> 0<00:00:24.740> that's<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.820> sprite<00:00:27.539> is

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
speed equals 0 that's so the sprite is

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.030 
speed equals 0 that's so the sprite is
not<00:00:27.930> going<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.320> look<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.710> now<00:00:29.640> add<00:00:30.000> event<00:00:30.330> and

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
not going to look and now add event and

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.400 
not going to look and now add event and
let<00:00:32.040> me<00:00:32.160> check<00:00:32.340> here<00:00:32.730> oh<00:00:32.960> now<00:00:33.960> we're<00:00:34.020> going<00:00:34.320> to

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
let me check here oh now we're going to

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.860 
let me check here oh now we're going to
make<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.800> AI<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.790> it's<00:00:36.300> going<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.630> be<00:00:36.750> just

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
make the AI so it's going to be just

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.780 
make the AI so it's going to be just
simple<00:00:37.350> pathfinding<00:00:38.100> just<00:00:38.430> like<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.760> my

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
simple pathfinding just like in my

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.080 
simple pathfinding just like in my
artificial<00:00:39.360> intelligence<00:00:40.670> tutorial<00:00:41.670> so

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
artificial intelligence tutorial so

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.170 
artificial intelligence tutorial so
let's<00:00:43.079> do<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.770> let's<00:00:44.399> change<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.969> room

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
let's do that so let's change the room

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.340 
let's do that so let's change the room
to<00:00:45.390> grid<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.170> grid<00:00:46.770> equals<00:00:47.370> MP<00:00:48.320> grid<00:00:49.520> create<00:00:50.520> at

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
to grid so grid equals MP grid create at

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:02.650 
to grid so grid equals MP grid create at
zero<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:53.390> room<00:00:54.980> with<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:57.170> /<00:00:58.170> 32<00:00:58.789> now<00:00:59.789> room<00:01:00.800> hi

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
zero and room with the / 32 now room hi

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.620 
zero and room with the / 32 now room hi
/<00:01:03.660> 32<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.850> says<00:01:05.850> will<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.750> 30<00:01:06.990> 2032<00:01:07.619> oops<00:01:08.630> we

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
/ 32 and says will be 30 2032 oops we

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.770 
/ 32 and says will be 30 2032 oops we
got<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> score<00:01:10.650> alright<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.600> now

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
got here on the score alright so now

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.429 
got here on the score alright so now
let's<00:01:13.110> make<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.350> path<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> path<00:01:14.280> equals<00:01:14.970> path

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
let's make the path a path equals path

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.480 
let's make the path a path equals path
add<00:01:17.299> there<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.390> go<00:01:18.540> now<00:01:19.140> let's<00:01:19.680> add<00:01:19.979> what<00:01:20.340> we

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
want to ever avoid so MP grid add

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.179 
want to ever avoid so MP grid add
instances<00:01:26.390> to<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.570> grid<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.890> want<00:01:29.100> to

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
instances to the grid and we want to

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.800 
instances to the grid and we want to
avoid<00:01:29.490> object<00:01:30.060> wall<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:31.790> yes<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:33.240> something

want to start path at p2 and once yes
for<00:02:29.260> something<00:02:29.590> okay<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:30.340> this<00:02:30.580> is<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.850> AI<00:02:31.000> and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
for something okay so this is the AI and

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.790 
for something okay so this is the AI and
now<00:02:31.930> one<00:02:32.650> last<00:02:32.980> thing<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:34.030> will<00:02:34.269> be<00:02:34.480> when

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
now one last thing and that will be when

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.059 
now one last thing and that will be when
will<00:02:35.800> collide<00:02:36.310> with<00:02:37.319> when<00:02:38.319> enemy<00:02:38.890> will

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
will collide with when enemy will

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:49.520 
will collide with when enemy will
collide<00:02:39.280> with<00:02:39.519> object<00:02:39.850> player<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:44.430> if<00:02:46.470> object

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
power up so the ghost can kill him i

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:06.650 
power up so the ghost can kill him i
mean<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.070> enemy<00:03:00.340> then<00:03:01.030> show<00:03:01.480> message<00:03:04.799> you

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
restart like that and now if if the

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.539 
restart like that and now if if the
player<00:03:20.079> has<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.500> power<00:03:20.950> up<00:03:21.190> then<00:03:21.930> instance

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
player has a power up then instance

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:30.990 
player has a power up then instance
destroy<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:26.459> then<00:03:28.920> activate<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.340> response

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
so object control alarm alarm 0 equals

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.910 
so object control alarm alarm 0 equals
60<00:03:42.940> so<00:03:43.090> that's<00:03:43.299> two<00:03:43.510> seconds<00:03:44.079> until<00:03:44.260> next<00:03:44.650> one
