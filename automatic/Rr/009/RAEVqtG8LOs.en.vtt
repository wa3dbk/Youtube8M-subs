00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.229
 two 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:05.229
 two 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.740
 i 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:14.480
 this time I come with this video 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.340
 because I want to show you something that 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.920
 they always ask me every time I see 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.930
 my videos and this part of here back 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.940
 I will tell you how I did that 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.340
 thing that I do not have my necklaces 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.740
 as we would say this we would say as 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.660
 computer for the necklaces whenever 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.550
 see my videos any girl sometimes 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.550
 up to two three 10 and he asks me 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.040
 where did I get this to hang my 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.260
 necklaces or how I did it or where 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.690
 get the things where I bought it that 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.829
 they are always those questions and I 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.500
 I decided to make this video for 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.670
 show them and show them how I did it 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:56.030
 or how to arm or grab the idea to 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.010
 this idea because they are seeing here back 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.800
 As you can see, I'm going to show more 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.420
 with detail the whole thing but leave us 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.930
 I talk first this one 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.689
 and give the villa in paintings I think it 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.610
 call that web 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.310
 and it's one that you can also grab 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.259
 cellular is called paintings and I'm going to 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.049
 leave here how you write because if 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.180
 I can not pronounce it a little bit well 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.630
 this there are three ideas of all of what 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.289
 organization look more than anything and 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.229
 I saw that idea there and this and decided to 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.659
 put it together as I was saying there 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.580
 what I needed and all the things 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.619
 but they will teach it in detail 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.800
 because if he inherits it works very well 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.130
 I really liked how it was liked 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.649
 that I no longer have my chains piled up 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.569
 in one place to make balls that 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.090
 get tangled up because if it was for me 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.979
 bit exasperating every time I went to 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.679
 a drawer because I had them here in a 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.259
 drawer of my table every time I went to 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.179
 go out and had to look for a necklace it 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.100
 I waited for me because they were all 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.470
 entangled and last I did not wear 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.149
 No necklace when it came out for the same 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.880
 what do I say there to be 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.840
 developing and here that the rd and then 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.030
 I despair better 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.129
 I was going to say nothing of necklace or anything 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.239
 well friends then I want to share with 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.590
 you as I did that thing for 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.900
 accommodate the necklaces that has 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.019
 worked very well and I had removed 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.090
 of troubles has solved my life 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.549
 even a little bit in that form of 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.989
 organizing my necklaces and good friends is 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.060
 well they laughed at I have all my 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.010
 hanging necklaces like I tell you I do not have 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.129
 very many first of all I'm going to 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.310
 say where to get this piece from here 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:45.569
 is supposedly a piece for 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.720
 hang towels or things for the bathroom more 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:52.200
 that nothing to order your towels or 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.930
 anything you can put in 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.540
 this rod here and as you can see 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.450
 the design is very beautiful you have 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.920
 curvitas and it looks very nice I like it 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.200
 much the way it is designed and I 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.870
 as I did not put two clavitos or two 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.110
 screws as you can see is this here 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.030
 and I'm here I only put two because in 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.090
 actually the necklaces do not weigh as much 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.760
 then for me with two was enough 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.390
 I bought it at a store where 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:29.230
 do crafts or there are many things 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.379
 for the house as ornaments and things of 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.950
 bathroom that could be said most Latin 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:39.400
 called hobby lobby and it's a store 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.950
 similar to here with michaels these 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.540
 stores are here in usa girls in 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.269
 I really could not tell if in their 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.129
 countries do those stores I'm going to 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.190
 leave the link as you want in the box 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:54.099
 information for you to see the 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.799
 price of this piece see it for 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.609
 internet if you want to order them I think 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:03.190
 that michaels did not find this piece 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:04.900
 then to the safe I went to hobby 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.680
 lobby is that as it is called this 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.319
 I bought this piece for 10 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.909
 dollars created or less than 10 dollars not 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.269
 I'm sure it was clear in the middle of 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:19.120
 price cost regular price 20 dollars 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.280
 I went and it was all in the middle of pressure 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.280
 then I think it was not that expensive though 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.850
 these other pieces are 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.950
 for bathroom curtains is with these where 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.490
 you hang the cloth 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.530
 to cover the bathtub or the plastic that 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.350
 It is also put in the bathtub to cover 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.070
 that is not the water is itching 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:46.370
 little things, grab it in walmart and you can 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.220
 put your any hook for bathtub 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.250
 to hang the curtain well in total 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.580
 I think there are 12 in total and what else 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.250
 liked that these will be different 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.490
 these have all hooks as they can 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.950
 see they have two hooks to put a 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.520
 necklace on one side and put the other necklace 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.919
 on the other side it's more because if not 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.130
 I was raided if I put them as two 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.740
 together in a first hook when 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.740
 I went and these little hooks in GuamÃ¡ I thought 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.330
 will work because the photo where I saw 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.240
 this idea 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.490
 came this hook but only with 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.520
 a 1 below then this idea I liked 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.220
 much more because it is better that they come 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.520
 two hooks to come one down 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.050
 since I can not use all this I can 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.020
 be double as who he is and for two 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:42.290
 necklaces I recommend it very much if 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.420
 you can find this from all below 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.760
 to do is much better 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.640
 this does not get stuck in walmart for less 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.230
 of five dollars I imagine and as 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.810
 you can realize 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:59.950
 I hung two necklaces here 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:02.500
 two necklaces here also two here in 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.260
 some I have more than two hung as 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.410
 say two here and two back because I do not 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.480
 they entered he did not have more space but the 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.820
 most is one on this side and one of 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.520
 that side as you can see 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:21.500
 and also with some necklaces of this 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:23.840
 side that is the hook that brings this the 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.210
 rod all complete as you can see 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.080
 Also use it and I decided to put 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.479
 other necklaces here 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.580
 since I did not have room for more hooks 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:35.650
 and how can you see friends with all the 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.620
 necklaces that I have as I say no 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:44.139
 I have a lot I only had about 2 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:47.229
 4 6 8 10 12 14 and 6 and 8 20 22 24 as and 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:49.780
 I start with about 30 collars to stop and 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:51.849
 I think I have in total 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.770
 I do not have many compared to other 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:56.919
 girls who have more than 100 in 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.289
 I do not know I'm not from a lot of collar but 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:01.900
 what I have and I like with this is 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:04.360
 enough and good friends is then is 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.849
 as well as you see I do not know what else to tell them 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.090
 As I tell you, it 's just buying 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:11.949
 two pieces that I already told you what it is and 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.229
 I'm going to leave these links where they can to 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:16.210
 get these things that I have in the 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:18.250
 information box or if you want it 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:21.310
 order online or if you want to go to 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.169
 the store does not feel where you live 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:26.020
 be in these stores where I bought 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:28.389
 these things and good friends how could 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:31.120
 realize is super easy to do not 

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:32.979
 you spend a lot of money and they are simply 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.090
 you have to go find two little things 

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:36.370
 to arm 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.740
 the piece that just showed them good 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:42.529

 next video that will be coming soon 

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:53.040
 you have to improve 

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:54.450
 [Music]
