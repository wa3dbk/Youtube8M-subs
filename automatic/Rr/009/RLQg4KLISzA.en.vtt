when you put your two marabou tips

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.710 
when you put your two marabou tips

marabou forward just on your tips when

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.899 
marabou forward just on your tips when
that<00:01:38.079> it<00:01:38.200> gets<00:01:38.350> in<00:01:38.469> the<00:01:38.560> water<00:01:38.799> it'll<00:01:39.460> wiggle

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
that it gets in the water it'll wiggle

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.819 
that it gets in the water it'll wiggle
it<00:01:40.240> won't<00:01:40.479> it<00:01:40.719> won't<00:01:40.899> actually<00:01:41.140> flow<00:01:41.560> but

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
it won't it won't actually flow but

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:42.749 
it won't it won't actually flow but
it'll<00:01:42.009> actually<00:01:42.100> wiggle

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
it'll actually wiggle

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.030 
it'll actually wiggle
because<00:01:43.060> these<00:01:43.180> tips<00:01:43.479> are<00:01:43.630> pretty<00:01:43.659> stiff<00:01:44.170> so

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
because these tips are pretty stiff so

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.590 
because these tips are pretty stiff so
we're<00:01:45.189> going<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.340> do<00:01:45.549> is<00:01:45.759> tie<00:01:45.969> these<00:01:46.210> in<00:01:46.390> just

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
we're going to do is tie these in just

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.490 
we're going to do is tie these in just
like<00:01:46.780> this<00:01:47.280> time<00:01:48.280> in<00:01:48.750> about<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.930> length<00:01:50.140> lock

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
like this time in about the length lock

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.130 
like this time in about the length lock
so<00:01:51.070> make<00:01:51.219> sure<00:01:51.250> you<00:01:51.520> just<00:01:51.700> use<00:01:51.939> the<00:01:52.090> tips<00:01:52.360> and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
so make sure you just use the tips and

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.380 
so make sure you just use the tips and
tie<00:01:54.100> that<00:01:54.280> in<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.700> length<00:01:54.850> of<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.060> hook<00:01:57.390> and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
tie that in the length of the hook and

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.700 
tie that in the length of the hook and
what<00:01:58.509> you've<00:01:58.659> got<00:01:58.750> to<00:01:58.840> tie<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.079> in<00:01:59.229> just<00:01:59.469> trim

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
what you've got to tie it in just trim

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.060 
what you've got to tie it in just trim

and I'm going to cut it and I'm going to

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.290 
and I'm going to cut it and I'm going to
put<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:20.950> on<00:02:21.069> one<00:02:21.250> side<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.700> fly<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.120> make

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
put it on one side of the fly and make

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.800 
put it on one side of the fly and make
sure

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
you leave about a half an inch of black

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.160 
you leave about a half an inch of black
still<00:02:26.950> showing<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:28.360> when<00:02:28.480> we<00:02:28.569> tie<00:02:28.810> in<00:02:28.959> this

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
still showing so when we tie in this

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.470 
still showing so when we tie in this
we're<00:02:29.410> going<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.560> tie<00:02:29.800> in<00:02:29.860> one<00:02:30.790> white<00:02:31.060> on<00:02:31.300> one

side and we'll do the exact same for the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.690 
side and we'll do the exact same for the
second<00:02:35.319> side<00:02:35.470> make<00:02:35.770> sure<00:02:35.800> that<00:02:36.190> white<00:02:36.430> leaves

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
second side make sure that white leaves

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.850 
second side make sure that white leaves
about<00:02:36.970> half<00:02:37.300> of<00:02:37.480> that<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:38.290> know<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.410> good<00:02:38.650> half

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
about half of that you know a good half

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.680 
about half of that you know a good half
an<00:02:39.040> inch<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:39.550> black<00:02:39.819> still<00:02:40.150> showing<00:02:40.390> and

an inch of that black still showing and

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.320 
an inch of that black still showing and
do<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.930> same<00:02:41.110> on<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.620> other<00:02:41.650> side<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:43.120> now<00:02:43.239> I'm

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
do the same on the other side so now I'm

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.490 
do the same on the other side so now I'm
going<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.540> do<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.810> same<00:02:43.989> on<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.290> other<00:02:44.319> side

going to do the same on the other side

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.890 
going to do the same on the other side
as<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:44.950> mentioned<00:02:45.310> earlier<00:02:45.610> measure<00:02:46.510> them<00:02:46.780> up

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
as I mentioned earlier measure them up

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.740 
as I mentioned earlier measure them up
and<00:02:47.140> put<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.830> white<00:02:48.209> narrow<00:02:49.209> blue<00:02:49.420> on<00:02:49.690> that

and put the white narrow blue on that

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.160 
and put the white narrow blue on that
side<00:02:50.140> now<00:02:50.440> when<00:02:51.250> this<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:51.550> in<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.760> water

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
side now when this is in the water

side now when this is in the water
you're<00:02:53.170> going<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.380> see<00:02:53.530> how<00:02:53.590> this<00:02:53.769> flows<00:02:54.099> what

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
you're going to see how this flows what

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.020 
you're going to see how this flows what
it's<00:02:55.209> going<00:02:55.330> to<00:02:55.420> do<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:56.860> form<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.549> compact

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
accentuate it and you get that block

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.210 
accentuate it and you get that block
away<00:03:16.750> Mirabal<00:03:17.260> working<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.860> looks<00:03:18.069> exactly

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
away Mirabal working it looks exactly

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.830 
away Mirabal working it looks exactly
like<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.790> tail<00:03:19.000> you<00:03:19.180> wait<00:03:19.299> till<00:03:19.450> you<00:03:19.540> see<00:03:19.690> in<00:03:19.750> the

like a tail you wait till you see in the

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.620 
like a tail you wait till you see in the
water<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:21.190> let's<00:03:21.489> wrap<00:03:21.849> this<00:03:22.120> forward<00:03:22.450> and

tail<00:04:04.030> on<00:04:04.269> it<00:04:04.299> now<00:04:05.109> we're<00:04:05.319> going<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.470> create<00:04:05.650> the

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
tail on it now we're going to create the

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.550 
tail on it now we're going to create the
body<00:04:06.600> now<00:04:07.600> we're<00:04:07.780> going<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:07.959> start<00:04:08.200> our<00:04:08.319> body

body now we're going to start our body
and<00:04:08.769> now<00:04:08.889> wrapping<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.459> body<00:04:09.670> is<00:04:09.819> very<00:04:09.880> simple

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
and now wrapping the body is very simple

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.059 
and now wrapping the body is very simple
it's<00:04:10.569> just<00:04:10.750> wrapping<00:04:11.170> and<00:04:11.290> rabbit<00:04:11.620> forward

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
it's just wrapping and rabbit forward

it's just wrapping and rabbit forward
the<00:04:12.790> key<00:04:13.060> here<00:04:13.540> is<00:04:13.569> making<00:04:13.959> sure<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:14.380> have<00:04:14.530> the

the key here is making sure you have the

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.770 
the key here is making sure you have the
right<00:04:14.859> flow<00:04:15.250> of<00:04:15.609> rabbit<00:04:16.060> so<00:04:16.450> see<00:04:16.630> how<00:04:16.720> the

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
right flow of rabbit so see how the

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.710 
right flow of rabbit so see how the
rabbit<00:04:17.260> is<00:04:18.010> pulling<00:04:18.519> back<00:04:18.549> this<00:04:18.970> way<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.479> real

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
rabbit is pulling back this way the real

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.740 
rabbit is pulling back this way the real
motion<00:04:20.049> of<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.560> rabbit<00:04:20.919> points<00:04:21.489> back<00:04:21.760> so<00:04:22.660> I'm

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
motion of the rabbit points back so I'm

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.969 
motion of the rabbit points back so I'm
going<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:22.960> tie<00:04:23.139> it<00:04:23.200> in<00:04:23.320> this<00:04:23.410> way<00:04:23.590> I'm<00:04:23.770> going<00:04:23.830> to

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
going to tie it in this way I'm going to

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.779 
going to tie it in this way I'm going to
form<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.690> just<00:04:25.690> a<00:04:25.810> little<00:04:26.050> bit<00:04:26.169> of<00:04:26.289> that
