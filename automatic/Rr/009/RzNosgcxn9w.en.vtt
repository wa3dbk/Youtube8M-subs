some I was watching a video the other
day<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.559> something<00:00:59.250> someone<00:00:59.730> said<00:01:00.180> that

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
day and it's something someone said that

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.750 
day and it's something someone said that
this<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.590> resistant<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.520> TNT<00:01:03.530> which<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:05.400> for

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
this is resistant to TNT which just for

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.980 
this is resistant to TNT which just for
your<00:01:05.939> information<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.810> very<00:01:07.530> much<00:01:07.890> not

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
your information is very much not

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.539 
your information is very much not
resistant<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.409> TNT<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:13.010> creepers<00:01:14.010> well<00:01:14.460> I'm

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
resistant to TNT or creepers well I'm

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.429 
resistant to TNT or creepers well I'm
not<00:01:14.640> sure<00:01:14.700> about<00:01:14.970> creepers<00:01:15.509> but<00:01:15.810> definitely

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
not sure about creepers but definitely

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:25.039 
not sure about creepers but definitely
not<00:01:16.650> TNT<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.400> make<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:22.549> and<00:01:24.049> the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
not TNT so you can make this and the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.539 
not TNT so you can make this and the
blue<00:01:25.259> wool<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:27.960> example<00:01:29.479> you<00:01:30.479> take<00:01:30.530> this

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
blue wool so for example you take this

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:40.520 
blue wool so for example you take this
and<00:01:32.750> that<00:01:34.130> you<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.509> blue<00:01:38.479> that<00:01:39.530> personally

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
and that you have blue that personally

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.060 
and that you have blue that personally

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
to me looks bit better but I'm not

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.350 
to me looks bit better but I'm not
really<00:01:44.610> fond<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.180> either<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.600> them
