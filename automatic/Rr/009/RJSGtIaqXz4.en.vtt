00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
processes it's quite dry from so it's

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.100 
processes it's quite dry from so it's
been<00:01:39.340> quite<00:01:39.550> a<00:01:39.580> warm<00:01:39.850> days<00:01:40.150> I<00:01:40.180> actually<00:01:40.750> dig

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
been quite a warm days I actually dig

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.320 
been quite a warm days I actually dig
away<00:01:41.229> right<00:01:41.560> down<00:01:41.800> that<00:01:42.250> all<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.880> way<00:01:43.000> down<00:01:43.210> to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
away right down that all the way down to

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.180 
away right down that all the way down to
the<00:01:43.390> bottom<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:46.409> there<00:01:47.409> you<00:01:47.470> go<00:01:47.530> that's<00:01:48.040> a

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
the bottom but there you go that's a

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.760 
the bottom but there you go that's a
nice<00:01:48.370> little<00:01:48.580> sized<00:01:48.909> baby<00:01:49.450> carrot<00:01:52.080> take<00:01:53.080> that

nice little sized baby carrot take that

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.330 
nice little sized baby carrot take that
one<00:01:53.950> too<00:01:55.830> they<00:01:56.830> will<00:01:57.010> actually<00:01:57.220> grow<00:01:59.340> larger

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
one too they will actually grow larger

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.969 
one too they will actually grow larger
in<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.549> bed<00:02:00.870> now<00:02:01.870> this<00:02:01.990> is<00:02:02.049> a<00:02:02.229> comparison<00:02:02.950> to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
in the bed now this is a comparison to

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.280 
in the bed now this is a comparison to
these<00:02:03.610> potted<00:02:03.970> coats<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:04.750> we've<00:02:04.900> grown

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
these potted coats that we've grown

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.530 
these potted coats that we've grown
quite<00:02:05.590> some<00:02:05.830> time<00:02:06.070> now<00:02:06.340> we<00:02:07.120> never<00:02:07.299> bonds

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
quite some time now we never bonds

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.910 
quite some time now we never bonds
within<00:02:07.900> these<00:02:08.140> out<00:02:08.379> so<00:02:08.409> they're<00:02:08.709> growing

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
within these out so they're growing

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.670 
within these out so they're growing
quite<00:02:09.220> compact<00:02:09.819> we<00:02:10.390> pull<00:02:10.629> foliage<00:02:11.230> but<00:02:11.260> here

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
quite compact we pull foliage but here

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.119 
quite compact we pull foliage but here
you<00:02:11.739> can<00:02:11.799> see<00:02:12.099> just<00:02:12.310> how<00:02:12.849> densely<00:02:14.129> growing

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
you can see just how densely growing

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.979 
you can see just how densely growing
these<00:02:15.310> are<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:16.030> we've<00:02:16.180> just<00:02:16.360> been<00:02:16.510> gradually

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
these are and we've just been gradually

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.720 
these are and we've just been gradually
thin<00:02:17.170> these<00:02:17.349> out<00:02:17.620> harvesting<00:02:18.040> as<00:02:18.340> we<00:02:18.519> need<00:02:18.700> to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
thin these out harvesting as we need to

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.059 
thin these out harvesting as we need to
and<00:02:19.659> because<00:02:19.959> they're<00:02:20.139> so<00:02:20.379> densely<00:02:20.829> packed

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
and because they're so densely packed

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.940 
and because they're so densely packed
and<00:02:21.340> competing<00:02:21.909> we<00:02:22.569> are<00:02:22.749> only<00:02:22.900> getting

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
and competing we are only getting

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.160 
and competing we are only getting
ones<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:27.069> gives<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.400> an<00:02:27.580> idea<00:02:28.080> there's<00:02:29.080> a

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
ones that it gives you an idea there's a

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.339 
ones that it gives you an idea there's a
size<00:02:29.379> comparison<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:31.540> those<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:31.959> are<00:02:32.080> going

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
size comparison to those that are going

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.250 
size comparison to those that are going
out<00:02:32.680> in<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.010> garden<00:02:33.160> bed<00:02:33.459> that<00:02:33.580> we<00:02:33.670> saw<00:02:33.849> before

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
out in the garden bed that we saw before

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.420 
out in the garden bed that we saw before
so<00:02:35.260> as<00:02:35.500> we<00:02:35.620> need<00:02:35.769> the<00:02:35.890> carrots<00:02:36.190> which<00:02:36.310> is

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
so as we need the carrots which is

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.970 
so as we need the carrots which is
periodically<00:02:37.019> something<00:02:38.019> through<00:02:38.260> pull<00:02:38.769> some

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
periodically something through pull some

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.650 
periodically something through pull some
out<00:02:39.129> of<00:02:39.340> course<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:39.700> do<00:02:39.819> get<00:02:40.000> some<00:02:40.180> real<00:02:40.360> tiny

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
out of course you do get some real tiny

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.040 
out of course you do get some real tiny
ones<00:02:40.840> in<00:02:41.200> here<00:02:41.230> but<00:02:41.680> that's<00:02:41.890> no<00:02:42.099> problem<00:02:42.370> kids

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
ones in here but that's no problem kids

one<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.129> the<00:02:54.190> tricks<00:02:54.430> with<00:02:54.879> the<00:02:54.910> carrots<00:02:55.690> is<00:02:55.930> to

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
one of the tricks with the carrots is to

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.539 
one of the tricks with the carrots is to
make<00:02:56.260> sure<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.739> you<00:02:56.830> take<00:02:57.010> these<00:02:57.250> top

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
make sure that you take these top

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.390 
make sure that you take these top
straight<00:02:57.910> off<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:58.390> just<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.690> first<00:02:58.930> round<00:02:59.400> take

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
straight off so just a first round take

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.610 
straight off so just a first round take
it<00:03:00.549> off<00:03:00.670> these<00:03:01.630> can<00:03:01.810> go<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.049> chops<00:03:02.260> or<00:03:02.440> into

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
it off these can go the chops or into

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.920 
it off these can go the chops or into
the<00:03:02.650> compost<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.790> your<00:03:03.970> carrot<00:03:04.299> it's<00:03:04.599> ready<00:03:04.780> to

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
go don't forget it is very important to

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:08.789 
go don't forget it is very important to
this<00:03:07.510> otherwise<00:03:07.780> you'll<00:03:08.079> just<00:03:08.110> end<00:03:08.440> up<00:03:08.590> with

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
this otherwise you'll just end up with

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.770 
this otherwise you'll just end up with
wilted<00:03:09.190> carrots<00:03:09.549> that<00:03:09.610> are<00:03:09.730> all<00:03:09.849> bendy<00:03:10.060> as<00:03:10.599> you
