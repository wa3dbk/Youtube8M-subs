00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.749 

so<00:00:04.049> how<00:00:04.170> can<00:00:04.230> we<00:00:04.440> use<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.710> karyogram<00:00:05.100> to

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
so how can we use the karyogram to

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.509 
so how can we use the karyogram to
locate<00:00:06.149> the<00:00:06.330> genes<00:00:06.600> if<00:00:07.019> the<00:00:07.740> karyogram<00:00:08.160> is

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
locate the genes if the karyogram is

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.549 
locate the genes if the karyogram is
viewed<00:00:08.790> at<00:00:08.940> high<00:00:09.330> power<00:00:09.660> under<00:00:10.469> the

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
viewed at high power under the

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.980 
viewed at high power under the
microscope<00:00:11.009> a<00:00:11.430> series<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.269> light<00:00:12.510> and<00:00:12.809> dark

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
microscope a series of light and dark

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.290 
microscope a series of light and dark
bands<00:00:13.290> can<00:00:13.620> be<00:00:13.680> seen<00:00:14.070> which<00:00:14.550> form<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.910> unique

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.300 
bands can be seen which form a unique

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.710 
bands can be seen which form a unique
pattern<00:00:15.630> on<00:00:15.900> each<00:00:16.049> chromosome<00:00:17.179> these<00:00:18.179> bands

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
pattern on each chromosome these bands

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.630 
pattern on each chromosome these bands
are<00:00:18.779> just<00:00:18.990> staining<00:00:19.500> patterns<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.220> they<00:00:20.580> do

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
are just staining patterns and they do

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.200 
are just staining patterns and they do
not<00:00:20.940> represent<00:00:21.390> individual<00:00:22.230> genes<00:00:22.699> even<00:00:23.699> so

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
not represent individual genes even so

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.019 
not represent individual genes even so
they<00:00:24.390> do<00:00:24.449> allow<00:00:24.930> scientists<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.890> locate<00:00:26.699> and

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
they do allow scientists to locate and

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.540 
they do allow scientists to locate and
pinpoint<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.690> positions<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.380> genes<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.949> they

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
pinpoint the positions of genes and they

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.080 
pinpoint the positions of genes and they
do<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.029> via<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.600> numbering<00:00:31.020> system<00:00:32.090> through

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
do so via a numbering system through

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.540 
do so via a numbering system through
genetic<00:00:33.570> research<00:00:34.220> scientists<00:00:35.220> have<00:00:35.370> now

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
genetic research scientists have now

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.479 
genetic research scientists have now
formed<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.059> cytogenetic<00:00:37.050> map<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.649> can<00:00:38.220> now

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
formed a cytogenetic map and can now

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.510 
formed a cytogenetic map and can now
locate<00:00:38.750> many<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.989> our<00:00:40.200> important<00:00:40.770> genes<00:00:41.130> and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
locate many of our important genes and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.830 
locate many of our important genes and
also<00:00:42.000> those<00:00:42.750> implicated<00:00:43.380> in<00:00:43.710> disease<00:00:44.570> so<00:00:45.570> how

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
also those implicated in disease so how

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.220 
also those implicated in disease so how
is<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.140> site<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.440> genetic<00:00:47.010> map<00:00:47.250> formed

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
is the site of genetic map formed

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.750 
is the site of genetic map formed
scientists<00:00:49.230> use<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> standardized<00:00:50.219> mapping

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
scientists use a standardized mapping

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.180 
scientists use a standardized mapping
system<00:00:51.239> called<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> international<00:00:52.739> system

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
system called the international system

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.229 
system called the international system
for<00:00:53.239> cytogenetic<00:00:54.239> nomenclature<00:00:55.100> is<00:00:56.100> CN<00:00:56.489> so

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
for cytogenetic nomenclature is CN so

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.779 
for cytogenetic nomenclature is CN so
they<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.539> pinpoint<00:00:57.840> genes<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.160> consistent

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
they can pinpoint genes in a consistent

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.830 
they can pinpoint genes in a consistent
manner<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:02.489> chromosomes<00:01:03.000> are<00:01:03.210> aligned<00:01:03.539> to

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
manner the chromosomes are aligned to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.170 
manner the chromosomes are aligned to
form<00:01:04.110> an<00:01:04.259> ideogram<00:01:04.589> with<00:01:05.460> their<00:01:05.610> short<00:01:05.789> arms

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
form an ideogram with their short arms

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.300 
form an ideogram with their short arms
orientated<00:01:06.930> upwards<00:01:07.529> and<00:01:07.829> along<00:01:08.130> arm

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
orientated upwards and along arm

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.590 
orientated upwards and along arm
downwards<00:01:10.189> the<00:01:11.189> arms<00:01:11.490> are<00:01:11.639> then<00:01:11.789> divided<00:01:12.179> into

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
downwards the arms are then divided into

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.169 
downwards the arms are then divided into
regions<00:01:12.779> with<00:01:13.679> region<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:14.399> next<00:01:14.969> to<00:01:15.149> the

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
regions with region one next to the

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.569 
regions with region one next to the
centromere<00:01:15.929> and<00:01:16.109> the<00:01:16.560> next<00:01:16.859> region<00:01:17.100> number

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
centromere and the next region number

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:20.989 
centromere and the next region number
two<00:01:17.819> and<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.740> these<00:01:19.740> regions<00:01:20.279> are<00:01:20.429> dictated

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:20.999 
two and so on these regions are dictated

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:24.080 
two and so on these regions are dictated
by<00:01:21.029> the<00:01:21.119> position<00:01:21.539> of<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.079> staining<00:01:22.439> bands<00:01:23.219> at

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
by the position of the staining bands at

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.719 
by the position of the staining bands at
a<00:01:24.299> high<00:01:24.539> magnification<00:01:24.959> as<00:01:25.920> additional<00:01:26.490> bands

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
a high magnification as additional bands

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.059 
a high magnification as additional bands
are<00:01:26.999> seen<00:01:27.270> each<00:01:27.719> region<00:01:28.469> is<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:28.740> divided

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
are seen each region is then divided

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:32.749 
are seen each region is then divided
into<00:01:29.490> further<00:01:29.729> bands<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.539> sub<00:01:30.840> bands<00:01:31.759> these

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
into further bands and sub bands these

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.809 
into further bands and sub bands these
are<00:01:32.999> numbered<00:01:33.329> by<00:01:33.479> adding<00:01:33.779> a<00:01:33.869> digit<00:01:34.349> eg<00:01:35.009> region

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
are numbered by adding a digit eg region

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.959 
are numbered by adding a digit eg region
