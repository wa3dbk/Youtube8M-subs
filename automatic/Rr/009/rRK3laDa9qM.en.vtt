for<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.090> idea<00:00:39.420> I'm<00:00:39.629> pretty<00:00:40.050> sure<00:00:40.290> I'm<00:00:40.410> not

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
for this idea I'm pretty sure I'm not

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.889 
for this idea I'm pretty sure I'm not
alone<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.629> assassin's<00:00:42.629> creed's

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
gameplay would make an excellent base

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.310 
gameplay would make an excellent base
for<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.610> legend<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.940> zelda<00:00:45.210> game<00:00:45.390> though<00:00:46.140> it's

for a legend of zelda game though it's

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.840 
for a legend of zelda game though it's
too<00:00:46.500> different<00:00:46.860> from<00:00:46.950> traditional<00:00:47.160> zelda

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850

titles to make it a game in the main
series<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.890> would<00:00:50.190> work<00:00:50.219> perfectly<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
series it would work perfectly for a

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.420 
series it would work perfectly for a
crossover<00:00:51.680> not<00:00:52.680> only<00:00:52.890> would<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.219> be<00:00:53.309> awesome

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
crossover not only would it be awesome

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.700

to play as a hooded assassin a link but

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.990 
to play as a hooded assassin a link but
like<00:00:55.920> Hyrule<00:00:56.280> warriors<00:00:56.309> there<00:00:56.850> could<00:00:56.969> be

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
like Hyrule warriors there could be

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.869 
like Hyrule warriors there could be
multiple<00:00:57.180> playable<00:00:57.780> characters<00:00:58.219> chic<00:00:59.219> EMPA

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
awesome assassins and I would definitely

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.990 
awesome assassins and I would definitely
pay<00:01:04.049> sixty<00:01:04.439> dollars<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.830> play<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.220> unless

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
pay sixty dollars to play that unless

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.609 
pay sixty dollars to play that unless
the<00:01:06.060> game<00:01:06.390> turned<00:01:06.659> out<00:01:06.869> like<00:01:07.049> Assassin's

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the game turned out like Assassin's

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.609

Creed unity then pretend I never said
this<00:01:10.710> was<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> good<00:01:11.070> idea<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:16.619> Elder<00:01:16.920> Scrolls

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
this was a good idea the Elder Scrolls

this was a good idea the Elder Scrolls
three<00:01:18.570> words<00:01:19.220> open-world<00:01:20.220> Hyrule<00:01:20.880> from<00:01:21.869> what

it<00:01:22.110> looks<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.380> right<00:01:22.439> now<00:01:22.860> Zelda<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.729> Wii<00:01:23.850> U

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
it looks like right now Zelda for Wii U

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.550 
it looks like right now Zelda for Wii U
might<00:01:24.240> end<00:01:24.420> up<00:01:24.509> being<00:01:24.780> pretty<00:01:24.960> close<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.470> this

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
might end up being pretty close to this

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.890 
might end up being pretty close to this
idea<00:01:25.770> The<00:01:26.700> Legend<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.090> Zelda<00:01:27.299> being<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.659> very

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
idea The Legend of Zelda being a very

idea The Legend of Zelda being a very
objective<00:01:28.470> based<00:01:28.680> series<00:01:29.100> would<00:01:29.280> fit<00:01:29.460> right

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
objective based series would fit right

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.429 
objective based series would fit right
in<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.060> Elder<00:01:30.390> Scrolls<00:01:30.420> open<00:01:31.200> world

version of The Legend of Zelda but I do

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.550

like<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.520> Zelda<00:01:38.700> series<00:01:38.850> more<00:01:39.560> sorry

Bethesda<00:01:41.189> although<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> chances<00:01:42.479> of

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
Bethesda although the chances of

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.510 
Bethesda although the chances of
Nintendo<00:01:43.020> doing<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.409> crossover<00:01:43.860> with<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> mature

Nintendo doing a crossover with a mature
rated<00:01:44.670> RPG<00:01:45.360> series<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.990> very<00:01:46.350> slim<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.009> think

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
rated RPG series is very slim I think

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.130 
rated RPG series is very slim I think
the<00:01:47.670> format<00:01:48.030> would<00:01:48.149> work<00:01:48.390> really<00:01:48.600> well<00:01:48.750> for<00:01:48.930> a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
the format would work really well for a
