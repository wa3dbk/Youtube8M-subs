00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.420
 and what's new youtube community 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.370
 I am alex when my information of 6-4 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.170
 this video may be a bit short and without 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.940
 so much emphasis but it's because I already got a 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.769
 video today a while ago and I have some 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.420
 homework so I 'm a little short of 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.220
 time that we still make a good video 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.989
 because not now do we go with the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.210
 analysis first of all will not give in 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:22.800
 manufacturer of no weapon this time 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.289
 because all weapons have the same 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.419
 Manufacturer description lining under 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.249
 unidentified so again the point 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.859
 why repeat this with each weapon 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:34.290
 even so let's go with the paulson list 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.240
 pistol was rob the semiautomatic to the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.520
 charge can become a mini 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.160
 Very short range shotgun capacity 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.500
 of tape and it's gunshot suppressor 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.910
 promises to fully automatic shoots 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.100
 bursts of shots to an incredible 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.780
 speed killing very quickly the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.570
 enemies especially in short 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.150
 distances tape capacity 48 shots 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.440
 if you want the totally dangerous weapon 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.270
 short distance that is capable of 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.800
 incinerate enemies and for small 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.960
 projectiles that can bounce against 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.840
 harder objects that wash capacity 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.759
 of tape five shots triple light rifle 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.740
 de mira promises here shoots bursts of 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.780
 short medium distance 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.340
 in the distance is not able to incinerate 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.009
 enemies and change their shooting mode 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.500
 when you have your tape capacity 36 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.659
 shots rifle binary extreme weapon 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.520
 long distances too powerful 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.939
 able to disintegrate enemies of a single 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.710
 threw 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.680
 He sank his head for the enemies more 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.289
 hard tape capacity two shots cannon 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.479
 incinerator explosive weapon promises anti 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.159
 vehicular and anti infantry serves 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.830
 perfectly to disintegrate 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.630
 enemies and also this loose explosion 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.210
 small pumps to make a radius of 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.850
 highest capacity explosion of tape a 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.440
 shot grenade grenade was robbed 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.360
 the pulse absorber that in addition to 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.729
 cause some damage and explode when 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.740
 it runs out of strength the objects go off by 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.020
 a few moments but good these have been 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.789
 all the weapons of which there are few 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.069
 I do not know but we consider that many weapons 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.090
 more than 30 wit 4 what is done to me 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:58.679
 more than enough 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.970
 another small thing that I want to clarify is 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.890
 that a new image of the 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.229
 remake of val skirt where we can see 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.880
 in a matisse on the multiplayer map what 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.950
 indicating that this vehicle exists 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.460
 can be used during working without 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.470
 finish 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.630
 equally maybe but I can know in 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.280
 a specific variant or playlist 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.940
 but still it 's good to give details to 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.770
 respect 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.060
 finally before finishing it was revealed 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.490
 a new multiplayer map called 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.050
 complex or complex in Spanish and maps 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.640
 they locate human facilities been a 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.470
 small air to the style that I had 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.540
 halo reach highlands in terms of 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.890
 human structures is a perfect map 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.500
 for games to capture the flag 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.660
 schleyer or the host model 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.610
 flow but good that has been all 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.870
 community if you liked this video handy 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.300
 above subscribe for more information 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.700
 well and we'll see each other until the next 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.700
 they spent 343 out 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.210
 goals
