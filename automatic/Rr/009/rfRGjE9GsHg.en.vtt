around here in the mid panels really

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.720 
around here in the mid panels really
where<00:02:59.190> it's<00:02:59.430> it<00:03:00.120> starts<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.540> get<00:03:00.629> tight<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.410> I

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
where it's it starts to get tight so I

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.309 
where it's it starts to get tight so I
mean<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.940> could<00:03:03.299> I<00:03:03.420> guess<00:03:03.629> I<00:03:03.750> can<00:03:03.930> loosen<00:03:04.079> these

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319
