to<00:01:40.480> build<00:01:40.750> that<00:01:40.840> base<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:41.410> you<00:01:41.470> want<00:01:41.650> to<00:01:41.770> add

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
to build that base and you want to add

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.340 
to build that base and you want to add
in<00:01:42.100> some<00:01:42.280> higher<00:01:42.580> intensity<00:01:43.350> interval

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
in some higher intensity interval

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.790 
in some higher intensity interval
training<00:01:44.550> runs<00:01:45.550> into<00:01:46.150> your<00:01:46.330> and<00:01:46.690> regime<00:01:47.110> so<00:01:47.770> a

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
training runs into your and regime so a

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.399 
training runs into your and regime so a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
typical kind of interval training

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.090 
typical kind of interval training
protocol<00:01:52.230> sincere<00:01:53.230> in<00:01:53.380> that<00:01:53.409> again<00:01:53.830> you<00:01:53.950> want

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
protocol sincere in that again you want

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.190 
protocol sincere in that again you want
to<00:01:54.190> look<00:01:54.340> at<00:01:54.430> sport<00:01:54.970> and<00:01:55.180> train<00:01:55.450> compartment

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.110 
to look at sport and train compartment
there's<00:01:56.860> a<00:01:56.920> change<00:01:57.250> of<00:01:57.400> pace<00:01:57.610> and<00:01:57.850> soccer

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
there's a change of pace and soccer

you're throwing a soccer game he's gonna

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.360 
you're throwing a soccer game he's gonna
have<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.360> tough<00:02:35.390> time<00:02:35.770> with<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.950> change<00:02:37.190> of

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
pace and that's that's something you

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.809 
pace and that's that's something you
want<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.810> attend<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.319> so<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.100> can<00:02:40.459> start<00:02:40.700> off

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
want to attend to so you can start off

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.130 
want to attend to so you can start off
with<00:02:41.000> those<00:02:41.120> kind<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.390> five<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:42.050> know

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
with those kind of five you know

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.259 
with those kind of five you know
five-second<00:02:42.769> accelerations<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.610> really

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
five-second accelerations and really

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.610 
five-second accelerations and really
there's<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:44.810> many<00:02:44.989> different<00:02:45.410> combinations

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
there's so many different combinations

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.710 
there's so many different combinations
of<00:02:46.160> intervals<00:02:46.519> that's<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:47.150> mean<00:02:47.330> you<00:02:47.540> really

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
of intervals that's I mean you really

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.190 
of intervals that's I mean you really
can't<00:02:48.050> go<00:02:48.170> wrong<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:50.090> can<00:02:50.300> then<00:02:50.569> you<00:02:51.080> know

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
can't go wrong you can then you know

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.350 
can't go wrong you can then you know
build<00:02:51.769> on<00:02:52.040> that<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:52.519> you<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.790> goulds<00:02:53.030> feel<00:02:53.269> to

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
build on that so you the goulds feel to

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.880 
build on that so you the goulds feel to
run<00:02:53.510> faster<00:02:54.049> for<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.260> longer<00:02:54.530> period<00:02:54.650> of<00:02:54.799> time

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
run faster for a longer period of time

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.130 
run faster for a longer period of time
so<00:02:55.340> for<00:02:55.459> instance<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:56.000> know<00:02:56.140> five-second

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
so for instance you know five-second

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.410 
so for instance you know five-second
accelerations<00:02:57.709> maybe<00:02:58.010> one<00:02:58.220> with<00:02:58.400> 20<00:02:58.940> seconds

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
accelerations maybe one with 20 seconds

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.050 
accelerations maybe one with 20 seconds
with<00:02:59.569> 30<00:02:59.840> second<00:03:00.790> acceleration<00:03:01.790> you<00:03:01.970> know

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
with 30 second acceleration you know

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.229 
with 30 second acceleration you know
close<00:03:03.049> to<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.260> sprinting<00:03:03.769> pace<00:03:04.069> and<00:03:04.370> then

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
close to a sprinting pace and then

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.360 
close to a sprinting pace and then
recovering<00:03:05.840> for<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.530> know<00:03:06.650> one<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.190> half

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
recovering for you know one and a half

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.979 
recovering for you know one and a half
to<00:03:07.610> two<00:03:07.819> minutes<00:03:08.120> depending<00:03:08.540> again<00:03:08.690> on<00:03:08.870> how

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
to two minutes depending again on how

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.520 
to two minutes depending again on how
your<00:03:09.380> fitness<00:03:09.709> level<00:03:09.950> is<00:03:10.040> improving<00:03:10.519> in

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
your fitness level is improving in

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.650 
your fitness level is improving in
general<00:03:12.530> as<00:03:12.739> you<00:03:13.160> get<00:03:13.549> fitter<00:03:13.880> you<00:03:14.209> can

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
general as you get fitter you can

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.830 
general as you get fitter you can
lengthen<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.350> work<00:03:16.280> interval<00:03:16.819> and<00:03:17.060> shorten

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
lengthen the work interval and shorten

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.660 
lengthen the work interval and shorten
the<00:03:17.989> recovery<00:03:18.470> you<00:03:18.530> know<00:03:18.709> okay<00:03:19.459> or<00:03:19.640> just

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
the recovery you know okay or just

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.990 
the recovery you know okay or just
really<00:03:19.970> do<00:03:20.120> one<00:03:20.329> at<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.510> time<00:03:20.720> so<00:03:21.709> start<00:03:22.640> off<00:03:22.730> for

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
really do one at a time so start off for

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.520 
really do one at a time so start off for
instance<00:03:23.299> by<00:03:23.450> working<00:03:23.810> a<00:03:24.019> little<00:03:24.109> bit<00:03:24.320> longer

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
instance by working a little bit longer

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.670

so<00:03:24.890> maybe<00:03:25.070> thirty<00:03:25.489> Seconds<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:27.470> minute

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
so maybe thirty Seconds to minute

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.800 
so maybe thirty Seconds to minute
recovery<00:03:28.070> repeat<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.120> for<00:03:29.329> about<00:03:29.390> 20

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
recovery repeat that for about 20

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.229 
recovery repeat that for about 20
minutes<00:03:29.959> then<00:03:30.829> as<00:03:31.130> we<00:03:31.280> get<00:03:31.370> fitter<00:03:31.670> you<00:03:31.790> can<00:03:32.150> go

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
minutes then as we get fitter you can go

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.270 
minutes then as we get fitter you can go
30<00:03:32.660> seconds<00:03:33.200> one<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:33.739> a<00:03:33.799> half<00:03:33.980> minute

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
30 seconds one and a half minute

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.060 
30 seconds one and a half minute
recovery<00:03:34.700> again<00:03:35.570> for<00:03:35.750> 20<00:03:35.989> minutes<00:03:36.290> as<00:03:36.769> you<00:03:36.950> get

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
recovery again for 20 minutes as you get

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.569 
recovery again for 20 minutes as you get
fitter<00:03:37.370> 30<00:03:38.150> seconds<00:03:38.600> hard<00:03:39.040> 1-minute<00:03:40.040> recovery

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
fitter 30 seconds hard 1-minute recovery

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.310 
fitter 30 seconds hard 1-minute recovery
so<00:03:40.970> you're<00:03:41.090> just<00:03:41.150> shortening<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.840> recovery

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
so you're just shortening the recovery

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.220 
so you're just shortening the recovery
time<00:03:42.579> so<00:03:43.579> there<00:03:43.880> in<00:03:43.970> fact<00:03:44.120> change<00:03:44.450> of<00:03:44.630> pace<00:03:44.959> is

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
time so there in fact change of pace is

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.500 
time so there in fact change of pace is
happening<00:03:45.680> sooner<00:03:46.160> and<00:03:46.519> that's<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.180> really

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
happening sooner and that's a really

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.970 
happening sooner and that's a really
great<00:03:47.660> way<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:47.989> especially<00:03:48.470> for<00:03:48.739> soccer

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
great way to especially for soccer

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.960 
great way to especially for soccer
players<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.459> most<00:03:49.850> athletes<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:51.250> build<00:03:52.250> that

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
players and most athletes to build that

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.970 
players and most athletes to build that
insurance<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:53.900> that<00:03:54.500> quick<00:03:54.709> acceleration

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
insurance and that quick acceleration

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.630 
insurance and that quick acceleration
into<00:03:55.640> their<00:03:56.359> into<00:03:56.900> their<00:03:57.019> training<00:03:57.519> so<00:03:58.519> that's

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
into their into their training so that's

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.849 
into their into their training so that's
that's<00:03:58.910> a<00:03:59.060> really<00:03:59.329> basic<00:04:00.140> way<00:04:00.410> of<00:04:00.560> doing<00:04:00.769> it

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
that's a really basic way of doing it

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.979 
that's a really basic way of doing it
and<00:04:01.040> at<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.489> same<00:04:01.640> time<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:02.299> can<00:04:02.450> start

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
and at the same time you can start

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.069 
and at the same time you can start
throwing<00:04:03.290> things<00:04:03.560> in<00:04:03.709> like<00:04:03.859> hills<00:04:04.600> to<00:04:05.600> develop

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
throwing things in like hills to develop

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.390 
throwing things in like hills to develop
some<00:04:06.260> better<00:04:06.470> life<00:04:06.739> strength<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:07.220> better

because<00:04:14.670> it<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:14.940> higher<00:04:15.360> impact

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
because it is a higher impact

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.319 
because it is a higher impact
weight-bearing<00:04:16.769> activity<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.940> it's<00:04:18.090> not
