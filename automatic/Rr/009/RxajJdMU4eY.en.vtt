needs to be fuller than this one this is

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.529 
needs to be fuller than this one this is
your<00:00:22.500> bow<00:00:22.650> area<00:00:22.859> up<00:00:23.160> here<00:00:23.210> once<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.330> get<00:00:24.449> this

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
your bow area up here once you get this

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.060 
your bow area up here once you get this
one<00:00:24.720> divide<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.080> out<00:00:25.939> you're<00:00:26.939> gonna<00:00:27.060> divide<00:00:27.359> it

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
one divide it out you're gonna divide it

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.689 
one divide it out you're gonna divide it
in<00:00:29.070> half

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
in half

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.310 
in half
and<00:00:30.150> go<00:00:30.269> ahead<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.510> just<00:00:30.599> clip<00:00:30.990> off<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
and go ahead and just clip off the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.979 
and go ahead and just clip off the
section<00:00:31.529> you're<00:00:31.740> not<00:00:31.890> using<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.219> first<00:00:32.989> you're

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
section you're not using it first you're

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.389 
section you're not using it first you're
gonna<00:00:34.079> make<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.380> size<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.739> your<00:00:34.829> bow<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.309> you

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
gonna wrap it around the base try to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.990 
gonna wrap it around the base try to
keep<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.559> close<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.190> ponytail<00:00:47.670> as<00:00:47.879> you

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
keep it as close to the ponytail as you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.209 
keep it as close to the ponytail as you
can<00:00:48.239> you'll<00:00:49.110> be<00:00:49.230> easier<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.649> hide<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.950> way<00:00:50.070> at

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
can you'll be easier to hide that way at

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.840 
can you'll be easier to hide that way at
the<00:00:50.309> end<00:00:54.890> not<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.100> nice<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.430> tight<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.610> it

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
the end not that nice and tight so it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.040 
the end not that nice and tight so it
doesn't<00:00:56.940> come<00:00:57.239> out<00:00:57.329> midday<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:59.180> okay<00:01:00.180> now

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
doesn't come out midday on you okay now

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.680 
doesn't come out midday on you okay now
with<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.609> the<00:01:02.609> leftovers<00:01:03.149> make<00:01:03.359> sure<00:01:03.539> they're

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
with it the leftovers make sure they're

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.109 
with it the leftovers make sure they're
hanging<00:01:04.019> over<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> top<00:01:04.559> right<00:01:04.739> there<00:01:05.119> and

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
hanging over the top right there and

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.399 
hanging over the top right there and
then<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.570> section<00:01:06.869> you're<00:01:07.020> doing<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
then with this section you're doing the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.590 
then with this section you're doing the
exact<00:01:07.680> same<00:01:07.890> thing<00:01:08.130> make<00:01:08.909> your<00:01:09.090> loop<00:01:09.240> size

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
exact same thing make your loop size

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.200 
exact same thing make your loop size
about<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.260> same<00:01:13.580> about<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> same<00:01:14.880> size<00:01:15.030> as

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
about the same about the same size as

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.359 
about the same about the same size as
the<00:01:15.330> other<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.350> flyaways<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.220> can

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the other if you have flyaways you can

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.859 
the other if you have flyaways you can
take<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> second<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.210> can<00:01:18.240> kind<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.630> spray

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
take a second and you can kind of spray

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.580 
take a second and you can kind of spray
them<00:01:19.310> we<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> few<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.000> side<00:01:21.470> and<00:01:22.470> then

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
them we have a few on this side and then

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.929 
them we have a few on this side and then
it<00:01:22.619> makes<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.950> easier<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.520> smooth<00:01:23.820> em

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
it makes it easier just to smooth em

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.219 
it makes it easier just to smooth em
into<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.770> bow<00:01:25.770> as<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.490> work<00:01:29.960> so<00:01:30.960> just<00:01:31.140> go

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
into the bow as you work so just go

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.260 
into the bow as you work so just go
ahead<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.530> make<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.860> loop<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.790> exact<00:01:33.090> same

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
ahead and make this loop the exact same

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.919 
ahead and make this loop the exact same
ways<00:01:33.450> before

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.260 

so<00:01:41.890> now<00:01:42.009> you<00:01:42.069> got<00:01:42.189> your<00:01:42.280> two<00:01:42.460> loops<00:01:42.640> but<00:01:43.179> you

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
so now you got your two loops but you

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.669 
so now you got your two loops but you
have<00:01:43.450> these<00:01:43.630> this<00:01:43.869> still<00:01:44.079> need<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.350> be<00:01:44.469> hidden

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
have these this still need to be hidden

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.279 
have these this still need to be hidden
that's<00:01:45.429> what<00:01:45.579> you're<00:01:45.670> going<00:01:45.759> to<00:01:45.819> do<00:01:45.939> for

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
that's what you're going to do for

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.139 
that's what you're going to do for
hiding<00:01:47.289> those<00:01:47.469> you're<00:01:48.460> gonna<00:01:48.609> get<00:01:48.729> your<00:01:48.850> Topsy

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
hiding those you're gonna get your Topsy

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.520 
hiding those you're gonna get your Topsy
tail<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.390> you're<00:01:49.479> gonna<00:01:49.569> put<00:01:49.780> up<00:01:49.869> all<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.439> way

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
tail and you're gonna put up all the way

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.330 
tail and you're gonna put up all the way
through<00:01:50.859> the<00:01:50.979> elastic<00:01:53.069> so<00:01:54.069> it's<00:01:54.189> going

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
through the elastic so it's going

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.590 
through the elastic so it's going
through<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.609> ponytail<00:01:54.759> not<00:01:55.240> hiding<00:01:55.569> behind

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
through the ponytail not hiding behind

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.690 
through the ponytail not hiding behind
it<00:01:55.929> like<00:01:56.079> you<00:01:56.200> normally<00:01:56.319> would<00:01:56.679> do<00:01:56.829> it<00:01:56.979> now<00:01:57.640> you
