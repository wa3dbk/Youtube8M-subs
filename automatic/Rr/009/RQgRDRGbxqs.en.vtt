00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
or not this is this is the shows and

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.160 
or not this is this is the shows and
what<00:02:50.459> we<00:02:50.610> are<00:02:50.820> sound<00:02:51.390> is<00:02:51.600> one<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.959> biggest

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
what we are sound is one of the biggest

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.430 
what we are sound is one of the biggest
but<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.860> annals<00:02:53.280> maybe<00:02:53.730> from<00:02:54.420> from<00:02:54.870> just<00:02:55.170> it

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
but the annals maybe from from just it

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.890 
but the annals maybe from from just it
is<00:02:55.590> twice<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.040> soul<00:02:56.610> that's<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:57.840> you

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900
