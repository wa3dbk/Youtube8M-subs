00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170
 because as they are easy 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:09.460
 well here I bring you a new tweets 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.130
 It is not good for you to do 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.910
 free calls from a thd expo or them 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:21.029
 I have a fourth generation ipod touch 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.029
 it's called city or something 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.150
 be greater 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.790
 is this 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.710
 we can find free in the author of 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:37.150
 Mexico is everything is totally free 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.700
 this study serves as it had already 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.170
 commented to be free calls from 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.780
 ipod touch 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.780
 this works based on credits 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:53.300
 you are one who is 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:57.579
 we go to my information you give to whom 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.579
 detect this green bar 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.820
 we give him 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.580
 and here we have to earn credit 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.770
 we have to 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.900
 we have to give any video more than 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.470
 is that we have nothing 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.409
 we give you here to see if there 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.429
 apps or apps 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.429
 for install 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.980
 and there is no 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.880
 so we have to find if there are 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.400
 applications here for free 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.740
 we install we use them 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.470
 and if we want, we can delete them 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.210
 so that credit is generated give us 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.700
 credit we have at the time of 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.490
 install it 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.920
 at this moment we have to use it and 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.060
 they will automatically give you credit 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.990
 is going to say how many credits they give you for 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.950
 by installing that application 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.950
 but right now there's no 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.800
 we do not have videos or other 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.800
 applications for 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.520
 the moment we do not have applications 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:16.490
 available now try later 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.340
 good but as I want I have credit 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.880
 I 'm going to give you a little demonstration of 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.060
 how to make free calls 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.940

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.120

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.890
 It's cellular, I only have 18 minutes if 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.280

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.830

 good friend 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.660

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.890
 As I say it's free, they can look for it 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.730

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.299
