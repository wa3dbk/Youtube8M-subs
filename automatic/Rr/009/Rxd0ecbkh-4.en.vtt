 I talk to Rio Responsible Design 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.620
 by hiv design in brazil case as is 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.970
 develop a car for Brazil 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.250
 when we see so many cars worldwide 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.319
 global comes our market and hyundai

 made a car globally the normal car 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:44.880
 car direct only in brazil by hbo avoid 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:47.250
 or dries the creative design of hb 2015 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.530
 both highlighted that the development of 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.690
 a vehicle for our market was 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.370
 meet the job requirements 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.550
 of use 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.230
 but a car made for the blues 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.170
 books with more sportiness 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.020
 most prominent feature in 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.390
 surveys and evaluations carried out by the 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.460
 hyundai takes care of all the work in the center 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.290
 design was to design a car for the 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.990
 I like Brazilians 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.450
 after much research a little 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.420
 target of this segment to have a 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.040
 that can last a longer time and design 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.560
 in Korea considered many 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.600
 Brazil's information coming your 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.850
 needs to make a car 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.210
 really Brazilian for a Brazil 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.100
 developed in Korea but I'm in Brazil 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.090
 and for Brazilians 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.220
 everton and pablo gil leo and sport ce 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.140
 now marry a car with modern lines 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.550
 as I just saw how it looks 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.230
 of aging we observe that 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.510
 those cases that have these my sheets 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.190
 at the moment the quality of life time 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.510
 design how is it 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:53.150
 ok, okay, okay, the stronger traits 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.550
 are part of the Commission's 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.190
 hyundai our cars with drawings 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.520
 differentiated and the best with the 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.860
 public acceptance for example 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.830
 in 2009 started all this 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.530
 change and still today the champions of 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.020
 sales in both Korea and 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.610
 United States continues to 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.160
 market acceptance 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.250
 I do not believe it 's a life design 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.250
 short but made to last another 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.530
 wide even without news without changes 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.960
 in the last five years it continues 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.600
 sales champion but the fluid sculpture 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.010
 one of the main reasons I believe 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:37.060
 this drawing soundsin of london plastic 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.060
 internet design was brazil 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.950
 well I really like design and had 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.950
 greater pleasure in designing a new vehicle 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.980
 to Brazil 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.980
 O 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.020
