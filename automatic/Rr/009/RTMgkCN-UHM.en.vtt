00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello i'm going to talk to you about a tool that 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.000
 I am indispensable to weigh well 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.649
 correctly all your food 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.570
 in fact it's just for you 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.950
 present a balance finally they 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.799
 do not sway the one in particular 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.480
 do not care and it's to invite you if 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.820
 you have not yet got a 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.010
 digital scale comes accurate he 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.070
 will have to show like that see when we 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.920
 support that that tells you well 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.500
 precisely what is needed so in fact 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.420
 I'm talking about that because it's silly and 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.830
 it's very important, however, is 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.290
 able to measure everything you ingest 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.149
 in terms of macronutrients especially 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.870
 protein and carbohydrates 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.000
 Well, if you do not have it, are you ok? 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.910
 to know exactly how big 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.170
 close everything we need not everything 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.090
 everything you put in his 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.469
 a game you do a little demo everything to 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.840
 the time how do I use it that 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.129
 I use it for almost everyone did a 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.600
 art it's been several years 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.000
 that I have them 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.460
 she's really good has never let go 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.010
 it is still in good condition 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.710
 waters that works with AA batteries 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.150
 this is the one of m it's the same ones who 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.650
 are in two sons and him I have them 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.020
 never changed for several years 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.350
 so that's good and I paid them 40 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.750
 is actually it's a guy like when 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.100
 you when you train muscu 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.900
 you will measure the loads it is 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.590
 you that you lift when you do 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.380
 sprints or 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.049
 the break was going to measure your time you 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.979
 do cardio you may have a 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.200
 frequency meter to see where bp 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.929
 and it's the same if you make the slack 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.509
 collage and well you'll measure at 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.069
 less millimeter here when 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.719
 you cut boards that you are not going 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.610
 not cut the stuff like that pretty much 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.490
 the assemblies this is going to do a trick all 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.689
 scary at all, it can work 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.859
 except that you lose efficiency in and 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.170
 and even if only for 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.329
 save if you make rice by 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.959
 example as I will show you in 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.860
 this video 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:59.289
 and here we go I'll show you a 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.810
 ancestral technique to succeed rice 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.599
 sticky attention georges leekens to his 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.789
 next video maybe for the 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:10.329
 sushi denies all this why not but 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:13.930
 yeah so suddenly measuring 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:15.760
 barassat confesses profitability is 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.250
 like you will usually take a 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.480
 little by little actually weigh everything that 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.340
 you eat that to become a bit of a 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.200
 second nature and you will not be 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.840
 calories clean that you manage 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.250
 it's interesting for that it allows 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.970
 also not to waste not in 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.650
 do too much for nothing and eat at his 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.690
 hungry because sometimes the versa is 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.760
 so we brew 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.010
 here is a demo here is how I use 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.440
 we take the example with the sandstone of a 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.090
 mixture to put 30 g of seeds in 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.519
 his jar to get them started 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.709
 it's gone I can control the gram 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.150
 I'll be careful when I'm not going there 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.109
 to go too common darlas because of 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.109
 Once was quick to exceed 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.050
 here is the message is sent 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.090
 finally here you have understood 30 ball 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.800
 it's great but hey we have a good dosage 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.550
 gram thing near another 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.060
 application with rice if I do not 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.590
 from jury go we will say 200 grams 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:20.050
 but 200 g of rice you will see I 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:20.950
 will put the waters live behind me 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.630
 believe same source 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.510
 I will direct donations years and suddenly 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.570
 it makes me a perfect dosage I'm going 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.940
 pass it's good I was a little 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.830
 brutally but there I matured I have more 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.200
 to heat it absorbs its loans 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.930
 pilot it takes and I know exactly 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.310
 how many mende to originate I know the 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.080
 carbs I have the proofs that I have 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.050
 I measure everything his clips 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.700
 here you have seen it's very simple 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.510
 ask your food to measure their mass 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.460
 that's how you go the way 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.860
 the most effective one month measure this 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:59.770
 that you are ingested is good then a 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:02.640
 design object and that continues there are 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:06.370
 times where we can do otherwise 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.100
 mass is the simplest way 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.020
 we will say the fastest and the most 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.030
 economic 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:16.299
 there is no need for material 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.900
 it just takes that to measure your 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.549
 foods what are you going to ingest there he 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.750
 there are others who will say yes 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:28.419
 but ingested foods and 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:33.400
 absorbed by the body are 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:35.430
 very different yes it's true but good 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.220
 it's true what you ingest moment 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.790
 it's all a great tool I you 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.969
 recommended 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.860
 it's finally done 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:45.299
 it's important as I tell you I 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.389
 leave you I hope it will help you 

00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:51.079
 to work to progress and I'm going 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.079
 Watch the television
