00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
hey you do know me right yeah we just

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:19.730 
hey you do know me right yeah we just
had<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.509> kill<00:00:06.899> attract<00:00:18.020> Parker<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.230> dig<00:00:19.439> I

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
had to kill attract Parker you dig I

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.490 
had to kill attract Parker you dig I
wanted<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.070> show<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.660> my<00:00:21.660> new<00:00:21.689> machine<00:00:22.230> i<00:00:22.320> made

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
wanted to show you my new machine i made

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.759 
wanted to show you my new machine i made
over<00:00:22.529> here<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.400> basically<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.240> mass

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
over here it is basically a mass

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.640 
over here it is basically a mass
generator<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:26.160> solar<00:00:26.730> array<00:00:27.410> and<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.500> looks

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
generator of solar array and it looks

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.750 
generator of solar array and it looks
like<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.980> guy<00:00:29.160> over<00:00:29.279> here<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.580> going<00:00:29.609> to

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
like this guy over here is going to

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.600 
like this guy over here is going to
screwing<00:00:30.090> with<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.929> spins<00:00:31.170> without<00:00:31.679> any

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
screwing with it so it spins without any

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.729 
screwing with it so it spins without any
way<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.690> just<00:00:34.140> turned<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.350> all<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.590> with

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
way I I just turned it all on with

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.139 
way I I just turned it all on with
redstone<00:00:35.040> torches<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:35.790> just<00:00:35.880> kind<00:00:36.059> of

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
redstone torches so it's just kind of

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.639 
redstone torches so it's just kind of
getting<00:00:36.300> geared<00:00:36.540> up<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.809> San<00:00:37.020> Malina<00:00:37.200> James

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
getting geared up in San Malina James

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.490 
getting geared up in San Malina James
days<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.719> Redstone<00:00:39.719> engines<00:00:40.110> here<00:00:40.290> but

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
days for the Redstone engines here but

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.160 
days for the Redstone engines here but
basically<00:00:40.710> how<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.890> works<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.340> all<00:00:42.170> solar

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
basically how it works it is all solar

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.779 
basically how it works it is all solar
energy<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.860> course<00:00:44.100> six<00:00:44.250> little<00:00:44.460> glitching

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
energy of course six little glitching

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.959 
energy of course six little glitching

sings backing up anyway show you the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.470 
sings backing up anyway show you the
basics<00:00:48.329> here<00:00:48.890> it<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.039> basically<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.480> collectors

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
basics here it is basically a collectors

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.770 
basics here it is basically a collectors
on<00:00:51.809> top<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.199> condensers<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.360> it<00:00:54.360> pumps<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.660> out

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
on top of condensers and it pumps it out

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.569 
on top of condensers and it pumps it out
whatever<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.199> need<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:56.250> all<00:00:56.340> self

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
whatever I need so it's all self

see<00:00:58.469> also<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.820> other<00:00:59.850> extras<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.629> dumps<00:01:00.930> out

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
see also with other extras it dumps out

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.780 
see also with other extras it dumps out
so<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.850> right<00:01:03.059> here<00:01:03.420> i<00:01:03.570> have<00:01:04.019> my<00:01:04.790> choppers

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
so like right here i have my choppers

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.679 
so like right here i have my choppers
and<00:01:06.390> my<00:01:07.350> sticky<00:01:07.920> resin<00:01:08.340> which<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.060> going

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
and my sticky resin which is going

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.719 
and my sticky resin which is going
directly<00:01:10.080> into<00:01:10.320> an<00:01:10.950> electric<00:01:11.280> furnace<00:01:11.430> which

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
directly into an electric furnace which

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.510 
directly into an electric furnace which
I<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:11.939> done

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.190 

and<00:01:15.909> Samoa<00:01:16.180> clock<00:01:16.450> or<00:01:16.659> some<00:01:16.810> McCann<00:01:17.020> rubber

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
and Samoa clock or some McCann rubber

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.870 
and Samoa clock or some McCann rubber
which<00:01:17.950> of<00:01:18.100> course<00:01:18.130> y'all<00:01:18.460> know<00:01:18.490> is<00:01:18.759> the

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
which of course y'all know is the

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.929 
which of course y'all know is the
components<00:01:19.539> of<00:01:19.659> wires<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.549> here<00:01:21.759> I<00:01:21.820> am

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
components of wires so here I am

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.389 
components of wires so here I am
mass-producing<00:01:22.689> wires<00:01:22.929> are<00:01:23.590> going<00:01:23.979> since<00:01:24.219> is

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
mass-producing wires are going since is

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.130 
mass-producing wires are going since is
here<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.860> make<00:01:27.100> circuits<00:01:27.909> and<00:01:28.840> then<00:01:28.960> you<00:01:29.020> can

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
here to make circuits and then you can

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.240 
here to make circuits and then you can
see<00:01:29.289> the<00:01:29.409> circuits<00:01:29.679> are<00:01:29.710> coming<00:01:29.950> out<00:01:30.039> so<00:01:30.159> I'll

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
see the circuits are coming out so I'll

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.830 
see the circuits are coming out so I'll
pump<00:01:30.429> in<00:01:30.549> pretty<00:01:30.759> slow<00:01:30.969> of<00:01:31.210> course<00:01:31.509> it's<00:01:31.719> got

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
pump in pretty slow of course it's got

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.920 
pump in pretty slow of course it's got
engines<00:01:32.289> up<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.619> running<00:01:32.979> again

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
engines up and running again

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.740 
engines up and running again
here<00:01:34.930> same<00:01:35.350> process<00:01:35.829> and<00:01:36.070> I

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
here same process and I

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
here same process and I
find<00:01:38.380> iron<00:01:39.480> which<00:01:40.480> is<00:01:40.690> coupling<00:01:41.350> along<00:01:41.590> with

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
find iron which is coupling along with

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.700 
find iron which is coupling along with
this<00:01:41.920> redstone<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.850> make<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.090> circuits<00:01:43.710> down

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
this redstone to make the circuits down

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.790 
this redstone to make the circuits down
on<00:01:44.890> this<00:01:45.040> portion<00:01:45.610> I<00:01:45.820> am<00:01:45.940> making<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.840> furnace

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
on this portion I am making the furnace

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.640 
on this portion I am making the furnace
and<00:01:47.950> a<00:01:48.010> generator<00:01:48.370> so<00:01:49.060> here's<00:01:49.270> just<00:01:49.420> iron<00:01:49.780> to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
and a generator so here's just iron to

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.420 
and a generator so here's just iron to
make<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:50.920> basic<00:01:51.280> iron<00:01:51.550> furnace<00:01:53.369> trying<00:01:54.369> to

make the basic iron furnace trying to

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.780 
make the basic iron furnace trying to
pump<00:01:54.580> those<00:01:54.820> outside<00:01:55.450> there<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:57.250> this<00:01:57.610> side

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
pump those outside there and this side

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.210 
pump those outside there and this side
I'm<00:01:58.030> making<00:01:58.270> iron<00:01:58.420> into<00:01:58.810> a<00:01:58.840> find<00:01:59.170> iron<00:01:59.380> to<00:02:00.100> go

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
I'm making iron into a find iron to go

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.440 
I'm making iron into a find iron to go
with<00:02:00.400> the<00:02:00.490> furnaces<00:02:00.910> to<00:02:01.119> go<00:02:01.210> with<00:02:01.330> the

batteries to make my generators overview
you<00:02:04.960> see<00:02:05.140> that's<00:02:05.320> pumping<00:02:05.650> out<00:02:06.720> ah<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:09.160> this

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
you see that's pumping out ah so this

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.710 
you see that's pumping out ah so this

I<00:02:10.780> let<00:02:11.620> this<00:02:11.740> run<00:02:12.250> for<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.490> little<00:02:12.520> while<00:02:12.760> I

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
I let this run for a little while I

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:22.100 
I let this run for a little while I
wouldn't<00:02:16.590> anyway<00:02:17.610> redstone
