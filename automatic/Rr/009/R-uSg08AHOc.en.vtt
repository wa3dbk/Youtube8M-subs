I'm going to be a big deal for you so
these<00:00:47.079> are<00:00:47.559> way<00:00:48.010> more<00:00:48.040> cost-effective<00:00:49.000> than

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
these are way more cost-effective than

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.920 
these are way more cost-effective than
this

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
this

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.820 
this
the<00:00:50.409> difficulty<00:00:50.920> is<00:00:51.100> they're<00:00:51.549> too<00:00:51.759> wide<00:00:52.830> they

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
the difficulty is they're too wide they

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.450 
the difficulty is they're too wide they
are<00:00:53.879> 13<00:00:55.170> centimetres<00:00:56.170> wide<00:00:56.350> rather<00:00:56.739> than<00:00:56.979> 11

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
are 13 centimetres wide rather than 11

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.859 
are 13 centimetres wide rather than 11
which<00:00:57.610> is<00:00:57.640> what<00:00:57.879> you<00:00:57.939> need<00:00:58.119> for<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.330> Midori

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:58.869 
which is what you need for the Midori

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:01.950 
which is what you need for the Midori
and<00:00:59.500> you<00:01:00.129> can<00:01:00.280> also<00:01:00.430> get<00:01:00.850> something<00:01:01.210> in<00:01:01.479> a5

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
and you can also get something in a5

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.210 
and you can also get something in a5
which<00:01:02.350> is<00:01:02.640> another<00:01:03.640> 2<00:01:04.540> centimetres<00:01:05.170> again<00:01:05.500> too

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
which is another 2 centimetres again too

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.539 
which is another 2 centimetres again too
wide<00:01:06.549> but<00:01:07.450> if<00:01:07.540> you<00:01:07.630> have<00:01:07.840> access<00:01:08.200> to<00:01:08.409> a<00:01:08.590> 5<00:01:09.070> books

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549

wide but if you have access to a 5 books
or<00:01:09.939> if<00:01:10.299> you<00:01:10.420> have<00:01:10.600> access<00:01:11.020> to<00:01:11.049> mul<00:01:11.590> skin<00:01:11.890> size

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
or if you have access to mul skin size

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.289 
or if you have access to mul skin size
books<00:01:12.509> they're<00:01:13.509> all<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.869> same<00:01:13.900> height<00:01:14.500> as<00:01:14.829> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
books they're all the same height as the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.880 
books they're all the same height as the
Midori<00:01:16.299> travelers<00:01:16.630> notebook<00:01:17.020> and<00:01:17.470> you<00:01:17.740> will

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
Midori travelers notebook and you will

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.800 
Midori travelers notebook and you will
probably<00:01:18.100> find<00:01:18.549> that<00:01:18.790> by<00:01:19.030> knees<00:01:19.299> and<00:01:19.479> cutting

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
probably find that by knees and cutting

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.290 
probably find that by knees and cutting
them<00:01:19.930> down<00:01:19.960> is<00:01:20.830> a<00:01:20.890> more<00:01:21.340> cost-effective<00:01:21.880> way

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
them down is a more cost-effective way

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.510 
them down is a more cost-effective way
to<00:01:23.260> keep<00:01:23.470> your<00:01:23.650> notebook<00:01:24.100> filled<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:26.460> how<00:01:27.460> do

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
to keep your notebook filled so how do

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.850 
to keep your notebook filled so how do
you<00:01:27.729> cut<00:01:28.000> it<00:01:28.240> well<00:01:28.810> um<00:01:29.850> here<00:01:30.850> is<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.690> book<00:01:31.930> and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
you cut it well um here is the book and

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.440 
you cut it well um here is the book and
we're<00:01:33.070> going<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.340> be<00:01:33.430> cutting<00:01:33.850> it<00:01:33.970> down<00:01:36.450> you

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
we're going to be cutting it down you

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.230 
we're going to be cutting it down you
can<00:01:37.479> use<00:01:38.170> a<00:01:38.470> stanley<00:01:39.130> knife<00:01:39.280> or<00:01:39.549> a<00:01:39.580> craft<00:01:39.940> knife

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
can use a stanley knife or a craft knife

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.010 
can use a stanley knife or a craft knife
for<00:01:40.659> this<00:01:42.150> don't<00:01:43.150> try<00:01:43.360> and<00:01:43.420> use<00:01:43.600> a<00:01:43.630> guillotine

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
for this don't try and use a guillotine

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.930 
for this don't try and use a guillotine
at<00:01:44.380> least<00:01:44.590> don't<00:01:44.890> use<00:01:45.130> a<00:01:45.159> whole<00:01:45.310> model

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
at least don't use a whole model

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.730 
at least don't use a whole model
guillotine<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.630> industrial<00:01:47.229> one<00:01:47.440> will<00:01:47.619> be

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
guillotine and industrial one will be

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.340 
guillotine and industrial one will be
fine<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:49.180> that's<00:01:49.390> probably<00:01:49.659> what<00:01:50.049> they'll<00:01:50.200> do

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
fine and that's probably what they'll do

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.380 
fine and that's probably what they'll do
if<00:01:50.470> you<00:01:50.619> ask<00:01:50.799> staples<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.610> do<00:01:51.760> this<00:01:51.970> for<00:01:52.210> you

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
if you ask staples to do this for you

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.370 
if you ask staples to do this for you
they'll<00:01:52.900> charge<00:01:53.470> you<00:01:53.680> money<00:01:53.830> as<00:01:54.100> well<00:01:55.380> the

they'll charge you money as well the

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.440 
they'll charge you money as well the
most<00:01:56.619> effective<00:01:57.190> way<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.400> do<00:01:57.610> this<00:01:57.760> at<00:01:57.940> home<00:01:58.030> is

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
most effective way to do this at home is

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.050 
most effective way to do this at home is
to<00:01:58.840> use<00:01:59.200> one<00:01:59.439> of<00:01:59.470> these<00:01:59.770> it's<00:02:00.159> a<00:02:00.280> rotary<00:02:00.729> cutter

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
to use one of these it's a rotary cutter

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.929 
to use one of these it's a rotary cutter
it's<00:02:02.020> used<00:02:02.409> typically<00:02:02.979> for<00:02:03.430> cutting<00:02:03.790> out

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
it's used typically for cutting out

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.750 
it's used typically for cutting out
material<00:02:04.659> but<00:02:05.409> it<00:02:05.500> works<00:02:05.740> beautifully<00:02:06.610> on

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
material but it works beautifully on

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.690 
material but it works beautifully on
paper<00:02:07.590> there<00:02:08.590> is<00:02:08.619> a<00:02:08.739> little<00:02:08.920> plastic<00:02:09.220> guard

paper there is a little plastic guard
here<00:02:10.060> different<00:02:10.989> models<00:02:11.409> will<00:02:11.650> work<00:02:11.860> in

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
here different models will work in

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.949 
here different models will work in
different<00:02:12.400> ways<00:02:12.580> but<00:02:13.060> ultimately<00:02:13.209> you<00:02:13.900> are

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
different ways but ultimately you are

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.380 
different ways but ultimately you are
going<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.470> pull<00:02:14.739> back<00:02:14.769> this<00:02:15.220> plastic<00:02:15.790> to

so<00:02:27.579> what<00:02:28.000> we<00:02:28.120> need<00:02:28.269> to<00:02:28.420> do<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:28.689> I've<00:02:28.780> done<00:02:28.810> this

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
so what we need to do and I've done this

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.759 
so what we need to do and I've done this
ahead<00:02:29.409> of<00:02:29.469> time<00:02:29.829> is<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.159> take<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.549> book<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.000> to

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
ahead of time is to take the book and to

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.630 
ahead of time is to take the book and to
using<00:02:32.769> a<00:02:32.829> ruler<00:02:33.750> measure<00:02:34.750> 11<00:02:35.709> centimeters

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
using a ruler measure 11 centimeters

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.849 
using a ruler measure 11 centimeters
across<00:02:36.730> near<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.540> top<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:37.930> near<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.739> bottom

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
across near the top and near the bottom

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.280 
across near the top and near the bottom
and<00:02:39.459> what<00:02:39.909> we're<00:02:40.030> then<00:02:40.180> going<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.480> do<00:02:40.659> is<00:02:40.900> put

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
and what we're then going to do is put

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.490 
and what we're then going to do is put
down<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.969> ruler<00:02:42.969> so<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:43.750> it's<00:02:44.140> aligned

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
down the ruler so that it's aligned

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.949 
down the ruler so that it's aligned
against<00:02:44.950> two<00:02:45.189> marks<00:02:45.609> and<00:02:45.790> we're<00:02:46.150> going<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.599> cut

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
against two marks and we're going to cut

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.770 
against two marks and we're going to cut
along<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.950> line<00:02:48.280> with<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.180> rotary<00:02:49.569> cutter

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
along that line with the rotary cutter

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.979 
along that line with the rotary cutter
I'll<00:02:50.200> show<00:02:50.379> you<00:02:50.470> how<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.650> works<00:02:50.980> in<00:02:51.159> a<00:02:51.220> moment

one<00:04:21.909> go<00:04:21.940> in<00:04:22.210> fact<00:04:22.360> your<00:04:22.510> struggle<00:04:22.870> to<00:04:22.990> do<00:04:23.110> it<00:04:23.199> in

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
one go in fact your struggle to do it in

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.409 
one go in fact your struggle to do it in
one<00:04:23.440> go<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:24.250> can<00:04:24.430> sweep<00:04:24.729> the<00:04:24.940> thing<00:04:25.150> backwards

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
one go you can sweep the thing backwards

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.050 
one go you can sweep the thing backwards
and<00:04:25.810> forwards<00:04:26.229> a<00:04:26.349> few<00:04:26.590> times<00:04:26.889> and<00:04:27.220> you'll<00:04:27.880> get

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
and forwards a few times and you'll get

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.240 
and forwards a few times and you'll get
there<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.780> you<00:04:29.380> would<00:04:29.530> use<00:04:29.680> a<00:04:29.710> very<00:04:30.009> similar

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
there and you would use a very similar

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.159 
there and you would use a very similar
technique<00:04:30.550> if<00:04:30.909> you<00:04:30.940> were<00:04:31.330> using<00:04:31.599> a<00:04:31.780> standing

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
technique if you were using a standing

technique if you were using a standing
knife<00:04:32.320> you<00:04:32.590> just<00:04:32.860> cut<00:04:33.130> in<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.400> one<00:04:33.580> direction

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
knife you just cut in the one direction

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.710 
knife you just cut in the one direction
a<00:04:34.270> number<00:04:35.139> of<00:04:35.229> times<00:04:35.529> again

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
a number of times again

a number of times again
this<00:04:36.900> hand<00:04:37.110> absolutely<00:04:37.380> still<00:04:38.010> so<00:04:38.910> here<00:04:39.360> we<00:04:39.480> go

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
this hand absolutely still so here we go

the moment of truth now I'm cutting on

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.150 
the moment of truth now I'm cutting on

see there I've got a nice firm straight
edge<00:05:23.700> now<00:05:24.390> what<00:05:24.870> you'll<00:05:25.020> find<00:05:25.200> is<00:05:25.380> if<00:05:25.470> you're

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
edge now what you'll find is if you're

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.820 
edge now what you'll find is if you're
doing<00:05:25.770> this<00:05:25.920> with<00:05:26.250> a<00:05:26.400> mold<00:05:26.670> scheme<00:05:27.590> you've<00:05:28.590> got

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
doing this with a mold scheme you've got

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.610 
doing this with a mold scheme you've got
this<00:05:29.010> weird<00:05:29.880> flappy<00:05:30.300> bit<00:05:30.570> here<00:05:30.870> that's<00:05:31.020> that's

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
this weird flappy bit here that's that's

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.860 
this weird flappy bit here that's that's
glued<00:05:31.980> at<00:05:32.100> one<00:05:32.250> edge<00:05:32.430> what<00:05:33.150> I<00:05:33.180> would<00:05:33.480> do<00:05:33.690> with

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
glued at one edge what I would do with

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.570 
glued at one edge what I would do with
this<00:05:34.050> is<00:05:34.110> I<00:05:34.440> would<00:05:34.620> run<00:05:34.800> a<00:05:34.860> little<00:05:35.100> bead<00:05:35.340> of

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
this is I would run a little bead of

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.670 
this is I would run a little bead of
glue<00:05:35.610> down<00:05:35.850> that<00:05:36.120> edge<00:05:36.450> there<00:05:36.720> hold<00:05:37.560> it

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
glue down that edge there hold it

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.560 
glue down that edge there hold it
together<00:05:38.010> and<00:05:38.340> then<00:05:38.820> you've<00:05:39.000> you've<00:05:39.360> got<00:05:39.540> a

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
together and then you've you've got a

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.980 
together and then you've you've got a
pocket<00:05:39.840> in<00:05:40.230> the<00:05:40.440> back<00:05:40.620> as<00:05:40.890> well<00:05:41.630> so<00:05:42.630> that's<00:05:42.810> how

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
pocket in the back as well so that's how

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.380 
pocket in the back as well so that's how
you<00:05:43.050> can<00:05:43.919> save<00:05:44.850> money<00:05:45.090> on<00:05:46.310> cutting<00:05:47.310> down

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
you can save money on cutting down

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.340 
you can save money on cutting down
cheaper<00:05:48.390> booklets<00:05:48.810> to<00:05:49.140> make<00:05:50.040> your<00:05:50.310> own<00:05:51.350> and

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
cheaper booklets to make your own and

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.500 
cheaper booklets to make your own and
you<00:05:52.560> will<00:05:52.710> find<00:05:53.010> that<00:05:53.340> that<00:05:53.669> that's<00:05:54.150> a<00:05:54.360> very

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
you will find that that that's a very

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.180 
you will find that that that's a very
worthwhile<00:05:54.810> exercise<00:05:55.229> and<00:05:55.800> once<00:05:55.979> you've

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
worthwhile exercise and once you've

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.860 
worthwhile exercise and once you've
invested<00:05:56.820> in<00:05:57.390> this<00:05:57.690> and<00:05:58.500> in<00:05:59.490> this<00:05:59.870> you're

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
invested in this and in this you're

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.680 
invested in this and in this you're
going<00:06:01.020> to<00:06:01.080> hit<00:06:01.260> breakeven<00:06:02.030> fairly<00:06:03.030> quickly<00:06:03.300> if

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
going to hit breakeven fairly quickly if

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.310 
going to hit breakeven fairly quickly if
you<00:06:03.990> do<00:06:04.169> any<00:06:04.350> amount<00:06:04.740> of<00:06:04.860> writing
