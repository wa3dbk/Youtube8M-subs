hi folks welcome to this brief

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.549 
hi folks welcome to this brief
demonstration<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.639> sax<00:00:08.970> tutor<00:00:09.300> program

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
demonstration of the sax tutor program

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.440 
demonstration of the sax tutor program
before<00:00:10.559> we<00:00:10.920> begin<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.639> can<00:00:11.820> see<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.240> we're

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
before we begin you can see that we're

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.779 
before we begin you can see that we're
using<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.990> unregistered<00:00:13.740> copy<00:00:14.009> here<00:00:14.339> don't

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:14.789 
using the unregistered copy here don't

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:16.250 
using the unregistered copy here don't
worry<00:00:15.030> too<00:00:15.329> much<00:00:15.360> about<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:15.809> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
worry too much about that the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260 
worry too much about that the
unregistered<00:00:16.619> copy<00:00:17.160> has<00:00:17.550> got<00:00:17.820> pretty<00:00:18.060> much

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
unregistered copy has got pretty much

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.150 
unregistered copy has got pretty much
all<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.690> facilities<00:00:18.960> they're<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.619> couple<00:00:20.010> of

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
all the facilities they're a couple of

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.160 
all the facilities they're a couple of
bits<00:00:20.340> are<00:00:20.519> missing<00:00:20.849> you<00:00:21.330> can't<00:00:21.570> play<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.960> blue

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
bits are missing you can't play the blue

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.800 
bits are missing you can't play the blue
scales<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:23.730> can't<00:00:23.970> print<00:00:24.330> so<00:00:24.509> much<00:00:24.660> as

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
scales and you can't print so much as

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.720 
scales and you can't print so much as
you<00:00:24.929> can<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.650> register<00:00:26.070> version<00:00:26.490> but

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
you can in the register version but

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.040 
you can in the register version but
you'll<00:00:27.210> probably<00:00:27.330> only<00:00:27.539> need<00:00:27.839> those

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
you'll probably only need those

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.480 
you'll probably only need those
facilities<00:00:28.380> when<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.890> get<00:00:29.009> a<00:00:29.039> bit<00:00:29.220> further

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
facilities when you get a bit further

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.519 
facilities when you get a bit further
into<00:00:29.730> your<00:00:29.939> sax<00:00:30.179> playing<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.779> we'll<00:00:31.320> clear

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
into your sax playing so we'll clear

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.620 
into your sax playing so we'll clear
that<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.949> let's<00:00:32.700> take<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> look<00:00:33.210> at<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> main

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
that and let's take a look at the main

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.619 
that and let's take a look at the main
screen<00:00:33.950> so<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.520> reason<00:00:35.879> that<00:00:36.000> sax<00:00:36.270> tutor

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
screen so the reason that sax tutor

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.869 
screen so the reason that sax tutor
really<00:00:36.930> exists<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.620> teach<00:00:38.010> people<00:00:38.039> how<00:00:38.850> to

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
really exists is to teach people how to

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.330 
really exists is to teach people how to
play<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.300> sax<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.870> particularly<00:00:40.620> which

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
play the sax and particularly which

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.979 
play the sax and particularly which
fingerings<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.030> use<00:00:42.239> for<00:00:42.660> any<00:00:42.809> particular

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
fingerings to use for any particular

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.319 
fingerings to use for any particular
note<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.250> left-hand<00:00:44.610> picture<00:00:44.940> here<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
note so the left-hand picture here the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.630 
note so the left-hand picture here the
sax<00:00:45.570> key<00:00:45.840> picture<00:00:46.260> tells<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> red

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
sax key picture tells you with a red

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.049 
sax key picture tells you with a red
where<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.750> key<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.440> depressed<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.010> where<00:00:50.730> white

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
where a key is depressed and where white

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.049 
where a key is depressed and where white
shows<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> key<00:00:52.079> that's<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.410> pressed<00:00:52.760> in<00:00:53.760> this

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
shows a key that's not pressed in this

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.840 
shows a key that's not pressed in this
particular<00:00:54.420> demo<00:00:55.410> was<00:00:55.710> showing<00:00:56.100> C<00:00:56.550> at<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
particular demo was showing C at the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
particular demo was showing C at the
moment<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.109> see<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> staff<00:00:58.739> here

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
moment as you can see on the staff here

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.849 
moment as you can see on the staff here
middle<00:00:59.550> C<00:00:59.850> is<00:00:59.910> showing<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.420> green<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.930> middle

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
middle C is showing in green and middle

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.529 
middle C is showing in green and middle
C<00:01:02.039> here<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.429> can<00:01:02.550> see<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> yellow<00:01:03.000> by<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.359> way

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
C here you can see the yellow by the way

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.330 
C here you can see the yellow by the way
just<00:01:03.899> demonstrate<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.710> we're<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.040> middle<00:01:05.309> C

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.340 
just demonstrate that we're on middle C

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.780 
just demonstrate that we're on middle C
you<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.300> also<00:01:06.480> see<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.040> red<00:01:08.310> modes<00:01:08.580> are

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
you can also see that the red modes are

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.609 
you can also see that the red modes are
showing<00:01:09.030> how<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.330> note<00:01:09.689> will<00:01:09.930> sound<00:01:10.259> in<00:01:10.500> its

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
showing how that note will sound in its

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.460 
showing how that note will sound in its
transposed<00:01:11.189> form<00:01:11.549> if<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:12.210> change<00:01:12.840> instruments

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
transposed form if we change instruments

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.460 
transposed form if we change instruments
using<00:01:13.650> these<00:01:13.890> radio<00:01:14.280> buttons<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:15.320> you<00:01:16.320> can

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
using these radio buttons here you can

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.530 
using these radio buttons here you can
see<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.830> transposed<00:01:17.430> position<00:01:18.000> changes

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
see that the transposed position changes

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.960 
see that the transposed position changes
and<00:01:18.900> we'll<00:01:19.710> stick<00:01:19.890> with<00:01:19.920> Alto<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.700> test

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
and we'll stick with Alto for this test

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.890 
and we'll stick with Alto for this test
I<00:01:21.090> think<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:23.610> real<00:01:23.790> power<00:01:24.090> sets<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.659> how<00:01:24.840> that

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
I think the real power sets to how that

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.230 
I think the real power sets to how that
comes<00:01:25.560> into<00:01:25.829> play<00:01:26.159> when<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.549> start<00:01:26.850> clicking

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
comes into play when you start clicking

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.569 
comes into play when you start clicking
on<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> star<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:27.990> here<00:01:28.680> i<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:28.799> i've<00:01:29.310> clicked

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
on the star so here i have i've clicked

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.780 
on the star so here i have i've clicked
on<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.869> note<00:01:31.049> show<00:01:31.320> me<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.369> keyboard

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
on a the note show me a the keyboard

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.330 
on a the note show me a the keyboard
show<00:01:32.970> me<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.149> and<00:01:34.009> fantastic<00:01:35.009> there<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.189> go

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
show me a and fantastic there you go

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.240 
show me a and fantastic there you go
there's<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.850> fingering<00:01:36.450> position<00:01:36.899> for<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.439> on

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
there's the fingering position for a on

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.289 
there's the fingering position for a on
a<00:01:38.280> saxophone<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.960> sharpen<00:01:40.350> or<00:01:40.680> flatten

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
a saxophone you can sharpen or flatten

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.580 
a saxophone you can sharpen or flatten
so<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.540> see<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.869> different<00:01:43.200> fingerings

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
so you can see the different fingerings

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.980 
so you can see the different fingerings
as<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.890> go<00:01:44.299> hopefully<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.450> all<00:01:45.600> makes<00:01:45.810> sense

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
as you go hopefully that all makes sense

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.459 
as you go hopefully that all makes sense
you<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.500> also<00:01:46.649> see<00:01:47.189> here<00:01:48.079> what's<00:01:49.079> written

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
you can also see here what's written

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.410 
you can also see here what's written
versus<00:01:50.130> what's<00:01:50.340> transposed<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.180> kind<00:01:51.390> of

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
versus what's transposed so it kind of

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.850 
versus what's transposed so it kind of
really<00:01:51.630> helps<00:01:51.990> if<00:01:52.170> you're<00:01:52.320> trying<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.649> figure

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
really helps if you're trying to figure

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.490 
really helps if you're trying to figure
out<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.430> transpose<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> piece<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.540> music<00:01:54.659> this

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
out and transpose a piece of music this

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.319 
out and transpose a piece of music this
can<00:01:55.770> be<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> really<00:01:56.159> cool<00:01:56.430> way<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.640> understand

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
can be a really cool way to understand

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.149 
can be a really cool way to understand
exactly<00:01:57.479> what's<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.409> for<00:01:59.009> any

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
exactly what's going on for any

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.209 
exactly what's going on for any
particular<00:01:59.430> instrument<00:02:00.329> but<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.710> power<00:02:02.009> of

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
particular instrument but the power of

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.969 
particular instrument but the power of
sets<00:02:02.430> -<00:02:02.640> -<00:02:02.789> really<00:02:03.240> lies<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.479> its<00:02:04.439> ability<00:02:04.710> to

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
sets - - really lies in its ability to

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.279 
sets - - really lies in its ability to
be<00:02:05.369> able<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.789> demonstrate<00:02:06.030> scales<00:02:06.750> for<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.049> so

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 
be able to demonstrate scales for you so

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.310 
be able to demonstrate scales for you so
if<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:08.009> click<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.490> scales<00:02:08.759> button<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:10.020> can

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
if we click on the scales button you can

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.500 
if we click on the scales button you can
choose<00:02:10.680> a<00:02:10.710> scale<00:02:11.130> some<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.030> them<00:02:12.210> are<00:02:12.300> grayed

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
choose a scale some of them are grayed

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.090 
choose a scale some of them are grayed
out<00:02:12.540> again<00:02:13.230> remember<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.800> is<00:02:13.860> the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
out again remember this is the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.800 
out again remember this is the
unregistered<00:02:14.700> version<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.330> they<00:02:15.450> would<00:02:15.630> come

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
unregistered version so they would come

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.610 
unregistered version so they would come
into<00:02:16.020> play<00:02:16.230> if<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.470> was

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
into play if it was

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.559 
into play if it was
registered<00:02:17.069> let's<00:02:17.730> pick<00:02:17.909> the<00:02:18.030> C<00:02:18.209> major<00:02:18.390> scale

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
registered let's pick the C major scale

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.390 
registered let's pick the C major scale
key<00:02:19.230> here<00:02:19.980> we<00:02:20.069> go

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
key here we go

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.070 
key here we go
and<00:02:20.489> now<00:02:21.060> we<00:02:21.120> have<00:02:21.299> a<00:02:21.330> slightly<00:02:21.540> different

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
and now we have a slightly different

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.199 
and now we have a slightly different
screen<00:02:22.290> we're<00:02:22.890> showing<00:02:23.099> C<00:02:23.370> major<00:02:23.580> up<00:02:23.790> top<00:02:24.030> here

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
screen we're showing C major up top here

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.380 
screen we're showing C major up top here
and<00:02:24.390> we've<00:02:24.959> got<00:02:25.140> these<00:02:25.260> five<00:02:25.530> buttons<00:02:26.390> let's

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
and we've got these five buttons let's

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.899 
and we've got these five buttons let's
start<00:02:27.750> by<00:02:27.900> pressing<00:02:28.110> start<00:02:31.580> hopefully<00:02:32.580> you

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
start by pressing start hopefully you

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.130 
start by pressing start hopefully you
can<00:02:33.030> hear<00:02:33.299> there<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.019> sax<00:02:34.620> 2<00:02:34.829> 2<00:02:34.980> is<00:02:35.069> just

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
can hear there that the sax 2 2 is just

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.780 
can hear there that the sax 2 2 is just
after<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.560> for<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.739> second<00:02:38.040> rotating<00:02:38.579> through

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
after that for a second rotating through

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.910 
after that for a second rotating through
the<00:02:38.940> scale<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.450> as<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:40.019> rotates<00:02:40.200> through<00:02:40.739> it

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
the scale and as it rotates through it

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.649 
the scale and as it rotates through it
shows<00:02:41.159> you<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.519> fingering<00:02:41.970> for<00:02:42.569> each

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
shows you the fingering for each

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.720 
shows you the fingering for each
position<00:02:42.989> on<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.409> scale<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:44.099> is<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.310> great

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
position on the scale this is a great

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.610 
position on the scale this is a great
way<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.060> be<00:02:45.540> able<00:02:45.659> to<00:02:45.810> kind<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.049> lock<00:02:46.379> into

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
way to be able to kind of lock into

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.369 
way to be able to kind of lock into
memory<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.790> basics<00:02:48.480> for<00:02:48.989> any<00:02:49.140> particular

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
memory the basics for any particular

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.619 
memory the basics for any particular
scale<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:50.730> you're<00:02:50.879> confused<00:02:51.269> if<00:02:51.510> you're

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
scale and if you're confused if you're

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.569 
scale and if you're confused if you're
more<00:02:51.870> keyboard<00:02:52.230> orientated<00:02:52.980> or<00:02:53.129> bore<00:02:53.400> more

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
more keyboard orientated or bore more

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.300 
more keyboard orientated or bore more
musically<00:02:54.299> notation<00:02:55.019> oriented<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:55.890> can<00:02:56.069> see

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
musically notation oriented you can see

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.550 
musically notation oriented you can see
all<00:02:56.549> three<00:02:56.849> things<00:02:57.120> on<00:02:57.450> screen<00:02:58.019> at<00:02:58.230> any<00:02:58.349> one

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
all three things on screen at any one

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.890 
all three things on screen at any one
time<00:02:58.760> hopefully<00:02:59.760> that<00:03:00.060> makes<00:03:00.239> some<00:03:00.359> sense<00:03:00.420> and

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
time hopefully that makes some sense and

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.930 
time hopefully that makes some sense and
if<00:03:01.560> we<00:03:01.739> go<00:03:01.859> back<00:03:02.099> up<00:03:02.129> here<00:03:02.459> we<00:03:02.640> can<00:03:02.760> select

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
if we go back up here we can select

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.440 
if we go back up here we can select
other<00:03:03.299> scales<00:03:03.690> maybe<00:03:04.170> let's<00:03:04.829> say<00:03:05.099> D<00:03:05.970> major<00:03:06.150> why

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
other scales maybe let's say D major why

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.259 
other scales maybe let's say D major why
not<00:03:06.629> and<00:03:06.810> again<00:03:07.680> we<00:03:07.980> can<00:03:08.159> press<00:03:08.340> star<00:03:08.489> which

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
not and again we can press star which

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.819 
not and again we can press star which
will<00:03:09.390> play<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:09.720> but<00:03:10.170> there's<00:03:10.409> a<00:03:10.470> couple<00:03:10.680> of

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
will play that but there's a couple of

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.740 
will play that but there's a couple of
other<00:03:10.950> things<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.459> show<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:12.390> can<00:03:12.629> click

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
other things to show you you can click

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.410 
other things to show you you can click
on<00:03:12.870> speed<00:03:13.409> and<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:14.310> can<00:03:14.519> make<00:03:14.700> this<00:03:14.879> faster

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
on speed and you can make this faster

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.800 
on speed and you can make this faster
and<00:03:16.069> everyone<00:03:17.069> in<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:17.459> box<00:03:17.760> is<00:03:18.030> 110<00:03:18.599> for<00:03:18.690> the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
and everyone in this box is 110 for the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.349 
and everyone in this box is 110 for the
second<00:03:19.109> roughly<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:19.620> if<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:19.859> set<00:03:20.370> one<00:03:20.400> this

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
second roughly so if I set one this

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:27.440 
second roughly so if I set one this
should<00:03:21.540> make<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.720> quite<00:03:22.079> fast<00:03:26.150> when<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.180> first

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
should make it quite fast when I first

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.909 
should make it quite fast when I first
set<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:27.810> up<00:03:27.989> I<00:03:28.109> didn't<00:03:28.319> think<00:03:28.440> I'd<00:03:28.620> ever<00:03:28.650> get

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
set this up I didn't think I'd ever get

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.069 
set this up I didn't think I'd ever get
to<00:03:28.980> that<00:03:29.190> speed<00:03:29.459> but<00:03:29.669> nowadays<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.480> can<00:03:30.690> pretty

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
to that speed but nowadays I can pretty

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.110 
to that speed but nowadays I can pretty
much<00:03:31.169> match<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.769> if<00:03:31.889> I<00:03:31.980> need<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.970> can

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
much match that if I need to you can

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.599 
much match that if I need to you can
also<00:03:33.239> loop<00:03:33.629> the<00:03:33.810> scale<00:03:34.049> if<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.260> want<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.709> maybe

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
also loop the scale if you want to maybe

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.460 
also loop the scale if you want to maybe
you<00:03:35.760> want<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:35.970> play<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.419> scale<00:03:36.540> ten<00:03:36.989> times<00:03:37.260> to

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
you want to play a scale ten times to

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.650 
you want to play a scale ten times to
really<00:03:37.590> get<00:03:37.769> it<00:03:37.889> in<00:03:37.980> your<00:03:38.099> head<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.540> set<00:03:39.540> the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
really get it in your head you set the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.849
