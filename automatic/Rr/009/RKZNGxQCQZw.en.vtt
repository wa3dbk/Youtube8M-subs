how to do some basic dial playing with
it<00:01:21.170> I<00:01:22.170> mentioned<00:01:22.710> before<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.070> Atlas<00:01:23.310> 550<00:01:23.820> can

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
it I mentioned before the Atlas 550 can

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.820 
it I mentioned before the Atlas 550 can
do<00:01:24.090> lots<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.420> things<00:01:24.479> sometimes<00:01:25.440> people<00:01:25.710> will

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
do lots of things sometimes people will

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.530 
do lots of things sometimes people will
be<00:01:25.890> using<00:01:26.130> these<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.400> channel<00:01:26.729> banks<00:01:27.030> but

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
be using these as channel banks but

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.030 
be using these as channel banks but
that's<00:01:27.780> not<00:01:28.020> how<00:01:28.260> I'm<00:01:28.409> gonna<00:01:28.560> use<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.920> today

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
that's not how I'm gonna use it today

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.310 
that's not how I'm gonna use it today
I'm<00:01:29.400> gonna<00:01:29.549> use<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.180> actually<00:01:30.690> give<00:01:31.140> it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
I'm gonna use it and actually give it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.250 
I'm gonna use it and actually give it
dial<00:01:32.010> plan<00:01:32.400> intelligence<00:01:33.330> so<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.080> knows

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
dial plan intelligence so that it knows

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.800 
dial plan intelligence so that it knows
how<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.619> route<00:01:34.920> calls<00:01:35.369> based<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.030> digits<00:01:36.510> dial

if that call comes across to anyway so

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.839 
if that call comes across to anyway so
anyway<00:04:25.800> take<00:04:26.800> a<00:04:26.830> look<00:04:27.010> at<00:04:27.099> the<00:04:27.190> router<00:04:27.400> so<00:04:27.640> I

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
anyway take a look at the router so I

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:28.660 
anyway take a look at the router so I
stand<00:04:28.150> status

whatever I program it in the ad Tran I

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.380 
whatever I program it in the ad Tran I
can<00:05:25.010> send<00:05:25.220> across<00:05:25.310> it<00:05:25.730> so<00:05:25.790> I<00:05:25.850> can<00:05:26.000> say<00:05:26.120> one

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
can send across it so I can say one

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.380 
can send across it so I can say one
seven<00:05:26.990> seven<00:05:27.350> seven<00:05:27.590> pound<00:05:28.040> at<00:05:28.430> send<00:05:29.120> a<00:05:29.210> one

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
seven seven seven pound at send a one

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.150 
seven seven seven pound at send a one
seven<00:05:29.810> seven<00:05:29.960> seven<00:05:30.290> so<00:05:30.620> if<00:05:30.710> I'm<00:05:30.830> trying<00:05:31.010> to

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
seven seven seven so if I'm trying to

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.550 
seven seven seven so if I'm trying to
round<00:05:31.370> into<00:05:31.640> an<00:05:31.760> auto<00:05:31.910> with<00:05:32.090> tenon<00:05:32.570> or<00:05:32.750> a<00:05:32.810> Cu<00:05:33.470> II

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
round into an auto with tenon or a Cu II

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.550 
round into an auto with tenon or a Cu II
module<00:05:34.250> or<00:05:34.630> ring<00:05:35.630> a<00:05:35.720> phony<00:05:35.960> anything<00:05:36.470> it

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
module or ring a phony anything it

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.840 
module or ring a phony anything it
doesn't<00:05:36.680> really<00:05:36.830> matter<00:05:37.040> I<00:05:37.220> can<00:05:37.520> do<00:05:37.670> it<00:05:37.820> that

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
doesn't really matter I can do it that

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.120 
doesn't really matter I can do it that
way<00:05:38.180> now<00:05:38.990> the<00:05:39.050> other<00:05:39.320> thing<00:05:39.530> I'm<00:05:39.650> gonna<00:05:39.740> try

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
way now the other thing I'm gonna try

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.710 
way now the other thing I'm gonna try
here<00:05:40.550> and<00:05:40.700> I<00:05:40.730> think<00:05:40.790> it'll<00:05:41.090> work<00:05:41.210> I<00:05:41.510> haven't

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
here and I think it'll work I haven't

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.530 
here and I think it'll work I haven't
tested<00:05:41.990> this<00:05:42.290> yeah<00:05:42.790> but<00:05:43.790> we're<00:05:44.120> gonna<00:05:44.210> give<00:05:44.450> it

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
tested this yeah but we're gonna give it
