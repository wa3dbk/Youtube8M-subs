00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.560
 So this is my first part is a story I made in the 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.319
 south south year and or no sleep 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:10.630
 the land institute 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.539
 I went there 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.459
 I was sleepy when I was Turkish champion and the guys in the pro-Gaddafi redoubt 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.470
 so I was the gunner now the matter 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.289
 Sometimes 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.289
 I feel good 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.910
 ray 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
 out 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.440
 I heard that anyone who sleeps there slept poorly 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.960
 aggressiveness if we can explain how it is in 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.650
 relation to Brazilian statehood is that the less you sleep and the 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.450
 quality of 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.720
 this is not bad 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.120
 the sector is not more aggressive but also you suffer with problems of 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.260
 memory lack of attention then all this would end up giving soulages 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
 of a normal subway show on the last ball 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.270
 gm mice for example sleeping with the television on you are sleeping more 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.900
 of sleep quality to get very bad because I had nervous system he knows 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.310
 still 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.860
 pay attention to what Thai television 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.229
 when you wake up it looks like the truck went over you 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.060
 a person how can she know how much each family world has published 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.430
 very important family in that sense is that the little you sleep you 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.400
 sleep well 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.710
 Let's try to leave their little eyes and wake up with that feeling of 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.550
 rest 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.940
 Theatrical happens most of the time without many people living with 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.520
 six hours of sleep many people report to each other at four years of age this does not 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.549
 will be being fed to - a man has been arrested in action ever 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.029
 but the balance should not spend a maximum of five years per night 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:14.009
 was a dream come to little caloric has dominance of the consumption of 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.139
 Very local coffee stimulants you're paying for 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:19.539
 this myth that makes you sleep 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:20.640
 I did not know that 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.750
 now no one else can complain Sunday has an excuse not to be 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.700
 identified how can I give that lucky I had the company 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.759
 then we have as a whole is indicated through my life 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:49.789

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:53.779

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:54.550

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:21.070

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.880
