well<00:00:05.800> I<00:00:05.830> know<00:00:06.040> once<00:00:06.309> the<00:00:06.519> economics<00:00:06.939> because

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:07.059 
well I know once the economics because

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:09.210 
well I know once the economics because
I've<00:00:07.540> really<00:00:07.809> enjoyed<00:00:07.870> it<00:00:08.200> in<00:00:08.260> a-levels<00:00:08.800> and<00:00:09.070> I

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.220 
I've really enjoyed it in a-levels and I

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.160 
I've really enjoyed it in a-levels and I
was<00:00:09.309> good<00:00:09.490> at<00:00:09.610> it<00:00:09.700> and<00:00:09.880> looking<00:00:10.840> at<00:00:10.960> South

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.170 
was good at it and looking at South

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.500 
was good at it and looking at South
Hamptons<00:00:11.620> curriculum<00:00:12.610> I<00:00:12.820> saw<00:00:13.030> that<00:00:13.180> it<00:00:13.360> had<00:00:13.390> a

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510 
Hamptons curriculum I saw that it had a

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.910 
Hamptons curriculum I saw that it had a
lot<00:00:13.720> of<00:00:13.750> stats<00:00:14.110> which<00:00:14.350> is<00:00:14.470> something<00:00:14.710> I<00:00:14.769> want

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
lot of stats which is something I want

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.170 
lot of stats which is something I want
to<00:00:14.980> get<00:00:15.070> a<00:00:15.130> lot<00:00:15.250> better<00:00:15.400> I'd<00:00:15.790> heard<00:00:16.000> it<00:00:16.059> was

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
to get a lot better I'd heard it was

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.239 
to get a lot better I'd heard it was
quite<00:00:16.390> important<00:00:16.900> and<00:00:17.230> also<00:00:17.680> when<00:00:17.859> I<00:00:17.949> came<00:00:18.130> on

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:18.249 
quite important and also when I came on

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:20.640 
quite important and also when I came on
the<00:00:18.369> open<00:00:18.669> day<00:00:18.699> just<00:00:19.210> the<00:00:19.810> campus<00:00:20.050> really<00:00:20.439> drew

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
the open day just the campus really drew

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.919 
the open day just the campus really drew
me<00:00:20.679> to<00:00:20.800> had<00:00:21.249> a<00:00:21.279> lot<00:00:21.460> of<00:00:21.490> green<00:00:21.789> and<00:00:21.820> I<00:00:22.269> just<00:00:22.570> like

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:22.929 
me to had a lot of green and I just like

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:24.439 
me to had a lot of green and I just like
the<00:00:23.109> atmosphere<00:00:23.140> here<00:00:23.619> and<00:00:24.009> it<00:00:24.099> felt<00:00:24.279> right

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the atmosphere here and it felt right

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.460 
the atmosphere here and it felt right
one<00:00:25.449> of<00:00:25.509> the<00:00:25.570> big<00:00:25.720> highlights<00:00:26.109> would<00:00:26.320> be<00:00:26.439> a

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
one of the big highlights would be a

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.890 
one of the big highlights would be a
group<00:00:27.009> work<00:00:27.279> and<00:00:27.579> the<00:00:27.880> amount<00:00:28.089> of<00:00:28.210> variety<00:00:28.779> we

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
group work and the amount of variety we

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.319 
group work and the amount of variety we
had<00:00:29.109> in<00:00:29.710> terms<00:00:29.890> of<00:00:30.159> optional<00:00:30.609> modules<00:00:30.999> I<00:00:31.179> took

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
had in terms of optional modules I took

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.479 
had in terms of optional modules I took
some<00:00:31.480> politics<00:00:32.020> once<00:00:32.349> as<00:00:32.529> well<00:00:32.710> to<00:00:33.040> put<00:00:33.250> my

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
some politics once as well to put my

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.610 
some politics once as well to put my
horizons<00:00:33.910> and<00:00:34.150> that<00:00:34.300> was<00:00:34.390> really<00:00:34.570> fun<00:00:34.750> the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
horizons and that was really fun the

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.650 
horizons and that was really fun the
global<00:00:36.010> financial<00:00:36.190> crisis<00:00:37.000> is<00:00:37.150> probably<00:00:37.480> the

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
global financial crisis is probably the

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.540 
global financial crisis is probably the
most<00:00:37.930> important<00:00:38.470> issue<00:00:38.620> at<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:38.980> minute<00:00:39.280> and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
most important issue at the minute and

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.050 
most important issue at the minute and
it's<00:00:39.820> shown<00:00:40.150> the<00:00:40.960> weaknesses<00:00:41.560> in<00:00:42.060> restricting

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
it's shown the weaknesses in restricting

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.940 
it's shown the weaknesses in restricting
ourselves<00:00:43.180> to<00:00:43.600> very<00:00:43.630> basic<00:00:43.960> models<00:00:44.530> of<00:00:44.740> how

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
ourselves to very basic models of how

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.090 
ourselves to very basic models of how
people<00:00:45.400> act<00:00:45.730> and<00:00:46.120> so<00:00:47.020> we<00:00:47.110> want<00:00:47.320> to<00:00:47.500> make

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
people act and so we want to make

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.820 
people act and so we want to make
students<00:00:48.760> think<00:00:48.790> beyond<00:00:49.450> simple<00:00:50.350> theories

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
students think beyond simple theories

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.310 
students think beyond simple theories
and<00:00:50.980> them<00:00:51.130> simple<00:00:51.670> models<00:00:51.970> and<00:00:52.420> to<00:00:53.080> think

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
and them simple models and to think

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.950 
and them simple models and to think
about<00:00:53.560> using<00:00:54.160> a<00:00:54.370> variety<00:00:55.000> of<00:00:55.330> techniques<00:00:55.660> to

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
about using a variety of techniques to

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.390 
about using a variety of techniques to
to<00:00:56.620> get<00:00:56.770> us<00:00:56.890> a<00:00:56.980> more<00:00:57.480> subtle<00:00:58.480> view<00:00:58.900> of<00:00:59.400> economic

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
to get us a more subtle view of economic

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.210 
to get us a more subtle view of economic
decision<00:01:00.760> making<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:02.500> economics<00:01:03.010> curriculum

decision making the economics curriculum

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.260 
decision making the economics curriculum
here<00:01:03.989> uses<00:01:06.120> experimental<00:01:07.120> economics

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
here uses experimental economics

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.360 
here uses experimental economics
behavioral<00:01:08.200> economics<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:09.010> we<00:01:09.070> have<00:01:09.250> an

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
behavioral economics and we have an

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.910 
behavioral economics and we have an
experimental<00:01:09.730> laboratory<00:01:10.390> as<00:01:10.900> well<00:01:10.930> that

experimental laboratory as well that

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.320 
experimental laboratory as well that
actually<00:01:12.040> helps<00:01:12.490> students<00:01:13.030> rerun

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
actually helps students rerun

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.080 
actually helps students rerun
experiments<00:01:14.290> and<00:01:14.500> look<00:01:15.190> at<00:01:15.310> how<00:01:15.520> people<00:01:15.760> make

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
experiments and look at how people make

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.149 
experiments and look at how people make
decisions<00:01:16.210> in<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:16.750> real<00:01:16.870> world<00:01:17.110> not<00:01:17.620> always

economics<00:01:27.220> is<00:01:27.729> really<00:01:27.970> a<00:01:28.000> cutting<00:01:28.420> edge<00:01:28.860> part

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
economics is really a cutting edge part

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.230 
economics is really a cutting edge part
of<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:30.100> discipline<00:01:30.490> now<00:01:30.640> it's<00:01:30.850> very<00:01:31.030> popular

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
of the discipline now it's very popular

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.469 
of the discipline now it's very popular
in<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.659> States<00:01:31.990> but<00:01:32.260> it's<00:01:32.409> not<00:01:32.640> used<00:01:33.640> a<00:01:33.790> lot<00:01:34.060> in

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
in the States but it's not used a lot in

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.750 
in the States but it's not used a lot in
undergraduate<00:01:35.200> teaching<00:01:35.440> in<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.220> UK<00:01:36.690> so<00:01:37.690> it's

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
undergraduate teaching in the UK so it's

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.310 
undergraduate teaching in the UK so it's
we<00:01:39.760> think<00:01:40.000> we're<00:01:40.090> at<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.240> frontier<00:01:40.690> really<00:01:41.110> of

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
we think we're at the frontier really of

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.440 
we think we're at the frontier really of
this<00:01:41.799> sort<00:01:42.040> of<00:01:42.190> teaching<00:01:42.400> and<00:01:42.790> it<00:01:42.909> really<00:01:43.270> does

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
this sort of teaching and it really does

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.320 
this sort of teaching and it really does
help<00:01:43.630> people<00:01:43.840> understand<00:01:44.500> that<00:01:45.460> linkage

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
help people understand that linkage

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.260 
help people understand that linkage
between<00:01:46.500> psychology<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:47.799> economics<00:01:48.270> how

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
between psychology and economics how

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.000 
between psychology and economics how
people<00:01:49.690> think<00:01:49.840> behavioral<00:01:50.380> economics<00:01:50.860> and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
people think behavioral economics and

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.580 
people think behavioral economics and
it's<00:01:51.190> important<00:01:51.610> in<00:01:51.760> all<00:01:52.270> kinds<00:01:53.229> of<00:01:53.350> POD
