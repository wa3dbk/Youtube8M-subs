00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:02.910 

now<00:00:01.449> here's<00:00:01.719> something<00:00:02.230> that<00:00:02.500> you're<00:00:02.740> not

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:02.920 
now here's something that you're not

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.889 
now here's something that you're not
going<00:00:03.280> to<00:00:03.370> find<00:00:03.670> on<00:00:03.940> a<00:00:03.970> brand<00:00:04.359> new<00:00:04.540> house

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:04.899 
going to find on a brand new house

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:08.190 
going to find on a brand new house
hopefully<00:00:05.470> but<00:00:06.220> you<00:00:06.640> could<00:00:07.149> find<00:00:07.569> it<00:00:07.809> on<00:00:07.990> an

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.200 
hopefully but you could find it on an

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.610 
hopefully but you could find it on an
older<00:00:08.650> home<00:00:08.920> and<00:00:09.330> that<00:00:10.330> is<00:00:10.660> multiple<00:00:11.320> layers

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.620 
older home and that is multiple layers

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.199 
older home and that is multiple layers
of<00:00:11.799> roofing<00:00:12.540> now<00:00:13.830> if<00:00:14.830> I<00:00:15.219> was<00:00:15.429> to<00:00:15.580> guess<00:00:15.820> I<00:00:16.150> would

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
of roofing now if I was to guess I would

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.160 
of roofing now if I was to guess I would
say<00:00:16.480> that<00:00:16.720> this<00:00:17.230> house<00:00:17.529> has<00:00:17.949> at<00:00:18.160> least<00:00:18.369> three

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
say that this house has at least three

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.929 
say that this house has at least three
individual<00:00:20.170> layers<00:00:20.650> of<00:00:21.070> composition

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
individual layers of composition

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.870 
individual layers of composition
shingles<00:00:22.269> on<00:00:23.019> top<00:00:23.859> of<00:00:24.099> it<00:00:24.279> now<00:00:24.550> you're

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
shingles on top of it now you're

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.230 
shingles on top of it now you're
probably<00:00:25.150> thinking<00:00:26.009> hey<00:00:27.009> with<00:00:27.640> enough

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
probably thinking hey with enough

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.870 
probably thinking hey with enough
shingles<00:00:29.019> like<00:00:29.289> that<00:00:29.589> the<00:00:29.920> roofs<00:00:30.160> not<00:00:30.310> going

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
shingles like that the roofs not going

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.420 
shingles like that the roofs not going
to<00:00:31.000> leak<00:00:31.179> at<00:00:31.359> all<00:00:31.509> it<00:00:31.720> can't<00:00:32.050> right<00:00:32.619> you're

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
to leak at all it can't right you're

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.760 
to leak at all it can't right you're
probably<00:00:33.700> right<00:00:34.180> and<00:00:34.510> that's<00:00:34.660> that's<00:00:35.469> a<00:00:35.590> good

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
probably right and that's that's a good

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.470 
probably right and that's that's a good
point<00:00:36.010> I've<00:00:36.370> got<00:00:36.550> to<00:00:36.670> say<00:00:36.850> there<00:00:37.120> but<00:00:37.360> the

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
point I've got to say there but the

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.970 
point I've got to say there but the
problem<00:00:38.170> is<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.640> amount<00:00:40.000> of<00:00:40.120> weight<00:00:40.600> that<00:00:40.989> is

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
problem is the amount of weight that is

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.880 
problem is the amount of weight that is
added<00:00:42.489> to<00:00:42.700> the<00:00:42.879> original<00:00:43.420> roof<00:00:43.719> and<00:00:44.020> sometimes

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
added to the original roof and sometimes

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.240 
added to the original roof and sometimes
these<00:00:45.219> roofs<00:00:45.640> aren't<00:00:46.120> designed<00:00:46.539> to<00:00:46.840> take<00:00:47.250> this

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
these roofs aren't designed to take this

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.580 
these roofs aren't designed to take this
much<00:00:48.579> weight<00:00:48.940> so<00:00:49.719> that's<00:00:50.199> the<00:00:50.410> biggest

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
much weight so that's the biggest

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.729 
much weight so that's the biggest
problem<00:00:51.039> other<00:00:51.969> than<00:00:52.090> that<00:00:52.480> yeah<00:00:52.930> it<00:00:53.350> probably

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
problem other than that yeah it probably

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.670 
problem other than that yeah it probably
is<00:00:54.250> a<00:00:54.280> great<00:00:54.640> idea<00:00:54.910> to<00:00:55.390> a<00:00:55.420> pile<00:00:55.899> the<00:00:56.109> layers<00:00:56.320> on

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
is a great idea to a pile the layers on

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.639 
is a great idea to a pile the layers on
and<00:00:57.160> reduce<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.300> amount<00:00:58.930> of<00:00:59.019> water<00:00:59.260> that

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
and reduce the amount of water that

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.139 
and reduce the amount of water that
would<00:00:59.829> eventually<00:01:00.070> leak<00:01:00.550> into<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:00.910> house

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
would eventually leak into the house

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.290 
would eventually leak into the house
something<00:01:02.079> else<00:01:02.559> that<00:01:03.030> happens<00:01:04.030> in<00:01:04.180> a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
something else that happens in a

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.770 
something else that happens in a
situation<00:01:04.540> like<00:01:05.050> this<00:01:05.290> is<00:01:05.950> that<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:07.120> when<00:01:07.630> you

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
situation like this is that the when you

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.580 
situation like this is that the when you
put<00:01:07.980> new<00:01:08.980> shingles<00:01:09.610> on<00:01:09.910> top<00:01:10.690> of<00:01:10.900> old<00:01:11.170> shingles

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
put new shingles on top of old shingles

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.220 
put new shingles on top of old shingles
without<00:01:12.280> putting<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:13.710> some<00:01:14.710> type<00:01:14.980> of<00:01:15.010> a

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
without putting the some type of a

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.230 
without putting the some type of a
barrier<00:01:17.230> in<00:01:17.530> between<00:01:17.800> them<00:01:18.370> which<00:01:18.760> you<00:01:18.970> could

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
barrier in between them which you could

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.500 
barrier in between them which you could
actually<00:01:19.270> use<00:01:20.020> roofing<00:01:20.650> paper<00:01:21.060> what<00:01:22.060> happens

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
actually use roofing paper what happens

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.500 
actually use roofing paper what happens
is<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:23.260> heat<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:24.340> go<00:01:24.580> through<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.030> shingle

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
is the heat can go through the shingle

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.600 
is the heat can go through the shingle
the<00:01:25.870> one<00:01:26.080> shingle<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:27.120> actually<00:01:28.120> build<00:01:28.510> up<00:01:28.780> in

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the one shingle and actually build up in

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.480 
the one shingle and actually build up in
the<00:01:30.610> lower<00:01:31.060> shingle<00:01:31.720> and<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:33.070> don't<00:01:33.130> know

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
the lower shingle and I don't know

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.760 
the lower shingle and I don't know
exactly<00:01:34.120> how<00:01:34.330> the<00:01:34.390> process<00:01:34.720> works<00:01:35.320> I<00:01:35.650> don't

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
exactly how the process works I don't

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.470 
exactly how the process works I don't
want<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:36.130> get<00:01:36.250> carried<00:01:36.520> away<00:01:36.700> here<00:01:37.120> with<00:01:37.270> some

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
want to get carried away here with some

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.290 
want to get carried away here with some
type<00:01:37.690> of<00:01:37.720> a<00:01:37.990> scientific<00:01:38.500> explanation<00:01:39.120> it<00:01:40.120> was

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
type of a scientific explanation it was

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.110 
type of a scientific explanation it was
explained<00:01:40.780> to<00:01:40.900> me<00:01:41.020> by<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.650> roofing<00:01:42.370> company<00:01:42.640> one

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
explained to me by a roofing company one

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.210 
explained to me by a roofing company one
time<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.660> it<00:01:43.720> made<00:01:43.870> a<00:01:43.900> lot<00:01:44.110> of<00:01:44.140> sense<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:45.130> the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
time and it made a lot of sense and the

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.010 
time and it made a lot of sense and the
reason<00:01:45.550> why<00:01:45.670> I<00:01:45.700> said<00:01:46.030> say<00:01:46.390> it<00:01:46.510> makes<00:01:46.720> a<00:01:46.840> lot<00:01:46.960> of

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
reason why I said say it makes a lot of

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.470 
reason why I said say it makes a lot of
sense<00:01:47.350> because<00:01:47.650> I've<00:01:48.040> seen<00:01:48.370> homes<00:01:49.180> with

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
sense because I've seen homes with

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.020 
sense because I've seen homes with
multiple<00:01:49.990> layer<00:01:50.200> multiple<00:01:51.040> layers<00:01:51.520> of<00:01:51.610> roofs

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
multiple layer multiple layers of roofs

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.850 
multiple layer multiple layers of roofs
have<00:01:52.390> this<00:01:52.600> problem<00:01:52.960> what<00:01:53.560> will<00:01:53.680> actually

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
have this problem what will actually

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.490 
have this problem what will actually
happen<00:01:54.160> to<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.730> shingle<00:01:55.150> is<00:01:55.630> it'll<00:01:56.020> start<00:01:56.410> to

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
happen to the shingle is it'll start to

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.430 
happen to the shingle is it'll start to
separate<00:01:57.490> from<00:01:57.940> itself<00:01:58.330> you'll<00:01:58.960> start<00:01:59.290> to

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
separate from itself you'll start to

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.050 
separate from itself you'll start to
lose<00:01:59.680> the<00:02:00.040> top<00:02:00.460> layer<00:02:00.820> of<00:02:01.890> granules<00:02:02.890> and

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
lose the top layer of granules and

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.010 
lose the top layer of granules and
it'll<00:02:04.689> actually<00:02:04.869> fall<00:02:05.619> apart<00:02:06.600> here's<00:02:07.600> a<00:02:07.840> good

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
it'll actually fall apart here's a good

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.229 
it'll actually fall apart here's a good
example<00:02:08.080> of<00:02:08.709> what<00:02:08.890> I'm<00:02:09.039> talking<00:02:09.550> about

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
example of what I'm talking about

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.500 
example of what I'm talking about
this<00:02:10.709> roof<00:02:11.709> here<00:02:12.400> has<00:02:12.670> at<00:02:13.000> least<00:02:13.270> one

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
this roof here has at least one

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.270 
this roof here has at least one
additional<00:02:13.780> layer<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.980> can<00:02:15.010> actually

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
additional layer and you can actually

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.510 
additional layer and you can actually
see<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.120> shingles<00:02:16.540> have<00:02:16.720> separated

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
see that the shingles have separated

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.990 
see that the shingles have separated
completely<00:02:18.520> from<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:20.370> lower<00:02:21.370> layer<00:02:21.670> of

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
completely from the lower layer of

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.059 
completely from the lower layer of
shingles<00:02:22.269> or<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.810> original<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.530> first<00:02:23.800> layer

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
shingles or the original the first layer

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.759 
shingles or the original the first layer
of<00:02:24.099> shingles<00:02:24.610> so<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.330> isn't<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.870> good<00:02:26.110> thing<00:02:26.500> and

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
of shingles so it isn't a good thing and

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.220 
of shingles so it isn't a good thing and
I'm<00:02:27.310> not<00:02:27.640> about<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.060> suggest<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.959> something

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
I'm not about to suggest that something

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.170 
I'm not about to suggest that something
like<00:02:29.560> this<00:02:29.739> is<00:02:29.950> going<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.250> happen<00:02:30.459> every

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
like this is going to happen every

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.440 
like this is going to happen every
single<00:02:31.450> time<00:02:32.040> because<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.220> doesn't<00:02:33.670> but<00:02:34.120> when

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
single time because it doesn't but when

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.800 
single time because it doesn't but when
it<00:02:34.599> does<00:02:34.810> happen<00:02:35.050> you're<00:02:35.590> kind<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:36.130> Sol<00:02:36.910> and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
it does happen you're kind of Sol and

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.650 
it does happen you're kind of Sol and
it's<00:02:38.230> not<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.470> good<00:02:38.799> thing<00:02:39.130> so<00:02:39.459> keep<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.600> in

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
it's not a good thing so keep that in

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.020 
it's not a good thing so keep that in
mind<00:02:41.220> now<00:02:42.220> you've<00:02:42.340> got<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.459> pretty<00:02:42.670> good<00:02:42.850> idea

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
mind now you've got a pretty good idea

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.150 
mind now you've got a pretty good idea
what<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.600> look<00:02:43.750> for<00:02:44.019> if<00:02:44.260> you're<00:02:44.290> planning<00:02:44.950> on

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
what to look for if you're planning on

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.490 
what to look for if you're planning on
