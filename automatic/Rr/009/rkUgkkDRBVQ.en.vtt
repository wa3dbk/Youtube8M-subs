those confused ck 22 is actually to 6.9
so<00:04:37.200> even<00:04:37.500> lighter<00:04:38.090> precise<00:04:39.090> about<00:04:39.390> that<00:04:39.780> Biggs

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
so even lighter precise about that Biggs

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.540 
so even lighter precise about that Biggs
even<00:04:40.260> more<00:04:40.440> impressive<00:04:40.890> whereas<00:04:41.460> this

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
even more impressive whereas this

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.990 
even more impressive whereas this
platinum<00:04:41.940> is<00:04:42.060> to<00:04:42.500> 7.3<00:04:43.500> so<00:04:44.100> again<00:04:44.430> this<00:04:44.610> one<00:04:44.850> is
