it would be accessible to them a lot of

our services projected an overhead

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.110 
our services projected an overhead
screen<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.310> people<00:02:57.459> can<00:02:57.730> look<00:02:57.880> at<00:02:58.030> that

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
screen so the people can look at that

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.640 
screen so the people can look at that
they<00:02:58.239> don't<00:02:58.390> have<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.600> worry<00:02:58.780> about<00:02:58.870> folks<00:02:59.320> and

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
they don't have to worry about folks and

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.190 
they don't have to worry about folks and
service<00:03:00.100> sheets<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.670> we<00:03:01.270> tried<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.570> keep<00:03:01.930> the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
service sheets and we tried to keep the

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.430 
service sheets and we tried to keep the
sort<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.470> songs<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.720> style<00:03:05.050> that<00:03:05.260> people

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
sort of songs and of a style that people

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:13.520 
sort of songs and of a style that people
could<00:03:06.040> possibly<00:03:06.430> join<00:03:06.730> in<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.120> relatively

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.520 

and<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.640> think<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.360> success<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.350> there

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
and I think the success is that there

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.620 
and I think the success is that there
where<00:03:16.740> people<00:03:17.190> who<00:03:17.580> came<00:03:17.760> along<00:03:17.940> at<00:03:18.390> that

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
where people who came along at that

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.660 
where people who came along at that
invitation<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.710> some<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.400> them<00:03:20.520> have

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
invitation and some of them have

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.790 
invitation and some of them have
remained<00:03:20.850> which<00:03:21.300> is<00:03:21.480> obviously<00:03:22.020> an<00:03:22.350> added

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
remained which is obviously an added

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.770 
remained which is obviously an added
bonus<00:03:22.950> but<00:03:23.700> even<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.060> get<00:03:24.180> them<00:03:24.360> through<00:03:24.540> the

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
bonus but even to get them through the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.830 
bonus but even to get them through the
door<00:03:24.960> of<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:26.100> church<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:27.030> was<00:03:27.240> successful

door of the church it was successful

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.000 
door of the church it was successful
from<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.140> point<00:03:28.350> of<00:03:28.500> view

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010
