00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
so they can sit there and do essentially

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.130 
so they can sit there and do essentially
what<00:00:17.980> rule<00:00:18.220> did<00:00:18.580> which<00:00:19.509> was<00:00:19.539> basically

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
what rule did which was basically

Kings<00:00:42.129> what<00:00:42.940> used<00:00:43.120> to<00:00:43.210> happen<00:00:43.269> was<00:00:43.600> you<00:00:43.900> got<00:00:44.050> a

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
Kings what used to happen was you got a

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.810 
Kings what used to happen was you got a
random<00:00:44.320> chance<00:00:44.769> of<00:00:44.949> picking<00:00:45.070> up<00:00:45.280> technologies

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
random chance of picking up technologies

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.119 
random chance of picking up technologies
now<00:00:46.690> what<00:00:46.900> we've<00:00:47.050> done<00:00:47.289> now<00:00:47.350> is<00:00:47.620> you<00:00:47.949> get

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
now what we've done now is you get

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.660 
now what we've done now is you get
points<00:00:48.699> every<00:00:49.390> month<00:00:49.629> to<00:00:50.489> invest<00:00:51.489> into

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
points every month to invest into

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.150 
points every month to invest into
technology<00:00:52.180> and<00:00:52.440> then<00:00:53.440> you'll<00:00:53.620> also<00:00:53.800> gain

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
technology and then you'll also gain

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.860 
technology and then you'll also gain
points<00:00:54.489> if<00:00:54.850> your<00:00:54.969> neighbors<00:00:55.359> happen<00:00:55.719> to<00:00:55.780> have

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
points if your neighbors happen to have

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.930 
points if your neighbors happen to have
technologies<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:56.500> then<00:00:57.039> I<00:00:57.129> can<00:00:57.309> spend<00:00:57.670> points

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
technologies and then I can spend points

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.349 
technologies and then I can spend points
to<00:00:58.780> buy<00:00:58.989> and<00:00:59.320> improve<00:00:59.769> technologies<00:01:00.309> so<00:01:01.239> for

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
to buy and improve technologies so for

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:02.790 
to buy and improve technologies so for
example<00:01:01.390> let's<00:01:01.750> give<00:01:02.019> our<00:01:02.050> army<00:01:02.320> better<00:01:02.500> siege

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
example let's give our army better siege

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.270 
example let's give our army better siege
equipment<00:01:03.750> may<00:01:04.750> be<00:01:04.809> a<00:01:04.899> better<00:01:05.470> some<00:01:06.130> better

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
equipment may be a better some better

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.380 
equipment may be a better some better
keeps<00:01:06.610> and<00:01:08.310> what<00:01:09.310> we<00:01:09.429> want<00:01:09.580> is<00:01:09.789> a<00:01:09.820> bit<00:01:09.970> Majesty

prestige is always nice ally prestige so
what<00:01:15.160> we've<00:01:15.280> done<00:01:15.310> is<00:01:15.640> rather<00:01:16.240> than<00:01:16.420> make<00:01:16.570> the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
what we've done is rather than make the

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.320 
what we've done is rather than make the
technology<00:01:17.200> system<00:01:17.530> very<00:01:17.830> random<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:18.850> you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
technology system very random and you

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.999 
technology system very random and you
kind<00:01:19.569> of<00:01:19.630> just<00:01:19.780> sitting<00:01:20.229> there<00:01:20.259> waiting<00:01:20.410> about

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
kind of just sitting there waiting about

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.740 
kind of just sitting there waiting about
what<00:01:21.640> we<00:01:21.729> try<00:01:21.880> to<00:01:21.910> do<00:01:22.149> is<00:01:22.240> make<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:22.420> far<00:01:22.720> more

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
what we try to do is make it far more

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
interactive and director you know that

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.389 
interactive and director you know that
you<00:01:24.940> pick<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:25.450> choose<00:01:25.770> what<00:01:26.770> technologies

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
you pick and choose what technologies

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.699 
you pick and choose what technologies
you<00:01:27.580> want<00:01:27.819> you<00:01:28.780> have<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.020> kind<00:01:29.229> of<00:01:29.289> see<00:01:29.440> the

00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:29.709 
you want you have the kind of see the

you want you have the kind of see the
kind<00:01:29.890> of<00:01:29.950> familiar<00:01:30.069> paradox<00:01:30.819> troops<00:01:31.119> like

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
kind of familiar paradox troops like

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.900 
kind of familiar paradox troops like
that<00:01:31.509> if<00:01:31.690> you're<00:01:31.840> am<00:01:32.050> if<00:01:32.349> you're<00:01:33.160> each

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
that if you're am if you're each

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.880 
that if you're am if you're each
technology<00:01:34.390> as<00:01:34.630> a<00:01:34.720> year<00:01:35.080> and<00:01:35.259> if<00:01:35.709> you're

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
technology as a year and if you're

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.529 
technology as a year and if you're
trying<00:01:36.099> to<00:01:36.190> research<00:01:36.489> technologies<00:01:37.149> ahead<00:01:37.390> of

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
trying to research technologies ahead of

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.089 
trying to research technologies ahead of
time<00:01:37.750> then<00:01:37.989> it's<00:01:38.410> going<00:01:38.530> to<00:01:38.590> cost<00:01:38.770> you<00:01:38.950> more

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:39.099 
time then it's going to cost you more

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.070 
time then it's going to cost you more
and<00:01:39.310> things<00:01:39.520> like<00:01:39.640> this<00:01:39.789> but<00:01:39.849> the<00:01:40.119> idea<00:01:40.420> is<00:01:40.660> to

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
and things like this but the idea is to

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.979 
and things like this but the idea is to
change<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.770> previous<00:01:42.220> rather<00:01:42.580> random<00:01:42.989> lucky

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:43.989 
change the previous rather random lucky

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:46.440 
change the previous rather random lucky
dip<00:01:44.170> system<00:01:44.560> into<00:01:44.770> something<00:01:45.239> that<00:01:46.239> you

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
dip system into something that you

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.660 
dip system into something that you
yourself<00:01:46.479> control<00:01:47.470> and<00:01:47.800> interact<00:01:48.250> with<00:01:48.459> oh

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
yourself control and interact with oh

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.870

to<00:02:00.940> our<00:02:01.090> laws<00:02:01.300> we<00:02:01.750> can<00:02:01.899> see<00:02:02.050> we<00:02:02.140> can<00:02:02.170> now<00:02:02.319> start

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
to our laws we can see we can now start

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.249 
to our laws we can see we can now start
changing<00:02:02.920> them<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:04.509> got<00:02:04.660> new<00:02:04.810> inheritance

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
changing them we got new inheritance

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.650 
changing them we got new inheritance
laws<00:02:06.060> what<00:02:07.060> we've<00:02:07.179> done<00:02:07.209> is<00:02:07.509> actually

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
laws what we've done is actually

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.199 
laws what we've done is actually
dramatically<00:02:08.500> reduced<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.160> ship's<00:02:09.489> counts

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
dramatically reduced the ship's counts

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.750 
dramatically reduced the ship's counts
of<00:02:10.390> countries<00:02:10.840> in<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.140> game<00:02:11.349> because<00:02:12.310> we

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
of countries in the game because we

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.540 
of countries in the game because we
didn't<00:02:13.120> want<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.810> know<00:02:16.930> and

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
didn't want and the you know and

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.430 
didn't want and the you know and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
him like 800 because it just well it

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.960 
him like 800 because it just well it
felt<00:02:26.680> wrong<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:27.310> know

works<00:02:28.330> we've<00:02:28.870> got<00:02:28.960> the<00:02:29.050> shipbuilding

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
works we've got the shipbuilding

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.800 
works we've got the shipbuilding
technology<00:02:30.250> here<00:02:30.490> which<00:02:31.060> what<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:31.450> does<00:02:31.600> is

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
technology here which what it does is

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.810 
technology here which what it does is
increases<00:02:32.170> your<00:02:32.380> number<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.680> ships<00:02:32.950> so<00:02:33.700> the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
increases your number of ships so the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.430 
increases your number of ships so the
Vikings<00:02:34.270> start<00:02:34.570> with<00:02:34.720> an<00:02:34.810> edge<00:02:35.110> in<00:02:35.380> that

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
Vikings start with an edge in that

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.280 
Vikings start with an edge in that
technology<00:02:36.280> which<00:02:36.910> gives<00:02:37.150> them<00:02:37.360> allows<00:02:38.050> them

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
technology which gives them allows them

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.710 
technology which gives them allows them
to<00:02:38.320> go<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.710> a<00:02:38.860> king<00:02:39.070> without<00:02:39.940> having<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.510> worry

to go of a king without having to worry

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.780 
to go of a king without having to worry
