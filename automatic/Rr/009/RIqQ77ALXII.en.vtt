00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.509
 proteins are essential components 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.759
 of the diet the three functions 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.650
 essentials of living matter nutrition 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.810
 increase 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.490
 they are linked to the molecules 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.490
 and the structures 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.460
 proteins are the only 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.099
 source of nitrogen assimilable for 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.810
 man and has mainly a 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.810
 structural or plastic function 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.020
 they occupy a quantitative place and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.720
 qualitatively important among 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.130
 molecules 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.130
 constituents of living beings 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.109
 their functions are essential for the 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.059
 growth fats and 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:55.579
 carbohydrates you can not substitute 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.840
 proteins because it does not contain nitrogen 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.630
 provides 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.380
 the essential essential amino acids 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.200
 in the synthesis 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.330
 the organism constantly experiences 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.760
 the change of the same supplies 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.460
 raw materials for training 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.520
 digestive juices hormones proteins 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.540
 plasma hemoglobin vitamins and 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.150
 enzymes 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.830
 it is used to supply power and 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.560
 function 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.990
 or tampons helping to keep the 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.390
 reaction of various means such as 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.390
 plasma cerebrospinal fluid 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.390
 its classification taking into account the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.570
 functions of proteins can be 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.510
 classify in 3 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.670
 three structural groups that 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.280
 they find bones in all tissues 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.010
 skin internal organs membranes 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.890
 cellular proteins with activity 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.960
 biological play an active role in 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.659
 all biological processes are the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.580
 enzymes hormones proteins involved 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.910
 in the contraction 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.490
 food proteins are those that 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.210
 They are digestible non-toxic and acceptable 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.210
 for humans 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.220
 the food protein sources of 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.920
 animal origin and high biological value 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.220
 with the meat the fish the egg the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.280
 milk and derivatives 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.430
 of vegetable origin and of low value 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.160
 biological with legumes cereals fruits 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.640
 dry and soy of high biological value 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.340
 carbohydrates 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.950
 carbohydrates or carbohydrates 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.380
 also called sugars are the 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.350
 most abundant organic compounds already 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.200
 the most diverse are integrated 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.600
 by carbon hydrogen and oxygen from there 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.360
 his name are an important part of 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.580
 our diet is to say the set of 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.490
 food made in a day 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.350
 understanding this the diet is composed 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.750
 mainly by carbohydrates lipids 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.020
 and proteins the carbohydrates are 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.230
 classified as simple are sugars from 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.910
 rapid absorption because of its size 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.250
 can begin to digest from the 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.650
 output these generate the immediate 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.650
 insulin secretion are those that 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.870
 they taste sweeter and the complexes are 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.980
 slower absorption and act more like 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.980
 reserve power 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.989
 are my organic molecules formed 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.860
 basically by carbon hydrogen 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.500
 oxygen and phosphorus 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.970
 lipids are heterogeneous substances 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.360
 that have 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.820
 They are insoluble in water and are soluble in 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.470
 organic solvents lipids 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.670
 They perform four types of functions 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.490
 energy reserve function 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.490
 structural function is to say coating 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:54.070
 organs and consistency 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.110
 They put bio catalyst to facilitate 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.460
 chemical reactions that occur in 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.040
 the beings 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.630
 with 100 conveyor 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.700
 the lipids 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.860
 they are divided into simple liquids these are 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.750
 they find in olive oil 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.390
 avocado vegetables dried fruits 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.180
 mani olives and so on 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.180
 and the complex lipids in soybeans and 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.049
 Their derivatives 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.049
 vitamins 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.670
 vitamins are compounds 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:24.760
 heterogeneous 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.620
 for life by ingesting them in a way 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.740
 balanced and in essential doses 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.570
 promote the correct functioning 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.090
 physiological most vitamins 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.880
 Essentials can not be synthesized 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.890
 by the agency so it does not 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.650
 you can get more than through the 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.840
 balanced intake of vitamins 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.940
 contained in food 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.400
 vitamins are nutrients that together 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.160
 with other nutritional elements act 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.460
 as catalysts of all processes 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.460
 physiological 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.999
 the vitamins are classified in two 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:01.449
 fat-soluble vitamins and vitamins 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:04.899
 water-soluble fat-soluble vitamins 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.899
 they are the app 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:13.460
 calcium vitamins and vitamin d is 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:16.610
 tocopherol vitamin k anti magic 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.680
 vitamins does not contain nitrogen are 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.210
 soluble in fat and therefore are 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.120
 transported in the fat of the 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.310
 foods that contain it for another 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.530
 are fairly stable compared to the 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.199
 Heat is absorbed in the intestine 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.509
 thin with food fat and 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:34.360
 can be stored in the body in greater 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:37.439
 or lesser degree 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.439
 water - soluble vitamins 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:48.080
 This group of vitamins includes the 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:51.040
 vitamins b1 b2 b3 b5 b6 v8 v9 b12 and 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.930
 vitamin c ascorbic acid 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.230
 characterized because they dissolve in water 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.500
 so they can go over to the water 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.210
 washing or cooking food 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.120
 many foods rich in this kind of 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.100
 vitamins do not bring us to the end of 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.980
 prepare them the same amount as 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.660
 initially contained to recover 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.750
 part of these vitamins 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:16.090
 some are destroyed by heat and 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.950
 can take advantage of the cooking water of 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.950
 the vegetables for carlos their leaves 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.930
 these vitamins contain nitrogen their 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:27.900
 molecule and they are not stored in the 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.240
 body except for vitamin b12 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.160
 that he does it in an important way in the 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.190
 liver 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.840
 the excess of vitamins ingested 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.390
 secretes in the urine , which is why 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:43.610
 requires daily interference since the 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.610
 not stored depend on the diet
