00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.500
 and here comes the mouse 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.500
 May 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.219
 the teachers 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.319
 4 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.319
 Meierhans have 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.339
 Grandel 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.339
 Dr 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.949
 like here 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.780
 the guerrilla is a big big country 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.530
 in the big big continent Africa 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.530
 in ideal 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.780
 they would live happily ever after 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.429
 If there were not the evil military men 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:50.710
 and the RTL bosses of oil companies diw-chef 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.200
 following these evil people Ghanzi make money making trees for them 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.200
 broken and need the villagers out 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.770
 that's why the villagers are terribly angry at the bleachers and on 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.920
 ship 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.920
 actually, the government should be mad at Shell 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.970
 but Shaqiri he threatens to simply go out with me and rather waste the 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.180
 Economy media and thus to step into the bin 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.369
 because Share says that the Nigerians 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.760
 are completely see through 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.780
 What you can do today is move the core open 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.470
 Of course, the Nigerians do not like that 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.540
 and to make the first place from last year 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.070
 So again the kpÃ¶ come they military men and while they are 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.660
 But even in military men are not loving because they promise democratic 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.050
 to be but it is not 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.440
 what ever 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.440
 Everything is not great in the area a 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.520
 it is always nice and warm 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.360
 I am now putting an end to the hotel in Lagos and that they tell me of the 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.800
 Loving people cocktails so it also has something to do with Audios 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.800
 in Lahr 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.910
 Aden 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.910
 Meierhans have 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.899
 Grandel 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:16.899
 Dr 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:18.859
 Hallelujah
