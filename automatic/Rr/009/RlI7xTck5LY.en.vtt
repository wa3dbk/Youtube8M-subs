lead this contains the list of all the
Patriots<00:03:05.620> but<00:03:06.620> also<00:03:06.830> I<00:03:07.010> took<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:08.240> one<00:03:08.420> we

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
Patriots but also I took it the one we

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.480 
Patriots but also I took it the one we
gave<00:03:08.600> you<00:03:09.050> wasn't<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.530> real<00:03:09.710> thing<00:03:10.690> what<00:03:12.490> this

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
gave you wasn't the real thing what this

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.700 
gave you wasn't the real thing what this
virus<00:03:14.120> is<00:03:14.330> coded<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:14.930> destroy<00:03:15.290> only<00:03:15.680> a

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
virus is coded to destroy only a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.190 
virus is coded to destroy only a
specific<00:03:16.220> part<00:03:16.460> of<00:03:16.580> GW<00:03:17.210> namely<00:03:18.080> the

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
specific part of GW namely the

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.270 
specific part of GW namely the
information<00:03:18.740> about<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.040> Patriots<00:03:19.520> identity

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
information about the Patriots identity

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.070 
information about the Patriots identity
which<00:03:22.280> means<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:23.000> there's<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.540> parameter

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
which means that there's a parameter

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.840 
which means that there's a parameter
coated<00:03:24.440> in<00:03:24.560> here<00:03:24.800> that<00:03:25.010> defines<00:03:25.370> what<00:03:25.610> that

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
coated in here that defines what that

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.530 
coated in here that defines what that
information<00:03:26.060> is<00:03:26.750> I<00:03:27.460> get<00:03:28.460> it<00:03:28.610> analyzed<00:03:29.330> the

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
information is I get it analyzed the

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.240 
information is I get it analyzed the
code<00:03:29.810> and<00:03:29.990> you<00:03:30.050> can<00:03:30.080> probably<00:03:30.470> find<00:03:30.710> out<00:03:31.100> where

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
code and you can probably find out where

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.510 
code and you can probably find out where
they<00:03:31.400> operate<00:03:31.960> count<00:03:32.960> me<00:03:33.170> in<00:03:33.200> no<00:03:33.800> you<00:03:34.310> have

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
they operate count me in no you have

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.250 
they operate count me in no you have
things<00:03:34.820> to<00:03:35.030> do<00:03:35.180> first

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:04:29.150 

and<00:03:38.590> people<00:03:39.040> you<00:03:39.129> need<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:39.400> talk<00:03:39.610> to

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160

I think I found something to pass along
to<00:06:07.960> the<00:06:08.110> future<00:06:08.530> what<00:06:10.080> he<00:06:11.080> said<00:06:11.290> all<00:06:11.470> living

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
to the future what he said all living

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.090 
to the future what he said all living
things<00:06:11.920> want<00:06:12.820> their<00:06:13.120> genes<00:06:13.480> to<00:06:13.840> live<00:06:14.050> on<00:06:14.290> are

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
things want their genes to live on are

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.930 
things want their genes to live on are
you<00:06:15.280> talking<00:06:15.730> about<00:06:15.820> the<00:06:16.090> baby<00:06:16.440> yeah<00:06:17.940> the

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
you talking about the baby yeah the

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.760 
you talking about the baby yeah the
genes<00:06:19.270> aren't<00:06:19.510> the<00:06:19.630> only<00:06:19.780> thing<00:06:20.170> it<00:06:20.320> bears<00:06:20.560> on

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
genes aren't the only thing it bears on

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.100 
genes aren't the only thing it bears on
there<00:06:21.640> are<00:06:21.730> too<00:06:21.940> many<00:06:22.120> things<00:06:22.480> that<00:06:22.840> aren't

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
there are too many things that aren't

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.220 
there are too many things that aren't
written<00:06:23.320> into<00:06:23.710> our<00:06:23.740> DNA<00:06:24.450> it's<00:06:25.450> up<00:06:25.630> to<00:06:25.720> us<00:06:25.930> to
