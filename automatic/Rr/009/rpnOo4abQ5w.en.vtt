00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.350
 before the principle everyone loves katamari by 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.420
 a fantastic coincidence like this 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.929
 and called the game that we are today 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.260

 and in it you have to roll things this 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.270
 already the second part but as we all know 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.490
 sequels are always cooler and the series is quite 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.689
 popular so don't carp at 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.609
 general plot such 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.150
 and let's now without surprised faces 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.679
 first game king of all space 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.140
 possessing extraordinary oblong 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.530
 head 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.809
 once abyuz rainbow well or something like that and 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.180
 destroyed all the stars in the sky then he 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.820
 made the prince restore everything 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.399
 heavenly bodies by rolling 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.739
 katamari very sticky balls prince 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.809
 picking up trash on the streets of the earth and then 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.000
 sent them into space in this way 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.059
 the assignment was completed and now in 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.579
 sequel people of the earth have become huge 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.320
 fans of the king of all space so 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.719
 naturally he turned into 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.299
 narcissistic bummer 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.090
 it's his brazen face screwed up and 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.369
 He forced us to dig their own problems and 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.790
 then I got all the fame to my 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.490
 hands 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.770
 nevertheless now people want all the time 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.270
 see katamari or magic 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.400
 royal rainbow 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.409
 or some other cosmological 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.270
 bullshit and king take aim first 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.830
 refuses but then they are him 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.860
 say compliments he is so well 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.560
 agrees it is about the whole plot 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.479
 This game they want there still show 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.909
 small cartoons about heavy childhood 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.189
 kings who let us know that 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.799
 having gained fame he just became 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.000
 compensate destroyed by father early 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.369
 years of your life 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.680
 remember if you are mistreated 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.600
 earlier it is not a reason to become 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.880
 jerk and blow up all the objects in 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.430
 outer space and generally i 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.790
 of course I'm exaggerating the games just kind 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.790
 humor 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.580
 as i said in this game you need 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.250
 roll things up like a snowball and than 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.280
 the more you make the better that is 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.320
 the whole game is like that scene from indiana 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.090
 johns only if the main character was 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.490
 USA 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.280
 but by the way no matter how hard you try and 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.400
 the king and the people will be unhappy and in 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.480
 the best will call your katamari 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.700
 mediocre 7 out of 10 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.590
 this is such a motivational moment of all 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.420
 bosses are taught to make good 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.610
 workers did not confess not trying 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.500
 arrange a riot and slyly feast on the throne 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.410
 I think the game is the way about it but 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.780
 so here you are prince roll out katamari 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.030
 management works on a tank system 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.860
 that is, to roll forward you must 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.090
 omit both sticks on the gamepad 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.490
 corresponding side 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.209
 want to turn left, press only 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.760
 conduct 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.400
 and so on, the system is non-standard but 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.670
 after a short habituation of control 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.680
 becomes pleasant and importantly 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.110
 unusual levels of scattering he is 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.450
 diverse musa is serious in the world 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.760
 katamari live the most slovenly people 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.340
 which I saw you find on the floor 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.010
 pencils and puzzles sushi beetles 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.170
 flew overland and when fleeing 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.750
 on cats cheese when jumping behind mice 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.420
 cockroaches while running for cuttlefish 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.810
 some plants geese with clarinets 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.000
 clowns battery crabs absolutely that 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.000
 whatever you understand the game is not 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.720
 confined to the interior you 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.060
 appear 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.850
 roll a very small ball 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.790
 some pins and little things but 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.910
 gradually gain mass and become 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.580
 more and now you roll cassettes 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.890
 stapler and small animals in a minute 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.110
 cats and rolls fall under the ball 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.080
 you get bigger roll out on 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.440
 the street and already make a real panic 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.840
 you sunset go out people and cars home town 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.900
 continents and in the end you go into space and 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.090
 roll the sun itself leaving only 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.670
 endless blackness of emptiness 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.130
 reminder of the crimes of the king of all 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.100
 cosmos vs the universe do i need 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.470
 say that the whole match is doe 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.810
 all matches by the way even after that he is all 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.300
 equally not happy dude have you ever 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.580
 heard demotivations you understand what 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.590
 even the vile bosses should have 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.260
 limits and after such a fantastic 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.020
 work you could praise a little 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.840
 the prince with him literally rolled everything 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:26.780
 the thing in the ball and whether to remind it 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.390
 did it less than half an hour before the prince 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.760
 just go from you to competitors and who 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.250
 you will be without him lazy that 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.690
 destroyed universes also merit 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.160
 true then the prince will return to 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.140
 countless sequels on the big 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.840
 number of consoles but I didnâ€™t play them 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.660
 in the end, we can say that katamari is 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.790
 madly funny series roll the ball 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.130
 roll all sorts of things into a snowball 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.980
 to great music and then you can 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.450
 enjoy funny conversations 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.970
 come up with your own gaming vision 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.280
 plot and still stare at everyone 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.440
 infinitely absurd cluster fak out 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.230
