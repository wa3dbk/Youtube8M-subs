00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hey good that such people of youtube 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.569
 here again in another video more to 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.880
 this channel and good in this video you 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.580
 are teaching how to make what 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.190
 is the operating system windows 8 start 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.420
 directly from the desk 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.010
 I prefer that it does not start when we start 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.090
 session or start what you get in the subway 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.769
 but here on the desk and well 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.230
 the truth something rather simple the able 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.180
 for those who bother them much that 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.150
 start here on the desk bothers me 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.840
 well here is the video tutorial quite 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.390
 easy to really use this application that 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.790
 is developed by dotcom tweets and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.149
 well then so let's start with what 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.149
 it's the video 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.410
 good to download what is the 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.710
 application there I'll leave it in a post in 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.380
 my web as always a downloaded one 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.960
 will leave this this file but but the 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.949
 scoop point zip we extract it click 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:09.450
 right extract here 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.149
 do not leave at this point should be executed 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.289
 we give you right click install 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.719
 probably here comes a window 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.100
 that can not be interrupted 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.049
 lean will click on more 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.120
 information and they give to execute of all 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.850
 ways 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.660
 then this window will come out 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.780
 We agree to accept the terms 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.250
 we install we are installing layers 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.480
 do not ask for good he will ask us what is 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.780
 the user account control we give 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.780
 yes 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.899
 and finalized quite fairly simple 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.549
 installation like all of them and well there 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.799
 will be what is activated what she 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.950
 will be initiating what is our 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.299
 system on the desktop to see for 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.429
 Let's check what is the meter 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.170
 we move the bars wait well that is 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.780
 will be what is an application here 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.470
 we click 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.690
 we accept 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.250
 and good we will get this this little 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.530
 application the truth pretty easy to 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.930
 use but also says youtube is 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.400
 expensive and be activated if you get this 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.350
 means what is already activated 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.690
 will start what is the system always 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.940
 in the face the desk good if not 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.840
 we want this good if we want 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.590
 disable it we give you click here 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.970
 the rest and ready there will be disabled 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.129
 to activate them you already know and we click and 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.100
 ready us 30 nobody is activated and 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.900
 the truth quite easy to use 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.760
 something useful the truth for people 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.470
 that bothers you what it is that the system 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.480
 It starts here with this application 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.150
 it will automatically start what it 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.640
 ends at the desk and well 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.470
 quite short tutorial but good as well 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.270
 how good we will not be seeing in another 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.270
 occasion a greeting and until the other
