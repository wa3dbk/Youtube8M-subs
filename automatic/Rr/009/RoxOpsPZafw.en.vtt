00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.280 
you know something guys it doesn't
matter<00:03:41.519> and<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:42.510> reason<00:03:42.660> I<00:03:42.840> say<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.140> doesn't

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
matter and the reason I say it doesn't

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.050 
matter and the reason I say it doesn't
matter<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.799> because<00:03:44.160> whether<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.700> fight<00:03:44.910> is

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
matter is because whether the fight is

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.449 
matter is because whether the fight is
cancelled<00:03:45.540> or<00:03:45.660> not<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.200> I'm<00:03:46.950> talking<00:03:47.280> about

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
cancelled or not and I'm talking about

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.670 
cancelled or not and I'm talking about
of<00:03:47.670> course<00:03:48.000> if<00:03:48.090> it's<00:03:48.209> not<00:03:48.390> cancelled<00:03:48.870> if<00:03:49.019> he

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
of course if it's not cancelled if he

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.830 
of course if it's not cancelled if he
enters<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.250> Octagon<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:51.000> way<00:03:51.150> he<00:03:51.360> looks<00:03:51.600> with

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.490 
the end st octave mountain which is
probably<00:05:27.849> not<00:05:28.120> going<00:05:28.270> to<00:05:28.330> happen<00:05:28.510> I<00:05:28.900> would

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
probably not going to happen I would

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.260 
probably not going to happen I would
probably<00:05:29.680> give<00:05:30.099> Rodgers<00:05:30.550> a<00:05:30.580> better<00:05:30.940> chance<00:05:31.180> to

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
probably give Rodgers a better chance to

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.320 
probably give Rodgers a better chance to
win<00:05:31.389> the<00:05:31.570> fight<00:05:32.130> but<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:33.160> way<00:05:33.340> I<00:05:33.370> see<00:05:33.460> it<00:05:33.700> he's

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
win the fight but the way I see it he's

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.779 
win the fight but the way I see it he's
facing<00:05:34.599> a<00:05:34.930> guy<00:05:35.229> that's<00:05:35.680> bigger<00:05:36.370> than<00:05:36.550> him

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
facing a guy that's bigger than him

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.180 
facing a guy that's bigger than him
stronger<00:05:37.510> than<00:05:37.599> him<00:05:37.780> when<00:05:37.960> I<00:05:38.380> say<00:05:38.620> bigger<00:05:38.860> I

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190

too<00:06:12.310> big<00:06:12.580> so<00:06:13.450> that's<00:06:14.410> going<00:06:14.590> to<00:06:14.650> be<00:06:14.770> a<00:06:14.800> factor

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
too big so that's going to be a factor

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.170 
too big so that's going to be a factor

carrots ha no fight he hit him hard and

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.930 
carrots ha no fight he hit him hard and
you<00:06:27.140> chase<00:06:27.410> after<00:06:27.620> him<00:06:27.860> and<00:06:28.130> you<00:06:28.220> keep<00:06:28.580> on<00:06:28.760> top

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
you chase after him and you keep on top

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.910 
you chase after him and you keep on top
of<00:06:29.000> him<00:06:29.210> and<00:06:29.240> keep<00:06:29.510> on<00:06:29.630> hitting<00:06:29.900> him<00:06:30.020> it's<00:06:30.830> a

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:30.920 
of him and keep on hitting him it's a

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.530 
of him and keep on hitting him it's a
chance<00:06:31.190> that<00:06:31.340> you<00:06:31.400> can<00:06:31.550> knock<00:06:31.700> him<00:06:31.730> out<00:06:31.970> but<00:06:32.270> he

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.540 
chance that you can knock him out but he

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.860 
chance that you can knock him out but he
wasn't<00:06:33.500> that<00:06:33.770> big<00:06:33.980> as<00:06:34.100> he<00:06:34.190> is<00:06:34.220> now<00:06:34.490> so<00:06:35.480> that's

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
wasn't that big as he is now so that's

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.540 
wasn't that big as he is now so that's
basically<00:06:36.050> his<00:06:36.530> chance<00:06:36.860> he's<00:06:37.520> a

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
basically his chance he's a

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.280 
basically his chance he's a
one-dimensional<00:06:38.240> fighter<00:06:38.480> went<00:06:38.690> over<00:06:38.930> him<00:06:39.140> if

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
one-dimensional fighter went over him if

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.600 
one-dimensional fighter went over him if
he<00:06:39.410> gets<00:06:39.590> this<00:06:39.710> to<00:06:39.860> the<00:06:39.950> ground<00:06:40.190> he's<00:06:40.400> going<00:06:40.550> to

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
he gets this to the ground he's going to

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.810 
he gets this to the ground he's going to
go<00:06:40.670> for<00:06:40.850> a<00:06:40.880> submission<00:06:41.230> and<00:06:42.460> he<00:06:43.460> has<00:06:43.580> a<00:06:43.610> chance

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:43.820 
go for a submission and he has a chance

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.240 
go for a submission and he has a chance
to<00:06:43.970> knock<00:06:44.180> Rogers<00:06:44.570> out<00:06:44.750> so<00:06:45.020> you<00:06:45.800> know<00:06:45.890> Rogers

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
to knock Rogers out so you know Rogers

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.620 
to knock Rogers out so you know Rogers
has<00:06:46.340> a<00:06:46.370> chance<00:06:46.670> but<00:06:46.940> I<00:06:46.970> give<00:06:47.150> over<00:06:47.390> him<00:06:47.600> a

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
has a chance but I give over him a

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.430 
has a chance but I give over him a
bigger<00:06:47.810> chance<00:06:48.110> i<00:06:48.380> would<00:06:48.440> say<00:06:48.710> over<00:06:49.010> him<00:06:50.440> it's

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
bigger chance i would say over him it's

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.130 
bigger chance i would say over him it's
