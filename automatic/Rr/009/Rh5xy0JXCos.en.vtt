00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
could change one day but right now the

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.220 
could change one day but right now the

reality in Canada's the population is
spread<00:03:11.500> out<00:03:11.769> too<00:03:12.430> much<00:03:12.639> to<00:03:12.970> really<00:03:13.359> facilitate

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
spread out too much to really facilitate

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.979 
spread out too much to really facilitate
enough<00:03:14.980> good<00:03:15.670> clubs<00:03:15.939> what<00:03:16.180> about<00:03:16.329> America<00:03:16.750> can
