00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
thinking about it was when I had a

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.729 
thinking about it was when I had a
chance<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.239> look<00:02:15.390> down<00:02:15.750> on<00:02:15.989> my<00:02:16.140> body<00:02:16.320> on<00:02:16.530> the

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
chance to look down on my body on the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
putting things putting tubes up my nose

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.820 
putting things putting tubes up my nose
to<00:02:21.299> help<00:02:21.420> me<00:02:21.540> breathe<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.140> down<00:02:22.320> my<00:02:22.500> throat

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
to help me breathe and down my throat

the<00:04:35.270> near-death<00:04:35.479> experience<00:04:36.290> is<00:04:36.560> perhaps<00:04:37.280> a

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
the near-death experience is perhaps a

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.390 
the near-death experience is perhaps a

perhaps near-death experiences are

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.520 
perhaps near-death experiences are
caused<00:04:48.530> by<00:04:48.740> drugs<00:04:49.130> or<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:50.630> bright<00:04:50.930> light<00:04:51.200> is

after eight years of research we have

after eight years of research we have
demonstrated<00:04:57.289> that<00:04:58.070> none<00:04:58.640> of<00:04:58.669> those

demonstrated that none of those
explanations<00:04:59.360> are<00:04:59.840> adequate<00:05:00.260> but<00:05:00.740> the

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
explanations are adequate but the

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.219 
explanations are adequate but the
near-death<00:05:01.400> experience<00:05:02.030> is<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:02.240> natural<00:05:02.990> and
