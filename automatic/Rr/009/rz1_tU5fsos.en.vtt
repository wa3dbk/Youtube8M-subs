we're going to talk about how to attack
coverages<00:00:07.970> utilizing<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.389> bunch<00:00:09.690> formation

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
coverages utilizing the bunch formation

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.830 
coverages utilizing the bunch formation
when<00:00:11.160> utilizing<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.790> bunch<00:00:12.000> formation<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.660> lot

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
when utilizing a bunch formation a lot

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.169 
when utilizing a bunch formation a lot
of<00:00:12.960> teams<00:00:13.170> like<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.590> designate<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.250> distinct

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
of teams like to designate a distinct

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.390 
of teams like to designate a distinct
call<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.170> strong<00:00:16.500> side<00:00:16.529> or<00:00:17.100> what<00:00:17.250> they

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
call to the strong side or what they

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.400 
call to the strong side or what they
declared<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.940> be<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.150> strong<00:00:18.390> side<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:19.199> see

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
declared to be the strong side you see

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.310 
declared to be the strong side you see
here<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.039> bunch<00:00:20.400> type<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:21.000> set<00:00:21.320> they

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
here in this bunch type of set they

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.230 
here in this bunch type of set they
designate<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.070> side<00:00:23.310> as<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> strong<00:00:23.850> side<00:00:24.090> so

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
designate this side as a strong side so

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.670 
designate this side as a strong side so
they<00:00:24.359> bring<00:00:24.510> their<00:00:24.689> strong<00:00:24.960> safety<00:00:25.320> over<00:00:25.500> here

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
they bring their strong safety over here

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.529 
they bring their strong safety over here
so<00:00:26.070> now<00:00:26.250> there's<00:00:26.519> even<00:00:26.760> numbers<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.300> if<00:00:27.420> this

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
so now there's even numbers so if this

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.570 
so now there's even numbers so if this
guy<00:00:27.720> comes<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.170> way<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:28.800> three<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.340> three

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
guy comes this way it's three on three

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.609 
guy comes this way it's three on three
the<00:00:30.029> free<00:00:30.269> sages<00:00:30.599> also<00:00:30.779> shaded<00:00:31.199> toward<00:00:31.289> that

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the free sages also shaded toward that

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.920 
the free sages also shaded toward that
side<00:00:31.830> as<00:00:32.130> well<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.669> if<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.570> ask<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
side as well so if you ask the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.470 
side as well so if you ask the
quarterback<00:00:34.410> seed<00:00:34.739> there's<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.309> strength<00:00:36.300> a

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
quarterback seed there's a strength a

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.780 
quarterback seed there's a strength a
defensive<00:00:37.110> strength<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.559> left<00:00:37.829> side<00:00:38.040> you

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
defensive strength to the left side you

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.430 
defensive strength to the left side you
can<00:00:38.820> come<00:00:39.180> back<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.629> by<00:00:39.840> making<00:00:40.260> an

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
can come back this by making an

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.010 
can come back this by making an
adjustment<00:00:40.590> call<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.640> call<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> motion<00:00:42.540> with

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
adjustment call you call a motion with

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.110 
adjustment call you call a motion with
the<00:00:43.050> last<00:00:43.410> guy<00:00:43.770> available<00:00:44.610> that's<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.910> tail

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
the last guy available that's the tail

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.970 
the last guy available that's the tail
back<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> shoot<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> side<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
back to the shoot to the side of the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.740 
back to the shoot to the side of the
field<00:00:47.129> where<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.700> numbers<00:00:48.120> right<00:00:48.539> here

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
field where you have numbers right here

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.510 
field where you have numbers right here
is<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.680> motion<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.070> guy<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.280> here

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
is to on to you motion this guy on here

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.790 
is to on to you motion this guy on here
quickly<00:00:50.910> now<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.170> three-on-two

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
quickly now you have a three-on-two

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.660 
quickly now you have a three-on-two
advantage<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:54.510> key<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.469> motion<00:00:55.710> guy<00:00:56.070> has

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
advantage the key is the motion guy has

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.970 
advantage the key is the motion guy has
to<00:00:56.910> be<00:00:57.059> late<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.199> cadence<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.800> may

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
to be late in the cadence so you may

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.099 
to be late in the cadence so you may
have<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> slant<00:00:59.609> call<00:00:59.940> here<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.809> want<00:01:01.020> to

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
have a slant call here but you want to

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.260 
have a slant call here but you want to
make<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.379> motion<00:01:01.590> call<00:01:01.949> later<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
make the motion call later on in the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.609 
make the motion call later on in the
Katyn<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.719> if<00:01:03.840> your<00:01:03.960> cadence<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.409> getting

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
Katyn so if your cadence is getting

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.320 
Katyn so if your cadence is getting
ready<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.489> come<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.030> them<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.210> there

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
ready just to come to them in there

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.880 
ready just to come to them in there
you're<00:01:06.420> about<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.659> snap<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.990> football<00:01:07.320> then

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
you're about to snap the football then

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.260 
you're about to snap the football then
you<00:01:08.040> want<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.250> designate<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.700> guy<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.909> go<00:01:09.180> in

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
you want to designate the guy to go in

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.700 
you want to designate the guy to go in
motion<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:09.990> instance<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.350> let's<00:01:10.530> say<00:01:10.650> you

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
motion for instance so let's say you

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.010 
motion for instance so let's say you
have<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> slight<00:01:11.520> call<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.270> make<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> check<00:01:12.780> call

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
have a slight call you make a check call

have a slight call you make a check call
to<00:01:13.260> 90<00:01:13.650> cent<00:01:13.890> or<00:01:14.070> one<00:01:14.310> ninety<00:01:14.670> slant<00:01:14.939> wherever

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
to 90 cent or one ninety slant wherever

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.480 
to 90 cent or one ninety slant wherever
the<00:01:15.630> terminology<00:01:16.200> may<00:01:16.350> be<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.280> this

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
the terminology may be you have this

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.190 
the terminology may be you have this
tight<00:01:17.729> end<00:01:17.909> right<00:01:18.090> here<00:01:18.240> cross<00:01:18.600> your<00:01:18.810> face<00:01:18.990> on

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
tight end right here cross your face on

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.870 
tight end right here cross your face on
the<00:01:19.619> slant<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.340> guy<00:01:20.490> breaking

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the slant you have this guy breaking

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.490 
the slant you have this guy breaking
here<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.479> coming<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> slant<00:01:22.350> but

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
here and coming in on the slant but

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.770 
here and coming in on the slant but
though<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.369> last<00:01:23.640> motion<00:01:24.030> has<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.570> be<00:01:24.689> this

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
though the last motion has to be this

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.870 
though the last motion has to be this
tailback<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.380> lately<00:01:25.590> cadence<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.310> send<00:01:26.790> this

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
tailback so lately cadence you send this

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.030 
tailback so lately cadence you send this
guy<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.299> motion<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.439> want<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.710> snap<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
guy in motion and you want to snap the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.890 
guy in motion and you want to snap the
ball<00:01:29.189> right<00:01:29.549> when<00:01:29.790> he<00:01:29.939> gets<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> outside

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
ball right when he gets on the outside

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.130

edge<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:32.130> tight<00:01:32.430> end<00:01:32.640> reason<00:01:33.329> being<00:01:33.509> this

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
edge of that tight end reason being this

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.660 
edge of that tight end reason being this
guy<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.470> gonna<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.950> make<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> decision

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
guy is gonna have to make a decision
