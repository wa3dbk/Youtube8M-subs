00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
throughout the year and for two

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.810 
throughout the year and for two
different<00:02:01.130> reasons<00:02:02.830> first<00:02:03.830> because<00:02:04.100> of<00:02:04.670> its

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
different reasons first because of its

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.150 
different reasons first because of its
orbit<00:02:05.240> is<00:02:05.390> an<00:02:05.570> ellipse<00:02:05.900> and<00:02:06.080> not<00:02:06.440> a<00:02:06.470> circle

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
orbit is an ellipse and not a circle

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.880 
orbit is an ellipse and not a circle
their<00:02:07.760> earth<00:02:07.910> moves<00:02:08.300> faster<00:02:08.899> when<00:02:09.440> it<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.680> near

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
their earth moves faster when it is near

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.820 
their earth moves faster when it is near
the<00:02:09.920> Sun<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:10.610> slower<00:02:11.600> when<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.350> is<00:02:12.470> further

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
the Sun and slower when it is further

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.690 
the Sun and slower when it is further
from<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.250> Sun<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.830> little<00:02:16.100> extra<00:02:16.520> amount

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
from the Sun so the little extra amount

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.210 
from the Sun so the little extra amount
of<00:02:16.790> rotation<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:18.230> earth<00:02:18.410> needs<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:18.980> do

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
of rotation that the earth needs to do

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.120 
of rotation that the earth needs to do
to<00:02:19.760> get<00:02:19.910> from<00:02:20.060> noon<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.600> noon<00:02:21.130> changes

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
to get from noon to noon changes

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.530 
to get from noon to noon changes
throughout<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:22.520> year

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.690 

second<00:02:28.540> because<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.590> earth<00:02:29.800> is<00:02:30.040> tilted<00:02:30.099> on

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
second because the earth is tilted on

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.930 
second because the earth is tilted on
its<00:02:30.730> axis<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:32.200> little<00:02:32.530> extra<00:02:32.950> rotation<00:02:33.129> to

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
its axis the little extra rotation to

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.630 
its axis the little extra rotation to
get<00:02:34.150> from<00:02:34.390> noon<00:02:34.629> to<00:02:34.870> noon<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.410> largest<00:02:36.160> at<00:02:36.459> the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
get from noon to noon is largest at the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.100 
get from noon to noon is largest at the
solstices<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:37.709> smallest<00:02:38.709> at<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.040> equinoxes

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
solstices and smallest at the equinoxes

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.559 
solstices and smallest at the equinoxes
so<00:02:41.110> solar<00:02:41.470> days<00:02:41.860> grow<00:02:42.430> progressively<00:02:43.239> longer

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
so solar days grow progressively longer
