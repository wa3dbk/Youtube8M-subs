00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
which is a more hard plastic and then

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.070 
which is a more hard plastic and then
the<00:01:03.690> inside<00:01:04.129> shell<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.970> case<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.299> made<00:01:06.750> of

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
TPU which is a lighter weight product

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.590 
TPU which is a lighter weight product
it's<00:01:10.619> kind<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.860> like<00:01:11.040> silicone<00:01:11.790> but<00:01:12.090> more

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
it's kind of like silicone but more

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.649 
it's kind of like silicone but more
sturdy<00:01:12.930> more<00:01:13.290> plasticky<00:01:14.270> man<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.630> a

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
sturdy more plasticky man this is a

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.560 
sturdy more plasticky man this is a
little<00:01:16.020> difficult<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.590> take<00:01:16.770> off<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.570> I

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
little difficult here to take off and I

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.830 
little difficult here to take off and I
guess<00:01:18.720> I'll<00:01:18.890> pause<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.100> here<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:21.540> then<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:21.750> we

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
guess I'll pause it here and then if we

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.149 
guess I'll pause it here and then if we
flip<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> back<00:01:22.439> here<00:01:22.680> you've<00:01:22.830> got<00:01:22.860> your

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
flip it to the back here you've got your

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.240 
flip it to the back here you've got your

speaker cut out you've got a nice little
logo<00:01:28.799> here<00:01:29.040> that's<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.640> speech<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
logo here that's a speech in this is the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.600 
logo here that's a speech in this is the
silver<00:01:31.500> back<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.159> then<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> blue

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
silver back and then the blue

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
silver back and then the blue
surrounding<00:01:33.150> here<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.509> that

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
surrounding here this is that

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.719 
surrounding here this is that
polyurethane<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.650> adds<00:01:34.920> protection

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
polyurethane this just adds protection

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.399 
polyurethane this just adds protection
to<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:35.880> phone<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.780> if<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:36.960> drop<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.380> just

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
to your phone so if you drop it it just

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.590 
to your phone so if you drop it it just
makes<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.740> more<00:01:37.950> impact<00:01:38.340> resistant<00:01:39.030> another

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
makes it more impact resistant another

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.819 
makes it more impact resistant another
thing<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.960> like<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.350> little<00:01:40.619> raised

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
thing that I like is this little raised

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.380 
thing that I like is this little raised
edge<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.520> set<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.850> down<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.360> table

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
edge so if you set it down on the table

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.580 
edge so if you set it down on the table
you're<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:42.930> going<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.170> scratch<00:01:43.380> up<00:01:43.560> your

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
you're not going to scratch up your

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.929 
you're not going to scratch up your
screen<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.100> course<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.399> does<00:01:44.549> come<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.820> a

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
screen of course it does come with a

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.940 
screen of course it does come with a
screen<00:01:45.750> protector<00:01:46.049> which<00:01:46.619> would<00:01:46.770> also

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
screen protector which would also

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.889 
screen protector which would also
protect<00:01:47.280> your<00:01:47.579> screen<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.570> little<00:01:48.720> raised

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
protect your screen this little raised

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.600
