00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
bitterness since we're gonna be roasting

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.130 
bitterness since we're gonna be roasting
with<00:01:29.729> some<00:01:29.909> olive<00:01:30.180> oils<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.600> salt<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:30.990> don't

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
with some olive oils and salt we don't

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.270 
with some olive oils and salt we don't
have<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.409> be<00:01:31.500> too<00:01:31.680> worried<00:01:32.010> about<00:01:32.100> that

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
have to be too worried about that

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.430 
have to be too worried about that
because<00:01:32.549> it'll<00:01:32.790> cook<00:01:33.060> out<00:01:33.270> but<00:01:33.900> if<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.020> are<00:01:34.229> so

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
because it'll cook out but if you are so

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.960 
because it'll cook out but if you are so
taking<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> eggplant<00:01:35.250> instead<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.580> roasting

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
taking the eggplant instead of roasting

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.480 
taking the eggplant instead of roasting
it<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.240> would<00:01:36.659> recommend<00:01:37.200> dredging<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.190> in<00:01:38.310> some

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
it I would recommend dredging it in some

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.180 
it I would recommend dredging it in some
salt<00:01:38.930> letting<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.020> sit<00:01:40.260> for<00:01:40.290> 10<00:01:40.619> minutes

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
salt letting it sit for 10 minutes

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.000 
salt letting it sit for 10 minutes
squeeze<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.119> dry<00:01:42.330> rinse<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.440> and<00:01:43.590> squeeze<00:01:43.860> it

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
squeeze it dry rinse it and squeeze it

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.440 
squeeze it dry rinse it and squeeze it
again<00:01:44.100> that'll<00:01:44.729> get<00:01:44.850> rid<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.030> any<00:01:45.150> bitterness
