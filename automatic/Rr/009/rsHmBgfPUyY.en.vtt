so that would have huge impacts for the
Xbox<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.680> course<00:02:39.920> because<00:02:40.250> they're<00:02:40.489> saying

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
Xbox of course because they're saying

that all devices come with a camera and

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.399 
that all devices come with a camera and
you<00:02:42.950> can't<00:02:43.280> take<00:02:43.489> it<00:02:43.639> away<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:44.870> bill<00:02:45.139> would

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
you can't take it away this bill would

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.699 
you can't take it away this bill would
make<00:02:45.650> them<00:02:46.250> do<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.700> otherwise<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.959> also<00:02:48.200> says

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
make them do that otherwise it also says

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.890 
make them do that otherwise it also says
that<00:02:48.739> any<00:02:49.220> time<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.819> device<00:02:50.060> is<00:02:50.299> on<00:02:50.540> and

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
that any time that the device is on and

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.920 
that any time that the device is on and
recording<00:02:51.500> or<00:02:51.739> capturing<00:02:52.519> data<00:02:52.790> that<00:02:53.510> they

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
would be required to show you on screen

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.949 
would be required to show you on screen
and<00:02:56.359> say<00:02:56.959> we<00:02:57.590> are<00:02:57.829> watching<00:02:58.129> you<00:02:58.489> on<00:02:58.700> screen<00:02:59.629> so

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
and say we are watching you on screen so

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.170 
and say we are watching you on screen so
that<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.230> consumer<00:03:00.680> knows<00:03:00.859> exactly<00:03:01.370> when

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
that the consumer knows exactly when

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.080 
that the consumer knows exactly when
they<00:03:02.359> are<00:03:02.659> being<00:03:02.930> recorded<00:03:03.409> and<00:03:03.680> looked<00:03:04.519> at<00:03:04.760> so

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
they are being recorded and looked at so

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.970 
they are being recorded and looked at so
again<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:05.629> could<00:03:05.930> have<00:03:06.109> huge<00:03:06.560> implications

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
again this could have huge implications

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.759 
again this could have huge implications
for<00:03:07.969> the<00:03:08.120> xbox<00:03:08.569> one<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.019> I<00:03:09.319> do<00:03:09.379> want<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.680> make

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
for the xbox one and I do want to make

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.940 
for the xbox one and I do want to make
clear<00:03:09.950> this<00:03:10.219> bill<00:03:10.459> was<00:03:10.669> not<00:03:11.079> created<00:03:12.079> for<00:03:12.769> the

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
this is technology that we've created

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.270 
this is technology that we've created
this<00:04:24.440> is<00:04:24.650> next<00:04:25.010> gen

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
this is next gen

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
raishin you know next generation isn't

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.500 
raishin you know next generation isn't
just<00:04:27.620> a<00:04:27.830> controller<00:04:28.400> in<00:04:28.670> your<00:04:28.820> hand<00:04:29.030> next

generation means voice activation

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.490 
generation means voice activation
controls<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:31.820> means<00:04:32.000> facial<00:04:32.690> recognition<00:04:32.840> it

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
controls it means facial recognition it

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.490 
controls it means facial recognition it
means<00:04:33.950> you<00:04:34.280> know<00:04:34.400> motion<00:04:35.180> controls<00:04:36.169> as<00:04:36.470> well

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
means you know motion controls as well

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.520 
means you know motion controls as well
so<00:04:37.250> Microsoft<00:04:38.000> is<00:04:38.150> saying<00:04:38.389> this<00:04:38.660> is<00:04:38.900> an<00:04:39.050> input

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
so Microsoft is saying this is an input

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.980 
so Microsoft is saying this is an input
for<00:04:39.710> our<00:04:39.889> device<00:04:40.280> just<00:04:40.880> like<00:04:41.090> a<00:04:41.270> mouse<00:04:41.540> is<00:04:41.840> an

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
for our device just like a mouse is an

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.780 
for our device just like a mouse is an
input<00:04:42.380> for<00:04:42.560> your<00:04:42.710> computer<00:04:43.100> and<00:04:43.250> you<00:04:43.639> know<00:04:43.760> a

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
input for your computer and you know a

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.520 
input for your computer and you know a
mouse<00:04:44.120> wasn't<00:04:44.540> always<00:04:44.690> an<00:04:45.020> input<00:04:45.290> for<00:04:45.380> your

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
mouse wasn't always an input for your

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.290 
mouse wasn't always an input for your
computer<00:04:45.860> whenever<00:04:46.550> they<00:04:46.669> first<00:04:46.910> developed

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
computer whenever they first developed

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.280 
computer whenever they first developed
it<00:04:47.419> i'm<00:04:47.540> sure<00:04:47.570> there<00:04:47.810> was<00:04:47.900> people<00:04:48.200> who

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
it i'm sure there was people who

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.350 
it i'm sure there was people who
probably<00:04:48.500> said<00:04:48.980> you<00:04:49.460> know<00:04:49.580> I'm<00:04:49.730> completely

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
probably said you know I'm completely

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.940 
probably said you know I'm completely
fine<00:04:50.660> with<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.870> keyboard<00:04:51.080> why<00:04:51.470> do<00:04:51.530> I<00:04:51.710> need<00:04:51.919> a

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
fine with the keyboard why do I need a

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.820 
fine with the keyboard why do I need a
mouse<00:04:52.220> and<00:04:53.120> so<00:04:53.450> there<00:04:53.660> was<00:04:53.810> backlash<00:04:54.320> for<00:04:54.680> that

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
mouse and so there was backlash for that

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.190 
mouse and so there was backlash for that
I'm<00:04:55.040> sure<00:04:55.220> so<00:04:55.580> this<00:04:56.060> is<00:04:56.240> just<00:04:56.570> another<00:04:56.900> input

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
I'm sure so this is just another input

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.380 
I'm sure so this is just another input
if<00:04:57.530> you<00:04:57.620> look<00:04:57.830> at<00:04:57.950> it<00:04:58.070> like<00:04:58.220> that<00:04:58.280> but<00:04:59.150> I<00:04:59.180> can

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
if you look at it like that but I can

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.580 
if you look at it like that but I can
definitely<00:04:59.540> see<00:04:59.900> both<00:05:00.140> sides<00:05:00.350> of<00:05:00.500> the

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
definitely see both sides of the

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.530 
definitely see both sides of the
spectrum<00:05:00.710> I'm<00:05:01.190> interested<00:05:01.550> to<00:05:01.910> know<00:05:02.090> what<00:05:02.360> you
