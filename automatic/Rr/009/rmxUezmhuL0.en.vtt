stove<00:00:18.960> designs<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.800> how<00:00:20.279> there<00:00:20.490> really

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
stove designs and how there really

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.730 
stove designs and how there really
wasn't<00:00:21.000> anything<00:00:21.359> new<00:00:21.689> out<00:00:21.720> there<00:00:22.230> it's<00:00:22.470> all

you know that's really really no new
designs<00:00:29.249> out<00:00:29.490> there<00:00:29.550> everything's<00:00:30.419> pretty

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
designs out there everything's pretty

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.470 
designs out there everything's pretty
much<00:00:30.779> stagnant<00:00:31.640> you<00:00:32.640> almost<00:00:32.759> think<00:00:33.120> at<00:00:33.300> times

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
much stagnant you almost think at times

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.090 
much stagnant you almost think at times
that<00:00:33.720> may<00:00:33.900> be<00:00:33.960> all<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.230> good<00:00:34.530> ideas<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:35.070> been

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
that may be all the good ideas have been

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.460 
that may be all the good ideas have been
using<00:00:35.430> they<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:35.940> how<00:00:36.060> many<00:00:36.120> left<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:37.230> that's

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
using they just how many left but that's

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.070 
using they just how many left but that's
not<00:00:37.560> true<00:00:37.950> there<00:00:38.430> are<00:00:38.460> other<00:00:38.900> designs<00:00:39.900> out

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
not true there are other designs out

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.720 
not true there are other designs out
there<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.440> just<00:00:40.620> haven't<00:00:40.980> discovered<00:00:41.310> him<00:00:41.520> yet

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
there we just haven't discovered him yet

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.440 
there we just haven't discovered him yet
but<00:00:42.380> there<00:00:43.380> is<00:00:43.500> one<00:00:43.710> ray<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.220> hope<00:00:45.150> and<00:00:45.360> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
place where he could buy it that's what

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.959 
place where he could buy it that's what
I'm<00:01:14.159> trying<00:01:14.399> to<00:01:14.460> say<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.600> anyway<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.670> stove

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
I'm trying to say so anyway it's a stove

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.270 
I'm trying to say so anyway it's a stove
that<00:01:18.179> burns<00:01:18.450> isopropyl<00:01:19.380> alcohol<00:01:19.469> seventy

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
that burns isopropyl alcohol seventy

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.450 
that burns isopropyl alcohol seventy
percent<00:01:20.539> it's<00:01:21.539> a<00:01:21.780> steel<00:01:22.079> can<00:01:22.439> design<00:01:22.920> oh<00:01:23.310> I

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
percent it's a steel can design oh I

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.069 
percent it's a steel can design oh I
don't<00:01:23.759> know<00:01:23.939> maybe<00:01:24.149> three<00:01:24.509> cause<00:01:24.719> of<00:01:24.840> an<00:01:24.899> inch

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
don't know maybe three cause of an inch

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.940 
don't know maybe three cause of an inch
high<00:01:25.289> and<00:01:25.729> then<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.999> this<00:01:27.899> this<00:01:28.350> was<00:01:28.619> really

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
high and then and this this was really

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.279 
high and then and this this was really
the<00:01:29.100> icing<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.819> cake<00:01:29.999> it<00:01:30.569> has<00:01:30.749> a<00:01:30.780> built-in

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
the icing on the cake it has a built-in

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.349 
the icing on the cake it has a built-in
pot<00:01:31.649> stand<00:01:32.009> where<00:01:32.249> he<00:01:32.280> slotted<00:01:32.789> it<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.149> four

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
pot stand where he slotted it in four

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.559 
pot stand where he slotted it in four
places<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.049> folded<00:01:34.889> it<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.310> made<00:01:35.490> a

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
places and folded it in and made a

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.319 
places and folded it in and made a
really<00:01:36.569> nice<00:01:37.139> accurate<00:01:37.950> pot<00:01:38.639> stand<00:01:38.999> and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
really nice accurate pot stand and

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.179 
really nice accurate pot stand and
that's<00:01:39.840> important<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.889> stove

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
that's important because this stove

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.639 
that's important because this stove
requires<00:01:42.179> that<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.659> gap<00:01:42.840> between<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.439> pot

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
requires that the gap between the pot

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.550 
requires that the gap between the pot
and<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:45.240> top<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.689> stove<00:01:45.959> has<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.409> be

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
and the top of the stove has to be

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.789 
and the top of the stove has to be
pretty<00:01:47.159> much<00:01:47.369> exactly<00:01:48.079> perfect<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.590> burn

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
pretty much exactly perfect to burn

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.969 
pretty much exactly perfect to burn
right<00:01:50.069> and<00:01:50.310> with<00:01:51.209> that<00:01:51.240> pasta<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:52.109> the<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
right and with that pasta it's the the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.209 
right and with that pasta it's the the
gap<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.789> set<00:01:54.030> perfectly<00:01:54.469> real<00:01:55.469> good<00:01:55.770> design

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
gap is set perfectly real good design

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.309 
gap is set perfectly real good design
now<00:01:56.909> I've<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> haven't<00:01:57.659> used<00:01:57.929> one<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.170> his

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
now I've you I haven't used one of his

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.679 
now I've you I haven't used one of his
but<00:01:58.679> i<00:01:58.709> have<00:01:59.039> used<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.579> very<00:01:59.850> similar<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.359> it

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
but i have used one very similar to it
