00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.900
 I use something like this 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.930
 It is a very hard thing- 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.170
 What is this for example 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:15.390
 Well this should I have had to Toko say 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:20.240
 Or the thing that sucked the role of the source role in the fact that you want applied to be here. 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.240
 Rather than not actually devote to this state such Fu 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:31.270
 It's to round and round winding and on the corresponding wound with it a newspaper is this 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:38.020
 Then I This is a short can these things 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:41.260
 This in that they contain a metal can be securely fixed this Der of 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.270
 You will be experienced in your 2-chome after 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.170
 What is here 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.850
 It is called the sore welfare 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.700
 It's really like this 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:56.800
 It can be folded like this 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:59.460
 It can be bent and you can reshape it freely with scissors . 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.390
 I often bend here 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:09.440
 I will bend over here 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:11.770
 For example, it is possible to wind around such a place and fix it in the state to match the roundness of the arm. 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.770
 Hall 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:19.259
 It is a strike that the biggest difference is 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.259
 That's a lot there 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.170
 The label may say something like this is very light 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.040
 And it is what particularly it is the other person one can say here 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.760
 And put away Yeah minute Nakanishi 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.440
 I will keep it fixed like this for a long time 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.190
 Exhibited this part 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:46.220
 I know Then is it still in a blender 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:52.330
 At that time , the newspaper absorbs some moisture and there 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:56.080
 There is a thing that it keeps maintaining to some extent in the fixed environment 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.970
 It's there is no action that cast Toka I minister is the kind of thing 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.880
 Well after the theme 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.500
 It may be very cheap Fishing is cheap 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:11.840
 It's still high number of points 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:13.260
 So you may say also be cheaper money to get from the patient's own 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.720
 Actually 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.650
 I little I'd beat this kind of mother 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.650
 Because it becomes difficult 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.980
 I will only teach you this 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.370
 In this way 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.150
 I will prevent the bandage from moving here 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.150
 Then I will 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:44.190
 I think that I'm here answering does not work 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:47.300
 Then I gradually shift it so that it doesn't have to be suppressed. 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.300
 I will roll like this 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.950
 And 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.930
 In such Fu 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.930
 I have already taken 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.200
 It earlier of a thumb went 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.330
 Put between the thumb and forefinger 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.340
 Put it between your thumb and forefinger 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.209
 By say 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.980
 It is ready to 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:38.630
 Only you will not be moving a little mix Please longer call this a wrist 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.630
 It I can anymore this is the one I wrist of the body
