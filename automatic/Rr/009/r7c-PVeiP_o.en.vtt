00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.750 
actually going to show the console a lot
of<00:03:35.640> people<00:03:35.910> just<00:03:35.940> seeing<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.510> controller<00:03:36.959> but

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
of people just seeing the controller but

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.710 
of people just seeing the controller but
nobody's<00:03:38.760> really<00:03:39.000> seeing<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.540> actual

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
nobody's really seeing the actual

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.810 
nobody's really seeing the actual
console<00:03:40.590> so<00:03:40.920> they're<00:03:41.130> probably<00:03:41.160> going<00:03:41.730> to

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
console so they're probably going to

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.170 
console so they're probably going to
show<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:42.510> console<00:03:43.050> for<00:03:43.530> this<00:03:43.650> uh<00:03:43.700> we<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.940> as

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
show the console for this uh we you as

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.170 
show the console for this uh we you as
far<00:03:45.989> as<00:03:46.110> games<00:03:46.410> I<00:03:46.770> think<00:03:47.760> they're<00:03:47.910> just<00:03:47.940> going

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
far as games I think they're just going

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.750 
far as games I think they're just going
to<00:03:48.239> show<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.480> lot<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:48.780> titles<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.530> data<00:03:50.400> come<00:03:50.640> out

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
to show a lot of titles of data come out

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.920 
to show a lot of titles of data come out
I<00:03:50.790> don't<00:03:50.970> think<00:03:51.150> they<00:03:51.239> can<00:03:51.300> show<00:03:51.480> too<00:03:51.720> many

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
I don't think they can show too many

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.780 
I don't think they can show too many
exclusive<00:03:52.440> itaú<00:03:52.709> titles<00:03:53.280> yet<00:03:53.370> for<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.640> week

making the same titles that they have in

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.189 
making the same titles that they have in
making<00:06:05.849> this<00:06:05.940> make<00:06:06.120> a<00:06:06.150> newer<00:06:06.389> version<00:06:06.479> because

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 
making this make a newer version because

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.930 
making this make a newer version because
that<00:06:07.530> you<00:06:07.860> know<00:06:08.159> people<00:06:08.520> want<00:06:08.610> to<00:06:08.759> see<00:06:08.909> that

think Sony is really gonna try to

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.730 
think Sony is really gonna try to
revolutionize<00:06:18.870> gaming<00:06:19.319> with<00:06:19.440> this<00:06:19.560> new

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
revolutionize gaming with this new

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.350 
revolutionize gaming with this new
console<00:06:20.219> and<00:06:20.370> I<00:06:20.669> think<00:06:20.880> they<00:06:20.940> want<00:06:21.090> to<00:06:21.150> start

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
console and I think they want to start

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.170 
console and I think they want to start
fresh<00:06:21.710> with<00:06:22.710> new<00:06:22.740> ideas<00:06:23.219> and<00:06:23.759> really<00:06:23.940> try<00:06:24.150> to

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
fresh with new ideas and really try to

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.990 
fresh with new ideas and really try to
get<00:06:24.360> the<00:06:24.479> people<00:06:24.630> um<00:06:25.380> as<00:06:26.159> far<00:06:26.610> as<00:06:26.789> their

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
get the people um as far as their

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.149 
get the people um as far as their
PlayStation<00:06:27.360> Vita<00:06:27.810> I<00:06:28.110> also<00:06:28.530> believe<00:06:28.919> they'll

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:29.159 
PlayStation Vita I also believe they'll

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:31.700 
PlayStation Vita I also believe they'll
have<00:06:29.370> some<00:06:29.669> sort<00:06:29.940> of<00:06:30.090> call<00:06:30.810> of<00:06:30.840> duty<00:06:31.229> showcase

have some sort of call of duty showcase

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.129 
have some sort of call of duty showcase
but<00:06:32.159> with<00:06:32.430> their<00:06:32.669> Vita<00:06:33.000> I<00:06:33.270> think<00:06:33.599> they'll<00:06:33.900> be

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
but with their Vita I think they'll be

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:35.990 
but with their Vita I think they'll be
announcing<00:06:34.740> an<00:06:34.949> exclusive<00:06:35.520> call<00:06:35.729> of<00:06:35.820> duty
