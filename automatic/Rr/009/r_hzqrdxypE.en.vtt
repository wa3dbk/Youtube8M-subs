00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
technology essentially and they want to

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.780 
technology essentially and they want to
place<00:01:37.680> place<00:01:38.159> Walla<00:01:38.850> Pistons<00:01:39.979> there<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.280> then

repeaters<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.479> redstone<00:01:55.350> wiring<00:01:56.570> and<00:01:57.570> then

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
repeaters and redstone wiring and then

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.569 
repeaters and redstone wiring and then
here<00:01:58.079> it's<00:01:58.680> really<00:01:58.920> over<00:01:59.040> placement<00:01:59.399> there

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579

or<00:02:02.490> watcher<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.540> varied<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.280> changes<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
or watcher and in varied and changes the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.130 
or watcher and in varied and changes the
current<00:02:05.670> basically<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.479> flip<00:02:06.840> around<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
current basically to flip around the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.399 
current basically to flip around the
other<00:02:07.200> way

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
other way

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.100 
other way
so<00:02:07.819> when

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
so when

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.960 
so when
very<00:02:10.680> quickly<00:02:11.450> when<00:02:12.450> input<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.810> on<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.940> a

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
very quickly when input is on the a

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.000 
very quickly when input is on the a
piece<00:02:15.180> off<00:02:15.360> like<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.440> that's<00:02:16.590> off<00:02:16.800> what

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
piece off like that and that's off what

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.070 
piece off like that and that's off what
you<00:02:17.070> want<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.310> be<00:02:17.490> you<00:02:17.840> wanted<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.900> be<00:02:18.960> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
you want to be you wanted to be the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.830 
you want to be you wanted to be the
power<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.350> be<00:02:19.410> on<00:02:20.060> when<00:02:21.060> they<00:02:21.150> piss<00:02:21.330> off<00:02:21.540> and

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
power to be on when they piss off and

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.440 
power to be on when they piss off and
the<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.530> be<00:02:22.680> off<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.700> then<00:02:23.790> puts<00:02:23.940> on<00:02:24.120> so

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
the that to be off and then puts on so

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.450 
the that to be off and then puts on so
basically<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:25.140> reveals<00:02:25.530> itself<00:02:25.860> that's<00:02:26.280> just

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
basically it reveals itself that's just

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.390 
basically it reveals itself that's just
to<00:02:26.550> be<00:02:26.720> quick<00:02:27.720> care<00:02:28.070> 101<00:02:29.070> thing<00:02:29.820> there<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:31.400> let

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
to be quick care 101 thing there and let

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.980 
to be quick care 101 thing there and let
me<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.640> want<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:32.910> take<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.210> in<00:02:33.300> there<00:02:33.450> and

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
me you want to take that in there and

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.080 
me you want to take that in there and
then<00:02:35.480> two<00:02:36.480> blocks<00:02:36.720> there<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.260> then<00:02:38.040> as<00:02:38.310> we're

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
then two blocks there and then as we're

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.640 
then two blocks there and then as we're
T<00:02:39.240> keeps<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.510> t-shape<00:02:39.990> sort<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.290> important

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
T keeps a t-shape sort of important

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.370 
T keeps a t-shape sort of important
again<00:02:41.120> because<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:42.810> where<00:02:42.960> you<00:02:43.020> gonna<00:02:43.110> play

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
again because it's where you gonna play

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.240 
again because it's where you gonna play
some<00:02:43.530> your<00:02:43.560> important<00:02:44.130> wiring<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:46.250> don't

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
some your important wiring and I don't

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.570 
some your important wiring and I don't
need<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.520> there<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:47.970> was<00:02:48.060> just<00:02:48.209> for<00:02:48.420> a

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
need that there that was just for a

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.130 
need that there that was just for a
there's<00:02:50.580> no<00:02:50.700> what<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:50.940> place<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.540> you

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
there's no what to place that and you

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.940 
there's no what to place that and you
can<00:02:52.260> wire<00:02:52.410> all<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:52.590> up<00:02:53.510> alright<00:02:54.740> I'm<00:02:55.740> at<00:02:55.860> that

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
can wire all this up alright I'm at that

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:04.430 
can wire all this up alright I'm at that
attempt<00:02:56.400> and<00:03:00.380> yeah<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:02.959> now<00:03:03.959> he's<00:03:04.080> done<00:03:04.260> that

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
attempt and yeah and now he's done that

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.910 
attempt and yeah and now he's done that
you<00:03:04.890> want<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.220> go<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.730> other<00:03:05.820> side<00:03:06.090> and

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
you want to go to the other side and

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.560 
you want to go to the other side and
then<00:03:07.920> place<00:03:08.520> pistons<00:03:08.940> this<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.300> where<00:03:09.450> your

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
then place pistons this is where your

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.449 
then place pistons this is where your
walkways<00:03:09.930> gonna<00:03:10.110> be<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:10.980> have<00:03:11.280> like<00:03:11.430> a

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
walkways gonna be so you have like a

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.949 
walkways gonna be so you have like a
stone<00:03:11.730> there<00:03:11.970> which<00:03:12.420> means<00:03:12.510> your<00:03:12.690> person<00:03:12.900> is

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
stone there which means your person is

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.570 
stone there which means your person is
what<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.170> be<00:03:13.260> there<00:03:15.050> and<00:03:16.070> now<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.250> can<00:03:17.310> place

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
what to be there and now you can place

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.320 
what to be there and now you can place
your<00:03:17.610> alright<00:03:18.000> it's<00:03:18.840> based<00:03:19.050> on<00:03:19.200> again<00:03:20.330> okay

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
your alright it's based on again okay

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.780 
your alright it's based on again okay
that's<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.600> disappeared<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:24.000> now<00:03:24.180> your<00:03:24.450> dark

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
another wife or their these pistons are

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:41.140 
another wife or their these pistons are
exactly<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.709> same<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.040> site

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.040 

and<00:03:42.150> while<00:03:42.540> sup<00:03:42.960> together<00:03:43.350> now<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:44.610> then<00:03:45.150> that

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
and while sup together now and then that

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.059 
and while sup together now and then that
ones<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.380> there's<00:03:46.530> important<00:03:46.980> because

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
ones and there's important because

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.440 
ones and there's important because
that's<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.370> one<00:03:47.520> with<00:03:47.760> what<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.240> pressure

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
that's the one with what the pressure

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.910 
that's the one with what the pressure
plates<00:03:48.750> gonna<00:03:48.930> be<00:03:49.020> on<00:03:49.110> so<00:03:49.470> you<00:03:49.560> can<00:03:49.680> state<00:03:49.890> your

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
plates gonna be on so you can state your

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.970 
plates gonna be on so you can state your
pressure<00:03:50.160> plate<00:03:50.370> on<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.580> now<00:03:51.170> and<00:03:52.170> know<00:03:52.920> you

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
pressure plate on that now and know you

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.730 
pressure plate on that now and know you
can<00:03:54.080> close<00:03:55.080> all<00:03:55.380> this<00:03:55.500> up<00:03:55.740> and<00:03:57.560> then<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.650> was

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
can close all this up and then I was

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.720 
can close all this up and then I was
gonna<00:03:58.800> be<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:58.980> was<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.130> duck<00:03:59.459> because<00:03:59.580> I'm

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
gonna be it was a duck because I'm

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:09.229 
gonna be it was a duck because I'm
really<00:03:59.880> smooth<00:04:00.240> stone<00:04:07.160> and<00:04:08.160> I<00:04:08.340> think<00:04:08.580> it's<00:04:08.700> way

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
really smooth stone and I think it's way

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.150 
really smooth stone and I think it's way
what<00:04:09.420> is<00:04:09.569> all<00:04:09.780> best<00:04:10.230> integers<00:04:10.590> why<00:04:10.709> half-year

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
what is all best integers why half-year

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.520 
what is all best integers why half-year
am<00:04:11.370> on<00:04:11.640> my<00:04:11.790> other<00:04:11.880> one<00:04:12.060> is<00:04:12.239> having<00:04:12.570> a<00:04:13.610> sort<00:04:14.610> of

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
am on my other one is having a sort of

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.140 
am on my other one is having a sort of
drop<00:04:16.530> down<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:17.040> like<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.340> ceiling<00:04:17.730> to<00:04:17.970> drop

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
drop down and like a ceiling to drop

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.690 
drop down and like a ceiling to drop
down<00:04:18.329> because<00:04:18.660> otherwise<00:04:18.780> they<00:04:19.640> when<00:04:20.640> you

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
down because otherwise they when you

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.930 
down because otherwise they when you
stand<00:04:20.940> on<00:04:21.060> here<00:04:21.650> and<00:04:22.650> it's<00:04:23.490> pretty<00:04:23.790> hard<00:04:23.910> to

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
stand on here and it's pretty hard to

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.200 
stand on here and it's pretty hard to
see<00:04:24.180> if<00:04:24.600> this<00:04:24.810> is<00:04:24.990> wrong<00:04:25.530> so<00:04:25.740> yeah<00:04:26.150> it's<00:04:27.150> very

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
see if this is wrong so yeah it's very

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.080 
see if this is wrong so yeah it's very
hard<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.540> notice<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:28.590> just<00:04:28.740> looks<00:04:28.860> like<00:04:28.919> a

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
hard to notice it just looks like a
