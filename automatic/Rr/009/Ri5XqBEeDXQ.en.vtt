mortar coming so it just constantly
spins<00:02:36.160> like<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:36.810> but<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:38.340> thought<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.520> would

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
spins like this but I thought that would

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.600 
spins like this but I thought that would
be<00:02:39.880> perfect<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.750> build<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:44.070> mortar<00:02:45.070> put<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.370> motor

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
be perfect to build a mortar put a motor

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.610 
be perfect to build a mortar put a motor
on<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:47.220> yeah<00:02:48.220> forward<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.880> reverse<00:02:49.240> and

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
on it and yeah forward and reverse and

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.640 
on it and yeah forward and reverse and
coming<00:02:50.620> off<00:02:50.770> of<00:02:50.800> that<00:02:51.480> actually<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.600> be<00:02:52.750> yeah

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
coming off of that actually to be yeah

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.710 
coming off of that actually to be yeah
it'll<00:02:53.950> be<00:02:54.160> turned<00:02:54.430> around<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.850> other<00:02:54.940> way<00:02:55.950> but

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
it'll be turned around the other way but

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.500 
it'll be turned around the other way but
have<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.950> like-kind<00:02:59.950> of<00:03:00.280> like<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.520> scooter<00:03:01.150> chair

actual<00:05:39.670> board<00:05:40.300> on<00:05:40.630> here<00:05:41.080> with<00:05:41.920> some<00:05:42.130> sort<00:05:42.310> of

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
actual board on here with some sort of

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.160 
actual board on here with some sort of
notches<00:05:43.060> and<00:05:43.290> they<00:05:44.290> welded<00:05:44.920> like<00:05:45.930> some<00:05:46.930> sort

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
notches and they welded like some sort

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.040 
notches and they welded like some sort
of<00:05:47.320> hitch<00:05:47.770> onto<00:05:48.070> it<00:05:48.460> to<00:05:49.360> use<00:05:49.540> it<00:05:49.720> for<00:05:49.750> something

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
of hitch onto it to use it for something

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.310 
of hitch onto it to use it for something
else<00:05:50.410> and<00:05:50.800> so<00:05:51.730> my<00:05:52.090> guess<00:05:52.150> is<00:05:52.330> they<00:05:52.660> used<00:05:52.930> it<00:05:53.170> to

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
else and so my guess is they used it to

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.390 
else and so my guess is they used it to
pull<00:05:53.620> something<00:05:54.360> but<00:05:55.360> it's<00:05:55.690> gotta<00:05:56.340> get<00:05:57.340> I

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
pull something but it's gotta get I

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.080 
pull something but it's gotta get I
guess<00:05:57.670> this<00:05:57.850> is<00:05:58.030> the<00:05:58.060> hydraulic<00:05:58.830> reservoir

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
guess this is the hydraulic reservoir

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.980 
guess this is the hydraulic reservoir
the<00:06:01.090> oil<00:06:01.300> reservoir<00:06:01.960> for<00:06:02.290> it<00:06:02.440> and<00:06:03.690> they<00:06:04.690> cut

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
the oil reservoir for it and they cut

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.320 
the oil reservoir for it and they cut
one<00:06:05.320> of<00:06:05.470> the<00:06:05.650> I<00:06:05.980> guess<00:06:06.580> this<00:06:06.820> would<00:06:07.000> be<00:06:07.180> where

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
one of the I guess this would be where

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.220 
one of the I guess this would be where
the<00:06:07.480> handle<00:06:08.110> is<00:06:08.320> for<00:06:08.890> the<00:06:08.980> snowblower<00:06:09.580> and

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
the handle is for the snowblower and

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.550 
the handle is for the snowblower and
this<00:06:11.230> lever<00:06:11.560> here<00:06:11.940> actually<00:06:12.990> adjust<00:06:13.990> the<00:06:14.260> tilt

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
this lever here actually adjust the tilt

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.410 
this lever here actually adjust the tilt
on<00:06:14.890> it<00:06:15.100> so<00:06:15.940> I'll<00:06:16.060> just<00:06:16.530> I'll<00:06:17.530> just<00:06:17.620> solid<00:06:18.420> that

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.420 
on it so I'll just I'll just solid that

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
on it so I'll just I'll just solid that
one<00:06:20.310> somewhere<00:06:21.310> there<00:06:21.820> and<00:06:22.200> it'll<00:06:23.200> work

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
one somewhere there and it'll work

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.880 
one somewhere there and it'll work
absolutely<00:06:23.860> awesome<00:06:24.450> so<00:06:25.560> that's<00:06:26.560> gonna<00:06:26.740> be

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
absolutely awesome so that's gonna be

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:33.720 
absolutely awesome so that's gonna be

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.410 
haven't even looked at it myself but

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.470 
haven't even looked at it myself but
yeah<00:06:38.590> this<00:06:38.800> is<00:06:38.950> gonna<00:06:39.100> be<00:06:39.310> really<00:06:39.670> awesome<00:06:40.030> i

yeah this is gonna be really awesome i
figured<00:06:41.430> um<00:06:42.930> because<00:06:43.930> you<00:06:44.050> can't<00:06:44.290> break

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
figured um because you can't break

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.310 
figured um because you can't break
either<00:06:45.010> side<00:06:45.610> i'll<00:06:46.420> have<00:06:46.690> to<00:06:46.900> make<00:06:47.080> the

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
either side i'll have to make the

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.180 
either side i'll have to make the
scooter<00:06:47.920> like<00:06:48.430> a<00:06:48.840> regular<00:06:49.840> sized<00:06:50.350> scooter

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190

like an old man scooter or whatever

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.740 
like an old man scooter or whatever
because<00:06:53.470> you<00:06:54.250> need<00:06:54.520> weight<00:06:54.970> on<00:06:55.240> the<00:06:55.510> front

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:58.780 
skis to actually be able to turn so

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.130 
skis to actually be able to turn so
you'll<00:06:59.380> be<00:06:59.470> sitting<00:06:59.890> just<00:07:00.340> in<00:07:00.630> like<00:07:01.630> literally

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:02.140
