programming director for socket i helped
develop<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:10.650> it's<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.190> soccer<00:00:11.429> ball

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
develop this it's a soccer ball

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.060 
develop this it's a soccer ball
generator<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:12.780> inside<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.530> ball<00:00:13.710> there's

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
generator so inside the ball there's

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.369 
generator so inside the ball there's
actually<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.490> mechanism<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.150> stores<00:00:16.080> energy

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
actually a mechanism that stores energy

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.710 
actually a mechanism that stores energy
so<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.100> when<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.550> play<00:00:17.940> with<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.240> ball<00:00:18.420> if

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
so that when you play with the ball if

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.290 
so that when you play with the ball if
it's<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.170> game<00:00:19.439> if<00:00:19.859> you're<00:00:20.010> doing<00:00:20.699> taps<00:00:20.970> or

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
it's in a game if you're doing taps or

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.420 
it's in a game if you're doing taps or
dribbling<00:00:21.779> by<00:00:21.960> yourself<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.650> actually<00:00:22.859> stores

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
dribbling by yourself it actually stores

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.220 
dribbling by yourself it actually stores
the<00:00:23.730> energy<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:24.359> when<00:00:24.510> you're<00:00:24.660> playing<00:00:24.900> and

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
the energy of when you're playing and

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.109 
the energy of when you're playing and
you<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.529> use<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.830> later<00:00:25.980> as<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.369> power<00:00:26.789> source

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
you can use it later as a power source

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.550 
you can use it later as a power source
so<00:00:27.539> if<00:00:27.689> your<00:00:27.840> home<00:00:27.990> does<00:00:28.199> not<00:00:28.380> have

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
so if your home does not have

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.669 
so if your home does not have
electricity<00:00:28.800> if<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:30.119> need<00:00:30.449> extra<00:00:30.929> power<00:00:31.230> for

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
electricity if you need extra power for

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.650 
electricity if you need extra power for
a<00:00:31.710> lamp<00:00:32.279> for<00:00:32.430> reading<00:00:32.940> which<00:00:33.149> charge<00:00:33.450> your

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
a lamp for reading which charge your

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.510 
a lamp for reading which charge your
cell<00:00:33.870> phone<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.559> socket<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.100> there<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.460> that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
cell phone the socket is there and that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.370 
cell phone the socket is there and that
can<00:00:35.730> help<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.360> reason<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:36.719> decided<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.260> use

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
can help the reason we decided to use

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.369 
can help the reason we decided to use
soccer<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:38.040> because<00:00:38.430> everybody<00:00:39.030> is

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
soccer it's because everybody is

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:40.970 
soccer it's because everybody is
enthusiastic<00:00:40.379> about<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.739> everybody

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
enthusiastic about it everybody

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.060 
enthusiastic about it everybody
understands<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.230> very<00:00:43.440> accessible

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
understands it it's a very accessible

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.190 
understands it it's a very accessible
ideas<00:00:44.700> that's<00:00:45.059> why<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.390> started<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:45.930> soccer

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
ideas that's why we started with soccer

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.799 
ideas that's why we started with soccer
there<00:00:46.890> are<00:00:47.010> quite<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.280> few<00:00:47.399> challenges<00:00:47.820> one<00:00:48.450> was

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
there are quite a few challenges one was

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.010 
there are quite a few challenges one was
was<00:00:49.620> getting<00:00:49.980> people<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.460> dream<00:00:50.670> with<00:00:50.730> us<00:00:51.090> none

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
was getting people to dream with us none

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.209 
was getting people to dream with us none
of<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> girls<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.620> we're<00:00:52.829> working<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.190> this

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
of the girls that we're working on this

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.279 
of the girls that we're working on this
project<00:00:53.460> are<00:00:53.760> actually<00:00:54.059> engineers<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:55.110> was

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
project are actually engineers that was

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.650 
project are actually engineers that was
quite<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.530> big<00:00:55.739> issue<00:00:55.949> but<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.789> think<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.239> that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
quite a big issue but I think that that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.139 
quite a big issue but I think that that
our<00:00:58.199> lack<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.559> experience<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> field<00:00:59.850> was

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
our lack of experience in the field was

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.840 
our lack of experience in the field was
actually<00:01:00.719> an<00:01:00.930> asset<00:01:01.440> ultimately<00:01:02.010> because<00:01:02.730> it

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
actually an asset ultimately because it

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.070 
actually an asset ultimately because it
allowed<00:01:03.149> us<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> bit<00:01:04.049> more

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
allowed us to have a bit more

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.530 
allowed us to have a bit more
imagination<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:05.100> said<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.090> something<00:01:06.420> we

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
imagination we said this is something we

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.060 
imagination we said this is something we
want<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.840> keep<00:01:06.990> doing<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.650> something<00:01:07.920> we

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
want to keep doing this is something we

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.190 
want to keep doing this is something we
want<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.340> keep<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.700> developing<00:01:09.000> even<00:01:09.990> though

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
want to keep on developing even though

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.350 
want to keep on developing even though
if<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.740> were<00:01:10.920> an<00:01:11.040> engineer<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.520> might<00:01:11.880> say<00:01:12.119> you

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
if I were an engineer I might say you

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.539 
if I were an engineer I might say you
know<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.720> not<00:01:12.900> enough<00:01:13.080> energy<00:01:13.439> all<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.490> us

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
know it's not enough energy all of us

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.690 
know it's not enough energy all of us
have<00:01:14.610> traveled<00:01:15.119> pretty<00:01:15.210> extensively<00:01:15.900> in

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
have traveled pretty extensively in

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.950 
have traveled pretty extensively in
resource-poor<00:01:17.700> errors<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.420> knew<00:01:18.630> that

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
resource-poor errors so we knew that

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.600 
resource-poor errors so we knew that
just<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.350> little<00:01:19.650> bit<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.860> electricity<00:01:20.280> would

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
just a little bit of electricity would

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.190 
just a little bit of electricity would
be<00:01:20.729> enough<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.180> make<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> difference<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:22.080> you

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
be enough to make a difference if you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.140 
be enough to make a difference if you
have<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.590> charge<00:01:23.250> your<00:01:23.400> cell<00:01:23.640> phone<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.030> no

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
have to charge your cell phone you no

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.700 
have to charge your cell phone you no
longer<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.689> walk<00:01:24.869> miles<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.320> miles<00:01:25.500> you

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
longer have to walk miles and miles you

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.679 
longer have to walk miles and miles you
can<00:01:25.860> do<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> home<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.509> don't

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
can do it in the home so that you don't

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.480 
can do it in the home so that you don't
have<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> walk<00:01:28.140> through<00:01:28.170> dangerous<00:01:28.740> areas<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
have to walk through dangerous areas the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.460 
have to walk through dangerous areas the
first<00:01:29.759> version<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> ball<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.810> had<00:01:30.990> we

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
first version of the ball that we had we

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.020 
first version of the ball that we had we
made<00:01:31.619> ourselves<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.430> was<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.820> normal

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
made ourselves it was just a normal

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.300 
made ourselves it was just a normal
soccer<00:01:33.390> ball<00:01:33.659> we<00:01:33.869> cut<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.200> open<00:01:34.350> put<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.189> a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
soccer ball we cut it open put in a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.010 
soccer ball we cut it open put in a
shake<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.579> charge<00:01:35.939> torch<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.509> shake<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.780> up

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
shake to charge torch you shake it up

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.960 
shake to charge torch you shake it up
and<00:01:37.170> then<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.530> actually<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.250> same<00:01:38.490> sort<00:01:38.850> of

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
and then it actually the same sort of

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.670 
and then it actually the same sort of
mechanism<00:01:39.090> that's<00:01:39.630> what<00:01:39.900> causes<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.409> charge
