little arm back here that swings the
pendulum<00:01:10.549> so<00:01:11.549> what<00:01:11.760> we<00:01:11.850> need<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:13.820> this<00:01:14.820> little

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
pendulum so what we need is this little

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.240 
pendulum so what we need is this little
piece<00:01:15.420> right<00:01:15.689> here<00:01:17.509> and<00:01:18.710> it's<00:01:19.710> basically<00:01:20.159> like

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
piece right here and it's basically like

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.570 
piece right here and it's basically like
a<00:01:20.400> little<00:01:20.520> see<00:01:21.950> this<00:01:22.950> thing<00:01:23.159> one's<00:01:23.340> being<00:01:23.490> a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
a little see this thing one's being a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:42.270 
a little see this thing one's being a
little<00:01:23.820> CrackBerry

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.130 

so<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.430> toppings<00:01:43.880> broke<00:01:44.119> off<00:01:44.330> so<00:01:44.810> when<00:01:45.020> it

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
so the toppings broke off so when it

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.670 
so the toppings broke off so when it
comes<00:01:45.380> it's<00:01:45.979> cause<00:01:46.580> to<00:01:46.759> catch<00:01:46.970> it<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:51.350> let's

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
comes it's cause to catch it and let's

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.499 
comes it's cause to catch it and let's
go<00:01:52.040> because<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.580> top<00:01:52.759> ones<00:01:52.940> should<00:01:53.119> grab<00:01:53.300> it

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
go because the top ones should grab it

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:54.850 
go because the top ones should grab it
and<00:01:53.600> then<00:01:53.690> should<00:01:54.080> be<00:01:54.170> like<00:01:54.350> top<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:54.770> grab

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
and then should be like top and grab

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.859 
and then should be like top and grab
bottom<00:01:55.310> or<00:01:55.460> grab<00:01:55.640> top<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.210> grab<00:01:56.360> bottom<00:01:56.720> and

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
bottom or grab top and grab bottom and

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.080
