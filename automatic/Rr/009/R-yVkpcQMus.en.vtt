00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
Arnold drew up a very

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.430 
Arnold drew up a very
report<00:00:56.060> of<00:00:56.180> his<00:00:56.300> encounter<00:00:56.630> that<00:00:57.050> contained

capabilities of the observed UFOs

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.640

because<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.360> objects<00:01:02.810> passed<00:01:03.050> in<00:01:03.260> front<00:01:03.530> of

because the objects passed in front of
some<00:01:03.830> mountain<00:01:04.190> peaks<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:04.640> disappeared

behind others Arnold was able to make a
fairly<00:01:08.030> accurate<00:01:08.240> estimate<00:01:08.960> of<00:01:09.050> the<00:01:09.200> relative

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
fairly accurate estimate of the relative

fairly accurate estimate of the relative
distance<00:01:10.070> on<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:11.390> basis<00:01:11.780> of<00:01:11.900> this<00:01:12.050> estimate

distance on the basis of this estimate

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.530 
distance on the basis of this estimate
he<00:01:13.100> calculated<00:01:13.640> that<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:13.970> objects<00:01:14.390> were

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540
