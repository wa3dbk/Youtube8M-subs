00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.120

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.010
 campaign in management at the level of 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.010
 national sports club 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.149
 but you that clear when he talks about 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.559
 foreign equivalent every now and then 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.719
 not all of you pay the cards in Italy 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.899
 then of ciampino and in the marine one 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.629
 inhabited by euro and worked for four 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.510
 in the area the elements that have their own 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.200
 for our search actually not 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.540
 were worth 4 spirit are people yes 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.540
 sick person can affect operations 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.159
 putting up a bed and finding them e 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.830
 they have the right not to be stupid though 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.020
 possible question pin not only with 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.659
 our president as he does not have 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.780
 understood how bad the Neapolitan people are 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:38.729
 but how much is the 20 inches that if it is 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.500
 clear to this point from 800 we are not 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.119
 we and I know how to say it as it is the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.619
 prediction attached and finished 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.250
 glad you could get married 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.390
 but I wonder why it's not the new 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.369
 let's call it the south as one 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.280
 Empire province for mid-morning is 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.670
 seen I did not understand belongs to one 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.290
 province film the road beneventano nome 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.560
 your speak are not even things are 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.420
 go as you know and ask for it I ask 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.420
 good 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.939
 center a little abnormal facilitates retention 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.530
 secret of urgent naples but what are you 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.160
 saying she is someone who does not appear i 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.959
 Neapolitans and folders right that the 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.790
 excuse strong mattress people is 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.709
 this is the transfer market 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.910
 she asks her questions and we see the 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.770
 Our ideas that the transmission 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.300
 she doesn't like them that we say personal 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.370
 and lucia problems but what has to do with it 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.170
 the internal reggio gallardo not 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.620
 it has nothing to do with the questions there 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.660
 I do this courtesy lets do and if 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.010
 please there is a question I give you one 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.480
 answer her but can also not 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.350
 share there are no problems but 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.900
 Inter has restored patience 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.700
 sorry but now I will be one of this 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.080
 split the question if he has too 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.110
 without it we have to do a job 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.840
 trying to come here to do the map 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.430
 of the international of benevento of 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.350
 avellino has nothing to do with it 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.680
 she's not busy talking about cabbages 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.260
 understand that it is not a daughter to talk about 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.390
 napoli having morals i guess he cared 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.730
 you have to stay at the molasses start stop 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.870
 we close to look for frequent thing in the 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.329
 notifications we are totally 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.660
 helpful and kind but if we have to do 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:15.920
 participate people who unfortunately do not 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.670
 exceeds a certain level that we cannot 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.030
 make them talk 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.980
 having said this once again wrong 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.269
 to speak for you that I have to intervene 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.799
 also said today in the editorial office 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.480
 I recommend you let people talk 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.459
 which however would transform a comparison 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.030
 television and not people who say 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.130
 hogwash 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.989
 then after this last sentence you are 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.450
 compromised a little because you don't know 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.730
 not even jurisprudence and you have to stay 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.859
 very careful said that you don't even know 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.450
 who are you talking to because she is 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.900
 demonstrated why you also said 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.410
 geographically inaccurate things 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:51.170
 having said that your superficiality is not 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.579
 even deserves my answer too 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.360
 because we lost three minutes 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.190
 unfortunately, 10 April 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.840
 You didn't talk about Lazio you don't have 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.550
 talked about the rome you did n't talk about 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.250
 vicenza which has also been redesigned here 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.450
 we talk about geography or we look at them 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.980
 gift of synthesis 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.450
 I think it's the first thing the two do 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.070
 questions and I will answer you when 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.560
 we have pleasure that Neapolitans will be 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.990
 changed 8v 90 we can think the 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.239
 unfortunately the chronometer repeated 90 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.040
 the accent that intervenes immediately what 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.680
 without telling us what makes sense and then there is 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.210
 that 10 percent who unfortunately is not there 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.210
 gives a helping hand saying this
