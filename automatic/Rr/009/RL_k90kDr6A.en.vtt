 What is in the xbox here? 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.210

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:32.689

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.689

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:45.000
 ready now you're seeing here 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:50.180
 I'll have the xbox 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.630
 You'll see it's in a gun system. 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.030
 storage 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.790
 here is my HD here the unit of 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.570
 memory and that usb device that 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.900
 is formatted for PC is just click on it 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.500
 you need to configure it now 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.820
 click on configure now 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.860
 need that once it will remove everything 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.020
 What you have in it then you empty and soon 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.680
 come in case there is not a thing 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.230
 important yes 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.489
 Now wait, you can see if your 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:27.450
 pen drive 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:29.370
 it is compatible and it looks personal the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.690
 device is ready and meets the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.180
 recommendations 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.530
 that's not it, it's a sport that is a 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.080
 positive signal is configured in case 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.900
 you want to let through for example the 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.730
 easy usually month can neither space 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.890
 to the computer memory half a 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.110
 xbox gives you who wants to customize 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.540
 I only recommend this 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.540
 although I use the other is tata 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:01.890
 configured now I know there in gauteng 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:04.410
 pendrive here to pass the bc just leave 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.820
 that he is here can see now that he 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.380
 it seems that it is totally 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.730
 used is already full only in the 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.670
 truth is no coincidence that the content does not 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.980
 recognize from xbox 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.299
 just as xbox does not know the 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.600
 computer is formatting the computer is 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.480
 good now is the horizon know what to 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.269
 he passes things that the computer does not 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.460
 I would switch to xbox today. 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:36.630
 the table 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:39.150
 It is what you can see who is here has 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.880
 nothing here o 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.260
 You'll see where all the tolls are going. 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.110
 here have several side 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:52.950
 no turns on will come shades of cheese 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:55.890
 and neide open, because you'll find me 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:00.090
 I'll pass on a link that's going to be a must. 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:03.090
 be to oscar inn it 's good she'll see 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.090
 so the other way there I did not renew 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.470
 she think that here there is also code 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.800
 If you take the copies, you can not 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.110
 identify later remembering that perhaps 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.880
 if it does not work only for him if you go 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.860
 lower the president also two want 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.540
 just there and will download a pendant 1.9 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:24.060
 1.7 up so you have a 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.760
 surprising best knows if it will 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:30.600
 lowering the president should be here 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.480
 the ipod sees that already recognizes alone already 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:38.270
 has a scale symbol and the parent network 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:40.740
 title is saved on the memory unit 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.680
 What is the pen drive? 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.190
 Now let's wait a little bit, ready. 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.860
 People here are right here. 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.490
 This is how it works. 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.620
 be net does if you want to have home 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.070
 sure that it is on the pendrive without any 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.520
 here comes nobody skyrim and here is 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.740
 people would install on the pendrive is and 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.730
 now what are you going to do? 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.000
 drive again and will move to xbox 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.000
 on here 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.820
 a little bit 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:26.610
 ready now you will see again 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.640
 storage unit to apply the 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.650
 memory now debated here, games and 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.500
 applications is going to appear scarim 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:38.130
 means that the dlc hatch fire here O 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:41.460
 downloaded items and account that it weighs will 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.860
 move the copy you know you do not even move 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.140
 where did you save the skype game from? 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.510
 if you have saved no you do not have 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.360
 hd can save that even if you save the 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:54.330
 game on the pendrive puts on the pen drive 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.480
 I knew nothing inside the block in HD only 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.740
 that's one thing is my game he came 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.410
 it's paraguais 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.720
 he came scratched so he gives a mistake 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:07.590
 whenever I put one should be a 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.870
 President is not because of gdp is the 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.980
 neither president nor lcd because of the game 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.800
 that I understand 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:16.530
 I'll show you here the error that 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.510
 but it's almost certain that it will 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:23.010
 picking up mainly if original 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:26.540
 I just came here to reload jirau paulo 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.540

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.350
 ready menu is already highlighted 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.790
 knows it will not make a mistake 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.410
 choose the unit of memory that you 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:39.460
 saved as always 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:43.150
 then the presence of the then yo my god 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.670
 If I go out alone with the seal he'll ignore 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.260
 It will not take long just a little bit 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.910
 enjoy them i thought you 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.810
