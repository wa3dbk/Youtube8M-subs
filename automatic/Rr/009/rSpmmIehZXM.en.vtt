today both physically and mentally it's
easy<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.130> write<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> set<00:00:32.520> on<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.790> board<00:00:33.000> it's

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
easy to write a set on the board it's

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.940 
easy to write a set on the board it's
more<00:00:33.750> challenging<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.410> try<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.649> figure<00:00:34.829> out

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
more challenging to try to figure out

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.229 
more challenging to try to figure out
okay<00:00:35.250> how<00:00:35.280> are<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.760> get<00:00:35.910> people<00:00:36.120> to

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
okay how are we going to get people to

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.840 
okay how are we going to get people to
swim<00:00:36.510> better<00:00:36.750> through<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.890> set<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.370> how<00:00:38.790> can

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
swim better through that set and how can

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.369 
swim better through that set and how can
they<00:00:39.090> really<00:00:39.600> look<00:00:39.780> at<00:00:39.989> what<00:00:40.200> they're<00:00:40.350> doing

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
they really look at what they're doing

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.090 
they really look at what they're doing
before<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.280> during<00:00:42.030> races<00:00:42.620> mentally<00:00:43.620> to

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
before and during races mentally to

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.819 
before and during races mentally to
prepare<00:00:44.370> themselves<00:00:44.579> as<00:00:44.969> well<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:49.440> best<00:00:49.710> way

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
prepare themselves as well the best way

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.740 
prepare themselves as well the best way
to<00:00:49.860> indicate<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.670> 9:00<00:00:51.180> Holyoke<00:00:51.449> swimming

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
a senior was a 159 so I've dropped 12

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.399 
a senior was a 159 so I've dropped 12
seconds<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.969> my<00:01:03.149> 200<00:01:03.539> free<00:01:03.719> our<00:01:04.049> training

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
seconds in my 200 free our training

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.870 
seconds in my 200 free our training
worked<00:01:04.589> for<00:01:04.769> me<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.400> had<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.610> good<00:01:05.700> time

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
worked for me and I had a good time

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.969 
worked for me and I had a good time
typically<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.080> anywhere<00:01:07.530> between<00:01:07.710> about

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
typically we have anywhere between about

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.580 
typically we have anywhere between about
90<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.400> 95%<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.390> people<00:01:09.479> set<00:01:09.869> personal<00:01:10.110> bests

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
90 and 95% of people set personal bests

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.830 
90 and 95% of people set personal bests
over<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> season<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:12.450> year<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.689> think

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
over the season and this year I think

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.020 
over the season and this year I think
was<00:01:12.990> about<00:01:13.170> 90<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> 93<00:01:13.950> percent<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.790> we<00:01:14.909> were

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
was about 90 to 93 percent so we were

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.340 
was about 90 to 93 percent so we were
pretty<00:01:15.240> happy<00:01:15.390> with<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
pretty happy with that one of the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.140 
pretty happy with that one of the
reasons<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.860> Dave<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> great<00:01:17.670> coach<00:01:17.939> is

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
reasons that Dave is a great coach is

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.969 
reasons that Dave is a great coach is
that<00:01:18.330> he<00:01:18.600> listens<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.170> what<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.770> say

that he listens to what you have to say

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.760 
that he listens to what you have to say
and<00:01:20.220> incorporates<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.210> into<00:01:21.360> what<00:01:22.320> his<00:01:22.439> plan

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
and incorporates it into what his plan

for the season

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.740 
for the season
well<00:01:28.490> choose<00:01:28.730> a<00:01:28.760> dive<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:29.270> say<00:01:29.390> this<00:01:29.540> is<00:01:29.720> a

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
well choose a dive and say this is a

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.420 
well choose a dive and say this is a
dive<00:01:29.990> that<00:01:30.110> we<00:01:30.290> want<00:01:30.500> to<00:01:30.590> work<00:01:30.770> towards<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:31.340> we

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
dive that we want to work towards and we

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.760 
dive that we want to work towards and we
want<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.730> have<00:01:31.820> this<00:01:32.030> dive<00:01:32.270> by<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:32.690> meet<00:01:33.260> so

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
want to have this dive by this meet so

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.050 
want to have this dive by this meet so
for<00:01:33.920> our<00:01:34.010> training<00:01:34.280> one<00:01:34.550> of<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.730> things<00:01:34.940> that
