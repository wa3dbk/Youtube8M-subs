00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.380
 so everyone lost to a video or 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.469
 something different 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.690
 today there is no pvp but rather 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.180
 a mvm no player versus player 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.439
 but monster versus monster i have 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.939
 recently already 2 mod presentation 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.930
 uploaded to mounted zombie 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.760
 mutant change 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.960
 and now to know together 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.490
 who of the two actually am 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.260
 strongest is that means we are doing here 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.789
 a small mob battle let the two 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.489
 went to fight and look who's there 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.630
 from the strongest conversations is so her 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.630
 can now give a tip what you 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.980
 thinks of who will win and then 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.480
 I would say it is also equal to 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.590
 already going on by the way who the videos are not 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.420
 I have been here now 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.829
 show individual murder ideas 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.969
 not to the two already 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.050
 Whoever has got a leg up can 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.730
 like to see what they can do 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.410
 The special attacks are all too 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.700
 relatively strong in the singleplayer 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.070
 probably done the zombie or 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.930
 to kill the mini 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.010
 I would say blatant part 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.010
 it starts already 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.449
 zombie has an end now 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.240
 attacked the fight starts we 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.010
 come to my little bergarena until the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.450
 closed from hills I have the dummy 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.560
 in the kate in it so that you can see 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.049
 how much lives do they have? 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.780
 if already violently from the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.430
 nmn uses a lookalike tactics 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.189
 to lose the zombie but the zombie 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.689
 had found each other and are further 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.430
 on top of it my heart of life 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.409
 Zombie stands out at 43 by 150 mm 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.650
 moment again slightly clown tactics 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.759
 Zombie knows I should attack again 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.439
 he just got in and he hit 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.890
 and he jumps up and when to them 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.250
 grab 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.650
 oh oh oh that will change from me 26 we 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.079
 there are still half of life and ender 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.759
 men killed zombies first time though 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.350
 he has logically three miles 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.890
 not quite at full Lebenssborn but 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.100
 watch how it goes when a cave 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.540
 nms has disappeared 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.799
 probably cloned or doubled 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.310
 Otherwise, something will break away on top of that 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.310
 teleport clown tactics again 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.369
 units found zombies pretty the 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.860
 corner and for the second time 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.840
 died the full life again 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.170
 the zombie awakens from therefore arises 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.170
 Of course , 58 live zombie now 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:21.060
 go back in and go for a 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.959
 Counter 35 still live and change 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.250
 clown day that hits me 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.910
 really hit again now 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.190
 has hit 40 40 40 to seven and the 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.489
 endeavor won very close with 33 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.560
 live it is at the moment no right to live 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.930
 is here again and again 40 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.160
 live to 33 26 26 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.540
 that is that is so close that is so 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.500
 scarce that it is so close endermann 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.410
 survived with two living man survived 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.150
 just so with 2 live like that and the whole 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.860
 Let's do it again, though 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.239
 night because at night is the zombie 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.680
 Stronger times to see if it is this time 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.680
 managed to kill you soon 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.400
 so now the night fight has started 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.200
 the change or zombie the mm again 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.130
 attacked 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.810
 at night the zombie a bit stronger 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.100
 because he is still partially healing 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.660
 And because also several zombies brought about 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.769
 Summon at the time you see 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.470
 easy as the lives of him back up 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:19.510
 let's go with 222 times this time 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.209
 zombie is about 105 yet 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.019
 and that's pretty down 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.450
 were beaten 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.709
 if you again clown tactics 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.400
 which is the right way is the one 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:45.389
 right zombie exactly the us and again 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:47.510
 Knocked it out of the when when 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:51.349
 zombie is pushed back into the corner 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.349
 but he can revive her 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.010
 diestandard.at do a lot of harm 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.370
 immense at 82, zombies live the first 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.370
 times dead 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.950
 He gets up and continues 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.950
 damage 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:26.370
 and he jumps and pops in the middle of the 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:29.570
 it is even the second air every time 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.570
 time I threatened simply make time was 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.880
 m25 life zombie is still standing at 39 each 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.610
 once that clown tactic and now 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:56.460
 zombies are dead again 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:05:01.590
 but he will get up again when 17 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:07.920
 9 and possession on the final blow 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:10.230
 Everything clear in the air 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.610
 Zambia won this time of the night 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:17.700
 at least with where we now the 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.890
 ender tacked with 31 lives 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.480
 he survived at night almost as if 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.510
 the zombie would be stronger and during the day 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.010
 because the internet is more powerful 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.680
 Media time it is not spoken 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.930
 Anyway, that was a couple more 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.260
 actually the moc battle in relation to 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.970
 change against zombie the world 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.830
 the first agent of mobs, so to speak 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.060
 can now suggest which 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.200
 mmogs also still beg against each other 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.510
 should be here for a still the 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.360
 Mutated snowball if he still 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.590
 then imagine having come as well 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.000
 we mutant skeleton looks like this 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.520
 and we still have the mutated creeper 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.110
 he looks like the five monsters are there 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.520
 then all now recognizes to the 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.520
 I have not yet introduced others 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.960
 come has offered imagination who is as 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.970
 next to whom to write writes the 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.290
 comments and then if that's you 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.180
 liked because there are so another new 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.470
 thing in itself now so today 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.600
 never did a rating then 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:13.580
 I'll let you know the net on the net 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.580
 In the next video of it and feet
