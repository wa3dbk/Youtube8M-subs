Dion right I believe that's what his
name<00:02:56.270> is<00:02:56.300> but<00:02:56.450> this<00:02:56.750> guy<00:02:56.960> was<00:02:57.140> linked<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.560> being

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
name is but this guy was linked to being

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.190 
name is but this guy was linked to being
theca<00:02:58.040> at<00:02:58.130> one<00:02:58.310> point<00:02:58.580> in<00:02:58.850> real<00:02:59.510> life<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.080> then

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
theca at one point in real life and then

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.350 
theca at one point in real life and then
I<00:03:00.440> think<00:03:00.860> they<00:03:01.010> wanted<00:03:01.310> too<00:03:01.520> much<00:03:01.550> money<00:03:02.090> and

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
I think they wanted too much money and

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.910 
I think they wanted too much money and
they<00:03:02.480> figure<00:03:02.780> couldn't<00:03:03.050> afford<00:03:03.290> him<00:03:03.470> but<00:03:03.710> I

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
they figure couldn't afford him but I

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.460 
they figure couldn't afford him but I
think<00:03:04.730> he's<00:03:04.910> an<00:03:05.060> upcoming<00:03:05.240> upcoming<00:03:06.200> strike

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.080 
think he's an upcoming upcoming strike
I'm<00:03:06.620> pretty<00:03:06.860> sure<00:03:07.130> that's<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.520> right<00:03:07.700> one<00:03:07.910> I'm

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
I'm pretty sure that's the right one I'm

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.670 
I'm pretty sure that's the right one I'm
not<00:03:08.270> I'm<00:03:08.390> not<00:03:08.450> 100%<00:03:08.990> sure<00:03:09.320> but<00:03:09.440> I'm<00:03:09.650> pretty

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.050 
not I'm not 100% sure but I'm pretty
