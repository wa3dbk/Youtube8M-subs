00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
cultured and putting redstone torch in

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.130 
cultured and putting redstone torch in
the<00:00:41.190> middle<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.820> will<00:00:41.969> get<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.210> fireworks

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
the middle and you will get a fireworks

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.430 
the middle and you will get a fireworks
and<00:00:43.469> since<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.399> don't<00:00:44.610> need<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:45.200> is<00:00:46.200> already

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
and since I don't need this is already

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.040 
and since I don't need this is already
half<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.920> set<00:00:47.100> up<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.430> anyway<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.969> use<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.780> is

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
basically by right clicking on them and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.760 
basically by right clicking on them and
it<00:00:51.600> will<00:00:51.750> produce<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.530> fire<00:00:53.399> or<00:00:54.410> do<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.500> mind<00:00:57.770> ya

pretty magnificent it looks amazing I
really<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.380> effects<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.430> stuff<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:12.119> it

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
really like the effects and stuff but it

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.460 
really like the effects and stuff but it
can<00:01:13.049> also<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.470> activated<00:01:14.250> by<00:01:14.390> redstone<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:16.170> if

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
can also be activated by redstone so if

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.080 
can also be activated by redstone so if
i<00:01:16.590> press<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.430> will<00:01:17.580> send<00:01:17.939> out<00:01:18.060> that

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
i press on this it will send out that

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.090 
i press on this it will send out that
redstone<00:01:21.090> seems<00:01:21.570> more<00:01:21.810> reliable<00:01:22.100> nevermind

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
redstone seems more reliable nevermind

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.789 
redstone seems more reliable nevermind
but<00:01:23.700> yeah<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.210> that's<00:01:24.390> pretty<00:01:24.630> much<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.530> part

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
but yeah so that's pretty much this part

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.980 
but yeah so that's pretty much this part
of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> how<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.549> part<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> mod<00:01:27.270> works<00:01:27.570> um

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
of the how this part of the mod works um

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.800 
of the how this part of the mod works um
but<00:01:28.770> i<00:01:28.829> will<00:01:29.159> quickly<00:01:29.520> go<00:01:29.880> into<00:01:30.150> cinematic

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
but i will quickly go into cinematic

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.700 
but i will quickly go into cinematic
view<00:01:31.140> right<00:01:31.439> here<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.630> so<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.659> sweep<00:01:34.140> towards

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
view right here and so you sweep towards

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.030 
view right here and so you sweep towards
here<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.460> what<00:01:35.850> I've<00:01:36.060> built

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
here and this is what I've built

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.359 
here and this is what I've built
basically<00:01:38.040> um<00:01:38.900> you<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.079> see<00:01:40.320> loads<00:01:41.159> of

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
basically um you can see loads of

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.700 
basically um you can see loads of
different<00:01:41.720> fireworks<00:01:42.720> display<00:01:43.170> I'm<00:01:43.350> pretty

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
different fireworks display I'm pretty

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.270 
different fireworks display I'm pretty
sure<00:01:43.860> there's<00:01:44.100> like<00:01:44.250> them<00:01:44.549> over<00:01:45.619> at<00:01:46.619> least<00:01:46.890> 12

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
sure there's like them over at least 12

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.260 
sure there's like them over at least 12
different<00:01:48.290> types<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.500> fireworks<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.490> go

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
different types of fireworks that can go

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.149 
different types of fireworks that can go
off<00:01:51.479> randomly<00:01:52.079> i'm<00:01:52.439> pretty<00:01:52.680> sure<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.009> more

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
off randomly i'm pretty sure it's more

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.209 
off randomly i'm pretty sure it's more
than<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.310> uh<00:01:53.700> maybe<00:01:54.390> 24<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.079> can<00:01:55.320> but<00:01:55.920> as<00:01:55.950> you

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
than that uh maybe 24 you can but as you

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.830 
than that uh maybe 24 you can but as you
can<00:01:56.340> see<00:01:56.520> there's<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.790> wide<00:01:56.939> variety<00:01:57.119> something

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
can see there's a wide variety something

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.620 
can see there's a wide variety something

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
one flaw above 0 1 block gap from the

one flaw above 0 1 block gap from the
firework<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.180> stuff<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.840> pie<00:02:24.290> which<00:02:24.500> will

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
firework and stuff the pie which will

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.410 
firework and stuff the pie which will
burst<00:02:25.010> out<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:25.580> also<00:02:25.700> looks<00:02:25.970> really<00:02:26.209> cool

burst out and it also looks really cool
so<00:02:27.400> that's<00:02:28.400> something<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.819> know<00:02:29.060> and

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
so that's something to know and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.449 
so that's something to know and
basically<00:02:29.600> how<00:02:29.840> I'm<00:02:29.930> doing<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.530> constantly

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
basically how I'm doing this constantly

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.420 
basically how I'm doing this constantly
is<00:02:31.880> by<00:02:32.209> having<00:02:33.050> a<00:02:33.290> redstone<00:02:33.650> powder<00:02:34.040> that's

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
is by having a redstone powder that's

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.080 
is by having a redstone powder that's
hidden<00:02:34.730> in<00:02:35.300> this<00:02:35.989> grass<00:02:36.560> blocks<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.910> this

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
hidden in this grass blocks and this

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.800 
hidden in this grass blocks and this
grass<00:02:38.390> tricking<00:02:39.170> rectangle<00:02:40.450> sort<00:02:41.450> of<00:02:41.569> shape

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
grass tricking rectangle sort of shape

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.390 
grass tricking rectangle sort of shape
that<00:02:41.989> i<00:02:42.019> made<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.590> can't<00:02:42.920> see<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.220> red

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
that i made so you can't see the red

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.740 
that i made so you can't see the red
stone<00:02:43.580> thing<00:02:44.000> cuz<00:02:44.209> that's<00:02:44.480> kind<00:02:44.720> of

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
stone thing cuz that's kind of

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.070 
stone thing cuz that's kind of
distracted<00:02:45.430> but<00:02:46.430> yeah<00:02:46.580> this<00:02:46.790> mod<00:02:47.060> is<00:02:47.269> really

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
server you can like I guess you can add
