00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.750
 today we have the question today 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.730
 from our friend julieta julieta we 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.920
 It says the following Victor's boys 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.920
 fitness what happens if I eliminated 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.619
 the carbohydrates in my diet ok and we 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.990
 ask if he only eats protein 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.550
 what repercussions could she have if 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.430
 is that is going to help him get off 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.650
 weigh very well in a single answer if 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.050
 is that you do that julieta because in 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.950
 you will lose weight but 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.670
 after 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.640
 to stop buttonhole obviously everything is a 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.720
 issue that continues to generate that deficit 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.380
 caloric but when you eliminate from 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.440
 yes a micronutrient your body starts to 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.480
 protest you as you do not calculate ok from 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.550
 done if you eliminate the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.880
 carbohydrates in your diet your muscle goes 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.510
 to start being smooth is to say that it's not going 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:08.670
 to have colombia that volume legs 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:12.150
 butt all that will look super says 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.729
 super flat and it's because if you eliminate 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.350
 the carbohydrates your body is not going to 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.850
 can replenish the glycogen they have 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.740
 I look for you is to say what helps you in the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.240
 recovery process that fills 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.160
 all that is difficult ok so when 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.470
 you eliminate a macronutrient and 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.760
 specifically the carbohydrates for 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.820
 start 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.280
 and feel a terrible drop in the subject of 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.720
 energy does not calculate ancestors 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.140
 superman 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.930
 next thing and your digestion you 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.280
 digestion is going to be terrible because 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.050
 obviously in the whole subject of 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.480
 carbohydrates we find the fiba 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.390
 ok so if you eliminate this from your 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.670
 digestion is going to be but terrible you're going to 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.940
 go to the bathroom but for little and every three 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.570
 days so I do not recommend this for 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.690
 nothing 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.480
 ok what I recommend is that I have a 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.770
 well put range of carbohydrates 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:14.310
 it would be for you among the multiply you 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.180
 poundage by one until so 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.260
 keep going down a bit more than these 0.8 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.600
 depending on how you are in 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.290
 this moment that you do you keep 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:29.340
 they look for their high proteins and keep 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.200
 your percentage of fat and normal 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.650
 you will see what you will have results 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.950
 excellent with a good training 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.070
 weights has said that guys for 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.620
 buy them also something else and 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.110
 just the week that happened and we 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.870
 we finished him 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.470
 at the end of the last guys we had 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.050
 brutal results or that is in 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.260
 reality people transformed their body to what 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.150
 beast so the next challenge that comes 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.850
 is going to be brutal in fact in which 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.820
 happened and we put some new 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.240
 strategies and it was impressive the 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.280
 results that we obtained so that they 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.860
 I highly recommend the next challenge 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.950
 for those who want to be but little paper 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.940

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.580
 the beast 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.590
