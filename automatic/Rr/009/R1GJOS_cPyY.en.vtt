also writing his like riding on on an
ice<00:00:50.030> berg<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.480> guess<00:00:51.719> or<00:00:51.960> got<00:00:52.440> an<00:00:52.710> ice<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.370> under

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
ice berg I guess or got an ice and under

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.340 
ice berg I guess or got an ice and under
it<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:57.020> it's<00:00:58.520> one<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.760> has<00:01:00.090> only<00:01:00.449> one<00:01:00.809> wheel<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
it is it's one it has only one wheel and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.679 
it is it's one it has only one wheel and
two<00:01:02.449> circles<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.629> guess<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.820> not<00:01:05.820> for

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
two circles I guess this is for not for

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.390 
two circles I guess this is for not for
not<00:01:06.720> making<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.650> go<00:01:08.119> like<00:01:09.140> go<00:01:10.140> anywhere<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.220> it

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
not making it go like go anywhere so it

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.090 
not making it go like go anywhere so it
I<00:01:11.580> guess<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:12.000> for<00:01:12.240> going<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:13.500> making<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
I guess it's for going for making the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.640 
I guess it's for going for making the
toy<00:01:14.310> run<00:01:14.909> street<00:01:15.479> without<00:01:15.900> going<00:01:16.320> anywhere

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
toy run street without going anywhere

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.090 
toy run street without going anywhere
like<00:01:17.270> when<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.689> way<00:01:19.020> we're<00:01:19.560> kind<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.950> like

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
like when this way we're kind of like

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.120 
like when this way we're kind of like
going<00:01:20.549> around<00:01:20.729> like<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.750> um<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.380> guess

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
going around like that so um I guess

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.920 
going around like that so um I guess
that's<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.549> purpose<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.090> those<00:01:24.500> circles<00:01:25.500> and

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
that's the purpose of those circles and

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.300 
that's the purpose of those circles and
yeah<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.350> tusks<00:01:29.189> are<00:01:29.369> really<00:01:29.820> great<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:42.120 

there's<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.430> trunk<00:01:35.880> right<00:01:36.119> there<00:01:39.890> okay

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
there's a trunk right there okay

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.350 
there's a trunk right there okay
so<00:01:42.939> on<00:01:43.150> here<00:01:43.659> is<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.549> launcher<00:01:45.549> or<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.210> key

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
so on here is the launcher or the key

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.890 
so on here is the launcher or the key
you<00:01:49.360> try<00:01:49.689> to<00:01:49.750> put<00:01:50.049> it<00:01:50.170> right<00:01:50.680> here<00:01:50.740> at<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.369> back

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
you try to put it right here at the back

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.570 
you try to put it right here at the back
so<00:01:52.900> you<00:01:52.990> see<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.200> hole<00:01:53.500> right<00:01:53.680> there<00:01:53.740> so<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.369> put

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
so you see a hole right there so you put

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.350 
so you see a hole right there so you put
it<00:01:54.700> inside<00:01:54.880> and<00:01:55.770> remember<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:57.070> always<00:01:57.580> face

just try to put it that way okay it goes
kind<00:02:52.390> of<00:02:52.480> goes<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:53.110> way<00:02:54.030> sometimes<00:02:55.030> so<00:02:55.660> let's

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
kind of goes that way sometimes so let's

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.800 
kind of goes that way sometimes so let's
just<00:02:56.019> try<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.320> um<00:02:58.079> point<00:02:59.079> it<00:02:59.200> that<00:02:59.500> way<00:02:59.799> so

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
just try to um point it that way so

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.210 
just try to um point it that way so
let's<00:03:01.810> try<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:03.810> okay<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:05.049> there<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.590> did<00:03:05.739> not<00:03:05.920> um

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
let's try it okay so there it did not um

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.300 
let's try it okay so there it did not um
go<00:03:07.209> that<00:03:07.420> way<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:08.109> doesn't<00:03:08.530> really<00:03:08.650> go<00:03:08.950> far

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
go that way and it doesn't really go far

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.920 
go that way and it doesn't really go far
it's<00:03:10.060> just<00:03:10.150> like<00:03:10.359> just<00:03:11.850> maybe<00:03:12.850> four<00:03:13.329> meters<00:03:13.720> or

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
it's just like just maybe four meters or

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.319 
it's just like just maybe four meters or
something<00:03:14.290> like<00:03:14.950> II<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.250> mean<00:03:15.730> four<00:03:16.000> inches
