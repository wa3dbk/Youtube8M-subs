me<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:33.030> guess<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.540> reason<00:02:33.690> behind<00:02:34.050> why<00:02:34.500> I

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
me and I guess the reason behind why I

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.750 
me and I guess the reason behind why I
wanted<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.670> get<00:02:35.820> this<00:02:35.940> procedure<00:02:36.440> but<00:02:37.760> you

she just asked me some questions I had
to<00:02:42.810> take<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.050> little<00:02:43.320> survey<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:46.080> know<00:02:46.230> type

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
to take a little survey you know type

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.800 
to take a little survey you know type
question<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.280> answer<00:02:47.700> there<00:02:48.330> was<00:02:48.420> no<00:02:48.570> real

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
question and answer there was no real

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.420 
question and answer there was no real
wrong<00:02:49.050> answers<00:02:49.500> but<00:02:49.680> she<00:02:49.800> just<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.280> was<00:02:50.400> just

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
wrong answers but she just it was just

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.020 
wrong answers but she just it was just
to<00:02:50.670> help<00:02:50.700> her<00:02:51.290> gauge<00:02:52.290> on<00:02:52.680> Who<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.550> am<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.790> I

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
to help her gauge on Who I am and I

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.940 
to help her gauge on Who I am and I
guess<00:02:54.270> that<00:02:54.570> goes<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.050> insurance<00:02:55.500> company

guess that goes to the insurance company

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.490 
guess that goes to the insurance company
or<00:02:56.300> whatever<00:02:57.300> paperwork<00:02:57.840> she<00:02:58.020> has<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.230> send

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
or whatever paperwork she has to send

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.130 
or whatever paperwork she has to send
back<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.070> insurance<00:02:59.490> company<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.140> my

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
out there you know one of the things

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.830 
out there you know one of the things
that<00:03:49.680> they<00:03:49.800> explained<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.190> me<00:03:50.400> is<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:51.420> am

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
that they explained to me is that I am

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.900 
that they explained to me is that I am
gonna<00:03:52.050> be<00:03:52.110> on<00:03:52.350> a<00:03:52.380> preoperative<00:03:52.830> diet<00:03:53.370> once<00:03:53.790> I

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910

diet<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:01.489> same<00:04:01.730> thing<00:04:02.000> for<00:04:02.209> about<00:04:02.360> two
