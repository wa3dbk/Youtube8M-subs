00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.980
 german bmw 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.080
 but it is different not only by the visual 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.119
 absolutely unique because 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.519
 we speak the second model of the line and 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.670

 of 234 horsepower 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.170
 but two electric motors that generate 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.940
 133 more horses 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.050
 with this combination ensures power 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.820
 maximum of 367 horses which makes accelerating 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.070
 from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.070
 only 4 point 4 seconds

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.090
 ie8 and died only electricity 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.430
 above this the motor starts to work. 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.560
 that in addition to guaranteeing more 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.300

 Available bmw and 8 have low levels 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.070

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.100
 only 49 grams per kilometer number 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.470
 same as a small car same thing 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.750
 for consumption that can reach 47 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.060

 but the clear design follows an elaborate 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.060
 aerodynamic design so that the car 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.730
 literally succeeds in cutting the wind and 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.010
