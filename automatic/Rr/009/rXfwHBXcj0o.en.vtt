00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.580
 many times when we watch the news 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.349
 we are not even told the octave 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.849
 part of what is happening in the 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.919
 world 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.079
 normally many things are left for 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.780
 talk that they are also important and 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:20.109
 that's why I am here, and many others 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.699
 people that we try to collect 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.580
 some of the most important news 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.640
 to make them known today not to mention 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.589
 of the case of the giant rats the rats 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.280
 giants in which they are beginning to be used 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:36.280
 in areas like may be tanzania in 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.970
 cambodia for what purpose are these 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.730
 giant rats then to detect mines 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.730
 mines have been buried in 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.080
 made in recent years these rats 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.970
 have managed to find more than 2,400 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.340
 antipersonnel mines which means that 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.130
 thousands of lives have been saved thanks to 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.550
 these rats who would think truly 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:03.010
 that a rat was going to have that 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.560
 importance not that it could be trained 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.060
 just like a dog in fact in some 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.100
 places in that area 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.320
 like a dog a rat dog 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.869
 and of course it does not surprise me because 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.150
 only not only help in the 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.729
 mine research work 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.729
 antipersonnel but also these rats 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.040
 are able to detect if a person 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.250
 has tuberculosis in a matter of 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.310
 seconds has one of the most sulfates 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.080
 sharpened and powerful of the world is a 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.700
 of animal species with smell 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:40.220
 more sharpened and clear can be used 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.340
 to detect anti- personnel mines and 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.770
 also for tuberculosis cases a 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.840
 scientist maybe it takes a day in 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.259
 know if a person has 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.789
 tuberculosis or not while then a 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.729
 rat of this type may take like 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.130
 many ten minutes to find 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.250
 evidence of tuberculosis these rats 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.539
 since they are born since the fourth week 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.310
 from the fourth week they begin to be 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.770
 trained in a regime of 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.160
 training 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.769
 in which then when they detect 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.650
 they detect the right sample the sample 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.540
 that is contaminated with tuberculosis 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.269
 automatically drop a piece of 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.420
 food to reward the and it seems that 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:26.209
 it works the rats learn the catch 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.940
 on a leash they take them through the fields 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.450
 of antipersonnel mines and there then 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.209
 detect the mines deactivate them then 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.380
 people and also serve to avoid 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.180
 that tuberculosis spread 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.240
 here is another example of the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.190
 animals can help detect 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.980
 certain diseases and also used in 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.690
 benefit of humanity I already spoke in a 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.000
 previous video a long time ago 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.390
 about dogs that are capable of 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.160
 detect cancer 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.590
 we are talking about animals 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.600
 our allies can also be allies 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.280
 we always have to see them as 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.860
 food that is how we see them 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.440
 currently they can be used as 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.640
 allies and also have to be 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.800
 undoubtedly respected if it were not for 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.740
 these animals would not have been saved 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.420
 so many lives these antipersonnel mines is 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.160
 very difficult to disable them a human being 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.640
 who wants to deactivate these mines 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.770
 antipersonnel can can run the 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.140
 danger of dying while if you take 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.420
 to a rat because not only will not tread 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.319
 the anti- personnel mine but it will stop 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.300
 and it will warn you that there is obviously 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:42.880
 has to be trained does not follow a 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.880
 rat anybody but it's funny
