okay<00:00:00.690> folks<00:00:00.960> in<00:00:01.140> this<00:00:01.230> clip<00:00:01.380> we're<00:00:01.589> going<00:00:01.620> to

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
okay folks in this clip we're going to

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.740 
okay folks in this clip we're going to
talk<00:00:01.890> about<00:00:02.070> how<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.429> shoot<00:00:02.939> music<00:00:03.240> videos

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
talk about how to shoot music videos

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.289 
talk about how to shoot music videos
music<00:00:04.529> videos<00:00:05.040> are<00:00:05.310> essentially<00:00:05.850> supposed<00:00:06.120> to

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
music videos are essentially supposed to

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.450 
music videos are essentially supposed to
be<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.750> visual<00:00:06.930> interpretation<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.220> song

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
be the visual interpretation of a song

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.150 
be the visual interpretation of a song
so<00:00:09.240> make<00:00:09.510> sure<00:00:09.540> early<00:00:09.990> on<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.469> everything<00:00:10.980> is

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
so make sure early on that everything is

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.589 
so make sure early on that everything is
everyone<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:11.849> on<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.000> same<00:00:12.179> page<00:00:12.330> when<00:00:12.570> it

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
everyone is on the same page when it

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.930 
everyone is on the same page when it
comes<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.200> visual<00:00:13.980> direction<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
comes to the visual direction of the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.779 
comes to the visual direction of the
video<00:00:15.179> itself<00:00:15.540> as<00:00:15.839> you're<00:00:16.650> shooting<00:00:16.859> first<00:00:17.640> of

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
video itself as you're shooting first of

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:18.590 
video itself as you're shooting first of
all<00:00:17.880> you're<00:00:18.000> gonna<00:00:18.090> want<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.300> get<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.449> lot<00:00:18.570> of

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
all you're gonna want to get a lot of

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.929 
all you're gonna want to get a lot of
coverage<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.529> performance<00:00:20.070> aspect<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.820> it

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
coverage of the performance aspect of it

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.620 
coverage of the performance aspect of it
meaning<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.510> band<00:00:21.779> or<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.170> artist<00:00:22.920> that's

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
meaning the band or the artist that's

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.779 
meaning the band or the artist that's
performing<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.779> song<00:00:24.990> itself<00:00:25.410> take<00:00:26.279> as<00:00:26.490> much

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
performing the song itself take as much

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.390 
performing the song itself take as much
time<00:00:26.849> as<00:00:27.510> Europe<00:00:28.140> permitted<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:29.099> get<00:00:29.250> as

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
time as Europe permitted to to get as

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.160 
time as Europe permitted to to get as
much<00:00:29.550> coverage<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.390> as<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.750> possibly

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
much coverage of this as you possibly

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.080 
much coverage of this as you possibly
can<00:00:31.410> because<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.830> will<00:00:32.070> be<00:00:32.250> your<00:00:32.279> safety<00:00:32.790> net

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
can because this will be your safety net

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.120 
can because this will be your safety net
in<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.899> editing<00:00:34.230> room<00:00:34.290> you're<00:00:34.890> going<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.070> be

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
in the editing room you're going to be

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.069 
in the editing room you're going to be
going<00:00:35.280> back<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:35.940> performance<00:00:36.510> again<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
going back to this performance again and

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.220 
going back to this performance again and
again<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.739> again<00:00:38.390> assuming<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.960> video

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
again and again assuming that the video

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.049 
again and again assuming that the video
itself<00:00:40.680> has<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> storyline<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.879> that's

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
itself has a storyline to it that's

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.000 
itself has a storyline to it that's
separate<00:00:42.480> from<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> performance<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.710> will

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
separate from the performance this will

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.940 
separate from the performance this will
be<00:00:44.160> your<00:00:44.809> the<00:00:45.809> shots<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.260> cut<00:00:46.800> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
be your the shots that you cut to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.590 
be your the shots that you cut to
whenever<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.430> need<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.789> move<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.329> scenes

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
whenever you need to move the scenes

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.700 
whenever you need to move the scenes
along<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.289> don't<00:00:49.410> want<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> make

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
along and you don't want to make

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.670 
along and you don't want to make
straight<00:00:50.489> transitions<00:00:51.059> from<00:00:51.300> one<00:00:51.600> bit<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
straight transitions from one bit to the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.619 
straight transitions from one bit to the
next<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.160> performance<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.059> essentially

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
next the performance is that essentially

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.750 
next the performance is that essentially
the<00:00:54.899> glue<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.440> holds<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.190> video<00:00:56.430> together

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the glue that holds the video together

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.450 
the glue that holds the video together
so<00:00:57.030> get<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.210> lot<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.510> coverage<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.460> second

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
so get a lot of coverage of this second

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.979 
so get a lot of coverage of this second
of<00:00:59.520> all<00:00:59.699> when<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.120> comes<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.510> shooting<00:01:00.690> any

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
of all when it comes to shooting any

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.869 
of all when it comes to shooting any
additional<00:01:01.500> aspects<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.190> video<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.760> if

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
additional aspects of the video like if

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.789 
additional aspects of the video like if
there's<00:01:03.090> some<00:01:03.300> sort<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.049> creative

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
there's some sort of a creative

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.240 
there's some sort of a creative
narrative<00:01:05.189> story<00:01:05.519> that's<00:01:05.820> attached<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
narrative story that's attached to the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.560 
narrative story that's attached to the
performance<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.520> group<00:01:08.760> or<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.150> band<00:01:09.360> or

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
performance of the group or the band or

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.500 
performance of the group or the band or
if<00:01:09.630> they're<00:01:09.780> involved<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.010> a

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
if they're involved in you know a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.609 
if they're involved in you know a
storyline<00:01:12.510> that's<00:01:12.900> connected<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.470> plot

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
storyline that's connected to the plot

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.859 
storyline that's connected to the plot
of<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> video<00:01:14.070> shoot<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.119> segment

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
of the video shoot this segment

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.980 
of the video shoot this segment
separately<00:01:16.320> from<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.610> actual<00:01:18.240> shots<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
separately from the actual shots of the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.840 
separately from the actual shots of the
performance<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.490> don't<00:01:20.670> really

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
performance so that you don't really

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.700 
performance so that you don't really
confuse<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> two<00:01:21.930> because<00:01:22.140> you're<00:01:22.439> gonna<00:01:22.560> be

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
confuse the two because you're gonna be

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.929 
confuse the two because you're gonna be
shooting<00:01:22.860> these<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.400> an<00:01:23.490> entirely<00:01:23.790> different

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
shooting these in an entirely different

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:24.620 
shooting these in an entirely different
way

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
way

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.240 
way
shooting<00:01:25.110> coverage<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.590> performance<00:01:26.130> is

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
shooting coverage of the performance is

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.910 
shooting coverage of the performance is
basically<00:01:27.049> covering<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> band<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.710> lot<00:01:28.890> of

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
basically covering the band in a lot of

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.440 
basically covering the band in a lot of
creative<00:01:29.579> ways<00:01:29.820> shooting<00:01:30.270> them<00:01:30.420> from

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
creative ways shooting them from

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.270 
creative ways shooting them from
different<00:01:30.900> angles<00:01:31.290> using<00:01:31.650> different<00:01:32.009> you

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
different angles using different you

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.090 
different angles using different you
know<00:01:32.430> lighting<00:01:33.299> schemes<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.049> locations<00:01:34.650> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
know lighting schemes and locations and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.950 
know lighting schemes and locations and
camera<00:01:35.490> moves<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:36.000> capture<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.450> performance

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
camera moves to capture the performance

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.200 
camera moves to capture the performance
when<00:01:37.110> you're<00:01:37.229> shooting<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.189> story<00:01:38.729> portion

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
when you're shooting the story portion

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.670 
when you're shooting the story portion
you're<00:01:39.390> gonna<00:01:39.479> want<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.350> little<00:01:40.590> bit

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
you're gonna want to have a little bit

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.069 
you're gonna want to have a little bit
more<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.250> clear<00:01:41.549> timeline<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.600> almost<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
more of a clear timeline and almost a

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.139 
more of a clear timeline and almost a
script<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.070> events<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.490> are<00:01:44.610> set<00:01:45.030> to

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
script of the events that are set to

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.060 
script of the events that are set to
unfold<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> story<00:01:46.110> already<00:01:46.530> planned<00:01:46.890> out

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
unfold in the story already planned out

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.210 
unfold in the story already planned out
and<00:01:47.250> shoot<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.939> would<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.149> short<00:01:48.479> film

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
and shoot it like you would a short film

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.010 
and shoot it like you would a short film
obviously<00:01:50.220> there's<00:01:50.460> gonna<00:01:50.520> be<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.180> beginning<00:01:51.750> a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
obviously there's gonna be a beginning a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.469 
obviously there's gonna be a beginning a
middle<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.470> an<00:01:52.560> end<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.009> an<00:01:53.490> arc<00:01:54.060> between<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
middle and an end and an arc between the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.120 
middle and an end and an arc between the
two<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.049> make<00:01:55.229> sure<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.680> cover<00:01:55.920> this

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
two so make sure that you cover this

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.100 
two so make sure that you cover this
well<00:01:56.399> make<00:01:56.729> sure<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.149> really<00:01:57.299> get<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.930> lot

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
well make sure that you really get a lot

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.600 
well make sure that you really get a lot
of<00:01:58.200> interesting<00:01:58.649> visual<00:01:59.040> shots<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.549> that

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
of interesting visual shots and that

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.730 
of interesting visual shots and that
they<00:01:59.759> really<00:01:59.939> match<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.540> energy<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
they really match the energy of the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.740 
they really match the energy of the
music<00:02:01.890> itself<00:02:02.729> because<00:02:03.119> when<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.390> get<00:02:03.570> into

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
music itself because when you get into

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.240 
music itself because when you get into
the<00:02:03.869> editing<00:02:04.170> room<00:02:04.380> you're<00:02:04.590> gonna<00:02:04.680> want<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
the editing room you're gonna want the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.580 
the editing room you're gonna want the
energy<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.240> visuals<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.170> match<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
energy of the visuals to match the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.770 
energy of the visuals to match the
energy<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.160> song<00:02:08.399> if<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:09.030> doesn't<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
energy of the song if it doesn't the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.510 
energy of the song if it doesn't the
video<00:02:10.080> will<00:02:10.259> fall<00:02:10.410> flat<00:02:10.560> on<00:02:10.679> its<00:02:10.920> face<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.430> it

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
video will fall flat on its face and it

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.340 
video will fall flat on its face and it
really<00:02:11.700> won't<00:02:11.849> make<00:02:12.000> sense<00:02:12.270> so

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
really won't make sense so

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.660 
really won't make sense so
that<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.190> how<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.700> shoot<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.180> music<00:02:15.360> video
