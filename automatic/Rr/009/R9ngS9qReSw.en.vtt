whole
day<00:06:03.030> and<00:06:03.270> I<00:06:03.330> thought<00:06:03.540> I<00:06:03.600> would<00:06:03.870> be<00:06:03.990> miserable

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
but it turned out good a lot better than

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.910 
but it turned out good a lot better than
I<00:06:07.170> thought<00:06:07.200> I<00:06:07.620> took<00:06:08.360> took<00:06:09.360> some<00:06:09.540> more<00:06:09.690> medicine

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920 
I thought I took took some more medicine

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.780 
I thought I took took some more medicine
but<00:06:11.630> you<00:06:12.630> know<00:06:12.780> it<00:06:13.290> was<00:06:13.950> a<00:06:14.010> lot<00:06:14.220> better<00:06:14.370> than<00:06:14.580> so

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
but you know it was a lot better than so

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.500 
but you know it was a lot better than so
that's<00:06:15.800> that's<00:06:16.800> a<00:06:16.980> little<00:06:17.220> bit<00:06:17.310> free<00:06:17.640> to<00:06:18.360> be

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
that's that's a little bit free to be

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.200 
that's that's a little bit free to be
able<00:06:18.780> to<00:06:19.160> know<00:06:20.160> that<00:06:20.370> you<00:06:20.520> can<00:06:20.760> get<00:06:21.000> out<00:06:21.180> and

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
able to know that you can get out and

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.290 
able to know that you can get out and
stuff<00:06:21.600> like<00:06:21.750> that<00:06:21.810> so<00:06:22.020> I<00:06:22.760> guess<00:06:23.760> over<00:06:24.030> the<00:06:24.120> next

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
stuff like that so I guess over the next

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.870 
stuff like that so I guess over the next
four<00:06:24.480> weeks<00:06:24.720> someone<00:06:25.080> slowly<00:06:25.460> try<00:06:26.460> to<00:06:26.520> get<00:06:26.730> out

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
four weeks someone slowly try to get out

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.520 
four weeks someone slowly try to get out
today<00:06:27.660> I<00:06:28.140> went<00:06:28.590> out<00:06:28.770> and<00:06:29.930> drove<00:06:30.930> around<00:06:31.140> in<00:06:31.410> my

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
today I went out and drove around in my

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.340 
today I went out and drove around in my
car<00:06:31.560> for<00:06:32.490> a<00:06:32.550> little<00:06:32.610> while<00:06:32.930> he<00:06:33.930> said<00:06:34.140> I<00:06:34.170> could

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 
car for a little while he said I could

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.030 
car for a little while he said I could
drive<00:06:34.380> last<00:06:34.830> time<00:06:35.100> but<00:06:35.430> I<00:06:36.180> haven't<00:06:36.930> really<00:06:37.080> had

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
drive last time but I haven't really had

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.700
