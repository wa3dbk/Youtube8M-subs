the<00:00:46.110> middle<00:00:46.700> because<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.989> personally<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the middle because I personally have a

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.840 
the middle because I personally have a
lot<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.489> hot<00:00:51.239> pink<00:00:52.050> color<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:55.039> it's<00:00:56.039> kind<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.699> a

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:50.050 
past few days I'm gonna apply it free
ice<00:02:46.270> so<00:02:47.270> this<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:47.870> how<00:02:48.170> looks<00:02:48.709> when<00:02:49.190> applied<00:02:49.730> on

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
ice so this is how looks when applied on

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.430 
ice so this is how looks when applied on
it<00:02:50.480> glides<00:02:51.410> on<00:02:51.740> very<00:02:52.190> smoothly<00:02:52.990> for<00:02:53.990> me<00:02:54.050> right

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
it glides on very smoothly for me right

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.280 
it glides on very smoothly for me right
now<00:02:54.620> it<00:02:54.890> does<00:02:55.100> not<00:02:55.280> feel<00:02:55.730> like<00:02:55.970> it's<00:02:56.240> drying<00:02:57.020> my

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
now it does not feel like it's drying my

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.820 
now it does not feel like it's drying my
lips<00:02:57.530> out<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:58.630> it's<00:02:59.630> very<00:02:59.780> nice<00:03:00.260> bright

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
lips out and it's very nice bright

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.960 
lips out and it's very nice bright
vibrant<00:03:01.550> color<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.440> it's<00:03:03.440> really<00:03:04.010> opaque<00:03:04.580> I

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
vibrant color and it's really opaque I

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.350 
vibrant color and it's really opaque I
think<00:03:05.720> this<00:03:05.930> product<00:03:06.260> is<00:03:06.590> very<00:03:06.920> nice<00:03:07.100> as<00:03:07.430> for

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
think this product is very nice as for

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.430 
think this product is very nice as for
it<00:03:08.989> does<00:03:09.200> not<00:03:09.380> dry<00:03:09.680> out<00:03:09.709> my<00:03:09.980> lips<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:11.239> it's<00:03:11.870> not

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
it does not dry out my lips and it's not

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.460 
it does not dry out my lips and it's not
really<00:03:13.100> moisturizing<00:03:13.940> but<00:03:14.360> it<00:03:14.450> just<00:03:14.630> doesn't

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
really moisturizing but it just doesn't

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.970 
really moisturizing but it just doesn't
feel<00:03:15.800> dry<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:17.540> feel<00:03:17.959> like<00:03:18.140> I<00:03:18.410> don't<00:03:18.590> really

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
feel dry and I feel like I don't really

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.259 
feel dry and I feel like I don't really
have<00:03:19.130> much<00:03:19.580> on<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.090> lips<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.630> I<00:03:21.440> only<00:03:21.680> needed
