that's not all it's of course it's got
one<00:03:37.349> more<00:03:37.470> feature<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:38.190> might<00:03:38.489> have<00:03:38.639> been

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
one more feature you might have been

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.640 
one more feature you might have been
thinking<00:03:39.239> about<00:03:39.329> what<00:03:39.660> this<00:03:39.840> bit<00:03:40.109> on<00:03:40.230> top<00:03:40.410> is

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
thinking about what this bit on top is

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.319 
thinking about what this bit on top is
not<00:03:41.579> a<00:03:41.609> periscope<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:44.519> first<00:03:44.819> what<00:03:45.120> we<00:03:45.209> have

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
not a periscope the first what we have

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.479 
not a periscope the first what we have
to<00:03:45.419> do<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.750> pull<00:03:46.199> this<00:03:46.319> leave<00:03:46.560> out<00:03:46.739> here<00:03:47.040> down

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
to do is pull this leave out here down

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.270 
to do is pull this leave out here down
like<00:03:47.669> a<00:03:47.699> pump<00:03:47.970> action<00:03:48.620> there<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:49.709> go<00:03:49.889> you<00:03:50.129> hit

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
like a pump action there you go you hit

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.520 
like a pump action there you go you hit
that<00:03:50.430> code<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:51.780> then<00:03:52.079> pressing<00:03:52.319> this<00:03:52.470> button

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
that code and then pressing this button

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.140 
that code and then pressing this button
on<00:03:52.889> the<00:03:53.010> top<00:03:55.310> five<00:03:56.310> discs<00:03:57.379> what<00:03:58.379> puzzles

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
on the top five discs what puzzles

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.259 
on the top five discs what puzzles
should<00:04:00.150> be<00:04:00.299> no<00:04:00.449> one<00:04:00.629> inside<00:04:00.989> of<00:04:01.109> this<00:04:01.199> one<00:04:02.840> okay

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
should be no one inside of this one okay

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.939 
should be no one inside of this one okay
so<00:04:06.269> if<00:04:06.870> you're<00:04:07.139> looking<00:04:07.379> at<00:04:07.590> one<00:04:07.739> of<00:04:07.769> these

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949 
so if you're looking at one of these

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.250 
so if you're looking at one of these
loose<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:09.030> course<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.659> drive<00:04:09.870> in<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.079> mask

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
loose of course the drive in the mask

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.099 
loose of course the drive in the mask
make<00:04:11.069> sure<00:04:11.099> it<00:04:11.400> comes<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.699> the<00:04:11.790> two<00:04:12.000> discs<00:04:12.780> this

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
make sure it comes to the two discs this

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.199 
make sure it comes to the two discs this
one<00:04:13.319> is<00:04:13.440> complete<00:04:13.919> because<00:04:14.819> I've<00:04:14.970> looked

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
one is complete because I've looked

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.980 
one is complete because I've looked
after<00:04:15.419> it<00:04:15.750> right<00:04:16.349> is<00:04:16.590> my<00:04:16.739> favorite

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:19.990 

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.760 

and<00:04:20.990> say<00:04:21.230> that<00:04:21.500> as<00:04:21.590> Raven<00:04:22.390> check<00:04:23.390> prices<00:04:23.930> and

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
and say that as Raven check prices and

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.190 
and say that as Raven check prices and
he<00:04:25.370> varies<00:04:25.880> from<00:04:26.480> around<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:27.020> 32<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.740> 50<00:04:28.220> more

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
he varies from around the 32 the 50 more

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.520 
he varies from around the 32 the 50 more
so<00:04:30.280> isn't<00:04:31.280> equal<00:04:31.580> part<00:04:31.880> of<00:04:32.060> what<00:04:32.210> it<00:04:32.300> is

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
so isn't equal part of what it is

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.100 
so isn't equal part of what it is
