00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello in this opportunity we are going to see the 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.240
 course cyanogenmod 11 for our 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.740
 samsung galaxy s 4 mini I'm looking at 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.370
 turn on the phone to see what 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.000
 speed charge this error comes with 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.150
 android 4.4 points 2 removes 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.369
 and until this date the development has been 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.369
 very good previously I tried it and 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.800
 It has not been very satisfactory but now 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.349
 the development has been good 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.129
 I have not had any problems 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:39.680
 in battery or that I have remembered the 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.350
 cellular or that I have some flaw out there 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.120
 that uncomfortable 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.170
 Well, you've already loaded your cell phone, let's see 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.170
 the android version 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.180
 4.4 points 2 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.150
 quito 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.870
 investment of 100 mod 11 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.590
 consult a date of 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.590
 the update 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.780
 now this this room 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.310
 as you can see this is what can be 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.680
 configure what is the interface here 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.680
 is everything that can be configured 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.369
 and as now it 's coming now you're 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.850
 Android versions the widgets no longer 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.700
 appear here in the menu of the 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.350
 Applications 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.440
 to be able to enter a widget 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.870
 simply boyacÃ¡ 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.230
 and here I present the widgets that I 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.230
 I have 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.230
 something else on this screen is this the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.090
 effects to move here are all 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:59.219
 the effects with which I can move 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.219
 we are not going to put this one here 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.710
 at the moment of moving 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.600
 as a small exodus is not good and there 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.390
 different effects with which you can 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.240
 scroll I can also select the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.370
 default screen 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.910
 I for example have there where is the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.850
 time can not be selected plus it is 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.410
 the wallpaper and settings 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.810
 and the button for configuration 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.390
 well something else with regard to this rom 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.620
 is that the camera is already 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.040
 it is already very stable 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.460
 I can use all your 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.490
 everything is 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.790
 your configurations 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.410
 one of the problems with the flash or the 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.090
 front camera that you have previously 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.390
 there have been problems I have had problems with 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:53.030
 that in other directions but in this case the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.030
 camera worked well completely 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.819
 something more with respect to this Monday the 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.040
 battery version 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.040
 giving it a normal use in a day 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.239
 like every person entering as all 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.540
 normal person entering again in the 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.640
 social networks or sometimes hitting a 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.489
 game during I do not know 15 minutes or 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.379
 half an hour listening to music all where 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.010
 we do not see normal the battery has been able to 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:21.550
 last all day not like other times in 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.800
 a half day is over 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.620
 In this respect, it seems to me that 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.850
 much improved I have not had any 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.640
 problem suddenly of 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.310
 overheating or crashing the 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.190
 cellular at some point as I say up 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.280
 now a room has been has had a good 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.500
 development and it's already stable 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.430
 even within the same page 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.819
 sick already put it as a stable weapon 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.319
