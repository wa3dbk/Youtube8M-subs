00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
puzzle as you can see I'm waiting and

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.200 
puzzle as you can see I'm waiting and
watching<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.380> lava<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:08.250> raises<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.180> lowers

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
watching the lava it raises and lowers

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.420

and<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.740> wait<00:01:10.920> until<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.400> have

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
and so you have to wait until you have

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.000 
and so you have to wait until you have
the<00:01:11.580> safe<00:01:11.970> jump<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.600> top<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.140> pipe<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.619> it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the safe jump on top of the pipe and it

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.740 
the safe jump on top of the pipe and it
can<00:01:14.189> make<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.490> next<00:01:14.700> jump<00:01:15.030> back<00:01:15.299> onto<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
can make the next jump back onto the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.610 
can make the next jump back onto the
shore

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.790 

this<00:01:23.280> next<00:01:23.640> jump<00:01:23.900> was<00:01:24.900> probably<00:01:25.260> the<00:01:25.410> hardest

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
this next jump was probably the hardest

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.580 
this next jump was probably the hardest
one<00:01:25.860> for<00:01:25.980> me<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.310> whatever<00:01:26.640> reason<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.590> keep

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590

one for me for whatever reason I keep
getting<00:01:28.680> hit<00:01:28.980> by<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.190> lava<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.850> going<00:01:30.570> into

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
getting hit by the lava and going into

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.150 
getting hit by the lava and going into
second<00:01:31.140> wind<00:01:33.650> you'll<00:01:34.650> notice<00:01:34.920> right<00:01:35.100> there
