you a live video app it rotates it moves
in<00:00:22.470> all<00:00:22.860> positions<00:00:23.630> once<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.810> move<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.140> and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
in all positions once you move it and

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.040 
in all positions once you move it and
flip<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.740> over<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.119> then<00:00:27.150> take<00:00:27.540> the<00:00:27.720> image

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
flip it over you can then take the image

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.810 
flip it over you can then take the image
and<00:00:28.230> flip<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.830> image<00:00:28.950> over<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.580> it's

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
and flip the image over so that it's

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
way it goes back to right side up you

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.340 
way it goes back to right side up you
can<00:00:35.309> use<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> side<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.900> can<00:00:37.050> take<00:00:37.200> your

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
can use it on the side you can take your

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.040 
can use it on the side you can take your
own<00:00:37.530> picture<00:00:38.210> you<00:00:39.210> could<00:00:39.360> do<00:00:39.510> virtually

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
own picture you could do virtually

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.810 
own picture you could do virtually
anything<00:00:40.080> with<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.800> there's<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.550> built-in

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
anything with it there's a built-in

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.799 
anything with it there's a built-in
intervalometer<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:43.020> motion<00:00:43.379> detector<00:00:43.890> that

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
intervalometer and motion detector that

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.890 
intervalometer and motion detector that
you<00:00:45.860> you<00:00:46.860> plug<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> cord<00:00:48.000> into<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.390> unit<00:00:48.720> and

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
you you plug a cord into the unit and

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.229 
you you plug a cord into the unit and
into<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> cameras<00:00:49.650> cable<00:00:50.070> Ruiz<00:00:50.370> then<00:00:50.790> you<00:00:51.059> can

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
into the cameras cable Ruiz then you can

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.180 
into the cameras cable Ruiz then you can
set<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.540> up<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.170> do<00:00:52.350> intervals<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.479> shots<00:00:55.190> with

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
set it up to do intervals of shots with

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.250 
set it up to do intervals of shots with
a<00:00:56.220> break<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.150> they'll<00:00:57.390> start<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> camera<00:00:58.080> you

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
a break so they'll start the camera you

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.869 
a break so they'll start the camera you
can<00:00:58.409> program<00:00:59.040> it<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.220> do<00:00:59.400> anything<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.850> needs

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
can program it to do anything it needs

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.149 
can program it to do anything it needs
there's<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.839> motion<00:01:01.080> detected<00:01:01.710> with<00:01:01.830> actually

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
there's a motion detected with actually

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.149 
there's a motion detected with actually
nine<00:01:02.370> separate<00:01:02.879> fields<00:01:03.479> in<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.690> viewfinder

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
nine separate fields in the viewfinder

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.500 
nine separate fields in the viewfinder
so<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> bird<00:01:05.940> coming<00:01:06.240> into<00:01:06.479> a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
so that if you have a bird coming into a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.810 
so that if you have a bird coming into a
birdbath<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.650> catch<00:01:07.830> motion<00:01:08.310> coming<00:01:08.610> in

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
birdbath you can catch motion coming in

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.520 
birdbath you can catch motion coming in
you<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.330> tell<00:01:09.479> how<00:01:09.659> many<00:01:09.870> shots<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.260> want

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
you can tell how many shots you want

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.830 
you can tell how many shots you want
when<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.100> either<00:01:11.220> range<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:12.390> useful

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
when it's in either range it's useful

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.080 
when it's in either range it's useful
you<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.350> watch<00:01:13.590> plants<00:01:14.010> grow<00:01:14.190> you<00:01:14.700> could<00:01:14.880> set

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
you can watch plants grow you could set

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.029 
you can watch plants grow you could set
it<00:01:15.120> to<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.479> many<00:01:15.720> many<00:01:15.900> different<00:01:16.140> things<00:01:16.500> it's

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
it to do many many different things it's

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:18.529 
it to do many many different things it's
amazing<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:17.520> got<00:01:17.640> quite<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> range<00:01:18.149> how<00:01:18.360> is

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
amazing it's got quite a range how is

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.649 
amazing it's got quite a range how is
that<00:01:18.659> full<00:01:19.020> 360<00:01:19.590> almost<00:01:20.460> 36<00:01:20.939> feet<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.420> goes

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
that full 360 almost 36 feet it goes

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.050 
that full 360 almost 36 feet it goes
almost<00:01:22.350> all<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> way<00:01:22.649> around<00:01:22.829> you<00:01:23.520> can<00:01:23.549> get<00:01:23.909> in

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
almost all the way around you can get in

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.910 
almost all the way around you can get in
virtually<00:01:24.450> every<00:01:24.600> position<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.530> doesn't

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
virtually every position but it doesn't

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.149 
virtually every position but it doesn't
go<00:01:26.009> 360<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.119> then<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.289> remove<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.890> pins

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
go 360 and then if you remove the pins

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.969 
go 360 and then if you remove the pins
on<00:01:29.399> it<00:01:29.549> right<00:01:29.729> here<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.719> can<00:01:30.990> separate<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
on it right here you can separate it and

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.670 
on it right here you can separate it and
put<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> cable<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.060> between<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:34.109> that<00:01:34.289> you<00:01:34.469> now

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
put a cable in between so that you now

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.830 
put a cable in between so that you now
can<00:01:35.009> shoot<00:01:35.340> at<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> distance<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.780> see

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
can shoot at a distance you can see

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.859 
can shoot at a distance you can see
exactly<00:01:37.829> what<00:01:38.219> was<00:01:38.399> what<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.240> camera<00:01:39.689> is

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
exactly what was what this camera is

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.910 
exactly what was what this camera is
seeing<00:01:40.619> at<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.039> distance<00:01:41.789> and<00:01:41.939> then<00:01:42.479> again<00:01:42.920> fire

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
seeing at a distance and then again fire

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.429 
seeing at a distance and then again fire
the<00:01:44.159> camera<00:01:44.579> from<00:01:45.000> right<00:01:45.179> here<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.200> for

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the camera from right here so that for

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.349 
the camera from right here so that for
the<00:01:46.530> portrait<00:01:46.979> photographer<00:01:47.670> who<00:01:48.000> has<00:01:48.179> his
