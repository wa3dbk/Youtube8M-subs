00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 bright or new video here today 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.230
 There are three fields of myths and always ob 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.480
 they are true or false 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.240
 ok right first with the old myth 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.639
 he is known that means that the myth 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.920
 about the game itself rather left pastor 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.439
 and the chris julien rom 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.750
 There are certainly many fans of the legend of 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.150
 Zelda Spielerei finally is this 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.220
 with over 60 million sold 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.529
 units are the most successful action 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.410
 but one of these fans is a worker 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.899
 well known increase it chris 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.090
 Williams and if you recognize the years 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.219
 after asking and how not to ask 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.710
 Believe on questions of faces 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.690
 Namely, there is this myth in 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.120
 play the last of zelda a link to the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.969
 past a secret room full of blue 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.489
 for what dedicated to this player 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.860
 should be and to resolve this 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.629
 myth is true there are many 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.770
 opportunities to achieve this but 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.199
 most are really very 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.660
 difficult okay to the second myth 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.910
 this myth is about the game of 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.820
 last of zelda majora's mask and indeed 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.670
 about the myth band sound in 2010 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.400
 tells a user with the username of 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.189
 durable of the image before 14 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.439
 an incredible story according to his 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.900
 statement he drove in his neighborhood 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.090
 to a flea market and searched there 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.700
 a game for the nintendo 64 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.460
 at an old mysterious man of the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.890
 some games including insertion 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.020
 modules on which majora's mask 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.509
 apparently even written on it 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.939
 it was apparently so 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.280
 not about the original does not matter anymore 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.409
 but he asked the man but this 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.720
 game because the old man can buy 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.850
 he laughed and gave him the game and 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.710
 Already the actual misere begins too 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.869
 When he arrives home, he puts the game in 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.030
 his console and presented with the stand 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.189
 firmly this is actually working 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.439
 but that was not all in the game 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.170
 was also included a score with 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.840
 the name ben which is already very far 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.750
 had progressed since the have 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.000
 this did not want to continue 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.000
 he set a new score and called 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.060
 this score was left in the game 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.690
 however , they occurred suddenly 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.150
 strange events 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.310
 so sometimes he got in the game anyway 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.470
 if called though he with the 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.330
 scoring from left also played 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.580
 graphics and his mistakes were 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.740
 ubiquitous even as he 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.470
 ben did not delete any grad 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.110
 The improvement on now was even 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.600
 of course there was no name 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.120
 also other oddities and because 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.760
 I about frightening events 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.820
 that damn module said 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.100
 user yes durable held all events 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.380
 also firmly on youtube videos around 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.890
 not to be portrayed as a liar 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.930
 this myth is only despite the videos 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.650
 fake the youtube user has that too 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.810
 added 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.910
 The next myth is about the game 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.270
 the last of zelda ocarina of time and 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.710
 it is true that the myth is the 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.050
 marathon runners beat in the game of 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.400
 last of zelda ocarina of time which 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.120
 originally for the nintendo 64 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.910
 there was a small mini-game 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.220
 he has the possibility in intestine udo dahl 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.709
 to compete against a marathon runner 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.500
 and beat him on this run 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.989
 you can find this in the tent of 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.360
 Baumeister but many failed at the 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.250
 task to defeat the marathon runner 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.260
 is it even possible 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.180
 There are many good ones on the internet 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.340
 players who this task 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.680
 have also put up with a best time 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.390
 from 50 seconds it really would be 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.910
 you do not get that good 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.750
 on time or before the marathon runner 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.160
 to target 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.459
 but you can not just to 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.010
 Unfortunately, the goal is not waiting for you 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.080
 The race will do that automatically 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.630
 so have not broken off 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.550
 The solution to victory can be found at all 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.590
 win some hackers have the 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.320
 complete code of the game after one 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.230
 possible text searched by the 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.070
 Marathon runners in a victory said 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.920
 could be 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.050
 but the effort was inconclusive 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.320
 such text was not even one 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.260
 programs were all possible 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.080
 ClichÃ© tried the game in the game 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.450
 are included but also this was one 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.880
 did not win the final 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.760
 Answer finally gave shigeru 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.410
 miyamoto itself no there is no 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.190
 possibility of the marathon runner too 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.870
 beat 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.260
 this race was with intent 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.790
 built in to annoy the player 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.480
 Yes, I mean what should I do 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.000
 say 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.130
 the myth is where that was now 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.410
 There are three myths of course 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.840
 others, but unfortunately there are others 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.240
 to do things besides cutting videos 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.860
 I can not do it for a long time 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.930
 to cut video in one week 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.150
 That's why I have the video in two parts 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.700
 divided so if you see the rest 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.620
 you want to have one more week now 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.090
 then wait for the second part 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.860
 cut and picked up 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.780
 if the video already has one 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.790
 week is old then you can now 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.530
 right click to the second part 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.180
 come and if the video is not so 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.070
 old is you can still with you 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.020
 have your other video 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.020
 it was but that my last video and 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.560
 Although the myth of mister with ok me 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.560
 say goodbye
