all the way at the top because you live

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.300 
all the way at the top because you live
in<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.430> room<00:01:14.610> when<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:14.940> add<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.479> last<00:01:15.690> two<00:01:16.080> bits

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
first because I'll mix gently with the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.889 
first because I'll mix gently with the
orange<00:01:22.259> juice<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:23.280> then<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.670> add<00:01:23.850> two<00:01:24.509> capfuls

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
orange juice but then we add two capfuls

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:34.580 
orange juice but then we add two capfuls
of<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:28.200> grenadine<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:32.869> this<00:01:33.869> time<00:01:34.109> we<00:01:34.350> don't

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
of the grenadine and this time we don't

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.300 
of the grenadine and this time we don't
mix<00:01:35.479> and<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:36.630> let<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.960> sit<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.350> approximately

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
mix and we let it sit for approximately

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.340 
mix and we let it sit for approximately
you<00:01:38.399> like<00:01:38.579> between<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.270> five<00:01:39.869> minutes

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350
