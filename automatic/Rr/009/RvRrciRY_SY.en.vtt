well<00:00:15.599> we<00:00:15.780> finally<00:00:16.470> made<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.769> to<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.980> end<00:00:17.130> we've

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
well we finally made it to the end we've

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.160 
well we finally made it to the end we've
made<00:00:17.699> biochar<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.390> now<00:00:18.840> we're<00:00:19.019> going<00:00:19.109> to

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
made biochar and now we're going to

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.279 
made biochar and now we're going to
prepare<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.429> put<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.699> in<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.970> soil<00:00:21.289> you

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
prepare it to put it in the soil you

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.169 
prepare it to put it in the soil you
don't<00:00:22.320> want<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.740> just<00:00:22.920> put<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.250> directly<00:00:23.429> in

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:24.179 
don't want to just put it directly in

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.259 
don't want to just put it directly in
biochar<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.439> wonderful<00:00:26.250> soil<00:00:26.550> amendment

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
biochar is a wonderful soil amendment

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.329 
biochar is a wonderful soil amendment
but<00:00:27.509> it<00:00:27.630> needs<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.990> work<00:00:28.199> with<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.650> rest<00:00:29.160> of

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:29.339 
but it needs to work with the rest of

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.310 
but it needs to work with the rest of
the<00:00:29.400> soil<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.419> we're<00:00:30.539> going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> prep<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.080> little

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
the soil so we're going to prep a little

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.640 
the soil so we're going to prep a little
up<00:00:31.439> here<00:00:31.470> with<00:00:32.310> me<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.730> John<00:00:32.940> Gus<00:00:33.240> a<00:00:33.650> professor

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
up here with me is John Gus a professor

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.340 
up here with me is John Gus a professor
emeritus<00:00:34.740> of<00:00:35.400> Teachers<00:00:36.270> College<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.870> Columbia

emeritus of Teachers College of Columbia

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.000 
emeritus of Teachers College of Columbia
University<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:39.030> here's<00:00:39.810> the<00:00:40.020> biochar<00:00:40.590> we<00:00:40.800> had

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
University so here's the biochar we had

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.100 
University so here's the biochar we had
we're<00:00:41.760> gonna<00:00:41.880> make<00:00:42.120> about<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.590> 50/50<00:00:43.590> mix<00:00:45.110> we

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
we're gonna make about a 50/50 mix we

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.680 
we're gonna make about a 50/50 mix we
need<00:00:46.290> to<00:00:46.410> crush<00:00:46.740> it<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:47.070> first<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:48.150> frankly

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
need to crush it up first but frankly

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.459 
need to crush it up first but frankly
it's<00:00:48.810> fairly<00:00:49.110> dusty<00:00:49.830> material<00:00:50.150> so<00:00:51.150> let's<00:00:51.360> pour

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.220 

enough<00:00:55.219> water<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:55.910> that<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.180> dust<00:00:56.539> will<00:00:57.199> be

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
enough water so that the dust will be

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.560 
enough water so that the dust will be
contained<00:00:57.940> good<00:00:58.940> way<00:00:59.090> to<00:00:59.149> tell<00:00:59.449> if<00:00:59.539> your

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
contained good way to tell if your

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.490 
contained good way to tell if your
wheelbarrow<00:00:59.960> leaks<00:01:00.559> also<00:01:01.750> so<00:01:02.750> just<00:01:02.960> chop<00:01:03.230> that

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
wheelbarrow leaks also so just chop that

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.469 
wheelbarrow leaks also so just chop that
up<00:01:05.229> you<00:01:06.229> want<00:01:06.440> to<00:01:06.560> get<00:01:06.740> it<00:01:06.970> not<00:01:07.970> down<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.420> a

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
up you want to get it not down to a

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.240 
up you want to get it not down to a
powder<00:01:08.720> but<00:01:09.110> we<00:01:09.200> want<00:01:09.409> to<00:01:09.530> get<00:01:09.619> it<00:01:09.770> below<00:01:10.070> the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
powder but we want to get it below the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.680 
powder but we want to get it below the
size<00:01:10.460> of<00:01:10.729> our<00:01:10.880> thumb<00:01:13.420> yep

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
size of our thumb yep

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.139 
size of our thumb yep
and<00:01:14.840> it'll<00:01:15.110> soak<00:01:15.320> up<00:01:15.530> all<00:01:15.710> this<00:01:15.979> water<00:01:16.310> because

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
and it'll soak up all this water because

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:26.469 
and it'll soak up all this water because
it's<00:01:17.330> all<00:01:17.509> it's<00:01:17.869> a<00:01:18.020> sponge<00:01:25.030> yeah<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.210> stuff

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
it's all it's a sponge yeah the stuff

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.690 
it's all it's a sponge yeah the stuff
that<00:01:26.659> isn't<00:01:26.810> we<00:01:27.800> got<00:01:27.950> some<00:01:28.190> stuff<00:01:28.429> that<00:01:28.580> isn't

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
that isn't we got some stuff that isn't

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.800 
that isn't we got some stuff that isn't
even<00:01:28.880> wetted<00:01:29.330> yet

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
even wetted yet

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.620 
even wetted yet
so<00:01:30.800> that'll<00:01:31.130> get<00:01:31.310> us<00:01:31.340> going<00:01:31.850> again<00:01:32.179> you<00:01:32.390> want

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
so that'll get us going again you want

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.660 
so that'll get us going again you want
to<00:01:32.720> chop<00:01:32.960> it<00:01:33.170> up<00:01:33.259> a<00:01:33.380> bit<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:33.860> frankly<00:01:34.340> if<00:01:34.490> we're

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
to chop it up a bit and frankly if we're

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.430 
to chop it up a bit and frankly if we're
doing<00:01:34.880> prepping<00:01:35.509> a<00:01:35.600> large<00:01:35.840> amount<00:01:36.229> we'd

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
doing prepping a large amount we'd

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.469 
doing prepping a large amount we'd
probably<00:01:36.679> get<00:01:37.220> some<00:01:37.429> hardware<00:01:37.880> cloth<00:01:38.179> that's

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
probably get some hardware cloth that's

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.850 
probably get some hardware cloth that's
the<00:01:38.720> thick<00:01:39.050> screen<00:01:39.500> that's<00:01:39.740> either

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
the thick screen that's either

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.790 
the thick screen that's either
quarter-inch<00:01:40.610> or<00:01:40.759> half-inch<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.590> set<00:01:42.590> that

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
quarter-inch or half-inch and set that

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.130 
quarter-inch or half-inch and set that
out<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.280> sieve<00:01:44.240> it<00:01:44.390> through<00:01:44.420> there<00:01:44.840> so<00:01:45.020> the

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
out and sieve it through there so the

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.660 
out and sieve it through there so the
big<00:01:45.289> pieces<00:01:45.530> are<00:01:45.830> retained<00:01:46.190> and<00:01:46.429> the<00:01:46.490> little

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
big pieces are retained and the little

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.290 
big pieces are retained and the little
pieces<00:01:46.850> fall<00:01:47.240> through<00:01:47.539> now<00:01:48.170> let's<00:01:48.470> add<00:01:48.679> some

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
pieces fall through now let's add some

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.270 
pieces fall through now let's add some
compost<00:01:50.300> Joan<00:01:51.050> is<00:01:51.259> there<00:01:51.380> any<00:01:51.590> compost

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
compost Joan is there any compost

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.130 
compost Joan is there any compost
anywhere<00:01:52.940> around<00:01:53.090> here<00:01:55.569> could<00:01:56.569> you<00:01:56.780> do<00:01:56.960> the

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
anywhere around here could you do the

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.080 
anywhere around here could you do the
honors<00:01:59.170> so<00:02:00.170> we<00:02:00.349> want<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.709> add<00:02:00.830> about<00:02:01.099> an<00:02:01.520> equal

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
honors so we want to add about an equal

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.190 
honors so we want to add about an equal
volume<00:02:02.739> to<00:02:03.739> this<00:02:03.950> mixture<00:02:04.729> of<00:02:04.959> biochar<00:02:05.959> that

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
volume to this mixture of biochar that

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.040 
volume to this mixture of biochar that
we<00:02:06.289> made<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:07.330> that's<00:02:08.330> what<00:02:08.539> we're<00:02:08.690> going<00:02:08.929> to

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
we made and that's what we're going to

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.510 
we made and that's what we're going to
that's<00:02:09.979> good<00:02:10.900> little<00:02:11.900> more<00:02:12.080> water<00:02:12.379> it's<00:02:13.310> going

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
that's good little more water it's going

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.570 
that's good little more water it's going
to<00:02:13.610> get<00:02:13.730> wet<00:02:13.910> in<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.180> soil<00:02:14.980> we'll<00:02:15.980> mix<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.400> all

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
to get wet in the soil we'll mix it all

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.180 
to get wet in the soil we'll mix it all
around<00:02:20.230> we're<00:02:21.230> probably<00:02:21.530> going<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.770> want<00:02:21.920> more

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
around we're probably going to want more

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.110 
around we're probably going to want more
soil<00:02:22.640> in<00:02:22.879> this<00:02:23.030> but<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:24.680> concept<00:02:25.250> is<00:02:25.400> biochar

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
soil in this but the concept is biochar

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.390 
soil in this but the concept is biochar
does<00:02:26.330> not<00:02:26.540> have<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.170> replace<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.769> soil<00:02:28.010> it's

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
does not have to replace the soil it's

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.160 
does not have to replace the soil it's
the<00:02:28.760> best<00:02:29.300> ten<00:02:30.019> percent<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.890> great<00:02:31.760> soil<00:02:32.170> so

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
the best ten percent of great soil so

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.290 
the best ten percent of great soil so
the<00:02:33.319> other<00:02:33.440> 90<00:02:33.950> percent<00:02:33.980> can<00:02:34.489> be<00:02:34.580> clay<00:02:34.940> and

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
the other 90 percent can be clay and
