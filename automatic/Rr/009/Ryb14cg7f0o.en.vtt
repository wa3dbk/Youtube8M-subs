difficult things to do in that like the

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.600 
difficult things to do in that like the
cost<00:03:55.080> in<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.320> shadows<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.800> the<00:03:55.890> dancers<00:03:56.370> on

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.140 

new<00:04:05.020> combinations<00:04:05.740> would<00:04:05.920> then<00:04:06.160> inform<00:04:07.000> I

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
new combinations would then inform I

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.680 
new combinations would then inform I
knew<00:04:07.330> you<00:04:07.510> were<00:04:07.660> going<00:04:08.380> to<00:04:08.440> be<00:04:08.560> energetic<00:04:09.690> so

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
knew you were going to be energetic so

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.480 
knew you were going to be energetic so
that<00:04:10.960> was<00:04:11.110> a<00:04:11.140> little<00:04:11.500> bit<00:04:11.770> tricky<00:04:12.100> to<00:04:12.130> get<00:04:12.310> each

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
that was a little bit tricky to get each

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.550 
that was a little bit tricky to get each
screen<00:04:12.850> isolated<00:04:13.750> from<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.050> other<00:04:14.200> screen

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
screen isolated from the other screen

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.020 
screen isolated from the other screen
that<00:04:14.800> took<00:04:14.950> a<00:04:14.980> little<00:04:15.130> bit<00:04:15.340> of<00:04:15.460> time<00:04:15.700> they

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
that took a little bit of time they

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.930 
that took a little bit of time they
wanted<00:04:16.360> a<00:04:16.420> dome<00:04:16.660> so<00:04:16.959> I'm<00:04:17.080> made<00:04:17.590> I<00:04:17.920> think<00:04:18.640> maybe

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
wanted a dome so I'm made I think maybe

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.970 
wanted a dome so I'm made I think maybe
some<00:04:19.720> hundreds<00:04:20.110> of<00:04:20.200> light<00:04:20.410> bulbs<00:04:20.739> in<00:04:20.920> the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
some hundreds of light bulbs in the

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.920 
some hundreds of light bulbs in the
concentric<00:04:21.519> circles<00:04:21.940> around<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.360> dome<00:04:22.540> and

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
concentric circles around the dome and

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.930 
concentric circles around the dome and
then<00:04:23.200> put<00:04:23.380> them<00:04:23.530> all<00:04:23.650> on<00:04:23.680> our<00:04:23.920> demos<00:04:24.220> so<00:04:24.910> I

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
then put them all on our demos so I

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:35.890 
then put them all on our demos so I
could<00:04:25.180> chase<00:04:25.360> them<00:04:25.570> in<00:04:25.690> different<00:04:25.960> way

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.290 

so<00:04:36.320> his<00:04:36.530> own<00:04:36.800> challenging<00:04:37.550> to<00:04:37.670> be<00:04:37.790> dancing<00:04:38.210> in
