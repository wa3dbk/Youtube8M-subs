00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:32.460

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.570
 words variable well, well, or meme here 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:39.000

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.419
 as if just like dumplings do not know 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.040
 carrying does not taste and color comrades 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.450
 No, I tell you my opinion purely on 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.610
 my opinion is well as fried dumplings 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:23.070
 fried by no less actually 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:28.050
 fried dumplings in alternating dough not 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:30.120
 need not eat anything else so in 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.990
 ohkot everything goes delicious i'm not saying that 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:36.030
 tasteless principle normal to taste 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.120
 just not to dry there is very add 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.419
 Sauce what is he there cheesy any 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:47.280
 generally it was normal but then she 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:48.440
 normally unusual, such are the cases
