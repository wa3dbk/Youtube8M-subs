anywhere<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.469> reason<00:00:46.589> why<00:00:46.739> i<00:00:46.769> want<00:00:47.010> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
anywhere so the reason why i want to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.139 
anywhere so the reason why i want to
show<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.640> because<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
show you this is because this is a

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.079 
show you this is because this is a
really<00:00:48.329> good<00:00:48.420> replay<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.839> show<00:00:49.109> you<00:00:49.170> why<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
really good replay to show you why the

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.459 
really good replay to show you why the
hitting<00:00:51.089> the<00:00:51.210> tracks<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.809> tracking<00:00:52.140> somebody

hitting the tracks and tracking somebody

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.410 
hitting the tracks and tracking somebody
so<00:00:52.739> your<00:00:52.859> enemies<00:00:53.129> can<00:00:53.339> shoot<00:00:53.519> them<00:00:53.640> really

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.790 
well so i'm waiting for my reloads quite
long<00:05:15.330> because<00:05:15.570> I<00:05:15.780> memorex<00:05:16.230> try<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:16.680> hit<00:05:16.770> the

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
long because I memorex try and hit the

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.440 
long because I memorex try and hit the
weak<00:05:16.980> spot<00:05:17.010> again<00:05:17.460> this<00:05:17.640> is<00:05:18.030> quite<00:05:18.240> dangerous

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
weak spot again this is quite dangerous

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.980 
weak spot again this is quite dangerous
because<00:05:18.810> he<00:05:18.990> can<00:05:19.169> shoot<00:05:19.380> me<00:05:19.530> I'm<00:05:19.680> pretty<00:05:19.919> big

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
because he can shoot me I'm pretty big

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.960 
because he can shoot me I'm pretty big

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
only got 19 elf and I'm a wreck but I

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.120 
only got 19 elf and I'm a wreck but I
just<00:06:19.960> want<00:06:20.110> to<00:06:20.170> do<00:06:20.230> as<00:06:20.320> much<00:06:20.470> damage<00:06:20.500> as<00:06:20.830> I<00:06:20.950> can

before<00:06:21.280> the<00:06:21.550> game<00:06:21.670> ends<00:06:25.950> so<00:06:26.950> he's<00:06:27.070> probably

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
before the game ends so he's probably

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.800 
before the game ends so he's probably
somewhere<00:06:27.670> there<00:06:28.120> he<00:06:28.210> was<00:06:28.360> retreating
