00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 here is the shoe by androidpit de and 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.660
 in my hand I hold again 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.590
 China's smartphone this time of the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.719
 manufacturer meso that is visually on the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.610
 at first sight it looks like in mesum 2 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.500
 Note is not it because that's it 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.119
 mx-5 the current flagship from the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.900
 home and we'll see you now 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.170
 hands on to 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.990
 So here we see the knife mx 5 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.519
 in close up before we go to the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.400
 we come first internal hardware 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.410
 times to the outer appearance of it 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.250
 this is a 55 inch 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.500
 display with a full hd resolution and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.890
 the whole packed in one full 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.300
 Aluminum housing of metal housing and 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.120
 yes that is someone there mainly 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.590
 also differed two not that was 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.140
 namely more or less one 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.140
 Pretense of metal and disabled 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.140
 only plastic housing here so a premium 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.670
 finish with a 20 megapixel camera 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.719
 the back which is supported with 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.670
 a led flash so you once 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.000
 to produce beautiful natural colors 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.150
 and what else is there on the page here 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.740
 on the side is the other 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.869
 switch-off plus one continuous 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.760
 volume then you actually rock 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.650
 It can reach very well though there is content 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.119
 55 inches is also down below 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.820
 is there then a micro usb 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.280
 port it is not a usb type c but also 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.640
 the standard micro usb port 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.479
 a little microphone and here behind 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.700
 then is the small one 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.130
 loudspeaker so it's mono 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.470
 speakers and that is actually enough 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.720
 Occur out and then it works 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.119
 further up to we have a 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.310
 another microphone pull right next to 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.860
 the 3.5 millimeter jack connection for 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.090
 the headset or headset should then 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.270
 namely ambient noise here 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.369
 pick it up so that you can be clearer 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.950
 can achieve language quality if one 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.329
 in noisy surroundings is located and on 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.500
 the page is then also 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:05.310
 micro sd card slot but that is here 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.500
 a sim card slide for dual sim 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.930
 cards so in speaking of two sim 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.690
 cards 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.050
 insert and then in two nets 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.060
 work in parallel content is still to come 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.100
 front front, there is also something to 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.950
 explain and that is located here in front 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.650
 yourself a 5 megapixel front camera and 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.650
 then, below, I'm missioning 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.990
 there is a home button here 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.120
 There are no softkeys left and right 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.190
 that is such a peculiarity of flavio 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.290
 but it comes but the same 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.330
 home-button does not just include the 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.940
 ball itself but also one 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.390
 fingerprint sensor with yours 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.580
 smartphone or mx-5 then excluded 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.350
 unlock state unlock can also pay 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.330
 then stories can make content 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.340
 but since this is an imported one 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.650
 device can be assumed 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.540
 that it does not stop right now 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.760
 Germany would work if you 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.600
 there by nfc paints or by fingerprint 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.760
 can pay 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.430
 apropos nfc nfc they do not installed 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.050
 So talk to an nfc terminal 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.610
 pay he does not go here 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.230
 but now say to the whole 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.709
 stories installed here in the inside 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.690
 been 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.730
 in there we can also just times 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.010
 even a tutor simply times call because 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.660
 Do you already see benchmark value if you 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.940
 then go into the info normal 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.840
 there you see this mediatek processor 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.420
 was built 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:27.250
 that's the helio x10 with 2.2 ghz and 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.230
 what is there still believes 3 gb 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.690
 memory one here that three 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.350
 gigabyte of memory is in it and it 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:39.459
 she is currently providing this mx-5 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:43.480
 importers than 32 gb variant the 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.519
 results from 50,000 1 161 benchmarks 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.360
 Score at the tutow is not exactly 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:51.670
 a lot considering that it is 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.760
 the media library processes the lever x10 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.190
 Actually we are high end product 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.230
 it can be from the media tech group 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.340
 currently in heydt not in terms of performance 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.700
 with record 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.230
 with such processors with the exitus 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:09.739
 74 20 from samsung or even with the 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.180
 qualcomm snapdragon 810 the lie 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.530
 much higher in the benchmark values 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.930
 but be it 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.359
 that does not necessarily have to be decisive 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.549
 if every smartphone brings that 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.370
 most smartphones say I am 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.110
 all already relatively fast and 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.850
 midrange devices but that's another 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.410
 why why here now at the 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.030
 always read all the softkeys 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.250
 was omitted that has a whole 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.430
 special unit with the little us too 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.690
 do as you see flavio you can see here 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.120
 in the settings you can see that too 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.380
 that someone was totally changed 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.110
 We Just have a look to what it 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.229
 an android version underneath it is 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.930
 would have to be here android 501 so not 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.180
 the most recent was but it was enough 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.500
 at least then immediately to it 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.530
 work it is actually relatively 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.550
 liquid and you can handle it very well 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.840
 There is no metro here under the us 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.570
 but all apps are here 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.979
 just put it on the homescreens and 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.990
 you can only clear that 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.550
 do if you then stop investing folder 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.690
 just merge and get one 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.789
 folder puts multi task manager gets 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.580
 one about it, if one from below 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.860
 from the display up to the horse is coming 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.289
 the task manager and one 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.490
 No one can choose to go there 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.280
 another app then stop 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.780
 jump back and the home button has 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.340
 another special feature that one 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.510
 then, if I have someone again 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.940
 go in 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.919
 With a simple tip you jump 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.520
 Take a step back with the double top 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:42.110
 you come back to the homescreen that 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.840
 is also a double assignment of 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.280
 the home button so the display can be 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.320
 of course also use it then 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.060
 to activate gesture control for 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.919
 For example, someone here in here you can 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.139
 here by double cab one can to 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.300
 example, then in the screen namely from 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:59.060
 awaken the state of rest as you do so 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.349
 in front of the lg devices next to halt knows and 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.910
 so on and so on, there are also 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:04.010
 various other movements you 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.800
 I can do that, too 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.849
 already shown in the m2 if you guys 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.949
 that interests you then you just go 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:11.889
 there again in the hands-on into 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:15.340
 So that's it from ours 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:17.259
 hans mazur mx-5 a short information 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.349
 So i'm doing some china 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:22.090
 weak smartphone is supported 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:24.610
 Of course, that's not the 800 anymore 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.069
 This frequency keeps him in the middle 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.960
 germany the disease gbm halt is 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:30.249
 and the complete review on this 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.840
 small smartphone metal gear of course 

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:36.939
 on ndr.de a read is a long day 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.400
 as a weekend is already short 

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:41.349
 before any further information 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.599
 as well as the test report on android 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:45.039
 pad de and my name already see you 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:46.689
