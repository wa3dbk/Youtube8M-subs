00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.830
 then bye guys i make this video 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:11.580
 for the google plus lg2 italy group 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:18.359
 to show you how the app works 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:24.920
 I posted a few hours ago if I find it there 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:28.189
 I have it here. Here is this lgg here two spouses 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:33.149
 practically when 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:35.040
 we install and do not detect this other 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.950
 installed application called 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.980
 exposed installer will send us 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.170
 directly to the link where to download 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:48.390
 this app we should in this case 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.789
 install and update the framework 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.510
 or remove it and always do it 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.100
 from here and then activate the exposed note 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.120
 lgg 2 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.969
 in this section modules then do 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.920
 reboot from this screen and go 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.100
 then on our application 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.220
 settings where we can have all these 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:19.229
 additional features this first 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.970
 function practically cleans the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.090
 this application screen 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.009
 recent therefore we lift the possibilities of 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.509
 delete all of the task manager then 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:33.310
 for more experience from android stock 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:38.950
 volume who music control and practically 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:42.360
 makes us change the traces of the 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.670
 music that we listen to from the volume keys 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.189
 posterior to less overflow the wall up 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.670
 if I haven't tried it yet because it hasn't 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.350
 I had so much time to play with 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.270
 status and navigation bar control 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.799
 practically sets the color black for 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.210
 the upper bar as gray 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.210
 I think it was unwatchable 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.100
 I also set the bar to 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.100
 navigation 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.160
 and transparent in the home vi 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.460
 I show here practically not there 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.380
 plus that fading of the software 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.490
 initial or even here that maybe you notice 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.560
 a little less because it is a background that 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.820
 higher black mind however here in the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.890
 transition you can see how it is 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.720
 transparent but back in the then vi 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:37.770
 I show that you can also decide 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.870
 what transparency to block and with 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.120
 things option sequences so we can 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.069
 delete certain things from ours 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.980
 bar just like the 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.200
 the written mpm but our case is not there 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.049
 you need to delete the clock icon 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.349
 battery alarm week settings 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:59.950
 bar then just this whole bar 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:04.409
 I deleted the time at 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:09.340
 center and I left this ticked 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:14.499
 this section aid carrier lebel in which 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:17.129
 did not leave the changes to the 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:20.760
 status bar by clicking on the button 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:23.079
 settings are reactivated me these two 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.569
 these two sliders then that of the 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:30.549
 volume that of brightness that alone 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:32.650
 now I keep it deactivated 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:36.069
 we have navigation bar option precisely 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.079
 to have the height of the navigation bar 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.500
 so if we want smaller icons 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.659
 we can make them smaller to have a 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.439
 four-button layout then put 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:52.509
 that I know present in another 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:55.180
 button and select a function in 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:57.759
 case of long pressure I left 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.430
 the stop functions because I was now 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:02.650
 used to it but if you want you can change 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.739
 you can also change the colors of the 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.189
 button in this case I left 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:13.569
 stock color and light coming into the 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:16.659
 moment when we click on it 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.810
 as you have seen before we return to the 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:21.639
 because I'm doing a bit of trouble 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.590
 or simply disable the 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.449
 nice nick and shawn bar then remove 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.810
 the navigation bar 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:31.360
 these are functions you can have 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.310
 moments when you install the version 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.909
 then completes the paid one in 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.599
 free version of the paid version 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:43.300
 can buy through purchase in the app 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:45.820
 so you won't find it on the play store 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.750
 I bought it because not up that 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.730
 I think he had a 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.340
 its peculiarity is its usefulness 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.850
 for me who are lovers of these little ones 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:00.060
 changes and while in the free one 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.650
 you will probably have a few features 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.440
 I recommend it because I am there 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.480
 found very well also helps second 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.290
 me in ram management but never had it 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.110
 so free for this video think of 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:17.540
 have all said hello to all a 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.540
 all the lg g2 italia community by tones
