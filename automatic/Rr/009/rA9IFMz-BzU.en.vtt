00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
some rye just for added cover we don't

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.250 
some rye just for added cover we don't
have<00:01:52.000> bare<00:01:52.240> dirt<00:01:52.479> here<00:01:52.720> going<00:01:52.960> into<00:01:53.170> the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
have bare dirt here going into the

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.429 
have bare dirt here going into the
winter<00:01:53.850> look<00:01:54.850> at<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.119> food<00:01:55.330> in<00:01:55.570> here<00:01:55.810> look<00:01:56.260> at

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
winter look at the food in here look at

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.740 
winter look at the food in here look at
all<00:01:56.650> this<00:01:56.890> food<00:01:57.159> you<00:01:57.460> asked<00:01:58.000> about<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.510> corn

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
all this food you asked about the corn

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.420 
all this food you asked about the corn
of<00:01:58.900> being<00:01:59.080> mixed<00:01:59.320> and<00:01:59.530> what<00:01:59.650> it<00:01:59.740> can<00:01:59.860> do<00:01:59.979> look

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
of being mixed and what it can do look

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.350 
of being mixed and what it can do look
at<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:01.030> food<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:02.229> this<00:02:02.909> product<00:02:03.909> these<00:02:04.119> two

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
at the food that this product these two

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.550 
at the food that this product these two
products<00:02:04.960> produce<00:02:05.400> okay<00:02:06.479> there's<00:02:07.479> tons<00:02:08.289> of

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
products produce okay there's tons of

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.869 
products produce okay there's tons of
food<00:02:08.769> here<00:02:08.979> there's<00:02:09.189> going<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.429> be<00:02:09.519> pods

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
food here there's going to be pods

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.390 
food here there's going to be pods
there's<00:02:10.659> going<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:10.929> be<00:02:10.989> ears<00:02:11.290> of<00:02:11.439> corn<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:12.340> to

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
there's going to be ears of corn so to

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.580 
there's going to be ears of corn so to
put<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.909> math<00:02:13.090> in<00:02:13.329> the<00:02:13.419> perspective<00:02:14.109> you've

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
put the math in the perspective you've

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.190 
put the math in the perspective you've
got<00:02:14.829> eight<00:02:15.010> acres<00:02:15.430> here<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:15.909> think<00:02:16.719> this<00:02:16.900> corn

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
got eight acres here I think this corn

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.640 
got eight acres here I think this corn
is<00:02:17.319> going<00:02:17.469> to

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
is going to

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.729 
is going to
about<00:02:17.980> 175<00:02:18.879> bushels<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.690> acre<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.680> you

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
about 175 bushels to the acre so you

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.580 
about 175 bushels to the acre so you
multiply<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.459> by<00:02:21.519> 8<00:02:21.909> the<00:02:22.870> soybean<00:02:23.290> will

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
multiply that by 8 the soybean will

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.530 
multiply that by 8 the soybean will
probably<00:02:24.069> throw<00:02:24.250> about<00:02:24.430> 30<00:02:24.909> bushels<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.420> the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
probably throw about 30 bushels to the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.080 
probably throw about 30 bushels to the
acre<00:02:25.629> do<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.650> math<00:02:26.860> on<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:27.459> there's<00:02:27.610> 240

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
acre do the math on that so there's 240

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.259 
acre do the math on that so there's 240
bushels<00:02:28.629> of<00:02:28.780> corn<00:02:28.840> of<00:02:29.349> soybean<00:02:29.620> here<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.370> 175

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
bushels of corn of soybean here and 175

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.720 
bushels of corn of soybean here and 175
times<00:02:31.930> 8<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:32.440> there's<00:02:32.590> over<00:02:32.769> a<00:02:32.799> thousand

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
times 8 so there's over a thousand

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.110 
times 8 so there's over a thousand
bushels<00:02:34.420> of<00:02:34.810> corn<00:02:35.069> who<00:02:36.069> doesn't<00:02:36.459> want<00:02:36.610> that

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
bushels of corn who doesn't want that

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.869 
bushels of corn who doesn't want that
going<00:02:37.569> into<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.900> hunting<00:02:38.140> season<00:02:38.670> hey<00:02:39.670> look
