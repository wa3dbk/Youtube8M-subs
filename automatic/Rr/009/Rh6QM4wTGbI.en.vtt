down poor headed there but there wasn't
much<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.550> could<00:00:35.579> do<00:00:35.850> really<00:00:37.730> one<00:00:38.730> thing<00:00:38.879> I

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
much I could do really one thing I

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.290 
much I could do really one thing I
really<00:00:39.480> liked<00:00:39.719> about<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.610> section<00:00:41.610> yeah<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
really liked about this section yeah the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.779 
really liked about this section yeah the
game<00:00:42.840> gets<00:00:43.350> kind<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.649> weird<00:00:43.890> when<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:44.399> moving

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
game gets kind of weird when it's moving

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.060 
game gets kind of weird when it's moving
left<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.090> right<00:00:45.410> like<00:00:46.410> when<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.739> trains

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
left and right like when the trains

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.160 
left and right like when the trains
turning<00:00:47.610> yeah<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.690> does<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> only

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
turning yeah like that does the only

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.930 
turning yeah like that does the only
time<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.320> ever<00:00:49.410> noticed<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.039> weird<00:00:50.340> cover

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
time I ever noticed that weird cover

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.750 
time I ever noticed that weird cover
aiming<00:00:51.570> glitch<00:00:51.809> but<00:00:52.399> one<00:00:53.399> thing<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.640> really

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
aiming glitch but one thing that really

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.639 
aiming glitch but one thing that really
kind<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.030> impressed<00:00:54.329> me<00:00:54.449> about<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.960> so

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
kind of impressed me about this is so

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.889 
kind of impressed me about this is so
many<00:00:55.860> times<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.250> games<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.879> well<00:00:57.719> they

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
many times on games like this well they

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.599 
many times on games like this well they
just<00:00:58.079> avoid<00:00:58.320> sections<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.219> entirely

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
just avoid sections like this entirely

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.849 
just avoid sections like this entirely
because<00:01:00.090> obviously<00:01:00.420> if<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.260> just<00:01:01.469> sit<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.680> one

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
because obviously if you just sit in one

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.280 
because obviously if you just sit in one
spot<00:01:01.890> you're<00:01:02.670> gonna<00:01:02.789> see<00:01:03.120> stuff<00:01:03.180> repeated<00:01:03.899> you

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
spot you're gonna see stuff repeated you

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.719 
spot you're gonna see stuff repeated you
can<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> backgrounds<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:06.000> an<00:01:06.150> old

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
can see the backgrounds like an old

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.789 
can see the backgrounds like an old
hanna-barbera<00:01:08.729> cartoon<00:01:09.240> mm-hmm<00:01:09.930> Tom<00:01:10.650> and

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
hanna-barbera cartoon mm-hmm Tom and

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.620 
hanna-barbera cartoon mm-hmm Tom and
Jerry<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.610> right<00:01:11.970> exactly<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.450> same

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
Jerry right right exactly the same

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.969 
Jerry right right exactly the same
colors<00:01:12.930> they're<00:01:13.080> gonna<00:01:13.170> go<00:01:13.350> flying<00:01:13.560> by<00:01:13.740> but

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
colors they're gonna go flying by but

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.460 
colors they're gonna go flying by but
they<00:01:14.549> did<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> really<00:01:14.970> good<00:01:15.060> job<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.689> making<00:01:15.869> it

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
they did a really good job of making it

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.980 
they did a really good job of making it
um<00:01:17.490> flow<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.689> not<00:01:20.119> seem<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.570> repeating

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
um flow and not seem like it's repeating

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.130 
um flow and not seem like it's repeating
mm-hmm<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.790> didn't<00:01:24.150> notice<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.420> at

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
mm-hmm I just I didn't notice that at

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.600 
mm-hmm I just I didn't notice that at
all<00:01:25.290> without<00:01:25.530> like<00:01:25.860> going<00:01:26.130> out<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.310> my<00:01:26.340> way<00:01:26.430> to

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
all without like going out of my way to

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.640 
all without like going out of my way to
look<00:01:26.909> for<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.330> did<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.110> find<00:01:28.350> it

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
look for it did you find it

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.370 
look for it did you find it
oh<00:01:28.680> yeah<00:01:29.130> because<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:30.450> next<00:01:30.780> part<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:31.320> of

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
oh yeah because this next part is one of

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.740 
oh yeah because this next part is one of
the<00:01:31.470> hardest<00:01:31.619> parts<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.070> game<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.750> don't

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the hardest parts in the game I don't

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.690 
the hardest parts in the game I don't
know<00:01:33.990> why<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.500> struggled<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:34.979> much<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.520> but

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
know why I struggled so much with it but

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.060 
know why I struggled so much with it but
I<00:01:35.729> just<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.150> did<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.560> really<00:01:37.770> don't<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:37.979> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
I just I did and I really don't have a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.700 
I just I did and I really don't have a
good<00:01:38.280> strategy<00:01:38.490> other<00:01:38.790> than<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.150> stay<00:01:39.390> back

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
good strategy other than just stay back

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.109 
good strategy other than just stay back
there's<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.799> couple<00:01:40.979> guys<00:01:41.220> with<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.820> couple

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
there's a couple guys with a couple

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.810 
there's a couple guys with a couple
heavy<00:01:42.299> armor<00:01:42.630> guys<00:01:42.780> with<00:01:43.020> shotguns<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.820> number

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
heavy armor guys with shotguns a number

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.810 
heavy armor guys with shotguns a number
of<00:01:44.909> guys<00:01:45.060> with<00:01:45.240> rifles<00:01:45.659> down<00:01:45.840> below<00:01:46.220> they<00:01:47.220> will

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
of guys with rifles down below they will

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.819 
of guys with rifles down below they will
sometimes<00:01:48.060> climb<00:01:48.720> up<00:01:49.140> onto<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.130> roof<00:01:50.310> yeah<00:01:51.060> oh

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
sometimes climb up onto the roof yeah oh

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.800 
sometimes climb up onto the roof yeah oh
I<00:01:52.829> guess<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> main<00:01:53.729> strategy<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.659> stay

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
I guess the main strategy is just stay

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.990 
I guess the main strategy is just stay
to<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.020> back<00:01:55.229> because<00:01:55.740> they<00:01:56.250> typically<00:01:56.670> can't

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
to the back because they typically can't

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.480 
to the back because they typically can't
throw<00:01:57.329> grenades<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.990> far<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:59.250> when<00:01:59.430> they

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
throw grenades that far and when they

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.700 
throw grenades that far and when they
get<00:01:59.610> grenades<00:01:59.939> at<00:02:00.090> your<00:02:00.210> feet<00:02:00.420> that's<00:02:00.710> game

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
get grenades at your feet that's game

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.120 
get grenades at your feet that's game
over

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
over

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.190 
over
well<00:02:02.430> it's<00:02:03.180> not<00:02:03.299> too<00:02:03.479> hard<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.689> avoid<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
well it's not too hard to avoid the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.350 
well it's not too hard to avoid the
grenades<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:05.369> you're<00:02:05.640> already<00:02:05.820> damaged

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360
