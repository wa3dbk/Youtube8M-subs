00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.529
 And youtube personal I am - brs I am 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.580
 here with lincom cumbica sp 510 for 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.219
 make a test as worsening the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.010
 zoom told me that when we pull 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:22.050
 very fast she says seal this old shah 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.960
 slow is not to blur the here produces 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.970
 1 he has to put two stages here only 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:33.090
 You messing with him to see that he has 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:35.370
 The 60's that he has a little foot here right? 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.140
 is that when you click the first time 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.180
 he plays the first time he gives a 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.190
 contact after the other contact will be 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.620
 even more magic that was faster 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.530
 but we also have here 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:51.379
 Let's zoom in and test the sound here. 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.379
 Are you going to defocus or not? Come on. 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.579
 here we go with this tight that the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.289
 movie I'm going to zoom here from the side 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.559
 like saying that was for the game on 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.559
 My pen had to focus on us. 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:14.070
 began to record the sound of an hour I 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.880
 to blur the nail guide blurred 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.880
 new is very close 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:25.490
 cute then the same personal thing does not 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.490
 Goodbye, if it's too slow. 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.240
 There's no way he's going to focus on them. 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.560
 they focus a little on after him 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.130
 focus again 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.869
 so it's not a question of the same has more 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.320
 slow or not the machine really it 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.479
 will move anyway it as something 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.310
 normal because when you 're attacking 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.680
 a camcorder even you will give strength 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.899
 will zoom in so she can move because 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.200
 she loses that focus is to rescue in the 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.930
 time there watching there to focus on a 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.719
 Something else then I think it's normal 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.780
 Ok guys so this is a tip I 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.020
 I tried running that is record and pull by 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.510
 here zoom to see if there if she 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.569
 say seal online 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.049
 recording here at the time she loses 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.030
 the time to focus on 11 more 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.720
 slow even though it loses touch focus 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.269
 folks 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.970
 This is a tip there that did not give much 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.579
 certain personal touch and also something else 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.280
 I saw that in the videos that she when I 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.140
 I do with it in full hd that the image 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.650
 It's great when we zoom in 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.220
 it seems the machine can capture 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.250
 the engine noise from the zoom in is this 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.170
 I did not like because it's personal are you 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.540
 Zooming in is something you're listening to. 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.620
 noise is something very much is totally lost 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.650
 the direction of filming other than 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.170
 this machine from this camcorder that you 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.389
 are you watching the video is a sony that I 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.629
 Can I zoom in on the time it was not? 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:03.409
 Catch the noise of the sound is very quiet 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.970
 personal touch 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.879
 so thats it if you like give some 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.659
 joinha of this personal touch message 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.659
 Thank you and see you
