until<00:01:59.210> you<00:01:59.360> see<00:01:59.600> lightning<00:02:00.530> bolts<00:02:01.010> and<00:02:01.190> then

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
until you see lightning bolts and then

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.460 
until you see lightning bolts and then
hit<00:02:02.630> why<00:02:06.640> now<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:07.940> won't<00:02:08.179> always<00:02:08.450> read<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.020> Y

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
hit why now it won't always read the Y

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
because of all the exes so I guess it's

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.170
