lot of hurdles to get past before we can
even<00:01:36.179> try<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.200> what<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.770> need<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.130> do<00:01:38.429> is<00:01:38.700> go

yeah<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:56.999> a<00:01:57.090> beep<00:01:57.299> saying<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.899> that's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
yeah we have a beep saying that that's

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.620 
yeah we have a beep saying that that's
off<00:01:58.889> the<00:02:00.109> SCM<00:02:01.369> whatever<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:03.029> up<00:02:03.239> to<00:02:03.389> max

and the f1 d-c presumably that's not

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.020

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.339 
David Coulthard dynamic control probably
that's<00:02:12.599> also<00:02:12.930> turned<00:02:13.170> up<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.409> max<00:02:13.620> um<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
that's also turned up to max um and the

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.649 
that's also turned up to max um and the
traction<00:02:16.590> controls<00:02:17.040> off

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
traction controls off

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:23.479 
traction controls off
so<00:02:18.659> that's<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:21.560> highly<00:02:22.560> relevant<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.159> is<00:02:23.340> of

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.869 

it<00:03:10.530> actually<00:03:11.040> wants<00:03:11.129> to<00:03:11.310> understand<00:03:11.819> this<00:03:11.969> car

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
it actually wants to understand this car

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.009 
it actually wants to understand this car
and<00:03:14.879> then<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.209> wants<00:03:15.359> to<00:03:15.450> behave<00:03:15.780> like<00:03:15.959> a

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
and then it wants to behave like a

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.610 
and then it wants to behave like a
four-wheel-drive<00:03:16.439> car<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.310> then<00:03:17.999> eventually

four-wheel-drive car and then eventually

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.280

if<00:03:19.620> you're<00:03:19.859> stupid<00:03:20.400> enough<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:21.049> you<00:03:22.049> keep

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
if you're stupid enough and you keep

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.910 
if you're stupid enough and you keep
your<00:03:22.469> footing<00:03:22.739> for<00:03:23.099> long<00:03:23.249> enough<00:03:23.519> I<00:03:23.819> do<00:03:24.450> so

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
give it a bootful hard enough it will

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.479 
give it a bootful hard enough it will
avenge<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.799> going<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.909> a<00:03:29.939> nice<00:03:30.150> service<00:03:30.569> this

avenge the going to a nice service this

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.339 
avenge the going to a nice service this
the<00:03:31.849> trouble<00:03:32.180> is<00:03:32.239> then<00:03:32.480> it<00:03:32.599> wants<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:32.870> run<00:03:33.110> wide

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
the trouble is then it wants to run wide

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.369 
the trouble is then it wants to run wide
a<00:03:33.379> bit<00:03:33.709> into<00:03:34.610> those<00:03:34.760> lorries<00:03:35.180> which<00:03:36.019> we<00:03:36.170> don't

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
a bit into those lorries which we don't

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.559 
a bit into those lorries which we don't
want<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.980> only<00:03:37.879> then<00:03:38.060> will<00:03:38.269> it<00:03:38.299> actually

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
want and only then will it actually

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:46.920 
want and only then will it actually
settle<00:03:39.049> into<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.319> full-on<00:03:39.709> power<00:03:40.129> drift

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.440 

so<00:03:47.500> if<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.769> original<00:03:47.860> question<00:03:48.700> was<00:03:48.879> will<00:03:49.420> it

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
so if the original question was will it

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.519 
so if the original question was will it
lift<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.950> answer<00:03:51.370> is
