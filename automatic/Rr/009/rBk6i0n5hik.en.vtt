across<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> frequency<00:01:36.479> range<00:01:36.900> they<00:01:37.799> have

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
across the frequency range they have

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.130 
across the frequency range they have
quite<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.220> punchy<00:01:38.700> bass<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.390> crisp<00:01:39.659> treble

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.429 
though I find they are a little lacking
in<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.210> mid<00:01:42.390> range<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.079> lose<00:01:43.259> some

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
in the mid range and you lose some

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.710 
in the mid range and you lose some
detail<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> music<00:01:44.340> otherwise<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.329> think

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
detail in the music otherwise I think

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.420 
detail in the music otherwise I think
they<00:01:45.810> gave<00:01:45.990> really<00:01:46.350> great<00:01:46.560> sound<00:01:46.860> quality<00:01:46.979> and

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
wasn't entirely convinced personally I

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.539 
wasn't entirely convinced personally I

comfortable to wear for long periods of

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.229 
comfortable to wear for long periods of
time<00:02:07.320> now<00:02:08.100> with<00:02:08.250> these<00:02:08.369> headphones<00:02:08.880> you<00:02:09.119> have

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
time now with these headphones you have

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.850 
time now with these headphones you have
the<00:02:09.329> honest<00:02:09.780> style<00:02:10.049> design<00:02:10.350> which<00:02:10.560> means<00:02:10.739> the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the honest style design which means the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.590 
the honest style design which means the
headphone<00:02:11.160> cups<00:02:11.430> sit<00:02:11.730> on<00:02:11.910> top<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.269> your<00:02:12.420> ear

headphone cups sit on top of your ear

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.420 
headphone cups sit on top of your ear
rather<00:02:13.170> than<00:02:13.350> completely<00:02:13.680> surrounding<00:02:14.280> them

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
rather than completely surrounding them

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.370 
rather than completely surrounding them
now<00:02:15.269> at<00:02:15.390> first<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.870> found<00:02:16.079> these<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.230> bit

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
now at first I found these a bit

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.930 
now at first I found these a bit
uncomfortable<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.980> wear<00:02:17.220> for<00:02:17.400> long<00:02:17.549> periods

uncomfortable to wear for long periods

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.729 
uncomfortable to wear for long periods
of<00:02:17.970> time<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.540> that's<00:02:18.959> probably<00:02:19.140> because<00:02:19.530> I'm

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
of time and that's probably because I'm

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.380 
of time and that's probably because I'm
just<00:02:20.040> not<00:02:20.160> used<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.609> on-air<00:02:20.790> design<00:02:21.239> of

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390
