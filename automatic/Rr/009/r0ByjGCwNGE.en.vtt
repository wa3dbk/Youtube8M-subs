the healthy fatty tissue that a process

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.860 
the healthy fatty tissue that a process
start<00:02:31.470> with<00:02:31.800> washing<00:02:32.610> out<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.239> fat<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:36.390> then

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
start with washing out the fat and then

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.460 
start with washing out the fat and then
while<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.470> patient<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:38.010> asleep<00:02:38.420> we<00:02:39.420> again<00:02:40.260> we

wash it we get rid of the blood we keep

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.490 
wash it we get rid of the blood we keep
only<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.500> healthy<00:02:43.950> fatty<00:02:44.610> tissue<00:02:45.290> then<00:02:46.290> that

and that will be clinically apparent by

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.330 
and that will be clinically apparent by
the<00:03:06.120> improvement<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.350> skin<00:03:07.410> quality

peel<00:06:34.270> we<00:06:34.540> always<00:06:35.160> advise<00:06:36.160> people<00:06:36.490> to<00:06:36.730> look

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
peel we always advise people to look

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.470 
peel we always advise people to look
after<00:06:37.600> their<00:06:38.020> skin<00:06:38.380> and<00:06:38.560> to<00:06:39.220> tighten<00:06:39.970> this<00:06:40.210> in

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:40.480 
after their skin and to tighten this in

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.600 
after their skin and to tighten this in
the<00:06:40.600> skin<00:06:40.870> peel<00:06:41.050> we're<00:06:41.290> doing<00:06:41.620> it<00:06:41.800> to<00:06:42.010> tighten

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
the skin peel we're doing it to tighten

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.580 
the skin peel we're doing it to tighten
the<00:06:43.090> collagen<00:06:43.630> layer<00:06:43.840> which<00:06:44.080> is<00:06:44.260> the<00:06:44.380> deep

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
the collagen layer which is the deep

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.220 
the collagen layer which is the deep
aspect<00:06:45.100> of<00:06:45.340> their<00:06:45.669> skin<00:06:46.060> what<00:06:46.570> we<00:06:46.750> call<00:06:47.020> the

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
aspect of their skin what we call the

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.010 
aspect of their skin what we call the
dermal<00:06:47.650> layer<00:06:47.860> so<00:06:48.610> by<00:06:48.820> peeling<00:06:49.180> the<00:06:49.390> top<00:06:49.750> layer

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
dermal layer so by peeling the top layer

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.370 
dermal layer so by peeling the top layer
the<00:06:50.940> skin<00:06:51.940> will<00:06:52.120> heal<00:06:52.330> from<00:06:52.630> the<00:06:52.870> bottom<00:06:53.230> up

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380 
the skin will heal from the bottom up

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.140 
the skin will heal from the bottom up
and<00:06:53.650> the<00:06:53.830> collagen<00:06:54.370> will<00:06:54.550> thicken<00:06:54.790> and

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 
and the collagen will thicken and

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.000 
and the collagen will thicken and
tighten<00:06:55.690> people<00:06:56.290> need<00:06:56.470> to<00:06:56.680> do<00:06:56.800> this

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.010 
tighten people need to do this

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.720 
tighten people need to do this
maintenance<00:06:58.230> treatment<00:06:59.230> every<00:07:00.100> three<00:07:00.460> four

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:00.730 
maintenance treatment every three four

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.880 
maintenance treatment every three four
years<00:07:01.000> so<00:07:01.450> we<00:07:01.630> don't<00:07:01.660> end<00:07:02.080> up<00:07:02.230> having<00:07:02.680> a

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:02.890 
years so we don't end up having a

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.400 
years so we don't end up having a
sagginess<00:07:03.430> of<00:07:03.610> our<00:07:03.790> skin<00:07:04.270> in<00:07:04.840> terms<00:07:05.050> of<00:07:05.290> the

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 
sagginess of our skin in terms of the

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.100 
sagginess of our skin in terms of the
fat<00:07:05.650> injection<00:07:06.280> seventy<00:07:07.150> percent<00:07:07.360> of<00:07:07.690> the<00:07:07.870> fat

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110 
fat injection seventy percent of the fat

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.650 
fat injection seventy percent of the fat
that<00:07:08.140> we
