00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 the elections then I also invite you to 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.599
 listen to see science for fun why 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.849
 can turn on some light bulbs and 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.360
 illuminate a little around inside the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.609
 our mind hello and welcome to science 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.890
 but for now, make yourself comfortable 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.840
 because it is widely believed that the slice 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.359
 of bread that has always been on the side 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.460
 of the jam and the question in addition to 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.010
 be one of the most famous laws of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.080
 murphy also bothered recently 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.540
 antonio banderas in a well-known commercial 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.940
 advertising but it is really so or yes 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.920
 is simply the effect of 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.230
 case was 1996 when the ig 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.510
 nobel for physics was won by 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.579
 robert matthews for his studies on 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.420
 dynamics of the fall of the slice of 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.370
 bread 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.350
 the analysis is based on the fact that the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.300
 most accidents of this 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.730
 kind happens when the slice of bread 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.680
 jam and resting on the table and of 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.960
 a and inadvertently pushed past the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.090
 edge when the center of gravity of the slice 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.489
 of super bread at the edge of the table of 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.500
 a critical length the front piece 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.869
 of the slice begins the fall before 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.580
 the back one and the slice begins to 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.830
 rotate on itself 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.869
 unfortunately the rotational speed that 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.180
 acquires is not so high from 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.640
 allow her to make a complete turn e 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.799
 so he felt her on the ground to jam down 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.810
 the case has nothing to do this time but it is 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.330
 the effect of physical forces at play 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.690
 which determines how many 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.110
 can make the slice before touching the ground 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.860
 obviously if there was a table 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.900
 high enough 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.270
 the slice could make a complete turn 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.340
 and land jam up but 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.530
 the height of the tables is linked to the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.940
 stature of human beings and according to the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.400
 physical william press 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.200
 the height of the man is limited we are 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.910
 evolved as a biped with a body 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.980
 developed in height and with the head 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.320
 placed at the highest point for this 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.030
 reason we are relatively unstable and 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.070
 more prone to falls than they can 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.320
 damage our vital points 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.790
 inherently limited height given 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.770
 that the strength of chemical bonds 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.690
 within our bones of 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.850
 being able to counter the effects of 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.679
 gravity that pushes us down 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.630
 perhaps we will not have available to the 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.430
 but we could have elevated tables 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.440
 use bread slices more 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.450
 small that falling can acquire 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.709
 a higher rotational speed e 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.709
 land the right way
