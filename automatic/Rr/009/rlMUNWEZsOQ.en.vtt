00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.290
 good as I already explained in the 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.790
 introductory course in range for 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.580
 beginners and that repeat them in this 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.320
 current plus a range is composed of 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.940
 several positions and it's going to be 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.230
 essential if you really want 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.850
 work a range correctly 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.500
 to learn all positions according to 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.960
 Farid chained thereafter and 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.130
 understand how all this is articulated 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.480
 so here I can not explain everything to you 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.830
 that right now but I wanted to give 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.749
 some small indications for better 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.390
 understand the relationship between 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:33.550
 positions first thing important is 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.110
 to know any position of 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.480
 range can be shifted more or less 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.240
 twelve boxes 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.610
 why, well that's because of the way 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.080
 whose notes are on the sleeve of the 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.130
 guitar 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.540
 if you recognize a minimum 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.000
 understand quickly enough if not I'll go 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.870
 explain it the half serious string 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.160
 when played empty did put the rope 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.900
 when played in empty talking 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.360
 to the rope of re live narrate and 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.130
 it's on the cases under the empty boxes 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.540
 we put the ground there is the trick 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.100
 interesting is that if we think about a 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.119
 little bit short calculated note on the 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.170
 sleeve and you know how to do it but 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.270
 if you do not do it I'll go 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:15.759
 to say it we find the same notes 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.079
 in box 12 or the stop floor is set and it 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.310
 what happens is that suddenly if we 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.079
 says that one space and that we 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.170
 found in castraise we will have the same 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.789
 note that in case one in this case this 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.909
 will finally be a lighthouse in question 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.740
 one is a castraise fan we will have a fa 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.850
 sharp 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.860
 2 to 10 15 14 c is the goal of the game it's 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.630
 to understand that each note in the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.909
 First 12 boxes are found in 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.409
 the next box es12 when I say all 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.509
 case that everyone does not have 24 boxes 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.939
 but that's the idea of ​​the shot 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:50.100
 range diagram surprises the first 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:52.350
 job we did on box 5,7 and well we 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.780
 can quite play the same diagram 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.100
 12 boxes higher than we can start 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.640
 by box 5 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.570
 we will start with box 17 next 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.479
 instead of playing box 8 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.250
 we will play the box came next after 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.369
 we have to break again will become the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.390
 box 17 etc 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.799
 so if you're on a guitar 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.200
 acoustics probably owes you 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.640
 play on these squares acute the purpose of the game 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.569
 it's not necessarily to play them twelve 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.540
 boxes above but it's to understand 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:23.040
 that we can shift them my diagram of 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:28.620
 range that I have just now here the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:31.860
 even we will find the same notes 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.420
 just an octave more acute all that 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.120
 it is to better understand later 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.489
 how positions fit together between 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.720
 they a little advice in relation to 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.850
 all of that rather than bothering you 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.890
 tell you it's at 4.5 so I'm doing +12 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.269
 I get the box 17 is the box him 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.010
 so I 'm going sweetest bothering sale 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.720
 it's better to memorize in fact the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.790
 diagrams the position as I explained it 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.989
 in the previous part to memorize 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.760
 really the linking the gaps between 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.590
 the fingers and that's how you 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.000
 just change your starting point and 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.190
 you do not calculate everything else after 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.709
 you just redo the same pattern 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.090
 another important thing to note is 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.579
 to see how the positions 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.569
 fit together if you 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.920
 look at our range dictionary 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.989
 you will realize that the range 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.530
 pentatonic of the minor has five 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.180
 positions no less no more and well if 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.010
 we are just interested in the first two 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.930
 positions the position one we saw 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.120
 in the co-chairs the parties 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.859
 previous and position 2 that I you 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.019
 show there we can right now 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.489
 noticed that interesting is that 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.280
 the second note that is played on 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.319
 every body of the position a 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.459
 it's the same as the first note 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.100
 which is played on every body of the 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.740
 position of the position one and the 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.660
 position two share notes and that 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.150
 must do even more when we superimpose 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.800
 two we can see that we have a whole 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.580
 series of notes that are in common between 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.610
 both positions 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.350
 in fact the two positions are related 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.209
 between them by this series of notes so 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.530
 we want it's not there are not holes 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.010
 huge between two positions they 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.900
 are linked 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.100
 a logical way to a reason for 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.720
 which to be cut like that but 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.640
 it's a little complex explained 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.950
 but we have to see the relationship between 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.630
 these two positions 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.420
 because if after a brig the five 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.830
 positions between them and that in addition to 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.110
 shifts all positions that can 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.170
 12 boxes up and down we will get 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.420
 this kind of schema if we take that in 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.940
 did I take the five positions of 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.769
 the atonic appart minors gd all shifted 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.320
 of twelve boxes when I could more of 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.760
 times it goes beyond the limits of the handle and 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.340
 I put everything together on the same 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.770
 diagrams and we will actually get 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.419
 all the notes of the range 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.070
 pentatonic of the minor which are 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.340
 possible to be played on a round of 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.680
 guitar there you have the entirety of the 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.210
 pentatonic range of the minor you do not 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.680
 can not play other notes elsewhere 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.740
 it does not exist you absolutely have 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.390
 all the stuff when we see this is that 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.010
 it's a little destabilizing is full of 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.539
 points everywhere we do not know where is the 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.570
 first we do not know where the end is 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:52.039
 for that we cut the scales in 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.960
 several positions to facilitate 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.280
 learning but when you 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.479
 learn your positions when you 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.370
 wait at the first position 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.830
 the second position the third 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.840
 position and his attempts to keep that in 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.770
 head to tell you that what you 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.510
 learn it's little bits of a 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.669
 much bigger scheme a lot 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.050
 more generalist and that once 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.940
 you will have learned all the positions 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.960
 you will actually know this pattern that 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.640
 I'll show you know you 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.710
 the entire pentatonic range 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.930
 of the minor on the whole of the handle 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.490
 that's the goal when you learn one 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.020
 range is to know all the 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.000
 notes on the neck 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.590
 we go little by little 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.360
 do not be in a hurry but it's always 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.860
 keep in mind this idea of ​​learning 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.930
 a little trick that's part of another 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.890
 much bigger good all I 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.300
 just told you here it's small 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.710
 things that seem to us maybe a 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.150
 interesting for now it changes 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.449
 nothing at work to learn the 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.919
 position by heart 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.240
 but try to keep that in a corner of 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.099
 your head will help you for later 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.509
 knowing that the positions are 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.639
 interrelated it will help you to 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:47.069
 follow up later knowing 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.300
 to memorize a diagram rather than 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:49.800
 suite of boxes that will help you to 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.370
 to transpose the ranges subsequently etc 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.289
 etc. 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.960
 and we will detail all these small 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.249
 things in there costs more evolved by 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.430
 the following is a lot of weight that 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:00.389
 Thursday over there so I'm going to stop 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.400
 again all this is that a 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:03.539
 basic example to show you 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.069
 how are we doing to read a 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.229
 range diagram and the work and the 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:10.080
 first time and we will soon make a 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:11.699
 course on pentatonic minors for 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.770
 really learn together all the 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.539
 positions so feel free to start 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.389
 this work alone and join us 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.560
 soon to see this wrath waiting 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:22.229
 you can always come big and one 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.240
 little with us on facebook.com to buy 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:28.550
 4 at guitar or on twitter.com stage 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.550
 acoustic evening step to the next
