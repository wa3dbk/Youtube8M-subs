 I had left yesterday but I had not had 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.609
 time to do this magazine is not 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.679
 it deserves a lot of review because although 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.560
 it's very good I think he has already taken it 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:34.620
 if they took it out but in the mode it 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.410
 flame days something like that beige something without law 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.260

 they grab him to diffusion benefits 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.960
 download comes with five modes 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.510
 which are necessary for the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.519
 production of the mount is to the maximum then 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.829
 has totally the whole engine called 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.410
 they have all five assets for the engine 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.679
 work properly well also 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.140
 through its part light ventura is this 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:06.120
 writing a little weirdly well in a 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.710
 super cool support so they see the 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.869
 port as it looks 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.780
 this is a style of like a style of 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.030
 peace of culture pp and good I'll 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.409

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.630
 these findings that are a bit breasts 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.090
 but well let's kill them as always 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.190
 the aim is supporting 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.830
 I want to show you because there is no payment 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.800

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.450
 shoot very cool and what I like the most 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.710
 this effect when you lift the 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.100

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:56.800

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.920

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.260

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.420
 so that we are all going to catch the world 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.899

 seeing each end of the wall with him 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.230

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.569

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.610

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.840
 I loved it but I loved it and I'm going to 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.710

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.110

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:04.010

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.270
 more I liked it was also this has to 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.460
 fire one strip to fire is necessary 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.390
 place whoever fire only like this 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.820

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.590
 I think that food but not food that goes to 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.130
 the booth the cow is going to 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.350
