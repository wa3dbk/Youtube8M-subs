years already that's not being rushed
it's<00:01:28.560> not<00:01:28.710> being<00:01:28.950> put<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> fast<00:01:29.579> track<00:01:29.700> but

it's not being put on the fast track but

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
it's not being put on the fast track but
at<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> end<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.390> day<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.689> think<00:01:30.840> about

at the end of the day if you think about

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.999 
at the end of the day if you think about
it<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.140> still<00:01:31.350> doesn't<00:01:31.530> really<00:01:31.650> help<00:01:31.770> mine

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
it that still doesn't really help mine

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.200 
it that still doesn't really help mine
sense<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.340> think<00:01:32.520> would<00:01:32.610> actually<00:01:32.880> be<00:01:32.970> better

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
sense I think would actually be better

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
they think about the Assassin's Creed

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.580 
they think about the Assassin's Creed
formula<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.210> release<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> huge<00:01:43.170> game<00:01:43.380> that

formula and release a huge game that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.870 
formula and release a huge game that
blows<00:01:43.770> up<00:01:43.950> because<00:01:44.040> everyone<00:01:44.369> hasn't<00:01:44.759> played

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
blows up because everyone hasn't played

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.830 
blows up because everyone hasn't played
one<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.090> almost<00:01:45.329> two<00:01:45.509> years

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
one in almost two years

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.080 
one in almost two years
and<00:01:46.070> maybe<00:01:47.070> everyone<00:01:47.340> will<00:01:47.549> finally<00:01:47.729> be<00:01:47.970> happy

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
and maybe everyone will finally be happy

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.850 
and maybe everyone will finally be happy
people<00:01:48.810> who<00:01:48.869> won't<00:01:48.990> always<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.290> happy<00:01:49.500> because

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
people who won't always be happy because

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.139 
people who won't always be happy because
this<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.070> video<00:01:50.220> games<00:01:50.520> we're<00:01:50.700> talking<00:01:51.060> about

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
this is video games we're talking about

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.270 
this is video games we're talking about
but<00:01:51.390> there's<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.170> fatigue<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.979> even

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
but there's just that fatigue and even

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.800 
but there's just that fatigue and even
the<00:01:53.369> movie<00:01:53.579> industry<00:01:53.939> has<00:01:54.090> learned<00:01:54.329> not<00:01:54.630> to

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
the movie industry has learned not to

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.569 
the movie industry has learned not to
release<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.079> movie<00:01:55.259> every<00:01:55.530> single<00:01:55.979> year<00:01:56.159> yeah

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
release a movie every single year yeah

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.609 
release a movie every single year yeah
we've<00:01:56.820> got<00:01:57.000> four<00:01:57.299> Transformers<00:01:58.110> movies<00:01:58.469> now

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
we've got four Transformers movies now

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.840 
we've got four Transformers movies now
but<00:01:59.009> they<00:01:59.100> don't<00:01:59.280> come<00:01:59.399> out<00:01:59.460> every<00:01:59.820> year

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
but they don't come out every year

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.760 
but they don't come out every year
back-to-back<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.899> clockwork<00:02:01.170> because<00:02:01.680> they

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
back-to-back like clockwork because they

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.109 
back-to-back like clockwork because they
know<00:02:01.920> that'll<00:02:02.189> drive<00:02:02.369> people<00:02:02.490> nuts<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.030> then

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
know that'll drive people nuts and then

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.459 
know that'll drive people nuts and then
less<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.390> less<00:02:03.659> people<00:02:03.840> will<00:02:04.079> come<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.350> see

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
less and less people will come to see

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.780 
less and less people will come to see
them<00:02:04.619> every<00:02:04.860> year<00:02:05.040> with<00:02:05.159> video<00:02:05.399> games<00:02:05.610> it

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
them every year with video games it

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.399 
them every year with video games it
seems<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.270> be<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.570> complete<00:02:06.960> opposite

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
seems to be like the complete opposite

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.900 
seems to be like the complete opposite
are<00:02:07.469> we<00:02:07.560> getting<00:02:07.649> tired<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.250> Ubisoft<00:02:08.550> in

general the whole fatigue really set in

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.809 
general the whole fatigue really set in
with<00:02:10.590> me<00:02:10.709> at<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.250> end<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:11.550> year<00:02:11.760> of

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
with me at the end of this year of

December 2014

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.550 
December 2014

Creed<00:02:13.709> unity<00:02:13.830> which<00:02:14.160> was<00:02:14.370> okay<00:02:14.730> but<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:15.060> was

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
Creed unity which was okay but it was

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.670 
Creed unity which was okay but it was
very<00:02:15.390> much<00:02:15.569> just<00:02:15.599> like<00:02:15.930> more<00:02:16.200> Assassin's

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
very much just like more Assassin's

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.260 
very much just like more Assassin's
Creed<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.190> cluttered<00:02:17.610> with<00:02:17.760> way<00:02:17.970> too<00:02:18.000> much

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
Creed and cluttered with way too much

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.820 
Creed and cluttered with way too much
busy<00:02:18.630> work<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:18.959> stuff<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.260> I've<00:02:19.470> been<00:02:19.620> doing

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
busy work and stuff that I've been doing

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
in these games forever and then we also

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.330 
in these games forever and then we also
have<00:02:21.690> Far<00:02:21.900> Cry<00:02:22.080> 4<00:02:22.140> which<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.680> much<00:02:22.860> better<00:02:23.040> and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
have Far Cry 4 which is much better and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.620 
have Far Cry 4 which is much better and
it's<00:02:23.489> still<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.670> lot<00:02:23.849> of<00:02:23.880> fun<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.180> play<00:02:24.270> but<00:02:24.540> it

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
it's still a lot of fun to play but it

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.180 
it's still a lot of fun to play but it
also<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.080> someone<00:02:25.620> who<00:02:25.709> spent<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.069> hundred
