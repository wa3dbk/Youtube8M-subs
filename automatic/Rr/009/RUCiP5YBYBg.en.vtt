 Now that you are inside 0 2 welcome to 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.420
 another episode a pisadita another video 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.090
 of gender agriculture 4 and in this case 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.600
 let's unlock the achievement that is 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.830
 call 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.110
 I believe that 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.470
 but less to meet those who are 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.030
 promoting the name but here it is 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.750
 ansa 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:38.579
 to the experts he says find one of 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.250
 reversal systems 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.010
 Spartans ok 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.130
 Well, we 're going to Spartans. 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.870
 play chapters 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.570
 obviously we put episode 1 because 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.700
 it's chapter 5 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.530
 in playing chapter and any difficulty 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.070
 this thing 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.070
 already 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:31.250
 and the data obtained from requiem and 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.250
 they will have to prevent me from getting it 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:48.150
 well we are if you want 30 battle what 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.020
 what he calls definition 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.020
 we advance 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.810
 and here good later on we 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.660
 we will find an installation 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.450
 which is full of enemies we have 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:07.150
 that as advisable mind get rid of 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.150
 of all before making this achievement 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.010
 then I'm going to cut here and then this one 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.080
 we will continue with her be all 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.410
 deaths that we see then in a 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.410
 little while 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.440
 ok we're back although it 's already 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.120
 that is the last one missing plaintiffs 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.120
 let's arrange 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:36.200
 once with everything on top 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.490
 of the installation we see that there is the 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.370
 switch to activate we will not activate it 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:45.050
 one that we're going to go to this part of the 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:49.030
 installation and look for that box when 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.100
 we shoot good those who see represent 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.310
 will know what is the sound that is 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.310
 will hear 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.880
 violets 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:18.550
 so then that's all for this 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:26.580
 is everything can be this video I hope 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:26.580
 that has served you and then yes 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.909
 well now yes since 2002 here I 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.909
