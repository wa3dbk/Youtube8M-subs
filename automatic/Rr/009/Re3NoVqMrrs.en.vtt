 but if that opens us up and we have to meet him, we have to look for him 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.999
 and that is a difficult business for us in the Western world 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:11.250
 because we are like that 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.890

 it's about meeting you there 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:56.589

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.319
 after an exit 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.969
 but for that we have other things that pull our attention away 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.089
 our thoughts pull away ours 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:09.079
 distract us from the gentle soft voice of the Holy Spirit 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.280
