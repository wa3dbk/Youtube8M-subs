the corn kernels and measure how much
corn<00:00:23.140> is<00:00:23.320> actually<00:00:23.830> on<00:00:24.039> one<00:00:24.640> ear<00:00:25.470> now<00:00:26.470> we<00:00:26.980> pose

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
corn is actually on one ear now we pose

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.910 
corn is actually on one ear now we pose
this<00:00:27.640> question<00:00:27.699> how<00:00:28.660> much<00:00:28.869> corn<00:00:29.259> is<00:00:29.349> actually

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
this question how much corn is actually

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.939 
this question how much corn is actually
on<00:00:30.070> one<00:00:30.369> ear<00:00:30.699> because<00:00:31.630> we<00:00:31.990> know<00:00:32.199> that<00:00:32.470> looking

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
on one ear because we know that looking

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.189 
on one ear because we know that looking
at<00:00:33.040> our<00:00:33.160> calories<00:00:33.699> steps<00:00:33.970> corn<00:00:34.870> is<00:00:35.110> a

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
at our calories steps corn is a

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.710 
at our calories steps corn is a
high-calorie<00:00:35.800> vegetable<00:00:36.489> and<00:00:36.790> referring

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
high-calorie vegetable and referring

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.840 
high-calorie vegetable and referring
back<00:00:37.870> to<00:00:37.930> our<00:00:38.170> calorie<00:00:38.500> steps<00:00:38.830> we<00:00:39.129> know<00:00:39.370> that

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
back to our calorie steps we know that

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.259 
back to our calorie steps we know that
cord<00:00:40.180> is<00:00:40.420> 135<00:00:41.350> calories<00:00:41.949> per<00:00:42.250> cup<00:00:42.280> so

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
cord is 135 calories per cup so

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.090 
cord is 135 calories per cup so
oftentimes<00:00:44.199> at<00:00:44.650> a<00:00:44.710> barbecue<00:00:45.339> etc<00:00:46.180> you<00:00:46.540> can

consume an ear-to-ear some corn but

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.649 
consume an ear-to-ear some corn but
really<00:00:50.530> pose<00:00:50.860> the<00:00:51.250> question<00:00:51.640> to<00:00:51.670> yourself<00:00:51.879> how

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
really pose the question to yourself how

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.200 
really pose the question to yourself how
much<00:00:53.019> corn<00:00:53.379> have<00:00:53.589> I<00:00:53.710> actually<00:00:53.949> consumed<00:00:54.699> so

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
much corn have I actually consumed so

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.910 
much corn have I actually consumed so
let's<00:00:55.420> solve<00:00:55.720> this<00:00:55.839> myths<00:00:56.229> together<00:00:56.619> right

let's solve this myths together right
now<00:00:57.000> now<00:00:58.000> what<00:00:58.239> tip<00:00:58.479> that<00:00:58.629> I<00:00:58.659> have<00:00:58.900> for<00:00:59.110> you<00:00:59.170> for

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
now now what tip that I have for you for

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.700 
now now what tip that I have for you for
cutting<00:00:59.860> corn<00:01:00.250> off<00:01:00.400> the<00:01:00.430> cob<00:01:00.610> is<00:01:01.030> to<00:01:01.839> once<00:01:02.530> you

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
cutting corn off the cob is to once you

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.009 
cutting corn off the cob is to once you
have<00:01:02.949> removed<00:01:03.189> the<00:01:03.489> husk<00:01:03.699> so<00:01:04.570> we're<00:01:04.839> going<00:01:04.930> to

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
have removed the husk so we're going to

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.859 
have removed the husk so we're going to
remove<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.590> husband<00:01:06.340> is<00:01:06.610> always<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:07.240> great

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
remove the husband is always a great

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.349 
remove the husband is always a great
idea<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:08.409> have<00:01:08.530> a<00:01:08.590> trash<00:01:08.890> can<00:01:09.159> near<00:01:09.369> by<00:01:09.609> and<00:01:10.240> he

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:10.359 
idea to have a trash can near by and he

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:12.419 
idea to have a trash can near by and he
wasn't<00:01:10.570> ensure<00:01:11.200> that<00:01:11.439> you<00:01:11.590> get<00:01:11.740> all<00:01:11.920> this<00:01:12.070> silk

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
wasn't ensure that you get all this silk

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:14.819 
wasn't ensure that you get all this silk
off<00:01:12.640> because<00:01:13.450> silk<00:01:13.990> and<00:01:14.170> your<00:01:14.259> teeth<00:01:14.469> is<00:01:14.649> not

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
off because silk and your teeth is not

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:16.950 
off because silk and your teeth is not
attractive<00:01:15.310> nor<00:01:16.090> does<00:01:16.299> it<00:01:16.329> provide<00:01:16.659> any

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
attractive nor does it provide any

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.830 
attractive nor does it provide any
additional<00:01:17.289> nutrition<00:01:18.329> so<00:01:19.329> we're<00:01:19.509> just<00:01:19.539> going

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
additional nutrition so we're just going

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.779 
additional nutrition so we're just going
to<00:01:19.899> ensure<00:01:20.079> that<00:01:20.289> the<00:01:20.619> silk<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.130> that<00:01:21.280> the

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
to ensure that the silk and that the

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.550 
to ensure that the silk and that the
husk<00:01:22.030> have<00:01:22.299> been<00:01:22.509> removed<00:01:22.749> and<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.460> it<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.689> large

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
husk have been removed and so it a large

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.550 
husk have been removed and so it a large
cereal<00:01:27.159> bowl<00:01:27.340> I<00:01:27.579> have<00:01:27.969> placed<00:01:28.270> a<00:01:28.539> small<00:01:28.630> bowl

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
cereal bowl I have placed a small bowl

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.609 
cereal bowl I have placed a small bowl
upside<00:01:29.890> down<00:01:30.490> now<00:01:31.479> what<00:01:31.689> we<00:01:31.869> are<00:01:31.899> going<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.320> do

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
upside down now what we are going to do

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.020 
upside down now what we are going to do
is<00:01:33.479> take<00:01:34.479> a<00:01:34.749> nice<00:01:35.200> sharp<00:01:35.920> knife<00:01:36.009> and<00:01:36.520> remember

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
is take a nice sharp knife and remember

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.599 
is take a nice sharp knife and remember
sharp<00:01:37.780> knives<00:01:38.049> are<00:01:38.380> essentially<00:01:38.890> safer<00:01:39.490> than

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
sharp knives are essentially safer than

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:41.760 
sharp knives are essentially safer than
dull<00:01:39.909> knives<00:01:40.149> because<00:01:40.719> dull<00:01:41.140> knives<00:01:41.350> you<00:01:41.590> have

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
dull knives because dull knives you have

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.039 
dull knives because dull knives you have
to<00:01:41.920> apply<00:01:42.130> more<00:01:42.429> pressure<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:43.119> thus<00:01:43.630> you<00:01:43.810> pose

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
to apply more pressure and thus you pose

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.989 
to apply more pressure and thus you pose
more<00:01:44.350> risk<00:01:44.590> for<00:01:44.859> cutting<00:01:45.189> yourself<00:01:45.310> so

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:45.999 
more risk for cutting yourself so

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:48.809 
more risk for cutting yourself so
remember<00:01:46.299> always<00:01:46.719> have<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.439> sharp<00:01:47.710> knife<00:01:47.979> so

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
remember always have a sharp knife so

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.289 
remember always have a sharp knife so
we're<00:01:49.450> going<00:01:49.659> to<00:01:49.979> take<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.880> knife<00:01:52.090> and

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
we're going to take the knife and

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.830 
we're going to take the knife and
essentially<00:01:53.229> just<00:01:53.859> cut<00:01:54.609> the<00:01:55.179> corn<00:01:55.569> off<00:01:55.780> the

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
essentially just cut the corn off the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.279 
essentially just cut the corn off the
cob<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:57.100> so<00:01:57.789> the<00:01:58.119> theory<00:01:58.509> behind<00:01:58.630> this<00:01:58.960> is

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
cob and so the theory behind this is

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.959 
cob and so the theory behind this is
that<00:01:59.319> all<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.770> corn<00:02:00.069> will<00:02:00.249> fall<00:02:00.490> into<00:02:00.729> the

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
that all the corn will fall into the

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.870 
that all the corn will fall into the
bowl<00:02:01.179> and<00:02:01.479> you<00:02:02.259> might<00:02:02.439> want<00:02:02.709> to<00:02:02.829> be<00:02:02.979> very

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
bowl and you might want to be very

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.490 
bowl and you might want to be very
ginger<00:02:04.450> with<00:02:04.959> your<00:02:05.170> head

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
ginger with your head

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.140 
ginger with your head
technique<00:02:05.920> so<00:02:06.070> your<00:02:06.220> court<00:02:06.490> does<00:02:06.640> not<00:02:06.670> go<00:02:07.000> all

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
technique so your court does not go all

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.169 
technique so your court does not go all
over<00:02:07.330> your<00:02:07.630> kitchen<00:02:07.800> because<00:02:08.970> we<00:02:09.970> know<00:02:10.149> that

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
over your kitchen because we know that

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.500 
over your kitchen because we know that
time<00:02:10.660> is<00:02:10.690> is<00:02:11.170> very<00:02:11.860> valuable<00:02:12.460> these<00:02:12.940> days<00:02:13.210> and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
time is is very valuable these days and

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.960 
time is is very valuable these days and
so<00:02:14.200> ensuring<00:02:14.860> that<00:02:14.890> we<00:02:15.130> don't<00:02:15.310> have<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.640> huge

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
so ensuring that we don't have a huge

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.890 
so ensuring that we don't have a huge
mess<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.420> clean<00:02:16.450> up<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:17.050> very<00:02:17.800> important<00:02:18.900> now

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
mess to clean up is very important now

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.760 
mess to clean up is very important now
I'm<00:02:20.140> going<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.440> just<00:02:20.620> rotate<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:22.560> because<00:02:23.560> on

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
I'm going to just rotate this because on

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.670 
I'm going to just rotate this because on
Bo<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:25.360> we<00:02:25.510> had<00:02:25.690> available<00:02:25.930> was<00:02:26.290> not

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
Bo that we had available was not

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.160 
Bo that we had available was not
essentially<00:02:27.340> huge<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.390> larger<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.959> goal

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
essentially huge so the larger the goal

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.290 
essentially huge so the larger the goal
that<00:02:29.200> easier<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:30.100> will<00:02:30.250> be<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.459> catch<00:02:30.850> all<00:02:31.120> the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
that easier it will be to catch all the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.810 
that easier it will be to catch all the
corn<00:02:31.570> kernels<00:02:31.990> so<00:02:32.920> here<00:02:33.100> we<00:02:33.130> see<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.520> it's<00:02:33.700> a

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
corn kernels so here we see that it's a

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.540 
corn kernels so here we see that it's a
very<00:02:34.090> efficient<00:02:34.720> way<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:35.080> getting<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.250> corn

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
very efficient way of getting the corn

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.540 
very efficient way of getting the corn

it<00:02:53.650> on<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.190> grill<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:54.970> let's<00:02:55.180> say<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.450> have<00:02:55.810> a

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
it on the grill so let's say you have a

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.710 
it on the grill so let's say you have a
nice<00:02:56.410> charcoal<00:02:57.310> fire<00:02:57.700> lit<00:02:58.030> or<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.270> have<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.450> gas

grill<00:02:58.989> you<00:02:59.530> can<00:02:59.709> essentially<00:03:00.130> leave<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.670> corn

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
grill you can essentially leave the corn

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.290 
grill you can essentially leave the corn
in<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.270> husk<00:03:01.300> and<00:03:01.810> pop<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:02.620> on<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:02.920> grill

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
in the husk and pop it on the grill

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.540 
in the husk and pop it on the grill
until<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:05.020> husk<00:03:05.290> have<00:03:05.590> become<00:03:05.980> charred<00:03:06.310> and

until the husk have become charred and

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
until the husk have become charred and
the<00:03:06.640> corn<00:03:06.940> is<00:03:07.420> nice<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.260> roasting<00:03:08.890> inside<00:03:09.760> so

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
the corn is nice and roasting inside so

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.660 
the corn is nice and roasting inside so
we<00:03:10.690> just<00:03:10.900> want<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.290> remove<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:12.070> small<00:03:12.370> bowl

we just want to remove the small bowl
from<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.420> inside<00:03:14.019> of<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:16.330> corn<00:03:17.340> large<00:03:18.340> bowl

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
from the inside of the corn large bowl

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.300 
from the inside of the corn large bowl
containing<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.209> corn<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.630> this<00:03:20.230> way<00:03:20.500> we<00:03:20.769> can

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
containing the corn and this way we can

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.220 
containing the corn and this way we can
easily<00:03:21.880> measure<00:03:22.480> out<00:03:22.840> how<00:03:23.620> much<00:03:24.220> corn<00:03:24.700> is<00:03:24.880> on

easily measure out how much corn is on
one<00:03:26.230> ear<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.790> here<00:03:28.150> we<00:03:28.269> have<00:03:28.299> a<00:03:28.690> measuring<00:03:29.140> cup

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
one ear so here we have a measuring cup

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.050 
one ear so here we have a measuring cup
and<00:03:29.350> I'm<00:03:29.590> going<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.799> grab<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:29.980> spoon<00:03:30.430> real<00:03:30.760> quick

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
and I'm going to grab a spoon real quick

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.470 
and I'm going to grab a spoon real quick
or<00:03:31.330> cook<00:03:31.799> just<00:03:32.799> to<00:03:33.130> get<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.580> corn<00:03:33.880> kernels<00:03:34.299> in

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
or cook just to get the corn kernels in

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.759 
or cook just to get the corn kernels in
the<00:03:35.230> cup<00:03:37.170> now<00:03:38.170> a<00:03:38.590> good<00:03:39.370> rule<00:03:39.700> of<00:03:39.790> thumb<00:03:39.850> is<00:03:40.360> that

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
the cup now a good rule of thumb is that

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.770 
the cup now a good rule of thumb is that
once<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:41.980> do<00:03:42.160> this<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.370> couple<00:03:42.610> times<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:43.600> have

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
once you do this a couple times you have

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.009 
once you do this a couple times you have
a<00:03:43.810> general<00:03:44.440> idea<00:03:44.709> of<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.910> size<00:03:46.299> of<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.690> ear<00:03:46.989> of

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
a general idea of the size of the ear of

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.970 
a general idea of the size of the ear of
corn<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.769> how<00:03:48.459> much<00:03:49.049> corn<00:03:50.049> that<00:03:50.380> correlates

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
corn and how much corn that correlates

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.560 
corn and how much corn that correlates
to<00:03:51.540> via<00:03:52.540> cup<00:03:52.959> so<00:03:53.560> we<00:03:53.739> see<00:03:53.980> that<00:03:54.239> you<00:03:55.239> know<00:03:55.269> a

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
to via cup so we see that you know a

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.289 
to via cup so we see that you know a

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
large air corn a medium to large era

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.949 
large air corn a medium to large era
corn<00:03:58.660> produced<00:03:59.519> roughly<00:04:00.519> one<00:04:01.000> cup<00:04:01.299> of<00:04:01.329> corn<00:04:01.750> or

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
corn produced roughly one cup of corn or

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.640 
corn produced roughly one cup of corn or
the<00:04:02.440> equivalent<00:04:03.040> to<00:04:03.870> 135<00:04:04.870> calories

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650
