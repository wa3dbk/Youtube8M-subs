 [Music] 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.090
 but they are in depth that are 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.570
 sulfides that are difficult to exploit 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.700
 and more difficult metallurgy then they are not 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.189
 of a competitive cost to which we were 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.009
 accustomed to that is that the cost 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.130
 total industry today is 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:36.500
 widely above the 1,200 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.740
 dollars degrees and the cost of cash 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:45.580
 is above 700 750 dollars 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.580
 sides then it is not attractive 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.320
 good every time they are worse 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:02.920
 in Peru in particular we have in 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:06.650
 addition to the expectations generated in 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:10.880
 communities there is the expectation generated 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.650
 in the illegal and informal ones that 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.030
 what they claim is that companies 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:20.760
 formalities can not 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:24.729
 explore and can not operate for them 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.400
 handle a totally illegal operation 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.630
 informal and on top of that we put 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.030
 prior consultation 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.450
 the activity has not yet been carried out 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.450
 mining 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.590
 to communities that are not 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.000
 they have the profile to be consulted 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.710
 but simply anyone who gets 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.890
 a pen already has the right to be 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.780
 consulted then well then that the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:59.490
 thing will be more difficult 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:01.710
 [Music] 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.280
 I do not know if we will reach the nine hundred 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.800
 a thousand ounces is a day 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.450
 laudable goal 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.700
 and we are doing our best 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.819
 efforts to get closer to it 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.400
 what is what we have to do what 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.950
 what we know how to do 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.310
 and go exploring and developing and 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.909
 building projects putting them in 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.430
 production and for that we have what 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:32.459
 we have done in recent years the 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.470
 ditch project of Tantahuatay 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.260
 the pampa in gold I mean 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.930
 we're 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.879
 in the process of building the project 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.879
 tambo mayo that is a euro project dish 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.960
 what we have done is we have reduced 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.270
 our riskiest explorations 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.550
 we have concentrated on the 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.170
 explorations brownfield that is the 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:06.440
 around the districts where we are 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:11.440
 and the operation explorations in 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.440
 those deposits that deserve it 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.670
 to 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.140
 the first thing is that we will have to see 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.470
 how are the bucks handled? 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.220
 areas that were left to explode when 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.620
 the prices were 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.670
 lower remember that yanacocha 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.820
 started its operations 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:43.830
 I said in the year 93 when the price 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:48.390
 of gold was between 300 dollars 890 and 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:52.020
 today 1300, you can go back to 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.300
 exploit those real ones two continue 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.430
 exploring and deepening the deposits 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.780
 if they are not already only oxides they will be 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.650
 surely sulfides and there will be 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.900
 and have a more intensive job more 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.709
 plaintiff of higher costs but 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.709
 according to the times 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.630
 if the planets are aligned is not true 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.990
 this 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.940
 and decisions are made that is a 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.050
 project that can be executed and 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.050
 conclude in three years 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.910
 so it will depend on what the moment is 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.669
 of the descent of the flag 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.669
