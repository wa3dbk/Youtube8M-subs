00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.359
 and after the construction of the trunk la 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.880
 exit training 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:13.019
 come and see how we always are 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.269
 in the now advanced stage of training 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.760
 of a plant once turned into rabbits 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.119
 side as side 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:25.080
 we therefore have the necessary ones 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.910
 attentions formed the trunk the respect 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.859
 of the lymphatic circuit 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:35.880
 now let's see how to keep the exits 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.670
 which have already been set up along the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.370
 trunk during last pruning 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.160
 winter through positioning in 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.680
 this spur on the right side and of 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.730
 this other spur left side 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.140
 through a perfect execution 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.579
 of the choice of starter shoots 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.340
 during last spring 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.109
 let's see now how to give continuity to 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.760
 operations that have been done up to 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.730
 Now 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.489
 let us get used to it as I have already told you more 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.740
 aimed at making contact with the plant 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.320
 we touch the trunk and look for the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.240
 outputs are perfectly aligned with the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.700
 therefore we are in a condition 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.540
 ideal for the continuation of ours 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.729
 therefore work to adjust the outputs 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.729
 their training was done now for 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.159
 adjust their setting and theirs 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.520
 continuity over time the first thing that 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.110
 I wanted to do is place the spurs 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.790
 as we have done so far we look 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.159
 the first gem facing downwards 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.259
 which is what gives continuity to 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.030
 next year through the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.030
 positioning of a new spur to the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.610
 slow circuit and add an e 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.220
 we have adjusted the length of ours 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.229
 spur on the side said the same 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.390
 we do the operation on the other side 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.610
 we hope with the hand on the left side 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.009
 we find the reference branch 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.579
 we look for the gem turned towards the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.659
 bass 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.429
 we add emma 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.329
 the length adjustment of the 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.950
 so great spur we go therefore one 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.220
 once we have secured the 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.040
 presence of at least one or two branches 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.620
 since it is dark to become 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.870
 unilateral or bilateral to eliminate 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.910
 the wood that produced the 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:25.629
 this is the position of the cut 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.599
 wooden portion will assure me one 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:31.299
 net reduction of the colon desiccation 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:35.379
 inside live wood 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:38.220
 at this point after eliminating the 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.220
 wood he produced 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.840
 I proceed with the choice of the fruitful item 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.569
 I will therefore eliminate one of these 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.930
 two branches indifferently 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.629
 then going down what I like best 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.209
 decided to eliminate this right 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.760
 I'm going to close eliminate the portion of 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.849
 dry of last year's spur for 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.380
 reduce the effect of the drying cone 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:10.889
 close by making a cut on the wood of a 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:15.579
 year the ray from the right side and I go to 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:18.880
 clean from avoid that from the females the 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:21.790
 head to fruit a branch that will become 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.720
 my boss at front of during the 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.720
 next of good
