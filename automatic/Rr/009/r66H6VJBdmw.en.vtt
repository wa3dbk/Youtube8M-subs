00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
or six minutes long it was because I had

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.480 
or six minutes long it was because I had
no<00:00:15.509> idea<00:00:15.540> where<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.590> enemies<00:00:16.890> were<00:00:17.039> not<00:00:17.250> this

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
which is still kind of longer if you

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.250 
which is still kind of longer if you
compare<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.420> some<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.720> quick<00:00:21.930> mobs

and I'm pretty sure you could only get

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.190 
and I'm pretty sure you could only get
it<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> shotguns<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.510> snipers<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:36.989> the

it on the shotguns the snipers and the
light<00:00:37.350> machine<00:00:37.649> guns<00:00:37.860> but<00:00:38.399> if<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.730> use

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
light machine guns but if you use

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.970 
light machine guns but if you use

specialist and got all your perks you

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.740 
specialist and got all your perks you
could<00:00:41.190> then<00:00:41.370> have<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.700> honest<00:00:42.210> machine<00:00:42.600> gun

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
could then have it honest machine gun

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.630 
could then have it honest machine gun
you<00:00:42.899> ran<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.440> quickly<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.040> helped<00:00:44.460> in

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
you ran so quickly so that helped in

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.310 
you ran so quickly so that helped in
that<00:00:44.700> game<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.329> get<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.510> quicker<00:00:45.780> streaks<00:00:46.140> and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
that game to get the quicker streaks and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.930 
that game to get the quicker streaks and
also<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> maps<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.399> game<00:00:47.550> are<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> lot

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
also the maps and that game are a lot

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.819 
also the maps and that game are a lot
closer<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> lot<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.170> know<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> lot<00:00:49.530> smaller

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
closer and a lot you know a lot smaller

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.889 
closer and a lot you know a lot smaller
so<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.309> easier<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:51.120> get<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.300> load<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.510> kills<00:00:51.780> in

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
so it's easier to get a load of kills in

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.840 
so it's easier to get a load of kills in
a<00:00:51.989> quick<00:00:52.199> amount<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.649> time<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.399> think<00:00:53.670> this

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
a quick amount of time so I think this

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.979 
a quick amount of time so I think this
is<00:00:54.000> around<00:00:54.180> three<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.480> three<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.960> half

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
is around three and three and a half

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.750 
is around three and three and a half
minutes<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.440> four<00:00:55.620> minutes<00:00:55.829> long<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> kem

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
minutes to four minutes long for a kem

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.279 
minutes to four minutes long for a kem
strike<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.480> isn't<00:00:57.750> too<00:00:57.930> bad<00:00:58.109> especially

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
strike it isn't too bad especially

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.990 
strike it isn't too bad especially
because<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:58.859> my<00:00:58.949> second<00:00:59.280> one<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.579> it's<00:00:59.940> a

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
because it's my second one and it's a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.790 
because it's my second one and it's a
lot<00:01:00.149> more<00:01:00.180> enjoyable<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.780> watch<00:01:00.809> than<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.350> one

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
lot more enjoyable to watch than the one

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.560 
lot more enjoyable to watch than the one
I've<00:01:02.010> loaded<00:01:02.219> yesterday<00:01:02.670> even<00:01:03.390> though<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
I've loaded yesterday even though the

one<00:01:03.660> i<00:01:03.719> gloated<00:01:04.080> yesterday<00:01:04.379> was<00:01:04.530> pretty<00:01:04.710> cool

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
one i gloated yesterday was pretty cool

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.770 
one i gloated yesterday was pretty cool
because<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.909> was<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> first<00:01:06.180> one<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.689> I

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.300

you less than 25 gun kills to get the
kem<00:02:04.409> strike<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.799> reason<00:02:05.009> for<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.369> if<00:02:06.270> you

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
kem strike the reason for that is if you

kem strike the reason for that is if you
use<00:02:06.479> hardline<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.229> becomes<00:02:07.619> 24<00:02:08.099> kills<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.550> if

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
see pretty much every time I kill

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.700 
see pretty much every time I kill
someone<00:03:03.030> or<00:03:03.060> shoot<00:03:03.360> someone<00:03:03.660> I've<00:03:03.900> always<00:03:04.410> got

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
someone or shoot someone I've always got

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.810 
someone or shoot someone I've always got
that<00:03:04.740> little<00:03:04.950> red<00:03:05.160> thing<00:03:05.340> going<00:03:05.580> on<00:03:05.640> just

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
that little red thing going on just

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.850 
that little red thing going on just
because<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.180> happens<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:06.570> frequently<00:03:06.870> because

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
because it happens so frequently because

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.560 
because it happens so frequently because
I'm<00:03:07.950> like<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.160> 22<00:03:08.640> streak<00:03:08.940> at<00:03:09.060> these<00:03:09.180> points<00:03:09.390> or

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
I'm like a 22 streak at these points or

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.690 
I'm like a 22 streak at these points or
what-have-you<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.650> gameplay<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.220> kind<00:03:11.610> of

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
what-have-you so the gameplay is kind of

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.190 
what-have-you so the gameplay is kind of
drawing<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.060> close<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.360> can<00:03:12.480> send<00:03:12.660> 31<00:03:13.080> and

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
drawing to a close you can send 31 and

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.380 
drawing to a close you can send 31 and
one<00:03:13.320> at<00:03:13.410> this<00:03:13.500> point<00:03:13.770> I<00:03:14.010> actually<00:03:14.340> died<00:03:14.790> 9<00:03:15.180> and

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
one at this point I actually died 9 and

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.020 
one at this point I actually died 9 and
0<00:03:15.480> at<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.660> start<00:03:15.990> and<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.739> was<00:03:16.920> really<00:03:17.070> unhappy

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
0 at the start and I was really unhappy

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.670 
0 at the start and I was really unhappy
about<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.420> because<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.870> thought<00:03:19.050> I<00:03:19.230> wasn't

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
about that because I thought I wasn't

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.960 
about that because I thought I wasn't
gonna<00:03:19.830> have<00:03:19.950> enough<00:03:20.130> time<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.550> get<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.790> kem

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
gonna have enough time to get the kem

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.180 
gonna have enough time to get the kem
strike<00:03:21.239> but<00:03:21.780> fortunate<00:03:22.140> enough<00:03:22.260> I<00:03:22.440> did<00:03:22.830> so

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
strike but fortunate enough I did so

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.979 
strike but fortunate enough I did so
that<00:03:23.850> means<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:24.180> I've<00:03:24.300> got<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.660> now<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:24.840> think

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
that means that I've got to now I think

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.840 
that means that I've got to now I think
wonderful<00:03:25.440> missing<00:03:25.680> domination<00:03:26.160> one<00:03:26.640> was<00:03:26.760> in
