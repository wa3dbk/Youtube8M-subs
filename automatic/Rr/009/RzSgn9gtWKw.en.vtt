00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.500
 friends batista70phone good morning here we are a 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.140
 still talk about htc juan n 9 some 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.480
 some time ago a decade ago 15 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.119
 days ago htc released a 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.090
 update that goes especially to 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.320
 work on the camera 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.289
 obviously we did tests 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.330
 learned light conditions and we have 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.390
 found that indeed there is a 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.489
 quite substantial improvement in 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.550
 full light conditions 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.920
 the photos are brighter and have one 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.840
 better definition and then if we say 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.820
 that the biggest flaw because you don't 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.820
 he understood as never in light conditions 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.199
 quite as strong as we had seen in 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.750
 my first texts they did a 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.449
 milano served him as the photos were never 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.899
 however quite dark and the world a lot 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.960
 fortunately defined was a problem 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.700
 software having htc has managed to put 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.709
 hand to get results 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.789
 where, however, according to me there is still to be 

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:14.490
 to work 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.140
 then a part on the video because the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.149
 strange thing that I just noticed the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.580
 the video started a while ago 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.690
 get used to light enough light 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.920
 strong and when done the video is also 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.500
 in the focus meter that was rather 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.140
 slow after I focused 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.119
 manually to frame an object 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.970
 near and I moved and put back in 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.950
 manually fire has improved 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.720
 situation then probably how 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.700
 also wrote the valentino article 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.070
 you must have the photo normally immediately 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.680
 again that the video earns 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.630
 quality and this is something that does not 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.900
 I know if it's a sporadic case I'll do it again 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.540
 evidence is a habit, the thing is 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.580
 placed nothing to worry about 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.640
 bad that just go to focus with 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.820
 little finger and we are right where it is from 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.930
 work a little and light composition 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.970
 rather poor both with flash and a 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.690
 more reason without the flash photos 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.420
 they tend to be quite noisy 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.940
 in short, they do not have a good shell 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.650
 definition at that juncture there not 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.500
 the sensor seems to be able to 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.500
 collect little or no light available 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.620
 alcohol flash seems to fail 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.850
 have a well balanced photo comes 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.970
 defined 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.760
 but honestly I have to say that already with 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:41.500
 this update the photos are now 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:44.170
 definitely not better in my opinion 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:50.610
 still at maximum levels 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:53.170
 and since it costs 739 749 euros 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.000
 rightly one makes the comparison with i 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.670
 competitors and let's say that it does 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.100
 camera still not at those levels 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.320
 however, considering that it is already something 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.079
 have managed to do not exclude that not 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.500
 we can still improve as far as 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:11.620
 concerns the normal user experience 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.330
 the photos but has phone experience e 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.520
 anything else but I must say that anyway 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.960
 reconfirm the good impressions that 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.550
 I had a very good fluidity 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.670
 I am now using the 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.410
 cover that we see ultraslim more and 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:32.140
 I must say that it has improved anyway 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:35.080
 also the grip and what is not just the kcal 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.660
 it is perceived in a lower way but 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.110
 so this snapdragon 810 warms up 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:45.459
 warm what it does and then let's talk 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.200
 clear on a practical level on the phone not 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.489
 absolutely nothing happens in the sense 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.610
 which I never noticed but I never repeat 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:57.489
 no pointing no reboot 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.700
 none of this therefore the fact 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:04.930
 that the processor also arrives at 45 46 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.230
 nothing happens at the terminal 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.930
 not 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.599
 burns motherboard there are 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.400
 touch problems as I read of a 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.980
 other device, however, they are 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.489
 perhaps sending him there between now and tomorrow 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:22.040
 will send and we will try to try it on 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.970
 really however of these problems not 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.710
 we did not even notice one 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.780
 actually the camry now that 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.330
 little ball to be a bit of a professor 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.460
 the days get warmer and tidy 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.070
 that on the back cover especially i 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.990
 speakers and I took pictures on 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.370
 there is only one garden from my parents 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.510
 powerful that still the four and a half 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.940
 in the afternoon 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.669
 I must say that they are more processors than 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.370
 it was hot I had not put the cover on 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.979
 effects I must say that in his hand he gave 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.470
 annoyance when you put it in your pocket that is 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.979
 warm I have to say that in short the 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.380
 kcal canvas solvable with a cover 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:03.139
 let's face it I know it shouldn't 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.800
 be the solution though if the 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:09.830
 terminal you like is fine as does le 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.860
 photos appreciate the fluidity 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.880
 the volume got worse though that still 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.970
 good level 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.180
 at reception level nothing to say 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.500
 I think it's a minimum let's say about one 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.130
 membrane we have a thing in a 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.860
 membrane minimum between you phone 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.200
 it takes because sincerely now 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.250
 especially in the hot weather the calories you 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.470
 warns quite importantly 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.420
 okay so let's say that from that point 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.740
 of view 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.740
 the processor is always the same 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.020
 overheating is won the 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.360
 category that you are going to warn is 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.080
 nothing has changed with 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.250
 update 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.660
 but I repeat important thing on the phone 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.390
 nothing happens 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.790
 there are no faults there are no bees 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.910
 there are no nights of nothing for which 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:07.390
 probably a factor of a room 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:09.940
 that on a tactile level skin is 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.970
 feels but for the phone it is not so 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:16.240
 we say important in creating gods 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:19.510
 problems for which I have to say a good one 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.940
 cam upgrade improved by 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:25.240
 improve lighting conditions 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:28.000
 but it is not said that it is not that low 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.820
 we can succeed with this conclusion below 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.820
 from the science batista areas70 to 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.820
