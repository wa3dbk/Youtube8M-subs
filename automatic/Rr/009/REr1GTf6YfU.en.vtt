00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
going to do that by strengthening the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.800 
going to do that by strengthening the
muscles<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.400> legs<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.880> hips<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.390> ankles

players<00:01:31.140> move<00:01:31.560> more<00:01:31.829> efficiently<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.399> that's

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
players move more efficiently so that's

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.580

the<00:01:32.820> goal<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.030> today's<00:01:33.450> workout

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.350 

now<00:01:39.130> in<00:01:39.310> regards<00:01:39.729> to<00:01:39.850> including

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
now in regards to including

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.120 
now in regards to including
explosiveness<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.229> improving<00:01:41.530> first<00:01:41.860> step

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
explosiveness and improving first step

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.319 
explosiveness and improving first step
we<00:01:42.490> need<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.759> make<00:01:42.909> sure<00:01:43.060> that<00:01:43.180> we're<00:01:43.299> doing

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
we need to make sure that we're doing

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.440 
we need to make sure that we're doing
some<00:01:43.689> strength<00:01:44.170> movements<00:01:45.040> most<00:01:45.970> of<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.270> time

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
some strength movements most of the time

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.850 
some strength movements most of the time
when<00:01:46.630> people<00:01:46.659> think<00:01:46.960> of<00:01:47.170> strength<00:01:47.500> they

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
when people think of strength they

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.080 
when people think of strength they
picture<00:01:48.220> doing<00:01:48.369> things<00:01:48.640> in<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:48.909> weight<00:01:49.060> room

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
picture doing things in the weight room

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.149 
picture doing things in the weight room
doing<00:01:49.479> a<00:01:49.630> barbell<00:01:49.990> squat<00:01:50.350> doing<00:01:50.680> a<00:01:50.770> leg<00:01:50.920> press

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
doing a barbell squat doing a leg press

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.190 
doing a barbell squat doing a leg press
that<00:01:51.579> is<00:01:51.789> certainly<00:01:52.090> an<00:01:52.240> aspect<00:01:52.479> of<00:01:52.899> strength

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
that is certainly an aspect of strength

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.960 
that is certainly an aspect of strength
training<00:01:53.470> but<00:01:53.890> it's<00:01:54.009> not<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.280> only<00:01:54.399> way<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.700> do

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
training but it's not the only way to do

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.940 
training but it's not the only way to do
it<00:01:55.000> as<00:01:55.630> we<00:01:55.899> mentioned<00:01:56.350> earlier<00:01:56.530> in<00:01:56.770> the

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
it as we mentioned earlier in the

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.820 
it as we mentioned earlier in the
workout<00:01:57.369> a<00:01:57.580> lunge<00:01:58.179> is<00:01:58.570> probably<00:01:59.289> the<00:01:59.590> most

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
workout a lunge is probably the most

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.319 
workout a lunge is probably the most
functional<00:02:00.220> move<00:02:00.640> you'll<00:02:00.880> use<00:02:01.090> as<00:02:01.299> a

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
functional move you'll use as a

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.179 
functional move you'll use as a
basketball<00:02:01.840> player<00:02:01.990> if<00:02:02.409> you<00:02:02.679> can<00:02:02.829> picture<00:02:03.070> a

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
basketball player if you can picture a

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.980 
basketball player if you can picture a
defender<00:02:03.759> in<00:02:03.880> front<00:02:04.119> of<00:02:04.179> me<00:02:04.299> right<00:02:04.329> now<00:02:04.539> and

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
defender in front of me right now and

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.139

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
to do a forward and a reverse lunge but

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.900 
to do a forward and a reverse lunge but
we're<00:02:50.470> not<00:02:50.650> going<00:02:50.859> to<00:02:50.920> stop<00:02:51.160> in<00:02:51.340> between<00:02:51.459> so

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
we're not going to stop in between so

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.490 
we're not going to stop in between so
we're<00:02:52.000> going<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.150> hold<00:02:52.329> the<00:02:52.480> ball<00:02:52.660> here<00:02:52.959> we're
