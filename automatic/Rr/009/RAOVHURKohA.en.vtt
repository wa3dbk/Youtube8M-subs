00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
particular is the height of the cabin

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.200 
particular is the height of the cabin
they've<00:01:40.710> gone<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.310> couple<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.700> hundred<00:01:42.000> more

an asked naturalness boat it's a good

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.250 
an asked naturalness boat it's a good
bike<00:04:13.670> when<00:04:14.090> it's<00:04:14.209> thrown<00:04:14.450> into<00:04:14.630> turns<00:04:14.989> it

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
bike when it's thrown into turns it

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.289 
bike when it's thrown into turns it
doesn't<00:04:15.739> lean<00:04:15.920> hard<00:04:16.340> into<00:04:16.640> the<00:04:16.669> turns<00:04:17.060> which

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
doesn't lean hard into the turns which

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.300 
doesn't lean hard into the turns which
is<00:04:17.450> quite<00:04:18.230> a<00:04:18.260> nice<00:04:18.440> feature<00:04:18.770> because<00:04:18.980> that's

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
is quite a nice feature because that's

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.620 
is quite a nice feature because that's
something<00:04:19.459> that<00:04:19.640> can<00:04:19.820> make<00:04:19.970> people<00:04:20.180> sort<00:04:20.570> of

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
something that can make people sort of

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.230 
something that can make people sort of
feel<00:04:20.810> a<00:04:20.840> bit<00:04:21.020> insecure<00:04:21.290> on<00:04:21.650> bites<00:04:21.859> it<00:04:22.820> gently

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
feel a bit insecure on bites it gently

definitely<00:05:22.580> something<00:05:22.880> that<00:05:23.090> can<00:05:23.270> work<00:05:23.420> for

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
definitely something that can work for

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.140 
definitely something that can work for
me<00:05:23.810> it<00:05:24.350> does<00:05:24.650> taper<00:05:24.950> down<00:05:25.130> towards<00:05:25.760> the<00:05:25.850> stern

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
me it does taper down towards the stern

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.090 
me it does taper down towards the stern
and<00:05:26.390> make<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.050> stern<00:05:27.320> a<00:05:27.530> little<00:05:27.770> bit<00:05:27.890> more

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
and make the stern a little bit more

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.470 
and make the stern a little bit more
accessible<00:05:28.670> when<00:05:28.790> it<00:05:28.880> comes<00:05:29.090> to<00:05:29.270> bringing

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
accessible when it comes to bringing

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.550 
accessible when it comes to bringing
fish<00:05:29.810> on<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:30.590> off<00:05:30.680> so<00:05:31.580> overall<00:05:31.970> it's<00:05:32.870> a<00:05:33.110> really

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
fish on and off so overall it's a really
