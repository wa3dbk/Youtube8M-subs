00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello friends how are you yes do you have 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.730
 the shape has very good 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.160
 he's at home that's great 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.369
 today I propose to you to realize a 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.160
 paper snowflake and look 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.720
 I started to decorate the Christmas tree 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.800
 tosi a super look here it's a 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.369
 beautiful snowflakes achieved with the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.369
 children 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.090
 go it's gone the board have little to 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:40.040
 watch the video 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.040
 yes very well thank you soon apple 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.340
 hello to make a snowflake 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.309
 like this one with children it's 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.850
 simple you need 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:03.070
 a sheet of paper from a plate or 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.800
 of a bowl there a pair of scissors and a 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.400
 pencil 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.920
 the first thing to do with your 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.100
 on your paper sheet is a big 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.310
 circle 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.310
 these 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:36.680
 then carefully cut out this circle on 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.680
 the line goes quietly 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:46.040
 who will give us the outline here 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:01.790
 and here are these cuts and well we 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:09.450
 let's fold it in half like these 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:15.990
 again in two as this is 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:20.160
 again in two like this here 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:24.830
 in what we currently get 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:31.800
 now you will realize an axis 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:39.739
 just in the center like this one two 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.739
 traits on both sides that's how 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.250
 then 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.390
 two traits like that two traits like 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.390
 it 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.820
 here 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.799
 so take off with a pair of 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.799
 scissors 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:32.659
 all this 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:41.280
 and a little bit here is to succeed 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:42.959
 to make our snowflakes a 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.409
 we can place and after on the 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.409
 Christmas tree 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.010
 or possibly on a window 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:04:06.450
 a window a window on a table 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:06.450
 or decorate a wall 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.819
 above your bed for example also 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:15.920
 it is very possible 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:23.900
 here we are 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:27.100
 next to let's see the second is 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:32.960
 sure it gives an extraordinary rendering 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:38.900
 the famous snowflakes were not looking 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:48.169
 not necessarily symmetry her skis from there 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:51.280
 a little bit the soul of your voice the 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.280
 road snowflakes 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:05.350
 here you cut an edge by 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:07.120
 example is here on board also went 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:15.300
 see the rendering is frankly 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:18.940
 extraordinary we redouble there is here 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:23.700
 the snowflake that you can 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:27.940
 put on on your christmas tree 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.410
 that's easy to do with 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.670
 children 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.040
 so you just need a sheet of 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:36.570
 paper i have a pair of scissors a 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.570
 pencil a plate or a bowl 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:49.159
 thank you friends for your goodbye visit 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.520
 and see you soon for the decoration of 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:52.340
 Christmas 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:57.430

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.430
