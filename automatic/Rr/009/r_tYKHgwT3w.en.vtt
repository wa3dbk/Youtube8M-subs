or<00:04:01.680> three<00:04:01.799> seasons<00:04:02.430> just<00:04:03.209> so<00:04:03.329> they<00:04:03.480> know<00:04:03.510> again

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
or three seasons just so they know again

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.020 
or three seasons just so they know again
it's<00:04:04.560> that<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:05.040> it's<00:04:05.220> something<00:04:05.790> that's

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
it's that that it's something that's

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.430 
it's that that it's something that's
that's<00:04:06.420> built<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:06.750> last<00:04:07.019> and<00:04:07.260> there's

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
somewhere to take you as opposed to

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.610 
somewhere to take you as opposed to
showing<00:04:09.720> you<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.900> bunch<00:04:10.079> of<00:04:10.170> interesting

people who aren't necessarily doing
lunch<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:12.780> would<00:04:13.650> be<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.890> short

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
lunch and that would be the short

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.050 
lunch and that would be the short
checklist<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.950> longer<00:04:17.280> checklist<00:04:17.700> I<00:04:17.820> think

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
checklist the longer checklist I think

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.940 
checklist the longer checklist I think
is<00:04:18.209> making<00:04:18.419> sure<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:19.260> idea<00:04:19.590> that<00:04:19.769> you

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
is making sure that the idea that you

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.210 
is making sure that the idea that you
have<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.609> not<00:04:21.330> only<00:04:21.539> saleable<00:04:22.200> and

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
have is not only saleable and

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.370 
have is not only saleable and
in<00:04:23.490> line<00:04:23.820> with<00:04:24.120> a<00:04:24.180> particular<00:04:24.720> networks<00:04:25.110> needs

typically it's about a hundred and
twenty<00:07:23.700> days<00:07:23.840> at<00:07:24.840> the<00:07:25.020> outside<00:07:25.380> some<00:07:26.130> people

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.370 
twenty days at the outside some people

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.890 
twenty days at the outside some people
will<00:07:26.520> do<00:07:26.640> it<00:07:26.760> longer<00:07:27.120> some<00:07:27.330> people<00:07:27.570> will<00:07:27.660> do<00:07:27.780> it

will do it longer some people will do it
shorter<00:07:28.320> I<00:07:28.919> think<00:07:29.580> it<00:07:29.640> gives<00:07:29.730> you<00:07:29.880> enough<00:07:30.180> time

shorter I think it gives you enough time

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.150 
shorter I think it gives you enough time
that<00:07:30.660> you<00:07:30.720> can<00:07:31.020> take<00:07:31.260> it<00:07:31.410> out<00:07:31.530> once<00:07:31.800> because

that you can take it out once because

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.000 
that you can take it out once because
once<00:07:32.490> it's<00:07:32.669> been<00:07:32.790> around<00:07:33.470> the<00:07:34.470> idea<00:07:34.740> is<00:07:34.830> kind

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.010 
once it's been around the idea is kind

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.030 
once it's been around the idea is kind
of<00:07:35.160> exhausted<00:07:36.290> once<00:07:37.290> a<00:07:37.410> series<00:07:37.710> has<00:07:37.860> been

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:38.040

that<00:07:39.960> it's<00:07:40.140> been<00:07:40.290> out<00:07:40.470> so<00:07:41.190> you<00:07:41.250> don't<00:07:41.520> really

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:41.729 
that it's been out so you don't really

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:43.670 
that it's been out so you don't really
you've<00:07:42.060> really<00:07:42.300> got<00:07:42.419> you<00:07:42.690> know<00:07:42.810> one<00:07:43.169> shot<00:07:43.470> to

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 
you've really got you know one shot to

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.190 
you've really got you know one shot to
take<00:07:43.830> it<00:07:44.010> somewhere<00:07:44.370> so<00:07:45.030> 120<00:07:45.660> days<00:07:45.810> is<00:07:45.960> usually

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:46.200 
take it somewhere so 120 days is usually

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.200 
take it somewhere so 120 days is usually
long<00:07:46.380> enough<00:07:46.620> to<00:07:46.740> do<00:07:46.860> it<00:07:47.010> and<00:07:47.250> basically<00:07:47.940> all

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:48.210 
long enough to do it and basically all

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.900 
long enough to do it and basically all
you're<00:07:48.390> doing<00:07:48.720> is<00:07:48.930> preventing<00:07:49.910> production

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:50.910 
you're doing is preventing production

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:52.830 
companies and other people from doing an

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.320
