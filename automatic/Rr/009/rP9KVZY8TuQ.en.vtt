00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.190
 for everyone, equally welcome once again 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:19.180
 to a video this time with drivers work 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.849
 for almost said the custom to me 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.480
 I am very happy very very happy the game 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.310
 officially left this Tuesday and then I 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.869
 I traveled it unloading on Monday 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.890
 but they were like a million thanks air 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.949
 with my indigenous collection was a 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.470
 problem the download and this heading that 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.660
 are seeing is a nonconformist who is a 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.220
 ridiculous this I 'm using to kill 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.989
 two long distance teams 3 do not see 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.730
 for the sparks 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.370
 and this is literally my first 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.930
 game using this sniper rifle that 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.390
 I forgot how to call person rifle 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.860
 mounted on your shoulders that you can not 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.840
 shoot from the hip only 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.340
 you can shoot by not raising the sight but 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.660
 the same can be done by clicking coups 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.250
 although it is a little bit of input and 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.860
 etcetera and there are too many things of what 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.500
 speak and who do not even know what 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.850
 things I played like 10 hours this game 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.100
 since I left, I am completely 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.530
 in flawed and I'm happy and I feel like 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.399
 I have my head to explode because I 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.399
 I feel the need 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.600
 other than obviously I want to play 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.119
 I want to play the campaign I carry as such 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.290
 once 20 or 25 the campaign completed and 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.150
 I want to play multiplayer and I want 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.710
 do everything and I do not want to work and 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.940
 I want to stay the office said I want 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.299
 stay at home just playing and 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.970
 see the next aim and weapons and 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.159
 throw the achieved and how changed 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.659
 things and I lost them and sorry one of the 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.350
 best things I finally made 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.080
 case 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.970
 finally or mike to a sewing game 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.530
 where players do not get tired of 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.720
 run have already realized that that has 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.550
 been a problem in all colors in 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.679
 the whole history of koudri always the 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.659
 players get tired cerethos marathón or 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.310
 exión conditioning or different types of 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.319
 Perez so you could run during 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.200
 more time now I never get tired 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:59.860
 love that changes a lot the ex 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.619
 skills of your from your soldier's 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.020
 mobility and the minimap saw the 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.670
 changes in the mini maps are rare in 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.670
 the costs of this death 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.600
 the falls remember a little bit what 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.130
 could not be a titan was there if those 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.200
 want to compare mobility 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.180
 Field destruction is fun 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.280
 it still does not reach that feeling of 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.140
 Parkour green before game too much ball 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.990
 I'm trying to shoot these 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.540
 these bullets 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.860
 believing that there is one as it is called 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.930
 there is a bullet movement but caution neither 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.710
 there is not 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.970
 there has never been in fact in the 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.620
 hard games latvala move 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.110
 Instantly from the front of your 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.940
 weapon up to the enemy what it means 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.440
 that where you shot is where is going to 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.360
 there is no time there is no there is no 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.980
 that calculate forward or nothing and when 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.690
 play it for a purpose tends to do this 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.070
 especially with sniper to try to 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.930
 point a little bit forward where they are 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.340
 players with spain I think they are a 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.290
 of the factual reasons now thinking about it 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.990
 with which code would have been 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.210
 always so popular click scouting 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.920
 and well I have too much to talk about 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.930
 so I'm going to do this one nothing more 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.360
 first impressions video because 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.490
 because there I have too many first 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.960
 impressions special things and 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.610
 specific that have changed and that are 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.250
 very different, such as how 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.209
 they work the scripts fix the people 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.680
 that by the way I 'm not going to talk 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.470
 practically the ones that I am playing 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.450
 games 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.300
 but he has realized that all the 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.760
 system of your display defense sheet 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.530
 change because now the map you can 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.690
 have the minimum normal size so that 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.670
 you have it there or you can have it in 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.130
 common as a wide screen as a 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.440
 expanded screen depending on a 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.510
 frame that you put you can recharge the 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.160
 faster weapon no longer isolate see from 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.510
 conjuring that there were always 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.090
 drivers but now what you can 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.860
 do is a quick reload that what 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.420
 you do is lose the bullets these 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.709
 very interesting that at the beginning I do not 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.299
 I realized I was doing it without wanting 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.769
 and half a day I want to discover by 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.080
 mistake I realized I was doing 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.580
 refills weapons very very quickly and 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.380
 the shovel does not improve anything and I'm like what 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.180
 whores is happening and I realized that it is 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.790
 that there are two ways to unload the weapon 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.470
 everything is incredible although they made him 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.330
 changes this game that is how I feel 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.670
 like playing with tours and for the first time 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.010
 It is so different and at the same time it feels so 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.660
 coduri that I do not have real explanation 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.580
 Of course, not everything is color 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.769
 pink for me there are problems like 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.329
 example the typical we do not have to be videos 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.919
 dedicated and been trying to look at 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.639
 discussion forums on reddit throughout 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.889
 side and nobody gives a tree 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.349
 a definitive answer they will do 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.900
 or they will not do it here, I think that 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:29.210
 and yet I have different ping and everything 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.819
 I can say that with bad internet I have not 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.319
 had I not felt so many problems of 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:35.150
 lag as other drivers passed where 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:37.340
 one felt the a donald or jalonazo was 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.610
 amazed to see the famous robert see that 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.110
 you feel like you're stuck 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.909
 some kind of rope or something that you do not 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.349
 lets move you do not feel so much but 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:46.699
 of course 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.249
 apart from quibbles that in my opinion 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.710
 they have to do with the doctor's rate 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:55.819
 of refreshing the game that is 30 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.909
 megahertz every second instead of every 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:00.889
 second the game refreshes 30 times from 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:03.680
 your screen up to what is 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.139
 happening in the service on the servers 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.729
 in the connection with him as the connection 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.199
 with all the other people who are 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.349
 playing then it means that the 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.789
 game has how to define what is it 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.919
 what can happen and sometimes they kill you 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.210
 behind atypical walls problems of 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.310
 net code that the truth that has not 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.310
 changed with turin but overall I'm 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.870
 super enjoying the campaign I think 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.490
 that is well done 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.350
 it's probably going to be a river too 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.700
 you better go putting me down in 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.350
 the comments that we would like to make 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.640
 I want to be weapons guides I want to do 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:36.560
 Class guides of all 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.850
 to the destination before I do not know I'm very 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.550
 excited about the game I think it's 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.950
 very very well accomplished sledgehammer me 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.190
 I take off my hat and this I have nothing else 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:49.220
 played a little bit in four players per 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.550
 true the cues creek are 00 over power 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.050
 not found a single click 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.820
 used few really because state 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.850
 only us while I 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.860
 I'm used to but there are a lot of things 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.690
 for example the indications I insist on 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.490
 minimap is an experience 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.680
 completely different than everything else 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.970
 As a tourist I recommend you if you want 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.350
 I made a minimum video for them 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.570
 to make a video of the minimap explaining 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.370
 everything there is because sexuality is 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.250
 of you is shown on the map too 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.840
 sexuality is from the enemy and a lot 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.750
 of things have changed and the truth is that 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.430
 all these changes feel like a 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.250
 amazing super refreshing question 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.650
 especially because the saga today has fallen 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.120
 and a little bit in a circle 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.080
 where I was almost always doing what 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.080
 same 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.379
 it was the same thing who managed to flirt 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.879
 the cues tics to do some kind of 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:41.000
 theft of the game now I think that 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:43.550
 never in what will you define will you define 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.590
 the games no longer is not like before 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.090
 the grenades last longer to detonate a 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.250
 a lot of problems that I saw before in 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.259
 contour and that I did not feel injustice 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.789
 trans justice now they do not feel 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:54.349
 so much because they have done a lot 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:56.629
 of change in the dynamics of the game by 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:58.250
 course the skills also and 

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:59.750
 he who abuses a lot of sexuality is 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.520
 Well, it's going to end with the problem 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.180
 typical of the whole world you will see where 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.819
 these 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.319
 few hits markets with the lakers in the 

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:07.610
 Weapons have good balance in blue 

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:08.780
 machine where they are again my 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.099
 favorite although I know that people to 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.190
 continue to use assault rifles 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:14.900
 I do not know I have too many to talk about and 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.400
 I'm running out of video I do not have the time 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.080
 so you guys are putting less
