00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.760
 and hello everyone so we end up 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.960
 today for a tutorial on a nab life 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.490
 carrots and potatoes 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.849
 I 'm doing a little demonstration 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.240
 right now so you put yourself there 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.300
 you look at the right clip to press and 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.859
 Here it fills alone the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.279
 carrots it's exactly the same thing 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:31.019
 and the potatoes too you can see 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.160
 that I'm surviving for good 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.620
 show that it works 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.420
 in this fashion then the front design 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.579
 is not me distributors and 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.290
 pistons with the earth block this is it 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.260
 seems to me and did that he invented the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.829
 first but then behind he had 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.579
 do that with a bot so I get it 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.489
 I did not like it too much 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.809
 I created a little sister sweater we go 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.430
 see that right now but I'm starting 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.770
 by explaining to you already how that 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.620
 walking here it's distributors who 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.000
 are filled with powder rising what will 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.719
 to grow your plant 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.180
 faster 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.150
 she is planted on a block of land 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.700
 plowed irrigated by water that you 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.460
 put on a sticky piston so the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.979
 sticky piston when he goes to get up 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.960
 and go back down very quickly it will allow 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.470
 dropping your plants that will 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.740
 already ready thanks to the powder address 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:29.009
 behind his graces impeller qg put there 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.799
 we will light it right away for better 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:37.140
 see so the court gets there there 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.420
 happens strong in the cursor he sends 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.729
 since that time speaks of under and to 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.960
 distributors 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:48.420
 here it flashes very quickly 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.079
 so lets harvest your food 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.509
 a logitech his his impressions so we 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.829
 goes on to build so for 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.750
 build this machine you go 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.079
 need about twenty blocks 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.899
 maximum one piston one earth block one 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.190
 bucket of water seven dispensers a lever 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.920
 repeater slats a comparator 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.120
 you are a red stone so we will start 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:18.380
 immediately by placing our pistons 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.900
 his block of land the distributors all 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.860
 around 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:31.000
 then we dig there to put 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:40.850
 the water we go behind we will go place 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:47.840
 our blocks like these last one 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:50.110
 distributor years above we spread of 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.110
 redstone 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:06.320
 here we are going to prepare our chip 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:11.870
 hours so here's a loop around the 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:14.060
 compare the turn on repeaters here 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.440
 for the current to be strong in the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.700
 queues 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.700
 otherwise there is too much of us and I noticed 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.580
 over there 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.450
 here the lever 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:45.280
 there we put repeaters to feed 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:50.060
 its distributors there and that's the circuit 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.250
 is almost done join our 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.570
 track years that lies there for 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.350
 activate it at the same time as 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.350
 distributors 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:06.770
 it is here it is a repeater 3 tic 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.930
 the faster its trend happens that the 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.700
 block of earth stays stuck up and 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.610
 less quickly there is a little developed and 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.480
 it's slower for getting 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.340
 the food on 3 ticks is not bad 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.770
 here I put a block that really avoids me 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.530
 that when I plant sometimes it happens 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.040
 to click on the on the repeater and to 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.650
 stagger it is the bazaar 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:38.060
 and here we are going to meet for 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:42.340
 the test we are ready or almost we 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.480
 sees the little ball to be tall 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:50.440
 I put a machine on the road 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.440
 a game filled with rising powder 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:17.070
 and go and you can see the 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:18.690
 wheat here we are in a moment 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.030
 for a little decoration of this machine 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.500
 is also a small change in noise 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.950
 at the level of the distributors it will be 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.150
 really cool 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.950
 so here's the little decoration I have 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.960
 introduce yourself I tried to stay 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.780
 quite natural in colors as we 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.140
 still talk about poultry farming gmi so 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.990
 my music blogs all around 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.480
 I cut the noise of the pistons and 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.420
 distributors so to do that these 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:52.410
 music and sound options you put the 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:55.220
 blocks at least here we go everything from 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.220
 see what it looks like 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:01.719
 here it is more pleasant to the ear 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.520
 could get scrambled annoyingly I put 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:06.729
 the little lights story that that 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.779
 blinks in its forgotten phase so I 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:10.689
 show you right away what that 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:14.020
 give back then I have everything 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:16.029
 simply night repeaters boulmerka 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.860
 of redstone that feeds the 

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:21.580
 distributors by shifting them from 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:23.469
 a few tics each story that it 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.529
 not play the note simultaneously 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:29.979
 lights i shifted from catic to that 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:32.080
 not blink too fast for the oxen 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:34.689
 musical what there is to know is that he 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:39.999
 absolutely must a block of grass in fact 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:41.620
 above the block below following the 

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:44.259
 material that you are going to put that goes 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:49.389
 play a different tone so for 

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:52.870
 wood is a low sand gravel 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:56.680
 it's a green snare that's 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:07:00.460
 stone chopsticks these big crr is a 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.480
 little everything else is piano so here it is 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.540
 he 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.800
 if not with a little right click you 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:11.900
 can change the note 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:14.150
 doremi fa sol la if do I think we 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.700
 come to the end of this tutorial so I hope 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.910
 that you liked it and I tell you to very 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.910
 soon
