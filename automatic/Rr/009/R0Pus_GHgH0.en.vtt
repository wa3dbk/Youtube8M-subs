running around the house we usually

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.160 
running around the house we usually
drink<00:01:09.350> filtered<00:01:09.619> water<00:01:09.979> brita<00:01:10.520> filtered

which<00:01:12.170> doesn't<00:01:12.619> take<00:01:12.770> care<00:01:12.979> of<00:01:13.100> e.coli<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:15.070> we

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
which doesn't take care of e.coli and we

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.950 
which doesn't take care of e.coli and we
only<00:01:16.219> had<00:01:16.460> one<00:01:16.729> or<00:01:16.820> two<00:01:16.850> bottles<00:01:17.450> of<00:01:17.539> water<00:01:17.750> in

the<00:01:18.049> house<00:01:18.200> so<00:01:18.950> I<00:01:18.979> figured<00:01:19.340> now<00:01:19.490> is<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.759> time

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
the house so I figured now is the time

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.569 
the house so I figured now is the time
to<00:01:20.000> break<00:01:20.359> this<00:01:20.539> thing<00:01:20.600> out<00:01:22.179> it<00:01:23.179> claims<00:01:24.579> that

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
to break this thing out it claims that

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:28.950 
to break this thing out it claims that
it<00:01:25.729> removes<00:01:26.000> harmful<00:01:26.890> microscopic<00:01:27.890> pathogens

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960

filter will take all of that out so like

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.300 
filter will take all of that out so like
I<00:01:49.429> said<00:01:49.490> I<00:01:49.850> thought<00:01:50.560> rather<00:01:51.560> than<00:01:51.740> save<00:01:52.130> it

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
I said I thought rather than save it

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.859 
I said I thought rather than save it
this<00:01:52.460> would<00:01:52.640> be<00:01:52.759> a<00:01:52.789> time<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.060> break<00:01:53.390> this<00:01:53.630> out

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
this would be a time to break this out

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.609 
this would be a time to break this out
and<00:01:54.020> try<00:01:54.259> it<00:01:54.759> what<00:01:55.759> happens<00:01:56.119> is<00:01:56.329> it<00:01:57.049> has<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.229> tube

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
and try it what happens is it has a tube

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.929 
and try it what happens is it has a tube
on<00:01:57.889> the<00:01:58.039> inside<00:01:58.399> that<00:01:58.960> hooks<00:01:59.960> up<00:02:00.139> to<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.939> filter

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
on the inside that hooks up to a filter

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.460 
on the inside that hooks up to a filter
like<00:02:02.119> this<00:02:02.439> it's<00:02:03.439> called<00:02:03.679> an<00:02:03.889> ionic

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.750 

I<00:02:07.560> think<00:02:08.490> it<00:02:08.550> was<00:02:08.610> ionic<00:02:09.590> absorption<00:02:10.590> of

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
I think it was ionic absorption of

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.440 
I think it was ionic absorption of
pollutants<00:02:11.840> on<00:02:13.070> ebay<00:02:14.070> army<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.090> rather<00:02:15.210> on

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
pollutants on ebay army and rather on

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.500 
pollutants on ebay army and rather on
youtube<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:16.050> saw<00:02:16.260> some<00:02:16.980> videos<00:02:17.480> where<00:02:18.480> people

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
youtube I saw some videos where people

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.370 
youtube I saw some videos where people
put<00:02:19.050> color<00:02:19.500> die<00:02:19.830> in<00:02:20.100> here<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:22.200> would

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
put color die in here and it would

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.020 
put color die in here and it would
filter<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.830> out<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.220> thought<00:02:23.400> maybe<00:02:23.460> I<00:02:23.730> try

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
filter it out so I thought maybe I try

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.420 
filter it out so I thought maybe I try
this<00:02:24.090> we've<00:02:24.450> been<00:02:24.600> drinking<00:02:25.020> out<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.170> this

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
this we've been drinking out of this

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.620 
this we've been drinking out of this
over<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.550> weekend<00:02:27.800> but<00:02:29.000> what<00:02:30.000> happens<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.510> you

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
over the weekend but what happens is you

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.630 
over the weekend but what happens is you
put<00:02:30.810> water<00:02:31.020> in<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.860> got<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.160> drain<00:02:32.370> this

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
put water in it you got to drain this

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.910 
put water in it you got to drain this
tank<00:02:33.090> twice<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.840> get<00:02:33.960> whatever<00:02:34.170> carbon<00:02:34.770> and

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
tank twice to get whatever carbon and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.910 
tank twice to get whatever carbon and
stuff<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.250> in<00:02:35.430> there<00:02:35.610> out<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.420> filter<00:02:36.920> you

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
stuff is in there out of the filter you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.510 
stuff is in there out of the filter you
can<00:02:37.950> suck<00:02:38.430> on<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.670> straw<00:02:39.090> or<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.920> can<00:02:41.130> squeeze

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
can suck on the straw or you can squeeze

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.699 
can suck on the straw or you can squeeze
the<00:02:41.790> tank<00:02:42.090> hopefully<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.110> can<00:02:43.290> do<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:43.560> without

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
the tank hopefully I can do this without

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.290 
the tank hopefully I can do this without
messing<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.400> all<00:02:44.520> up<00:02:44.930> squeeze<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.080> tank<00:02:46.350> and

messing it all up squeeze the tank and

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.770 
messing it all up squeeze the tank and
the<00:02:48.300> water<00:02:48.510> comes<00:02:48.780> out<00:02:50.240> now<00:02:51.240> it's<00:02:51.420> a<00:02:51.510> little

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
the water comes out now it's a little

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.470 
the water comes out now it's a little
harder<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.170> squeeze<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.130> is<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.580> suck

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
harder to squeeze it that it is to suck

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.500 
harder to squeeze it that it is to suck
on<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.840> straw<00:02:55.640> but<00:02:56.640> if<00:02:56.910> you're<00:02:57.150> going<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.360> put

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
on the straw but if you're going to put

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.590 
on the straw but if you're going to put
it<00:02:57.600> in<00:02:57.690> cooking<00:02:58.110> pots<00:02:58.470> or<00:02:58.709> whatever<00:02:59.300> of<00:03:00.300> course

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
it in cooking pots or whatever of course

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.760 
it in cooking pots or whatever of course
you<00:03:00.720> wouldn't<00:03:00.870> be<00:03:01.050> able<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.260> suck<00:03:01.470> on<00:03:01.650> the

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
you wouldn't be able to suck on the

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.850 
you wouldn't be able to suck on the
straw<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.600> water<00:03:03.810> comes<00:03:04.050> out<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.680> does

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
straw so the water comes out and it does

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.509 
straw so the water comes out and it does
taste<00:03:05.130> good<00:03:07.220> yep<00:03:08.660> tastes<00:03:09.660> good<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.489> thought<00:03:11.489> I

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
taste good yep tastes good so thought I

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:19.660 
taste good yep tastes good so thought I
try<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:11.940> blue<00:03:12.330> dye<00:03:12.950> routine<00:03:14.480> let's<00:03:15.480> put<00:03:15.840> one

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.770 

drop<00:03:20.670> there<00:03:21.860> it<00:03:22.860> should<00:03:23.190> be<00:03:23.220> plenty<00:03:25.010> yikes<00:03:26.010> I

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
drop there it should be plenty yikes I

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.080 
drop there it should be plenty yikes I
really<00:03:27.920> dies<00:03:28.920> it

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.619 

put<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:32.840> back<00:03:33.050> in<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.319> bottle<00:03:34.360> like<00:03:35.360> I<00:03:35.480> said

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
put it back in the bottle like I said

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.080 
put it back in the bottle like I said
see<00:03:35.870> there<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:36.110> have<00:03:36.459> can<00:03:37.459> you<00:03:37.580> see<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:37.879> the

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
see there you have can you see that the

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.880 
see there you have can you see that the
filter<00:03:39.730> just<00:03:40.730> hangs<00:03:41.000> here<00:03:41.269> on<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.620> end<00:03:42.739> of<00:03:42.800> the

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
filter just hangs here on the end of the

00:03:42.890 --> 00:04:01.300 
filter just hangs here on the end of the
straw<00:03:43.780> let<00:03:44.780> me<00:03:44.900> pour<00:03:45.170> this<00:03:45.440> in

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:11.680 

pour<00:04:02.310> that<00:04:02.520> in<00:04:02.700> there<00:04:04.640> mix<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:05.820> up<00:04:06.500> let's<00:04:07.500> see

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:20.710 

it<00:04:12.690> is<00:04:12.870> blue<00:04:13.200> water<00:04:13.500> in<00:04:13.740> their<00:04:16.160> work<00:04:17.160> back<00:04:17.430> in

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.020 

put<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.750> filter<00:04:22.140> in<00:04:22.470> now<00:04:23.370> there's<00:04:23.610> a<00:04:23.670> whole

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
put the filter in now there's a whole

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.450 
put the filter in now there's a whole
ring<00:04:24.270> here<00:04:24.600> so<00:04:25.350> you<00:04:25.410> have<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.860> make<00:04:26.040> sure<00:04:26.070> that

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
ring here so you have to make sure that

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.880 
ring here so you have to make sure that
you<00:04:26.550> close<00:04:26.820> this<00:04:27.060> thing<00:04:27.240> good<00:04:27.480> and<00:04:27.630> tight<00:04:27.890> so

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
you close this thing good and tight so

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.780 
you close this thing good and tight so
that<00:04:28.920> you<00:04:29.070> can<00:04:29.220> build<00:04:29.370> up<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.700> pressure<00:04:31.790> the

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
that you can build up the pressure the

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.510 
that you can build up the pressure the
lint<00:04:33.090> just<00:04:33.390> clicks<00:04:34.110> over<00:04:34.380> like<00:04:34.560> that<00:04:34.770> squashes

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
lint just clicks over like that squashes

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.820 
lint just clicks over like that squashes
the<00:04:35.670> straw<00:04:35.970> so<00:04:36.840> that<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.140> can<00:04:37.320> carry<00:04:37.560> this

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
the straw so that you can carry this

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.060 
the straw so that you can carry this
around<00:04:37.890> with<00:04:38.310> you<00:04:38.580> then<00:04:39.290> you<00:04:40.290> just<00:04:40.500> pop<00:04:40.800> this

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
around with you then you just pop this

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.710 
around with you then you just pop this
back<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.550> straw<00:04:41.790> comes<00:04:42.090> out<00:04:44.510> should<00:04:45.510> about

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
back the straw comes out should about

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.010 
back the straw comes out should about
another<00:04:45.960> class<00:04:46.380> let's<00:04:46.950> try<00:04:47.190> it<00:04:47.250> in<00:04:47.400> this<00:04:47.520> one

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
another class let's try it in this one

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.840 
another class let's try it in this one
let's<00:04:49.020> see<00:04:49.170> what<00:04:49.320> comes<00:04:49.530> out<00:04:51.560> clear<00:04:52.760> can<00:04:53.760> you

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
let's see what comes out clear can you

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:04.070 
let's see what comes out clear can you
see<00:04:54.030> that<00:05:01.820> nice<00:05:02.820> looks<00:05:03.270> like<00:05:03.420> nice<00:05:03.690> clear

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
see that nice looks like nice clear

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:20.390 
see that nice looks like nice clear
water<00:05:16.910> all<00:05:17.910> clear<00:05:18.300> it's<00:05:18.450> not<00:05:18.630> blue<00:05:19.130> let's<00:05:20.130> put

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
water all clear it's not blue let's put

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:27.560 
water all clear it's not blue let's put
it<00:05:20.520> back<00:05:20.670> into<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.120> other<00:05:21.360> one<00:05:26.510> this<00:05:27.510> is

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
it back into the other one this is

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:37.070 
it back into the other one this is
what's<00:05:27.900> in<00:05:28.050> the<00:05:28.140> bottle<00:05:28.500> I<00:05:35.720> don't<00:05:36.720> know<00:05:36.810> can

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
what's in the bottle I don't know can

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.260 
what's in the bottle I don't know can
you<00:05:37.320> can<00:05:37.500> see<00:05:37.740> compared<00:05:38.190> to<00:05:38.280> two<00:05:38.460> that's

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
you can see compared to two that's

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.940 
you can see compared to two that's
within<00:05:39.510> the<00:05:39.720> water<00:05:39.930> and<00:05:40.380> this<00:05:40.470> is<00:05:40.620> what<00:05:40.770> comes

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
within the water and this is what comes

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.360 
within the water and this is what comes
through<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.370> filter<00:05:41.760> and<00:05:41.910> the<00:05:41.970> straw<00:05:43.370> bikes

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
through the filter and the straw bikes

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.730 
through the filter and the straw bikes
clear<00:05:45.080> verses<00:05:46.080> nice<00:05:46.860> blue<00:05:48.350> so<00:05:49.350> if<00:05:49.530> it<00:05:49.650> will

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
clear verses nice blue so if it will

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.800 
clear verses nice blue so if it will
clear<00:05:49.980> out<00:05:50.160> if<00:05:50.460> it'll<00:05:50.760> strain<00:05:51.000> out<00:05:51.180> blue<00:05:51.540> dye

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
clear out if it'll strain out blue dye

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.010 
clear out if it'll strain out blue dye
hmm<00:05:52.740> that's<00:05:53.310> interesting<00:05:53.600> it<00:05:54.600> really<00:05:54.780> does

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
hmm that's interesting it really does

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.140 
hmm that's interesting it really does
filter<00:05:55.560> out<00:05:55.680> blue<00:05:56.010> dye<00:05:56.220> like<00:05:56.520> that<00:05:56.760> out<00:05:57.000> of

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
filter out blue dye like that out of

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.690 
filter out blue dye like that out of
water<00:05:57.330> I<00:05:57.710> guess<00:05:58.710> it<00:05:58.860> should<00:05:59.070> clear<00:05:59.250> out<00:05:59.370> most

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
water I guess it should clear out most

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.880 
water I guess it should clear out most
of<00:05:59.820> the<00:05:59.910> pathogens<00:06:00.540> and<00:06:00.750> stuff<00:06:01.020> and<00:06:01.590> hopefully

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
of the pathogens and stuff and hopefully

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.580 
of the pathogens and stuff and hopefully
be<00:06:02.280> a<00:06:02.310> pretty<00:06:02.580> safe<00:06:03.140> thing<00:06:04.140> to<00:06:04.169> a<00:06:04.410> drink<00:06:04.860> from

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
be a pretty safe thing to a drink from

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:11.010 
be a pretty safe thing to a drink from
