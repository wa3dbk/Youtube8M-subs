00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.760
 Hi guys all right 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.360
 I'm going to teach you today and make a 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.839
 pencil holder with custom super 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.720
 computer keys 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.029
 It is very laborious to do if you 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.220
 should present staff will know that you 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.279
 She loves it a lot because she gives a little work and 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.369
 bad but it is easy to do 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.969
 It takes only a little delay. 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:40.020
 two days maybe but the person gets super 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.660
 Glad it's beautiful to a pencil door. 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.020

 news and you will love are sure 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.850

 so this is it , kiss it until the next 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.309
 Merry Christmas, you run that gives you time to 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.549
 do this and cut pencils to give 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.430
 Christmas present a kiss, see you later 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.439
 Good to begin, I went to a small shop. 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:18.429
 wooden 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:21.670
 I bought a pencil holder several types 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:28.890
 I tried black with wood paint 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.890
 even I break apart the keyboard 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.890
 now I'm going to get a little 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:11.679
 example I will use to take only one 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.679
 of little key has seen me 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:22.480
 and I'll also use a nail clipper 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.280
 to pull out those little things there that 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.050
 will mess up to make a pencil door 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.050
 so we discard 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.690
 and now we will fill with biscuit 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:46.330
 techniques to make it easier to 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:48.610
 paste the chance that you will burn with 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:54.640
 hot glue if you do not have a clay 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:57.580
 inside screen is very big so now 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.709
 I'll put it in there. 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.370
 now I need to level and it takes away 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.370
 all the excess 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.860
 strip the excess with in you too 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:18.940
 can use a ruler or some surface 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:21.990
 Lisa to help level out how she is now 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.630
 for example the resident 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.250
 pushed out to see is another to 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:32.560
 play dough 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.560
 now we take the excess of the ready
