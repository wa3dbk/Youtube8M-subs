00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.120 
really nice this I probably won't use
the<00:03:24.180> bronzer<00:03:24.570> there's<00:03:25.380> not<00:03:25.530> really<00:03:25.650> enough<00:03:25.739> of

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
the bronzer there's not really enough of

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.400 
the bronzer there's not really enough of
it<00:03:26.280> for<00:03:26.520> that<00:03:26.640> but<00:03:27.120> it's<00:03:27.270> a<00:03:27.330> really<00:03:27.510> nice<00:03:27.840> shade

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
it for that but it's a really nice shade

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.430 
it for that but it's a really nice shade
so<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.680> might<00:03:28.920> use<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.280> as<00:03:29.430> an<00:03:29.610> eyeshadow<00:03:30.380> see<00:03:31.380> if
