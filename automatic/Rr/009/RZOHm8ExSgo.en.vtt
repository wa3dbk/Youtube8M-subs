00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
talk about is running back foot work on

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.430 
talk about is running back foot work on
three<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.710> our<00:00:07.919> biggest<00:00:08.099> plays<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:09.269> power<00:00:09.510> the

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
three of our biggest plays the power the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
three of our biggest plays the power the
belly<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.910> sprint<00:00:12.240> draw<00:00:13.099> now<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.250> may

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
belly and the sprint draw now this may

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.400 
belly and the sprint draw now this may
seem<00:00:14.759> very<00:00:14.790> simple<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.660> oversimplified<00:00:16.379> but

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
seem very simple and oversimplified but

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.189 
seem very simple and oversimplified but
we<00:00:16.800> are<00:00:16.949> going<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.369> talk<00:00:18.300> about<00:00:18.480> how<00:00:18.810> we<00:00:18.869> make

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
we are going to talk about how we make

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.650 
we are going to talk about how we make
sure<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:20.010> quarterback<00:00:20.580> does<00:00:20.880> not<00:00:21.060> push<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
sure the quarterback does not push the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.480 
sure the quarterback does not push the
tailback<00:00:22.080> off<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.560> midline<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.279> power

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
tailback off the midline on the power

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.490 
tailback off the midline on the power
because<00:00:24.390> when<00:00:24.539> we<00:00:24.779> are<00:00:24.840> running<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.260> power

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
because when we are running the power

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.040 
because when we are running the power
towards<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.189> three<00:00:26.490> technique<00:00:26.970> we<00:00:27.660> like<00:00:27.869> to

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
towards a three technique we like to

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.040 
towards a three technique we like to
stick<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.800> right<00:00:28.830> into<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.310> gap<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.869> other

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
stick it right into a gap and the other

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.650 
stick it right into a gap and the other
thing<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.399> possibly<00:00:32.969> could<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
thing is that we possibly could have the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.030 
thing is that we possibly could have the
cutback<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.559> play

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
cutback on the play

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.250 
cutback on the play
and<00:00:35.130> if<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> quarterback<00:00:36.300> pushes<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
and if the quarterback pushes the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.470 
and if the quarterback pushes the
tailback<00:00:37.950> too<00:00:38.280> far<00:00:38.579> off<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.969> line<00:00:39.000> he<00:00:39.390> will

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
tailback too far off the line he will

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.970 
tailback too far off the line he will
not<00:00:39.690> be<00:00:39.870> able<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.140> get<00:00:40.260> his<00:00:40.379> eyes<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
not be able to get his eyes on the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.010 
not be able to get his eyes on the
cutback<00:00:41.399> if<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.730> opens<00:00:42.059> up<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.719> what<00:00:42.899> we're

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
cutback if it opens up so what we're

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.170 
cutback if it opens up so what we're
gonna<00:00:43.079> do<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.469> we're<00:00:43.620> gonna<00:00:43.680> demonstrate

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
the belly it's very important that I

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.770 
the belly it's very important that I
think<00:01:49.670> that<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:49.970> teach<00:01:50.180> this<00:01:50.480> to<00:01:50.630> your

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
think that you teach this to your

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.540 
think that you teach this to your
tailback<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.470> your<00:01:51.650> fullback<00:01:52.040> if<00:01:52.250> you<00:01:52.370> want

track<00:03:59.630> the<00:04:00.630> reason<00:04:00.960> we<00:04:01.080> do<00:04:01.230> this<00:04:01.380> is<00:04:01.560> we<00:04:01.710> like

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
track the reason we do this is we like

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.710 
track the reason we do this is we like
the<00:04:02.100> linebackers<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.880> be<00:04:03.000> scraping<00:04:03.390> and

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
the linebackers to be scraping and

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.510 
the linebackers to be scraping and
moving<00:04:04.020> lateral<00:04:04.530> we<00:04:04.950> don't<00:04:05.220> want<00:04:05.430> the

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
moving lateral we don't want the

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.400 
moving lateral we don't want the
linebackers<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.240> meet<00:04:06.420> us<00:04:06.540> in<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.960> hole<00:04:07.140> on

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
linebackers to meet us in the hole on

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.820 
linebackers to meet us in the hole on
the<00:04:07.560> ISO<00:04:08.150> so<00:04:09.150> if<00:04:09.240> we<00:04:09.390> can<00:04:09.570> get<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:10.530> play<00:04:10.770> to

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
the ISO so if we can get the play to

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.340 
the ISO so if we can get the play to
look<00:04:11.190> like<00:04:11.460> the<00:04:12.300> option<00:04:12.810> we<00:04:12.959> can<00:04:13.110> get<00:04:13.230> the

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
look like the option we can get the

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.199 
look like the option we can get the
linebacker<00:04:13.770> scraping<00:04:14.520> and<00:04:14.640> then<00:04:15.030> what

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
linebacker scraping and then what

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.570 
linebacker scraping and then what
happens<00:04:15.600> is<00:04:15.870> your<00:04:16.320> isolation<00:04:17.130> block<00:04:17.370> from

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
happens is your isolation block from
