00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.770
 we are in the sports city of fc 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.139
 barcelona where xavi hernández just 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.540
 announce that he left the final barça of 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.590
 season now we will ask our 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.500
 fellow journalists who has 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.480
 meaning I knew the brain of the best 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.180
 Barça in history is practically the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.100
 perfect career because from the child 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.240
 he who arrived when he was 17 years old was seated 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.400
 between figure guardiola to the locker room 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.690
 I was half scared to what it is now 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.950
 that goes with a big capital 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.050
 I hope that by raising a triplet 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.489
 having won everything by being better with 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.829
 more matches the more of the barça the game 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.480
 with more titles in the barça 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.390
 Messi has broken all records 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.409
 let's say singles and xavi I think that 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.210
 example I decided carlos resources at level 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:45.399
 of team the team game in that not 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.409
 there's none like him I think we'll see 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.000
 others like him we are talking about 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:50.019
 most important footballer in history 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.760
 of Spanish football 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.460
 I believe that Xavi has changed the story 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.869
 of football not only that of the club not only 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.449
 the Spanish football but also the 

00:00:55.869 --> 00:01:00.189
 of the world soccer to many included me 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.350
 It cost us to understand his game at 

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:03.879
 principle but but then it has 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.039
 proven that it has evolved 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.659
 football there are no players like him and 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:09.729
 what we put that is a player and 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.409
 replaceable big footballers that 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.700
 they have gone there has been 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.500
 people who have then returned to cover their 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.149
 space but I think by the 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.770
 characteristics of your game is going to be very 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.310
 difficult not to say impossible to find 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.930
 another xavi 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.939
 and say that is more questions 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.710
 difficult that can be done to a 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.990
 journalist value a figure as 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.240
 xavi hernández I think it's who has 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.720
 changed the recent history of this 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.579
 club 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.439
 everybody remembers figures like 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.700
 the guardiola the messi so 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.950
 surely he has had many more 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.720
 covers but the radical change that has 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.820
 experienced the boat in the last 15 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.039
 years could not be understood without the figure 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.990
 Xavi Hernandez tells you only that the 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.549
 importance of xavi in ​​the club of his 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.920
 loves that is the boat and that will follow 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.750
 being without doubt as xavi 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.340
 Hernandez I think that from today 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.619
 sets the tone for how it has to come 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.110
 the midfielder the way to do 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.869
 the soccer of the boat as he himself has 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.600
 said at a press conference people doubted 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.549
 he doubted his style in his way 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.740
 to do and he has consolidated it and to 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.000
 from now there is no doubt as to how 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.679
 xavi has made a career 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.549
 awesome to me is the best 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.680
 athlete of Catalan history I can 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.170
 say because he has got trophies has 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.390
 got titles with Spain and with the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.489
 barça and from here not only leaves a 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.530
 spectacular legacy but also me 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.970
 I think it marks a future that is what 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.560
 has to come because as he himself has 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.750
 said midfielder of the club has to 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.320
 understand the game of the barça we hope 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.239
 that with him as a reference man summary 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.799
 Xavi's career is impossible because 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.510
 we should be here days and days 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.239
 for me it is an unrepeatable burden 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.739
 unequaled incomparable and unsurpassed and 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.600
 I think he has directed the legendary barça 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.780
 with a huge mastery more can not be 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.550
 say to hernandez 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.050
 it does not look very original but it has been the 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.790
 Barça football is in the way of 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.590
 play to understand what is not necessary 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.530
 to run a lot does not need to dribble 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.020
 but often make the passes and 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.959
 especially knowing where to give the passes in 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.600
 that plays where the player over 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.760
 where is it interesting to move the team the barça 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.610
 is not to make 100 consecutive passes before 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.260
 to score a goal is to move 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.420
 rival team with the ball and so 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.330
 so much to see where the free space 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.830
 things that are very difficult to explain 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.140
 I hope that it makes them easy and that 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.150
 you know somehow intuitively said 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.790
 that the next video on the track would have 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.820
 that understand the football of the barca as 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.820
 understands better than anyone and this is the 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.040
 this vii will be irreplaceable for sure 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.010
 has made enjoy a lot and 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.650
 simply because grateful to what he has 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.750
 ported good football I think xavi 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.500
 means the best barca of the last 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.720
 years 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.760
 believe in a philosophy and have the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.530
 right player that is the DNA for 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.600
 play that way 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.420
 a player who feels the colors that 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.800
 He carries the shield in his heart a great 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.420
 footballer for me the best 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.459
 midfielder of the history of the club 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.410
 and that will be the symbol of the best 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.430
 years of its history 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.860
 I believe that xavi is the structure is a 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.420
 base a foundation if messi is the icing 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.700
 he's the guy who makes the difference 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.050
 you know playing more influential and more than 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.510
 more impacts on a football game than 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.310
 I've never seen and I think I'll see in 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.010
 my life 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.780
 I think it's the barça and it's going to be very 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.389
 difficult not to say impossible to find 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.730
 one as the will to adapt a little 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.490
 the pieces that are there to see that are 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.540
 bring from outside to achieve an effect 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.409
 seemed like the one that affects that he 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.110
 administers a football match 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:40.249
 surely the most important player 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.619
 removing month and month and has given you the 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:44.809
 absolute greatness and has defined many 

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:47.689
 titles but it had stayed a bit 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:49.909
 what is the essence of the game and during 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:51.430
 a lot of time for many years I think 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:53.950
 What is it 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.920
 the most important player in history 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.290
 of the boat if we remove messi that is 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.450
 out of competition as the 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.300
 essence of barça in every way 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.610
 not only in the game that is easy to 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.230
 see him because his hand in the play picks up 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.510
 the essence of the barça model 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:14.020
 established since the 90s but 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.490
 also the being of the club to have the 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.190
 agent values that are formed at home 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.540
 what the club wants and when it has 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.700
 needy even if he says he does not follow 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.860
 firefighter when he has needed the club there 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:28.200
 He has had him to solve situations 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.200
 that could endanger the team
