00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.850
 it has good ergonomics 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.290
 but it is not exactly a mini to 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.009

 including the smart button on the 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.210

 are 8 gb for internal storage that 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.980
 You can earn more with 32gb card 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.800
 memory it is possible to move some 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.350
 applications for the micro sd card as 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.550
 games for example it has 3g connection 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.600
 wifi bluetooth gps plus sensor 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.520

 the rest are the same both leave the factory 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:21.789
 with android 4.4.2 we just tested the version 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.049
 1.2 gigahertz and its performance was 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.630
 amazing 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.920
 lg customized android with your 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.409
 standard interface 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.350
 the setup screen is separated in 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.469
 using applications 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.530
 open the screens easily 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:41.189
 gently play heavy games without 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.189
 problems 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.140
 and to put functions such as subtitle 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.390
 nokia world a new way of 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.689
 unlock the handset by touching the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.539
 screen can choose from 1 to 8 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:01.179
 touches which gives more than 65 thousand 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.490
 combinations you can put the code up 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.709
 with the screen off which is safer 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.840
 since nobody will see your password 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.250
 today 2 thousand and can also work as 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.340
 a remote control 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.459
 thanks to the mountain qik application gives to 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.340
 to set up dvds or blu ray tvs and not 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.500
 only from lg but from several manufacturers 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.160
 do not need internet since that's all 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.220
 via infrared 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.400
 the screen has 4.7 inches and resolution 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.360
 540 for 960 points 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.630
 the lcd technology is the same as the 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.090
 lg and the glass that protects the gorilla 2 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.549
 the images have bright colors and great 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.620
 response to the touch as well as not missing 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.989
 definition from different angles 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.079
 it also has radio receiver 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.389
 fm 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.739
 the camera takes pictures at 8 megapixels and 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.900
 full hd videos 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.700
 the quality of the images is good in 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.040
 well-lit environments 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.910
 in places with low light you can see 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.269
 noises 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.959
 it has manual focus adjustment iso brightness 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.980
 shot by you hdr timer and 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.319
 panorama 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.099
 videos also look good in 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.900
 with much light but lacking stabilization gives 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.359
 to take pictures while recording 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.180
 video and pause recording and continue 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.790
 in the same file the front camera does 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.470
 1 megapixel photos and HD videos 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.200
 is enough for video calls 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:36.040
 the battery the highlight of the g2 mini she has 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.169
 capacity of 2,370 my perez above the 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.769
 average for smartphones with this screen 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.290
 size 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.810
 we use our pattern by taking the 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.419
 outlet at eight in the morning and at 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.609
 half past seven at night he had 44% 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:51.190
 using the appliance only for 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:54.209
 common tasks you can use it for 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:58.270
 more than one day without recharging 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:01.030
 the lg two mini has a screen of 4.7 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.880
 inches and bears the mini name for being 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.310
 physically similar to your g2 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.709
 configuration is not top-of-the-line but 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.260
 performance of the not-call feature of 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.390
 helps in productivity in security 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.099
 battery life another highlight since 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.950
 the appliance will last more than a day without 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.650
 recharge with the camera is only medium 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.410
 with good images only with lots of light 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.660
 and lack of stabilization for videos and 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.600
 8 GB of storage can be 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.340
 Insufficient to Install Applications
