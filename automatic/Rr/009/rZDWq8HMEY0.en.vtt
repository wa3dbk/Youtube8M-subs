gonna<00:01:24.180> work<00:01:24.270> really<00:01:25.850> it<00:01:26.850> worked<00:01:27.150> every<00:01:27.750> time

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
gonna work really it worked every time

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.200 
gonna work really it worked every time
before<00:01:28.410> but<00:01:28.440> all<00:01:29.190> of<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.460> sudden<00:01:29.760> now<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.060> not

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
before but all of a sudden now is not

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.350 
before but all of a sudden now is not
going<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.450> work<00:01:31.250> okay<00:01:32.250> well<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.640> guess<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.150> is

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
going to work okay well I guess this is

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.730 
going to work okay well I guess this is
probably<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.780> pretty<00:01:33.900> good<00:01:34.110> chance<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.530> show

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
probably a pretty good chance to show

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.690 
probably a pretty good chance to show
you<00:01:34.880> how<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.120> works<00:01:37.370> it<00:01:38.370> uses<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.910> a<00:01:40.700> mod

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
you how this works it uses a a mod

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.140 
you how this works it uses a a mod
called<00:01:42.590> well<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:43.740> basically<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.220> floodgate

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
called well it's basically a floodgate

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.350 
called well it's basically a floodgate
mod<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.920> origami<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.369> link<00:01:48.000> will<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
mod I origami the link will be in the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.240 
mod I origami the link will be in the
description<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:49.380> one<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.650> those<00:01:49.740> mini<00:01:49.979> mods

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
description it's one of those mini mods

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.070 
description it's one of those mini mods
and<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.750> what<00:01:51.900> it<00:01:51.930> looks<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:53.660> so<00:01:54.660> let<00:01:55.050> me

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
and this is what it looks like so let me

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.600 
and this is what it looks like so let me
take<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.500> switch<00:01:55.800> up<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:58.920> basically<00:01:59.340> you

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
take this switch up so basically you

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.730 
take this switch up so basically you
just<00:01:59.640> connect<00:02:00.119> redstone<00:02:00.690> to<00:02:01.050> the<00:02:01.350> control

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
just connect redstone to the control

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.520 
just connect redstone to the control
block<00:02:02.450> you<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.630> change<00:02:03.930> what<00:02:04.170> they<00:02:04.290> look<00:02:04.500> like

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
block you can change what they look like

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.090 
block you can change what they look like
so<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.550> can<00:02:05.880> change<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.450> M<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:07.110> control<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.890> to

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
so I can change the M the control and to

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.520 
so I can change the M the control and to
stone<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.959> gate<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.380> dirt<00:02:10.790> or<00:02:12.530> whatever

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
stone and the gate it's dirt or whatever

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.920 
stone and the gate it's dirt or whatever
whatever<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.190> want<00:02:16.520> but<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:18.420> just<00:02:18.600> connect

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
whatever I want but you just connect

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:30.080 
whatever I want but you just connect
some<00:02:19.050> redstone<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:23.180> oops<00:02:28.519> and<00:02:29.519> you<00:02:29.940> can

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
some redstone to it oops and you can

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.060 
some redstone to it oops and you can
flip<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.420> switch<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.260> gate<00:02:31.739> goes<00:02:31.950> away

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
flip the switch and the gate goes away

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.140 
flip the switch and the gate goes away
and<00:02:33.060> then<00:02:33.480> your<00:02:33.810> lava<00:02:34.019> should<00:02:34.320> come<00:02:34.500> out<00:02:35.150> and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
and then your lava should come out and

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.050 
and then your lava should come out and
it's<00:02:36.420> actually<00:02:36.630> going<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.930> work<00:02:36.989> this<00:02:37.200> time

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
it's actually going to work this time

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.140 
it's actually going to work this time
hopefully<00:02:39.060> yeah<00:02:39.780> there<00:02:40.049> there<00:02:40.470> goes<00:02:41.150> so

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
hopefully yeah there there goes so

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.880 
hopefully yeah there there goes so
that's<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.540> hot<00:02:42.750> water<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:46.470> cold<00:02:46.709> water

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
that's the hot water and the cold water

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.830 
that's the hot water and the cold water
works<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.519> same<00:02:47.549> it's<00:02:47.970> just<00:02:48.030> on<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.570> opposite

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
works the same it's just on the opposite

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.830 
works the same it's just on the opposite
side<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.850> if<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:50.970> mix<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.330> two<00:02:51.480> in<00:02:51.660> there

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
side and if you mix the two in there

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.289 
side and if you mix the two in there
it'll<00:02:52.350> make<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.790> cobblestone<00:02:53.790> block<00:02:54.090> right

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
it'll make a cobblestone block right

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.340 
it'll make a cobblestone block right
there<00:02:55.700> but<00:02:56.700> thanks<00:02:57.630> for<00:02:57.750> watching<00:02:57.989> I'll<00:02:58.200> put
