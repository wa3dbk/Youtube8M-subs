00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.719
 It is a few works of it shopman in the future 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.230
 But this is the third win in g1 following the January-September period 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:12.609
 Showed it 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:17.189
 As a public school follow-up to Grip, but at the recovery plant 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.859
 Do 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.199
 Why 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.019
 When not connected 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.230
 I wonder if that was all the time 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.339
 Male formally 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.890
 It is a handle part 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.890
 Such an expression as father 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.440
 After this 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.730
 It is as one, but it is natural liquor to see in Japan 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.150
 Offer 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.100
 There is no design of the handle part 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.100
 Then depart 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.290
 Losing the political appearance of something 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.640
 Mr. Borgerson 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.070
 It's pretty close to the 4 split ratio 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.620
 During recruitment 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.370
 This is a little over 300 for employment 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.370
 There was also a weight 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.440
 On the other hand 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.180
 This is something like this 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.150
 I think it's a really great response 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.000
 But as part of this, this will be mentioned later 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.810
 89th 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.430
 You're a medieval knight, right? 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.070
 If you put on the work afterward and throw it, more interesting pattern 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.780
 Although there was no construction height of the sponsor etc. 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.690
 Design Beijing Capital Airport 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.310
 Mrs. Secretary General 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.380
 Silver kanji and the return of the past 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.550
 It's a pleasure design 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.090
 Looking at it here, I think that this year's value would have been there since last month 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.509
 Tokochi language conversion 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.260
 Have western rights 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.470
 It is the fifth time, but drama 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.100
 What do you mean in Europe 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.100
 It may have been martial arts 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.580
 It is an honor 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.590
 After the last night's phone call, I became unemployed 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.850
 That's why there are 40 minds of Noel. 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.360
 If my snare's money is made, Ricin will build up 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.609
 Run but 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.869
 Mainly go to the parent and child countries of the end point of this gpu 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.939
 Because it is here, I like this one 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.659
 Original German 3 to 1 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.659
 It is close to the city that I want to be my sister 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.389
 It is a lie and my opinion 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.540
 Well, when you say this center of gravity, the whole of Mr. Naga 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.869
 Right from the middle 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:39.090
 To here 2.5% place 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.709
 2.5% 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.849
 Mr. Sun has the best time when entering 2.5% each and remains second only after 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.999
 At most 9% 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:52.450
 This is the same as 5% with chance children 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.339
 The middle is the limit 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:58.290
 It is in the middle of the one-on-one of the whole party who makes a heart out of mind from zero 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:59.849
 Then the whole 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:00.760
 Also the person 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.659
 2.5 times ideal or up to 5% 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.469
 Focused on knowing quickness 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.539
 After that, it will become the center of gravity rather completely, though 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.199
 That's the case 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.020
 After 19 days 130 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.349
 There is a city 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.349
 In such a long time, this is 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.230
 It is sent by the couple 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.379
 Kim major culture next 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.459
 It's because I never made a knife, right? 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:30.309
 It will be short and it will be difficult to throw him 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:33.039
 It was said that for example several of these about the central dragon 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.729
 Over 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.139
 When it is finished 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.029
 The ratio is close to Canadian open cultural property 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:40.349
 It was hard to throw 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.829
 Also in principle do not squeeze the national flag 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.299
 I argue that I want to go in the wind and there is not too much labor-management agreement 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.779
 Deployment center of gravity is the whole precursor- 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:53.570
 Bound around the middle 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.310
 9% behind the limit 25% behind 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:01.409
 The interval is good, but there is width of cartier though 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.040
 I think that it is fun to make on my feet that my experience foot 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.700
 But there is a subtle difference in the rate, but from this 0% 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:10.939
 From the middle 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.460
 Since it became 5% when it became 2.5% 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:21.690
 The middle of Europe and 2.5% 5% 6% 8% are totally different in crispy 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.379
 so 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:26.219
 After all, there is no Marx 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:29.279
 It looks like you haven't heard about it, so it's Yagai Nagai in an ordinary prevention incident 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.620
 At the same time, the eyes of Chinese people 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.919
 Found in this flow 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.379
 unexpectedly 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:01.379
 here 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.680
 Current events 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:46.409
 I feel like tomorrow 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.610
 Say to the mat 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.009
 Is it a strange tab once? 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:21.029
 Another three but 

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:23.089
 This is not a point of view 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:24.289
 Fast 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:27.289
 Can you do 1/4 rotation 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.290
 others
