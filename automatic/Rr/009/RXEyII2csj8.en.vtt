hello my name is Dean and today I'm

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.000 
hello my name is Dean and today I'm
going<00:00:11.330> to<00:00:11.389> talk<00:00:11.660> to<00:00:11.809> you<00:00:11.870> about<00:00:11.990> the<00:00:12.410> imprint

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
going to talk to you about the imprint

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.530 
going to talk to you about the imprint
first<00:00:13.280> shoe<00:00:13.629> the<00:00:14.629> imprint<00:00:14.990> first<00:00:15.230> shoe<00:00:15.500> is<00:00:15.830> a

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:16.540 
first shoe the imprint first shoe is a

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.179 
first shoe the imprint first shoe is a
fully<00:00:17.540> adjustable<00:00:17.960> plastic<00:00:18.500> heart<00:00:18.710> bass<00:00:18.920> shoe

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
fully adjustable plastic heart bass shoe

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.519 
fully adjustable plastic heart bass shoe
and<00:00:19.910> it's<00:00:20.180> made<00:00:20.420> from<00:00:20.630> a<00:00:20.779> low<00:00:21.080> melt<00:00:21.290> for

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
and it's made from a low melt for

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.280 
and it's made from a low melt for
plastic<00:00:22.189> which<00:00:22.759> means<00:00:23.060> at<00:00:23.570> a<00:00:23.630> relatively<00:00:24.110> low

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.290 
plastic which means at a relatively low

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.080 
plastic which means at a relatively low
temperature<00:00:24.500> it<00:00:24.949> becomes<00:00:25.039> malleable<00:00:25.730> and<00:00:26.029> can

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
temperature it becomes malleable and can

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.009 
temperature it becomes malleable and can
be<00:00:26.539> molded<00:00:26.990> onto<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.699> horse's<00:00:28.699> foot<00:00:28.910> and<00:00:29.330> what

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
be molded onto the horse's foot and what

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.290 
be molded onto the horse's foot and what
that<00:00:30.170> means<00:00:30.320> in<00:00:30.560> practice<00:00:31.070> is<00:00:31.340> that<00:00:31.730> can<00:00:32.090> place

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
that means in practice is that can place

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.540 
that means in practice is that can place
this<00:00:32.570> shoe<00:00:32.840> into<00:00:33.379> a<00:00:33.530> container<00:00:34.040> with<00:00:34.280> freshly

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
this shoe into a container with freshly

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.549 
this shoe into a container with freshly
bowled<00:00:34.879> water<00:00:35.180> and<00:00:35.600> there's<00:00:36.110> enough<00:00:36.320> heat

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
bowled water and there's enough heat

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.369 
bowled water and there's enough heat
transferred<00:00:37.129> from<00:00:37.340> that<00:00:37.580> boiled<00:00:38.269> water<00:00:38.420> to

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
transferred from that boiled water to

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.630 
transferred from that boiled water to
soften<00:00:39.769> and<00:00:40.160> make<00:00:40.909> the<00:00:41.059> shoe<00:00:41.269> malleable

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
soften and make the shoe malleable

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.579

whilst<00:00:43.640> that's<00:00:43.909> going<00:00:44.210> on<00:00:44.360> I<00:00:44.629> can<00:00:44.989> go<00:00:45.140> back<00:00:45.409> to

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
whilst that's going on I can go back to

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.130 
whilst that's going on I can go back to
the<00:00:45.739> thought<00:00:46.400> and<00:00:46.729> finish<00:00:47.330> the<00:00:47.479> preparation

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
their dorsal wall of the horses fault so

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.310 
their dorsal wall of the horses fault so
some<00:01:40.880> of<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:41.030> unique<00:01:41.360> features<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:41.990> sets

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
some of the unique features that sets

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.370 
some of the unique features that sets
this<00:01:42.590> shoe<00:01:43.010> apart<00:01:43.370> I<00:01:43.790> suppose<00:01:44.570> most<00:01:44.900> obviously

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
this shoe apart I suppose most obviously

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.940 
this shoe apart I suppose most obviously
firstly<00:01:46.190> is<00:01:46.370> that<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.970> shoe<00:01:47.180> is<00:01:47.330> glued<00:01:47.690> on

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
firstly is that the shoe is glued on

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.740 
firstly is that the shoe is glued on
it's<00:01:48.950> not<00:01:49.130> nailed<00:01:49.400> on<00:01:49.610> so<00:01:49.850> there<00:01:50.330> aren't<00:01:50.510> any

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
it's not nailed on so there aren't any

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.810 
it's not nailed on so there aren't any
of<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.930> associated<00:01:51.560> traumas<00:01:52.400> that<00:01:52.520> can<00:01:52.670> be

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
of the associated traumas that can be

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.060 
of the associated traumas that can be
involved<00:01:53.540> in<00:01:53.840> trying<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.229> nail<00:01:54.409> a<00:01:54.440> shoe<00:01:54.710> onto<00:01:54.890> a

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
involved in trying to nail a shoe onto a

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.240 
involved in trying to nail a shoe onto a
already<00:01:55.729> traumatized<00:01:56.420> foot<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.250> secondly

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
already traumatized foot and secondly

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.300 
already traumatized foot and secondly
the<00:01:58.970> plastic<00:01:59.390> that<00:01:59.540> is<00:01:59.630> made<00:01:59.870> from<00:02:00.140> is<00:02:00.409> similar

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
the plastic that is made from is similar

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.570 
the plastic that is made from is similar
in<00:02:01.490> physical<00:02:02.300> properties<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:02.990> hoof<00:02:03.580> the

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
in physical properties to hoof the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.660 
in physical properties to hoof the
imprint<00:02:04.940> hoof<00:02:05.150> repair<00:02:06.040> granules<00:02:07.040> can<00:02:07.280> be<00:02:07.400> used

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
imprint hoof repair granules can be used

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.850 
imprint hoof repair granules can be used
in<00:02:08.269> conjunction<00:02:08.629> with<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.289> imprint<00:02:09.530> first

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
in conjunction with the imprint first

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.190 
in conjunction with the imprint first
you<00:02:10.099> to<00:02:10.670> add<00:02:10.789> additional<00:02:10.819> plastic<00:02:11.569> where<00:02:12.049> it's

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
you to add additional plastic where it's

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.800 
you to add additional plastic where it's
needed<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:13.670> can<00:02:13.909> give<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.209> horse<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.629> foot
