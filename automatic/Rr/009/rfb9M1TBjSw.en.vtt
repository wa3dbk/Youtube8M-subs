00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.680 
long I'm trying to keep them really
short<00:00:05.490> because<00:00:05.640> it's<00:00:05.910> easier<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.299> upload<00:00:06.569> them

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
short because it's easier to upload them

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.900 
short because it's easier to upload them
that<00:00:06.839> way<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:07.529> being<00:00:07.740> said<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.370> wanted<00:00:08.790> to

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
that way that being said I wanted to

show you some Duane isms the best I can
I'm<00:00:12.090> not<00:00:12.330> saying<00:00:12.660> not<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:13.530> great<00:00:13.769> at<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.009> but

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
I'm not saying not that great at it but

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.370 
I'm not saying not that great at it but
I'm<00:00:15.450> showing<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.289> my<00:00:17.270> facsimile<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:19.289> he

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
I'm showing you my facsimile of so he

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.740 
I'm showing you my facsimile of so he
tuned<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.770> e<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:20.609> I'm<00:00:21.119> gonna<00:00:21.270> start<00:00:21.570> at<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
tuned to e so I'm gonna start at the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:44.529 
tuned to e so I'm gonna start at the
bottom<00:00:21.810> pulling<00:00:22.380> up

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.720 

so<00:00:45.539> basically<00:00:46.379> what<00:00:46.559> you're<00:00:46.679> doing<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:47.010> if<00:00:47.640> you

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
so basically what you're doing is if you

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.520 
so basically what you're doing is if you
can<00:00:47.850> imagine<00:00:47.940> if<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:48.809> planning<00:00:49.230> me<00:00:49.320> that's

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
can imagine if I was planning me that's

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
can imagine if I was planning me that's
the<00:00:49.680> sama

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the sama

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.880 
the sama
so<00:00:50.850> I've<00:00:50.940> tuned<00:00:51.179> the<00:00:51.300> G<00:00:51.539> up<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.350> steps<00:00:52.680> so

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
so I've tuned the G up I have steps so

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.459 
so I've tuned the G up I have steps so
that<00:00:53.070> would<00:00:53.219> be<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.670> G<00:00:53.909> sharp<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:55.140> tuned<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
that would be a G sharp and I tuned the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.149 
that would be a G sharp and I tuned the
a<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.940> whole<00:00:57.539> step<00:00:58.100> so<00:01:00.049> God<00:01:01.049> C<00:01:01.500> sharp<00:01:01.799> and<00:01:02.039> I

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
a up a whole step so God C sharp and I

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.270 
a up a whole step so God C sharp and I
tuned<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.519> D<00:01:02.760> up<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.289> whole<00:01:04.289> step<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.250> that

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
tuned the D up a whole step so that

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.469 
tuned the D up a whole step so that
would<00:01:05.880> be<00:01:06.119> F<00:01:07.049> sharp<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.940> think<00:01:08.940> if<00:01:09.149> I'm<00:01:09.299> wrong

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
would be F sharp I think if I'm wrong

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.320 
would be F sharp I think if I'm wrong
tell<00:01:09.840> me<00:01:09.990> people<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.890> go<00:01:11.100> back<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.820> add

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
tell me people I can go back and add

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.660 
tell me people I can go back and add
some<00:01:12.390> text<00:01:12.840> box<00:01:13.200> stuff<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.520> would

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
some text box stuff so so that would

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.559 
some text box stuff so so that would
basically<00:01:15.060> put<00:01:19.940> whatever<00:01:20.940> key<00:01:21.330> you're<00:01:21.539> in

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:21.569 
basically put whatever key you're in

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:23.450 
basically put whatever key you're in
still<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.350> go<00:01:22.500> off<00:01:22.679> of<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.009> from<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> top

still like you go off of it from the top

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.279 
still like you go off of it from the top
strings<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.090> make<00:01:24.270> sense<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.750> someone

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
strings that make sense like someone

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:26.480 
strings that make sense like someone
said<00:01:25.470> hey<00:01:25.590> we're<00:01:25.800> neat<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.100> know<00:01:26.130> your<00:01:26.340> top
