question to the redshirt concept is a

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.590

game<00:04:47.900> how<00:04:48.320> long<00:04:48.530> have<00:04:48.650> you<00:04:48.680> have<00:04:48.860> this<00:04:49.010> idea<00:04:49.130> so

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
game how long have you have this idea so

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.280 
game how long have you have this idea so
that<00:04:49.940> pass<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.330> idea<00:04:50.600> actually<00:04:50.840> came<00:04:51.080> from

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
that pass the idea actually came from

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.250 
that pass the idea actually came from
Cliffs<00:04:51.919> key<00:04:52.419> so<00:04:53.419> some<00:04:53.840> of<00:04:53.870> you<00:04:54.050> might<00:04:54.200> be

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:15.329 
simulation game without so any theme or

00:05:15.329 --> 00:05:18.499 
simulation game without so any theme or
anything<00:05:15.859> and<00:05:16.859> he<00:05:17.309> told<00:05:17.519> me<00:05:17.669> about<00:05:17.879> the<00:05:18.029> idea

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
anything and he told me about the idea

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.749 
anything and he told me about the idea
it<00:05:18.719> had<00:05:18.989> all<00:05:19.379> sort<00:05:19.619> of<00:05:19.649> doing<00:05:19.859> another<00:05:20.249> kudos

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
it had all sort of doing another kudos

it had all sort of doing another kudos
desk<00:05:20.969> game<00:05:21.209> but<00:05:21.629> set<00:05:21.989> to<00:05:22.409> in<00:05:22.919> space<00:05:23.309> with<00:05:23.549> like

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
desk game but set to in space with like

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.299 
desk game but set to in space with like
a<00:05:23.699> whole<00:05:23.909> sci-fi<00:05:24.359> skin<00:05:24.659> going<00:05:24.929> on<00:05:25.309> because

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:26.309 
a whole sci-fi skin going on because

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:29.059 
a whole sci-fi skin going on because
he's<00:05:26.459> a<00:05:26.489> massive<00:05:27.089> Trek<00:05:27.269> fan<00:05:27.509> and<00:05:27.779> and<00:05:28.649> I<00:05:28.769> was

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
he's a massive Trek fan and and I was

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:32.539 
he's a massive Trek fan and and I was
like<00:05:29.819> so<00:05:30.119> am<00:05:30.239> i<00:05:30.359> and<00:05:30.779> so<00:05:31.259> he<00:05:31.559> suggested<00:05:31.799> sort<00:05:32.489> of

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:32.549 
like so am i and so he suggested sort of

00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:33.879 
like so am i and so he suggested sort of
maybe<00:05:32.699> merging<00:05:33.119> the<00:05:33.209> concepts<00:05:33.569> together

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
maybe merging the concepts together

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.009 
maybe merging the concepts together
taking<00:05:34.889> my<00:05:35.009> idea<00:05:35.309> and<00:05:35.549> setting<00:05:36.119> it<00:05:36.239> in<00:05:36.419> space

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:37.019 
taking my idea and setting it in space

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:40.579 
taking my idea and setting it in space
and<00:05:37.409> I<00:05:38.189> was<00:05:38.369> like<00:05:38.519> oh<00:05:38.759> my<00:05:39.149> god<00:05:39.329> I<00:05:39.359> love<00:05:39.629> space<00:05:39.869> so

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:40.589 
and I was like oh my god I love space so

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:43.309 
and I was like oh my god I love space so
that's<00:05:41.099> how<00:05:41.219> it<00:05:41.339> started<00:05:41.959> what<00:05:42.959> do<00:05:43.079> you<00:05:43.109> want

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:43.319 
that's how it started what do you want

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:45.649 
that's how it started what do you want
players<00:05:43.529> to<00:05:43.709> feel<00:05:44.129> is<00:05:44.489> the<00:05:44.849> redeeming<00:05:45.269> feature

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
players to feel is the redeeming feature

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:47.839 
players to feel is the redeeming feature
that<00:05:45.989> makes<00:05:46.139> red<00:05:46.409> shine<00:05:46.979> more<00:05:47.309> than<00:05:47.489> any<00:05:47.699> other

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
that makes red shine more than any other

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:51.139 
that makes red shine more than any other
games<00:05:48.119> on<00:05:48.329> the<00:05:48.419> scene<00:05:48.629> I<00:05:49.519> think<00:05:50.519> the<00:05:50.729> the

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:51.149 
games on the scene I think the the

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:53.109 
games on the scene I think the the
social<00:05:51.449> simulation<00:05:51.929> stuff<00:05:52.229> is<00:05:52.529> pretty<00:05:52.739> cool

00:05:53.109 --> 00:05:53.119 
social simulation stuff is pretty cool

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:58.489 
social simulation stuff is pretty cool

from massive nerdy point to you there

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:00.979 
from massive nerdy point to you there
are<00:05:58.619> many<00:05:59.369> games<00:05:59.669> which<00:06:00.029> art<00:06:00.299> of<00:06:00.479> doing<00:06:00.839> things

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:00.989 
are many games which art of doing things

00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:02.659 
are many games which art of doing things
like<00:06:01.169> that<00:06:01.349> especially<00:06:01.589> sort<00:06:02.129> of<00:06:02.219> setting<00:06:02.549> it

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
like that especially sort of setting it

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.809 
like that especially sort of setting it
on<00:06:02.789> a<00:06:02.849> social<00:06:03.359> network<00:06:03.829> I<00:06:04.829> mean<00:06:05.610> so

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 
on a social network I mean so

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:08.149 
on a social network I mean so
essentially<00:06:06.360> it's<00:06:06.689> a<00:06:07.349> sandbox<00:06:07.860> for<00:06:08.099> the

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159 
essentially it's a sandbox for the

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.210 
essentially it's a sandbox for the
player

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
player

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.160 
player
probably<00:06:10.030> go<00:06:10.240> think<00:06:10.480> is<00:06:10.630> a<00:06:10.660> good<00:06:10.810> recent

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170 
probably go think is a good recent

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.890 
probably go think is a good recent
example<00:06:11.620> of<00:06:11.830> a<00:06:11.950> game<00:06:12.100> which<00:06:12.490> is<00:06:12.520> like<00:06:13.480> a<00:06:13.510> social

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
example of a game which is like a social

simulation game that yeah in a nerdy way
things<00:06:18.190> that<00:06:18.310> I'm<00:06:18.730> most<00:06:18.790> excited<00:06:19.240> about<00:06:19.600> about

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
things that I'm most excited about about

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.710 
things that I'm most excited about about
the<00:06:20.140> game<00:06:20.320> is<00:06:20.740> is<00:06:21.550> that<00:06:22.000> the<00:06:22.360> social

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
the game is is that the social

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.500 
the game is is that the social
simulation<00:06:23.200> stuff<00:06:24.060> the<00:06:25.060> other<00:06:25.240> thing<00:06:25.480> that

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
simulation stuff the other thing that

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.630 
simulation stuff the other thing that
shines<00:06:25.990> about<00:06:26.260> the<00:06:26.380> game<00:06:26.530> again<00:06:26.980> dinner<00:06:27.310> sort
