00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.160

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.740
 today is in the order of departure a month earlier had been intercepted 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.360
 it took several to the recording studio I receive a lot of data from 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.340
 different escape routes it seems that the study is our last chance and 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.360
 has pierced 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.740
 if he manages to leave 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.980
 the obligation disappears 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.980
 we can not allow that 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.200
 third at a level 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 it is not mandatory for vests 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.810
 it will not be easy 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:26.929

 copy for distribution May 1, 2006 takes 4 citizens of the world 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.379
 this indicated safe and sound and closer to whatever 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:42.559
 we can not endanger the lives of soldiers 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:44.549
 the works 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.549

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.990
 you just wrote with gold letters on the new page of the felines 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.990
 the history 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:36.849
 the leader in health 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.400
