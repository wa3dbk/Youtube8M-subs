staying on the strip so that's the first

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.249 
staying on the strip so that's the first
thing<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.850> would<00:01:18.030> recommend<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.080> can

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
thing I would recommend is that you can

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.830 
thing I would recommend is that you can
save<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> lot<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.189> money<00:01:20.460> by<00:01:21.119> actually<00:01:21.540> staying

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
save a lot of money by actually staying

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.179 
save a lot of money by actually staying
on<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.200> strip

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
on the strip

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.580 
on the strip
the<00:01:24.179> other<00:01:24.329> thing<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.719> if<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.109> use<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the other thing is that if you use the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.309 
the other thing is that if you use the
secrets<00:01:26.039> as<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.520> teach<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.149> you'll<00:01:27.749> be<00:01:27.899> able<00:01:28.079> to

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
secrets as I teach you you'll be able to

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:31.700

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
get fantastic upgrades now the last time

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.480 
get fantastic upgrades now the last time
I<00:01:31.920> stayed

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
I stayed

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.899 
I stayed
I<00:01:32.520> paid<00:01:33.170> $79<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> night<00:01:34.469> but<00:01:35.009> was<00:01:35.159> upgraded<00:01:35.880> to

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
I paid $79 a night but was upgraded to

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.300 
I paid $79 a night but was upgraded to
one<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.509> suites<00:01:36.869> which<00:01:37.439> up<00:01:37.619> goes<00:01:37.859> for<00:01:38.130> like

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
one of the suites which up goes for like

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.929 
one of the suites which up goes for like
I<00:01:38.579> think<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.770> 219<00:01:40.770> dollars<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.219> night<00:01:41.310> so

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
I think it's 219 dollars a night so

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.240 
I think it's 219 dollars a night so
that's<00:01:42.119> an<00:01:42.240> instant<00:01:42.780> saving<00:01:43.140> there<00:01:43.319> and<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
that's an instant saving there and I

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.760 
that's an instant saving there and I
save<00:01:44.549> more<00:01:44.789> than<00:01:44.819> the<00:01:45.060> cost<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.569> DVD<00:01:46.109> but

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
save more than the cost of the DVD but

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.889 
save more than the cost of the DVD but
the<00:01:46.920> best<00:01:47.219> thing<00:01:47.459> is<00:01:47.490> I've<00:01:47.789> reused<00:01:48.659> these

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
the best thing is I've reused these

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.490 
the best thing is I've reused these
again<00:01:49.469> and<00:01:49.709> again<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.729> again<00:01:51.599> and<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.319> has

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
again and again and again and this has

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.039 
again and again and again and this has
enabled<00:01:52.619> me<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.219> have<00:01:53.789> fantastic<00:01:54.420> holidays
