00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
pain wise for me I thought it was

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.950

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
bad it was a little bit bearable but it

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.889 
bad it was a little bit bearable but it
felt<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.490> he<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:56.820> scaffolding<00:01:57.390> into<00:01:57.540> my<00:01:57.659> leg

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.990 
of those are important values in my life
and<00:04:33.550> then<00:04:34.120> this<00:04:34.449> is<00:04:34.750> all<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.350> so<00:04:35.560> these<00:04:36.340> this

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
and then this is all and so these this

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.900 
and then this is all and so these this
whole<00:04:37.180> touchy<00:04:37.539> pretty<00:04:37.870> much<00:04:38.050> means<00:04:38.949> that<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.430> am

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
whole touchy pretty much means that I am

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.550 
whole touchy pretty much means that I am
the<00:04:40.030> only<00:04:40.270> person<00:04:40.360> that<00:04:40.780> has<00:04:40.810> control<00:04:41.229> over<00:04:41.259> my

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
the only person that has control over my

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.379 
the only person that has control over my
life<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.860> no<00:04:41.979> one<00:04:42.009> else<00:04:42.250> has<00:04:42.460> control<00:04:43.090> over<00:04:43.120> my

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
life and no one else has control over my

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.270 
life and no one else has control over my
life<00:04:43.419> so<00:04:43.960> I'm<00:04:44.229> the<00:04:44.500> one<00:04:44.590> controlling<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:45.160> and

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
life so I'm the one controlling it and

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.159 
life so I'm the one controlling it and
then<00:04:46.240> as<00:04:46.810> for<00:04:47.289> the<00:04:47.560> shell<00:04:48.190> gas<00:04:48.960> symbol<00:04:49.960> the

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
then as for the shell gas symbol the

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.480 
then as for the shell gas symbol the
reason<00:04:50.410> I<00:04:50.470> put<00:04:50.680> that<00:04:50.860> there<00:04:51.039> is<00:04:51.160> because<00:04:51.250> when

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
reason I put that there is because when

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.620 
reason I put that there is because when
I<00:04:51.520> was<00:04:51.639> a<00:04:51.669> little<00:04:51.880> kid<00:04:52.060> I<00:04:52.120> always<00:04:52.360> used<00:04:52.600> to

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
I was a little kid I always used to

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.180 
I was a little kid I always used to
think<00:04:52.690> they<00:04:52.960> named<00:04:53.199> the<00:04:53.470> gas<00:04:53.650> station<00:04:54.039> after

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
think they named the gas station after

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.330 
think they named the gas station after
me<00:04:54.520> because<00:04:55.240> it<00:04:55.990> was<00:04:56.139> shell<00:04:56.620> but<00:04:57.070> I<00:04:57.160> thought

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
me because it was shell but I thought

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.040 
me because it was shell but I thought
they<00:04:57.460> just<00:04:57.490> accidentally<00:04:58.240> left<00:04:58.479> off<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:58.750> why

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
they just accidentally left off the why

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.080 
they just accidentally left off the why
