of<00:00:36.230> any<00:00:36.379> season<00:00:36.800> but<00:00:36.920> a<00:00:36.949> little<00:00:37.159> bit<00:00:37.250> different

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
of any season but a little bit different

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.759 
of any season but a little bit different
this<00:00:37.760> year<00:00:37.820> with<00:00:38.269> a<00:00:38.300> new<00:00:38.629> head<00:00:39.170> coach<00:00:39.199> and<00:00:39.559> Gary

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
this year with a new head coach and Gary

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:41.920 
this year with a new head coach and Gary
Anderson<00:00:39.829> yeah<00:00:40.460> there's<00:00:40.879> an<00:00:41.030> unknown<00:00:41.390> I<00:00:41.659> think

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
Anderson yeah there's an unknown I think

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.899 
Anderson yeah there's an unknown I think
there<00:00:42.050> would<00:00:42.199> be<00:00:42.229> and<00:00:42.620> it<00:00:43.010> probably<00:00:43.309> most

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:43.909 
there would be and it probably most

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:45.280 
there would be and it probably most
teams<00:00:44.180> across<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:44.629> country<00:00:44.960> there'd<00:00:45.140> be<00:00:45.260> a

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
teams across the country there'd be a

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.719 
teams across the country there'd be a
certain<00:00:45.620> level<00:00:45.800> of<00:00:46.040> unknown<00:00:46.399> but<00:00:46.489> I<00:00:46.579> think

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:46.729 
certain level of unknown but I think

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:49.090 
certain level of unknown but I think
there's<00:00:46.879> a<00:00:46.940> lot<00:00:47.149> of<00:00:47.180> intrigue<00:00:47.809> here<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:48.440> Gary

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
there's a lot of intrigue here and Gary

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.410 
there's a lot of intrigue here and Gary
Anderson<00:00:49.190> throughout<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:49.969> course<00:00:50.210> of<00:00:50.300> the

Anderson throughout the course of the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.790 
Anderson throughout the course of the
summer<00:00:50.570> probably<00:00:51.019> ever<00:00:51.140> since<00:00:51.320> it<00:00:51.469> got<00:00:51.589> here

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800

in late December is asked what would

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.689 
in late December is asked what would
define<00:00:54.259> a<00:00:54.290> good<00:00:54.559> season<00:00:54.830> I<00:00:55.070> always<00:00:55.250> liked<00:00:55.519> his

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
define a good season I always liked his

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.490 
define a good season I always liked his
answer<00:00:56.119> was<00:00:56.239> a<00:00:56.420> very<00:00:56.629> consistent<00:00:57.170> with<00:00:57.259> it<00:00:57.379> he

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
answer was a very consistent with it he

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.020 
answer was a very consistent with it he
wants<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.860> seniors<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:58.369> be<00:00:58.430> able<00:00:58.580> to<00:00:58.640> walk<00:00:58.759> out

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
wants the seniors to be able to walk out

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.850 
wants the seniors to be able to walk out
of<00:00:59.059> here<00:00:59.330> with<00:00:59.989> all<00:01:00.199> of<00:01:00.350> their<00:01:00.470> heads<00:01:00.680> held

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
of here with all of their heads held

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.259 
of here with all of their heads held
high<00:01:00.979> and<00:01:01.129> knowing<00:01:01.820> that<00:01:01.939> they<00:01:02.030> had<00:01:02.150> a<00:01:02.180> very

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
high and knowing that they had a very

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.840 
high and knowing that they had a very
good<00:01:02.479> experience<00:01:02.600> at<00:01:03.290> Wisconsin<00:01:03.920> but<00:01:04.369> maybe

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
good experience at Wisconsin but maybe

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.969 
good experience at Wisconsin but maybe
isn't<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:05.299> answer<00:01:05.570> that<00:01:05.930> every<00:01:06.229> fan<00:01:06.530> wants<00:01:06.799> to

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
isn't the answer that every fan wants to

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.740 
isn't the answer that every fan wants to
hear<00:01:07.189> you<00:01:07.220> want<00:01:07.520> to<00:01:07.579> say<00:01:07.729> championships<00:01:08.479> next

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
hear you want to say championships next

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.350 
hear you want to say championships next
number<00:01:08.990> of<00:01:09.229> wins<00:01:09.439> but<00:01:09.680> I<00:01:09.850> think<00:01:10.850> in<00:01:10.970> our<00:01:11.119> time

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
number of wins but I think in our time

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.270 
number of wins but I think in our time
to<00:01:11.479> get<00:01:11.630> to<00:01:11.750> know<00:01:11.780> him<00:01:12.020> he's<00:01:12.049> pretty<00:01:12.409> real<00:01:12.680> and

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
to get to know him he's pretty real and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.880 
to get to know him he's pretty real and
i<00:01:13.520> think<00:01:13.610> that's<00:01:14.030> that's<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:15.170> goal<00:01:15.409> that's<00:01:15.740> not

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
i think that's that's a goal that's not

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.020 
i think that's that's a goal that's not
a<00:01:15.920> bad<00:01:16.159> one<00:01:16.340> that's<00:01:16.490> not<00:01:16.610> a<00:01:16.640> bad<00:01:16.790> place<00:01:17.000> to

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
a bad one that's not a bad place to

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.880 
a bad one that's not a bad place to
start<00:01:17.180> to<00:01:17.479> be<00:01:17.570> able<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:17.780> say<00:01:17.930> your<00:01:18.110> seniors<00:01:18.500> you

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
start to be able to say your seniors you

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.550 
start to be able to say your seniors you
know<00:01:19.009> era<00:01:19.700> of<00:01:19.939> transition<00:01:20.750> can<00:01:21.140> still<00:01:21.409> walk

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
know era of transition can still walk

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.020 
know era of transition can still walk
out<00:01:21.799> of<00:01:21.829> here<00:01:22.040> feeling<00:01:22.670> pretty<00:01:22.759> good<00:01:22.970> about

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
out of here feeling pretty good about

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.540 
out of here feeling pretty good about
their<00:01:23.360> experiences<00:01:23.930> now<00:01:24.740> fair<00:01:24.979> or<00:01:25.070> foul<00:01:25.280> Bret

their experiences now fair or foul Bret

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.160 
their experiences now fair or foul Bret
Bielema<00:01:25.670> always<00:01:26.120> felt<00:01:26.330> that<00:01:26.420> this<00:01:26.690> team<00:01:26.960> had

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
Bielema always felt that this team had

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.960 
Bielema always felt that this team had
the<00:01:27.260> potential<00:01:27.590> be<00:01:27.830> one<00:01:27.979> of<00:01:28.070> his<00:01:28.159> very<00:01:28.340> finest

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
the potential be one of his very finest

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.969 
the potential be one of his very finest
teams<00:01:29.240> largely<00:01:29.900> due<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.229> all<00:01:30.440> that<00:01:30.620> experience

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
teams largely due to all that experience

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.670 
teams largely due to all that experience
all<00:01:31.370> those<00:01:31.550> seniors<00:01:32.030> so<00:01:32.780> maybe<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.200> parts<00:01:33.530> are

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
all those seniors so maybe the parts are

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.950 
all those seniors so maybe the parts are
here<00:01:33.830> it's<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:34.040> matter<00:01:34.250> of<00:01:34.400> identifying<00:01:35.180> and

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
here it's a matter of identifying and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.570 
here it's a matter of identifying and
getting<00:01:36.409> them<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:36.560> fall<00:01:36.830> into<00:01:37.010> place<00:01:37.190> yeah<00:01:37.549> i

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
getting them to fall into place yeah i

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.310 
getting them to fall into place yeah i
think<00:01:37.790> that<00:01:38.120> the<00:01:38.240> leadership<00:01:38.540> has<00:01:38.930> a<00:01:38.960> chance

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
think that the leadership has a chance

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.620 
think that the leadership has a chance
to<00:01:39.440> be<00:01:39.530> very<00:01:40.100> good<00:01:40.400> and<00:01:40.580> obviously<00:01:41.210> we<00:01:41.450> say

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
to be very good and obviously we say

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.030 
to be very good and obviously we say
that<00:01:41.810> from<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.049> outside<00:01:42.440> looking<00:01:42.470> in<00:01:42.979> but

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
that from the outside looking in but

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.590 
that from the outside looking in but
when<00:01:43.340> you<00:01:43.460> give<00:01:43.760> a<00:01:43.790> guy<00:01:44.000> like<00:01:44.030> her<00:01:44.360> Chris

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
when you give a guy like her Chris

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.539 
when you give a guy like her Chris
Borland<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:45.200> guy<00:01:45.530> like<00:01:45.740> Curt<00:01:45.979> Phillips<00:01:46.159> well

long<00:01:50.390> time<00:01:50.450> now<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.229> was<00:01:51.530> dealt<00:01:51.860> with<00:01:52.010> a<00:01:52.040> lot

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
long time now it was dealt with a lot

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.980 
long time now it was dealt with a lot
and<00:01:52.610> has<00:01:52.729> handled<00:01:53.119> everything<00:01:53.210> with<00:01:53.780> such

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
and has handled everything with such

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.620 
and has handled everything with such
class<00:01:54.640> those<00:01:55.640> are<00:01:55.729> just<00:01:55.820> couple<00:01:56.180> of<00:01:56.299> examples

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
class those are just couple of examples

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.780 
class those are just couple of examples
right<00:01:57.229> there<00:01:57.500> but<00:01:57.680> I<00:01:57.710> think<00:01:57.979> this<00:01:58.070> is<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.280> senior

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
right there but I think this is a senior

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.789 
right there but I think this is a senior
class<00:01:59.030> of<00:01:59.240> size<00:01:59.479> and<00:01:59.810> I<00:02:00.020> think<00:02:00.170> a<00:02:00.229> senior<00:02:00.560> class

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
class of size and I think a senior class

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.070 
class of size and I think a senior class
of<00:02:01.010> substance<00:02:01.580> and<00:02:02.390> there<00:02:02.630> are<00:02:02.720> question

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
of substance and there are question

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.810 
of substance and there are question
marks<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.439> be<00:02:03.560> sure<00:02:03.799> but<00:02:04.130> when<00:02:04.490> you<00:02:04.580> feel

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
marks to be sure but when you feel

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.820 
marks to be sure but when you feel
pretty<00:02:05.090> good<00:02:05.270> about<00:02:05.330> that<00:02:05.570> veteran<00:02:06.290> class<00:02:06.560> at

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
pretty good about that veteran class at

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.740 
pretty good about that veteran class at
senior<00:02:07.250> class<00:02:07.460> that<00:02:07.760> does<00:02:08.000> that<00:02:08.239> isn't<00:02:08.539> a<00:02:08.569> bad

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
senior class that does that isn't a bad

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.630

at<00:04:29.699> least<00:04:30.699> to<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:30.909> potential<00:04:31.240> of<00:04:31.720> that<00:04:31.870> front

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
at least to the potential of that front

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.500 
at least to the potential of that front
seven<00:04:32.620> but<00:04:33.520> certainly<00:04:33.849> some<00:04:34.090> position

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
seven but certainly some position

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.839 
seven but certainly some position
battles<00:04:34.840> to<00:04:35.050> be<00:04:35.889> waged<00:04:36.159> here<00:04:36.580> in<00:04:36.699> that

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.240 
battles to be waged here in that

that'll<00:04:41.320> be<00:04:41.380> an<00:04:41.469> area

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
that'll be an area

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.270 
that'll be an area
I<00:04:42.110> was<00:04:42.500> pretty<00:04:42.650> impressed<00:04:42.800> with<00:04:43.009> Gary

Anderson in chicago two big 1080 of days

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.050 
Anderson in chicago two big 1080 of days
he<00:04:45.379> didn't<00:04:45.620> resist<00:04:45.710> when<00:04:46.340> asked<00:04:46.639> about<00:04:46.669> Chris

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
he didn't resist when asked about Chris

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.730 
he didn't resist when asked about Chris
Borland<00:04:47.300> probably<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:47.990> best<00:04:48.169> linebacker<00:04:48.560> in

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
Borland probably the best linebacker in

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.619 
Borland probably the best linebacker in
the<00:04:48.770> country<00:04:48.830> and<00:04:49.400> he<00:04:49.580> said<00:04:49.849> that<00:04:49.879> he<00:04:50.060> did<00:04:50.360> yeah

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:50.629 
the country and he said that he did yeah

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:52.180 
the country and he said that he did yeah
I<00:04:50.659> think<00:04:50.930> that<00:04:51.259> that<00:04:51.289> may<00:04:51.590> have<00:04:51.710> turned<00:04:51.860> a<00:04:52.009> few

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
I think that that may have turned a few

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.320 
I think that that may have turned a few
heads<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:52.610> people<00:04:52.849> and<00:04:52.970> I<00:04:53.000> think<00:04:53.030> of<00:04:53.210> this

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
heads and people and I think of this

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.730 
heads and people and I think of this
