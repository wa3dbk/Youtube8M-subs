00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.290 
expect to be able to actually make it
through<00:02:03.960> this

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
through this

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.620 
through this
the<00:02:05.930> way<00:02:06.080> that<00:02:06.260> it<00:02:06.380> did<00:02:07.420> considering<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:08.450> it

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
the way that it did considering that it

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.550 
the way that it did considering that it
was<00:02:08.720> six<00:02:08.960> in<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.170> morning<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:11.080> my<00:02:12.080> last<00:02:12.320> few

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
strength after those five doubles did a

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.270 
strength after those five doubles did a
set<00:02:42.380> of<00:02:42.590> five<00:02:43.040> here<00:02:43.670> of<00:02:44.110> 615<00:02:45.110> so<00:02:45.470> my<00:02:45.740> sixth<00:02:46.070> set

was<00:02:46.490> that<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:46.910> five<00:02:47.350> after<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.620> no<00:02:48.770> belts<00:02:49.100> ads

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
was that a five after the no belts ads

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.430 
was that a five after the no belts ads
after<00:02:49.520> the<00:02:49.760> hook<00:02:49.910> grip<00:02:50.090> sets<00:02:50.420> there's<00:02:51.230> about

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
after the hook grip sets there's about

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.790 
after the hook grip sets there's about
five<00:02:51.740> put<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.760> down<00:02:52.940> gave<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.900> tug<00:02:54.140> on<00:02:54.230> six<00:02:54.560> and

five put it down gave a tug on six and

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.500 
five put it down gave a tug on six and
just<00:02:54.950> kind<00:02:55.130> of<00:02:55.160> decided<00:02:55.520> not<00:02:56.090> worth<00:02:56.270> the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
just kind of decided not worth the

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.060 
just kind of decided not worth the
effort<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:57.020> it<00:02:57.110> was<00:02:57.230> going<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.590> take<00:02:57.770> to<00:02:57.980> get

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
effort that it was going to take to get

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.340 
effort that it was going to take to get
that<00:02:58.250> up<00:02:58.460> and<00:02:58.700> possibly<00:02:59.690> put<00:02:59.930> myself<00:03:00.050> out<00:03:00.290> of

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
that up and possibly put myself out of

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.110 
that up and possibly put myself out of
position<00:03:00.530> plus<00:03:01.010> I<00:03:01.190> was<00:03:01.310> running<00:03:01.700> short<00:03:01.970> on

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
position plus I was running short on

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.600 
position plus I was running short on
time<00:03:02.180> because<00:03:02.750> like<00:03:03.320> I<00:03:03.410> said<00:03:03.470> Jim<00:03:04.190> opened<00:03:04.340> at

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
time because like I said Jim opened at

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.600 
time because like I said Jim opened at
six<00:03:04.880> training<00:03:05.870> starts<00:03:05.990> at<00:03:06.290> eight<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.580> I

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
six training starts at eight and so I

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.370

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
triceps are pretty developed considering

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.530 
triceps are pretty developed considering
how<00:03:32.480> small<00:03:32.540> my<00:03:33.170> arms<00:03:33.470> are<00:03:33.680> but<00:03:34.640> my<00:03:35.060> shoulders

are<00:03:35.780> still<00:03:36.230> weakness<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:36.980> so<00:03:37.430> I'm<00:03:38.239> just

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
are still weakness and so I'm just

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.880 
are still weakness and so I'm just
trying<00:03:38.750> to<00:03:38.810> hammer<00:03:38.959> those<00:03:39.230> I<00:03:39.470> through<00:03:39.739> this

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
little try set together and so I have

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.830 
little try set together and so I have
135<00:03:44.180> and<00:03:44.570> do<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.750> hand<00:03:45.080> clean<00:03:45.350> and<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:46.840> moderately

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
trying to keep these a little stricter

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.300 
trying to keep these a little stricter

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
but considering how beat up i was from

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.500 
but considering how beat up i was from
the<00:03:59.140> from<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.170> bench<00:04:00.410> Inge<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:00.739> then<00:04:00.860> from

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
the from the bench Inge and then from

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.460 
the from the bench Inge and then from
the<00:04:02.510> pressing<00:04:03.200> right<00:04:03.320> beforehand<00:04:03.950> I<00:04:04.340> would

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
the pressing right beforehand I would

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.680 
the pressing right beforehand I would
say

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
say

you know a little bit of a okay a lot of

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.370 
you know a little bit of a okay a lot of
bit<00:04:11.010> of<00:04:11.420> form<00:04:13.670> sacrifice<00:04:14.670> this<00:04:15.570> is<00:04:15.720> i'm<00:04:16.230> just

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
bit of form sacrifice this is i'm just

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.990 
bit of form sacrifice this is i'm just
getting<00:04:16.560> blood<00:04:16.739> flow<00:04:16.890> to<00:04:16.980> those<00:04:17.250> areas<00:04:17.670> and

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
getting blood flow to those areas and

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.580 
getting blood flow to those areas and
right<00:04:18.209> now<00:04:18.360> my<00:04:18.390> shoulders<00:04:18.870> are<00:04:19.080> on<00:04:19.110> fire<00:04:20.540> and<00:04:21.590> i

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
right now my shoulders are on fire and i

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.800 
right now my shoulders are on fire and i
probably<00:04:23.040> should<00:04:23.370> have<00:04:23.460> filmed<00:04:23.910> my<00:04:24.300> first<00:04:24.600> set

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
probably should have filmed my first set

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.330 
probably should have filmed my first set
of<00:04:24.840> these<00:04:25.110> because<00:04:25.500> this<00:04:25.650> was<00:04:25.830> not<00:04:25.980> my<00:04:26.160> first

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
of these because this was not my first

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.520 
of these because this was not my first
set<00:04:26.700> and<00:04:26.730> I<00:04:26.970> was<00:04:27.150> pretty<00:04:27.630> torched<00:04:28.170> by<00:04:28.350> this

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
set and I was pretty torched by this

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.460 
set and I was pretty torched by this
point<00:04:28.680> of<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.890> workout<00:04:30.320> considering<00:04:31.320> that<00:04:31.350> I

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
point of the workout considering that I

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.780 
point of the workout considering that I
fit<00:04:31.860> all<00:04:32.340> of<00:04:32.400> this<00:04:32.970> into<00:04:33.630> a<00:04:33.660> fairly<00:04:34.790> fairly

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
fit all of this into a fairly fairly

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.810 
fit all of this into a fairly fairly
narrow<00:04:36.120> time<00:04:36.450> frame<00:04:37.040> just<00:04:38.040> stressing<00:04:38.700> the

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
narrow time frame just stressing the

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.250 
narrow time frame just stressing the
whole<00:04:38.970> time<00:04:39.180> about<00:04:39.330> making<00:04:39.780> sure<00:04:39.840> i<00:04:39.990> could<00:04:40.170> get

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
whole time about making sure i could get

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.860 
whole time about making sure i could get
as<00:04:40.380> much<00:04:40.530> time<00:04:40.770> as<00:04:40.980> i<00:04:41.130> as<00:04:41.370> i<00:04:41.910> needed<00:04:42.360> to<00:04:42.570> to<00:04:42.720> have

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
as much time as i as i needed to to have

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.940 
as much time as i as i needed to to have
a<00:04:42.900> successful<00:04:43.140> workout<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:45.770> after<00:04:46.770> i<00:04:46.800> think

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
a successful workout and after i think

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.070 
a successful workout and after i think
about<00:04:47.310> three<00:04:47.580> or<00:04:47.610> four<00:04:47.700> sets<00:04:48.090> NOS<00:04:48.570> three<00:04:48.840> sets

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
about three or four sets NOS three sets

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.750 
about three or four sets NOS three sets
three<00:04:49.380> sets<00:04:49.620> of<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:50.040> little<00:04:50.490> try<00:04:50.760> set<00:04:51.060> I

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
three sets of the little try set I

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.070 
three sets of the little try set I
didn't<00:04:53.760> even<00:04:54.090> have<00:04:54.270> time<00:04:54.450> to<00:04:54.510> go<00:04:54.690> upstairs<00:04:54.900> and

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
didn't even have time to go upstairs and

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.720 
didn't even have time to go upstairs and
grab<00:04:55.260> one<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.620> ab<00:04:55.710> wheels<00:04:56.070> and<00:04:56.250> so<00:04:56.370> I<00:04:56.400> made

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
grab one of the ab wheels and so I made

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.530 
grab one of the ab wheels and so I made
do<00:04:57.540> with<00:04:57.570> what<00:04:57.690> I<00:04:57.870> had<00:04:58.080> here<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:58.740> I<00:04:59.700> was<00:05:00.150> doing

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
some of the things I'm going to be

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.420 
some of the things I'm going to be
adjusting<00:05:35.060> in<00:05:35.240> a<00:05:35.300> in<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.470> weeks<00:05:36.800> to<00:05:36.890> come<00:05:36.980> I

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.660 
adjusting in a in the weeks to come I
definitely<00:05:38.210> noticed<00:05:38.780> that<00:05:39.080> my<00:05:39.520> some<00:05:40.520> of<00:05:40.610> the

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 
definitely noticed that my some of the

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.460 
definitely noticed that my some of the
percentages<00:05:41.180> I<00:05:41.240> was<00:05:41.450> using<00:05:41.600> for<00:05:41.750> my<00:05:42.170> deadlift

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
percentages I was using for my deadlift

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.840 
percentages I was using for my deadlift
were<00:05:42.740> higher<00:05:43.370> than<00:05:43.400> I<00:05:43.880> need<00:05:44.480> to<00:05:44.630> be<00:05:44.720> using<00:05:45.850> you

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
were higher than I need to be using you

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.430 
were higher than I need to be using you
don't<00:05:47.060> always<00:05:47.240> need<00:05:47.450> to<00:05:47.570> be<00:05:47.600> maxing<00:05:48.080> out<00:05:48.200> you

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
don't always need to be maxing out you

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.260 
don't always need to be maxing out you
don't<00:05:48.560> always<00:05:48.740> need<00:05:48.950> to<00:05:49.010> be<00:05:49.130> working<00:05:49.400> at<00:05:49.940> the

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
don't always need to be working at the

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.340 
don't always need to be working at the
extreme<00:05:50.750> top<00:05:51.020> end<00:05:51.260> of<00:05:51.470> your<00:05:51.970> capability<00:05:52.970> to

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
extreme top end of your capability to

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.770 
extreme top end of your capability to
progress<00:05:54.350> in<00:05:54.710> fact<00:05:55.070> especially<00:05:56.000> looks<00:05:56.570> like

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
progress in fact especially looks like

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.960 
progress in fact especially looks like
deadlift<00:05:57.200> that<00:05:57.650> usually<00:05:58.100> ends<00:05:58.250> up<00:05:58.430> setting

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
deadlift that usually ends up setting

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.000 
deadlift that usually ends up setting
you<00:05:59.060> backwards<00:05:59.480> and<00:05:59.780> so<00:05:59.900> I'm<00:05:59.990> scaling<00:06:00.740> my

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
you backwards and so I'm scaling my

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.880 
you backwards and so I'm scaling my
deadlift<00:06:01.310> numbers<00:06:01.640> back<00:06:01.850> a<00:06:01.880> bit<00:06:02.710> back<00:06:03.710> to

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
deadlift numbers back a bit back to

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.600 
deadlift numbers back a bit back to
making<00:06:04.040> some<00:06:04.340> progress<00:06:04.850> on<00:06:05.240> it<00:06:05.450> and<00:06:06.610> then

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
making some progress on it and then

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.480 
making some progress on it and then
she's<00:06:07.910> going<00:06:08.090> really<00:06:08.390> well<00:06:08.740> squats<00:06:09.740> I<00:06:10.070> think

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
she's going really well squats I think

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.430 
she's going really well squats I think
once<00:06:10.670> I<00:06:10.820> figure<00:06:11.120> out<00:06:11.150> my<00:06:11.300> balance<00:06:11.780> point<00:06:12.050> my

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
once I figure out my balance point my

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.590 
once I figure out my balance point my
squats<00:06:12.740> are<00:06:12.920> feeling<00:06:13.280> great<00:06:13.490> and<00:06:13.760> I<00:06:14.000> am<00:06:14.060> ready

to<00:06:14.750> start<00:06:15.050> bringing<00:06:15.260> up<00:06:15.650> the<00:06:15.860> depth<00:06:16.070> a<00:06:16.220> little

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
to start bringing up the depth a little

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.640 
to start bringing up the depth a little
bit<00:06:16.610> I<00:06:17.240> hope<00:06:17.840> that<00:06:17.990> doesn't<00:06:18.110> break<00:06:18.410> any<00:06:18.440> hearts

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
bit I hope that doesn't break any hearts

the<00:06:20.810> super<00:06:21.140> deep<00:06:21.290> squats<00:06:21.650> but<00:06:22.900> ultimately<00:06:23.920> I'm

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920 
the super deep squats but ultimately I'm

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.800 
the super deep squats but ultimately I'm
going<00:06:25.220> for<00:06:25.400> a<00:06:25.430> total<00:06:25.760> right<00:06:25.910> now<00:06:26.090> that's<00:06:26.420> it's

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
going for a total right now that's it's

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.170 
going for a total right now that's it's
going<00:06:26.960> to<00:06:27.050> be<00:06:27.110> pretty<00:06:27.320> ridiculous<00:06:28.100> and<00:06:28.430> so<00:06:28.760> I

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
going to be pretty ridiculous and so I

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.490 
going to be pretty ridiculous and so I
need<00:06:29.900> to<00:06:30.170> make<00:06:30.710> sure<00:06:30.770> that<00:06:31.130> I'm<00:06:31.220> not<00:06:31.490> doing

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
need to make sure that I'm not doing

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.640 
need to make sure that I'm not doing
more<00:06:33.500> than<00:06:33.830> I<00:06:33.950> that<00:06:34.370> I<00:06:34.490> need<00:06:34.790> to<00:06:34.970> do<00:06:35.150> to<00:06:35.840> set<00:06:36.530> it

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
more than I that I need to do to set it

more than I that I need to do to set it
I'm<00:06:36.800> still<00:06:37.160> planning<00:06:37.400> on<00:06:37.580> setting<00:06:37.850> legit
