00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.510
 or the cats of youtube I am mister lion 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.700
 and today we will analyze a topic of 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.920
 steven the universe is a theory that 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.420
 says that jasper is a fusion and I will give my 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.880
 point of view and others 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.270
 before I start I want to send you a 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.250
 gta salute before and arturo flaky 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.200
 and I will remind you that I have a page 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.829
 facebook as always and I ask you to give 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.690
 like without further ado let's start four 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.110
 reasons why hasper is not a 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.210
 merger 1 what I have heard say that 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.250
 jasper is a merger because it is bigger 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.370
 that garnett and rose is also bigger 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.210
 that garnett and it's not a merger has 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.340
 I mean that the truth is not because it's like 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.320
 humans and animals is the same as 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.710
 say that a person for being tall is 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.480
 a merger 2 I've seen in the series that 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.250
 hasper says that mergers are a 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.710
 cheap tactic for the gems 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.530
 weaker are stronger that's because 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.540
 that hasper is a forced merger not 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.210
 have to see that there are people that you hate 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.530
 certain sports meals people and 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.229
 strategies 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.540
 but only because I hate hatred of 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.869
 mergers is enough to know about 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.180
 complaints but it's not a merger 3 I do not know 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.360
 who invented this theory but did not 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.369
 account of something very very fundamental but 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.159
 all mergers have a part 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.369
 extra body as the stick has 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.880
 four arms as garnett has three 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.909
 eyes like sardÃ³n and x has four eyes and 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.820
 arms like his gala and he has four 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.460
 arms and has five eyes like 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.740
 alexandrite has six arms eyes 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.920
 It can not be good but I guess notice 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.409
 He must have seven eyes and two mouths like 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.920
 Malachite has six arms and four 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.560
 eyes four you see what malachite does not have 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.110
 a very humanoid form and that what has 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.899
 what to see is an unstable merger if they have 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.300
 seen the fusion cuisine episode looks 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.600
 that alexandrita's face is disfigured 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.580
 that may be what happened with malachite 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.950
 but nothing is confirmed until 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.050
 rebecca sugar confirm everything 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.450
