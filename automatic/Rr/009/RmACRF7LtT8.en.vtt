00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
you see big you is aspect that there is

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.010 
you see big you is aspect that there is
no<00:01:54.630> confusion<00:01:55.340> because<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:56.609> accepting<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
no confusion because it's accepting you

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.270 
no confusion because it's accepting you

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
is the blue that the colorblind press

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.270 
is the blue that the colorblind press
receives<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.730> is<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.180> pink<00:02:41.420> marble<00:02:42.010> big<00:02:43.010> you

receives that is the pink marble big you

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.610 
receives that is the pink marble big you
shows<00:02:43.670> up<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.180> little<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.140> doesn't<00:02:45.530> know

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
shows up and little you doesn't know

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.070 
shows up and little you doesn't know
what<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:45.830> do<00:02:46.100> with<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:46.510> because<00:02:47.510> there's<00:02:47.870> no

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
what to do with that because there's no

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.470 
what to do with that because there's no
way<00:02:48.320> to<00:02:48.380> because<00:02:48.950> it<00:02:49.130> can't<00:02:49.430> there's<00:02:50.300> no<00:02:50.360> way

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
way to because it can't there's no way

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.060 
way to because it can't there's no way
of<00:02:50.690> fathoming<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.290> do<00:02:51.560> you<00:02:51.620> guys<00:02:51.680> understand

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
of fathoming it do you guys understand

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.550 
of fathoming it do you guys understand
what<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.220> fourth<00:02:52.459> dimension<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:53.290> yeah<00:02:54.290> sure

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
what the fourth dimension is yeah sure

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.699 
what the fourth dimension is yeah sure
it's<00:02:54.770> another<00:02:54.980> dimension<00:02:55.280> no<00:02:56.320> my<00:02:57.320> science

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
it's another dimension no my science

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.110 
it's another dimension no my science
teacher<00:02:57.830> best<00:02:58.310> explained<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.880> fourth

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
teacher best explained the fourth

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.360 
teacher best explained the fourth
dimension<00:02:59.270> to<00:02:59.630> me<00:02:59.720> one<00:02:59.900> time<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.110> I<00:03:00.320> got<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.740> ok

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
dimension to me one time and I got it ok

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.590 
dimension to me one time and I got it ok
I<00:03:01.400> don't<00:03:01.459> know<00:03:01.580> how<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:01.730> got<00:03:01.940> it<00:03:02.090> but<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.270> got<00:03:02.450> it

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
I don't know how I got it but I got it

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.690 
I don't know how I got it but I got it
we<00:03:03.470> know<00:03:03.650> three<00:03:03.950> dimension<00:03:04.400> what<00:03:04.550> does<00:03:04.640> that

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
we know three dimension what does that

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.580 
we know three dimension what does that
mean<00:03:04.910> two-dimensional<00:03:05.870> as<00:03:05.959> flat<00:03:06.260> three

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
mean two-dimensional as flat three

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.410 
mean two-dimensional as flat three
dimensional<00:03:07.040> is<00:03:07.250> with<00:03:07.730> all<00:03:07.970> these<00:03:08.120> shapes

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
dimensional is with all these shapes

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.600 
dimensional is with all these shapes
that<00:03:08.510> we<00:03:08.600> can<00:03:08.780> see<00:03:08.959> dimension<00:03:09.610> fourth

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
that we can see dimension fourth

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.449 
that we can see dimension fourth
dimension<00:03:11.120> we<00:03:11.480> can't<00:03:11.690> even<00:03:11.870> imagine<00:03:12.459> that's

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
dimension we can't even imagine that's

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.580 
dimension we can't even imagine that's
how<00:03:13.580> deep<00:03:13.760> it<00:03:13.910> is<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.570> can't<00:03:14.780> even<00:03:14.870> your<00:03:15.320> brain

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
how deep it is you can't even your brain

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.080 
how deep it is you can't even your brain
won't<00:03:15.739> even<00:03:15.920> understand<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:16.790> wrap<00:03:16.940> it

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
won't even understand it to wrap it

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.190 
won't even understand it to wrap it
around<00:03:17.180> it<00:03:17.450> because<00:03:17.510> you've<00:03:17.720> never<00:03:17.840> seen<00:03:18.080> it

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
around it because you've never seen it

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.690 
around it because you've never seen it
how<00:03:18.800> you<00:03:18.860> gonna<00:03:18.980> describe<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.430> me<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.640> I've

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.160 
described in best my science teacher
said<00:03:31.760> something<00:03:32.120> with<00:03:32.239> just<00:03:32.390> materialized<00:03:32.989> in

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
said something with just materialized in

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
said something with just materialized in
front<00:03:33.380> of<00:03:33.470> you<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:33.830> believe<00:03:34.010> where'd

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
front of you and you believe where'd

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.830 
front of you and you believe where'd
that<00:03:34.250> come<00:03:34.430> from<00:03:34.489> because<00:03:35.420> they<00:03:35.510> were<00:03:35.600> living

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
that come from because they were living

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.509 
that come from because they were living
in<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.110> fourth<00:03:36.290> dimension<00:03:36.350> it's<00:03:36.980> deep<00:03:37.250> it's

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
in the fourth dimension it's deep it's

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.310 
in the fourth dimension it's deep it's
much<00:03:37.700> deeper<00:03:37.910> than<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.269> at<00:03:38.390> that<00:03:38.450> time<00:03:38.720> but<00:03:39.200> the

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
much deeper than I at that time but the

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.769 
much deeper than I at that time but the
reality<00:03:39.739> is
