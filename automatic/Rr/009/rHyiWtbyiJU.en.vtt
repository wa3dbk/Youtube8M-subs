00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
and then once you've done that you can

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.490 
and then once you've done that you can
spin<00:01:31.430> see<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.759> by<00:01:32.909> doing<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:34.320> earn

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
spin see just by doing that I can earn

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.390 
spin see just by doing that I can earn
easily<00:01:34.860> five<00:01:35.250> hundred<00:01:36.020> TC<00:01:37.020> which<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.920> true

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
easily five hundred TC which is true

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.450 
easily five hundred TC which is true
cannot<00:01:39.030> buy<00:01:39.390> than<00:01:39.600> others

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
cannot buy than others

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.510 
cannot buy than others
look<00:01:41.460> that's<00:01:41.670> pretty<00:01:41.970> cool<00:01:42.920> but<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.250> quite

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
look that's pretty cool but it's quite

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.120 
look that's pretty cool but it's quite
hard<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:46.229> you're<00:01:46.439> near<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.890> game

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
hard to do so if you're near the game

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.789 
hard to do so if you're near the game
maybe<00:01:47.579> gonna<00:01:47.820> want<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.090> practice<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.630> little

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
maybe gonna want to practice a little

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:58.090 
maybe gonna want to practice a little
yeah

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:06.140 

 you<00:02:04.770> can<00:02:04.890> also<00:02:05.040> do<00:02:05.280> other<00:02:05.490> grinds<00:02:06.060> on

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
 you can also do other grinds on

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.850 
 you can also do other grinds on
that<00:02:06.360> because<00:02:06.960> they'll<00:02:07.140> set<00:02:07.440> your<00:02:07.590> score

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
that because they'll set your score

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.990 
that because they'll set your score
quite<00:02:08.160> hot<00:02:10.250> though<00:02:11.250> easy

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
quite hot though easy

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.500

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
and score once you'll see their upscale

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:48.550 
and score once you'll see their upscale

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
that way and if you can grind in see all

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.709 
that way and if you can grind in see all
