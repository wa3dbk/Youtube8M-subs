00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hello everyone 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.540
 you 're live with receipts in 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.049
 under health oms for a new 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.110
 tutorial 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.200
 so I'm going to show you how to dock 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.139
 people with a keylogger so a 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.270
 ko yor what is it an application 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.100
 that your victims raise and then 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.230
 all the information that teaches you 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.300
 on their computers will be sent 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.410
 in a text file that will be in 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.750
 your in your ftp to you so this fcp 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.700
 there we will create it worry and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.610
 so then these text files you 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.100
 will have all the coordinates of your 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.050
 line is so to start I you 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.719
 request and download it to that augur 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.280
 v2 rare item that is in the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.390
 description that the link is downloading for 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.149
 can be found in the description 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.190
 so actually extracting us from you 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.960
 extract this file there and you will see it 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.530
 so then you have your rigor 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.570
 so wait I delete some stuff 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.449
 it 's summer what I did before 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:09.299
 video to be able to have a nice video 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.990
 so I'm going to the video will split into 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.549
 three steps 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.000
 so first step we will find 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.830
 how to find a trick to be able to 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.940
 to gain trust with your victims 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.180
 and that they can launch 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.430
 the application and it's the hardest 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.369
 that's why I'm going to show you 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.659
 a trick linked with our chipsets 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.909
 because that's where there is more than 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.140
 colors but you can do it with 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.979
 any game so for that the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.080
 second part it's going to be the creation 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.509
 of the key logger and the third part that 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.460
 is going to be their voice when to go to 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.190
 all the people you 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.619
 infected so you double click 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.080
 on buy the heart so the room 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.880
 open a window 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.920
 so there you go back the formation of 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:03.409
 your stp so respect them 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.409
 we will create them here so you do 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.500
 www.dresser.com 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.200
 you create a free account so he goes 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.530
 ask your heart net your word 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.420
 like any other site 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.550
 so as soon as you have created this account 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.790
 when an fcp will be created automatically 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.290
 for you so if a fan of 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.770
 information from your ftp one is very 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.670
 simple so ftp point drive hq points 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:40.070
 as will be lost so the olap server 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.300
 connected to even use it's going to be him 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.710
 without even having you enter the 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.780
 site she does not want her passwords that 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.490
 you will have to enter the site 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.560
 [Music] 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.120
 I am all done and connections and there he 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.040
 will test the connection to find out if I 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.990
 did not make a mistake then that but 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.900
 you are has been complete below 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.600
 but it remains thick training bis 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.610
 okay so actually it happened 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.590
 correctly and the information that 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.270
 you have returned are correct so 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.850
 for we can start creating our 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.180
 our bodega augurs so there was created on 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.010
 butt wants him to show his failure so if 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.690
 you are on the scream with the train station so 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.060
 what it is handed but it's going to you 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:23.180
 create here is in 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.160
 other h record of the smell v2 and you 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:31.849
 will have an oath file so this server 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:34.489
 queue will serve it to kedgwick so what we 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.870
 is going to do is we will put in 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.220
 trust your victim 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.989
 we are going to pump the file so it's up to 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.810
 to say that we will add the size 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.940
 we want to make it look like 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.640
 the application we want to bend so 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.980
 auxi to highlight that you want 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.739
 make me a hero by the words that's 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.209
 more secure so I 'm not going to 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.250
 do it because it's a tutorial but 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.260
 you do as you want so here 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.900
 now what we will do is we 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.160
 will change the icon of your from your 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.989
 server file so that it looks like 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.880
 the application that you are going to copy so 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.440
 for that it's very simple you 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.120
 download the software resources at 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.769
 heart I will put you the link of 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.140
 download on my description 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.609
 also there it will be very very simple 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.900
 what we are going to do is that the size of 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.160
 rothen then we go in our files 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.919
 me I you the application red hot spots 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.140
 because it's the bot that I'm going 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.729
 use to why foot so that's it 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.710
 my asus a month that I selected 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.960
 but could do as you want 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.550
 so opened and there are several 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.680
 icon stuff so they have to do 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.930
 it's opening the nikon group 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.720
 we will open the dante file alas 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.090
 here you will have all the icons since 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.880
 the application does not use what I want 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.060
 to do is we will do so right and 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.740
 we're going to do syl icon buddy 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.500
 we will save it to attack me 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.639
 wars to do tutorial for me this 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.159
 will be later 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.680
 do you want to tutorial me feel 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.240
 French registered so here I 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.830
 the recorded now what are we going 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.370
 to do is how are we going to rot our 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.370
 fault server 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:15.050
 these farm bombs group nails his 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.280
 folder and there we see that the icons that 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.229
 is on our app 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.400
 so what we're going to do is we're going 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:27.560
 replace it so we will replace 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:29.720
 resources to number the icon we want 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.820
 it is this one recalling puzzled 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.560
 click on the arrows and it's ok 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:38.300
 replace automatically now 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:43.520
 does these deep friends make you save 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:45.979
 and then several files are going to be 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.750
 several folders china therefore creates the 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.450
 server file 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.070
 original and the one with the double icon 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.020
 schedule believe me to do will remove 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:58.520
 the old elm because it's useless 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.650
 milan and we shall renamed when I m 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.150
 [Music] 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.490
 my tip 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.460
 I will be the last version that 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.100
 one of them croatia 5-1 so here it is 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.590
 is going to be our notes that they the 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.990
 so do not keep how it will suffice 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.590
 very simply to send it to your 8th and 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:22.010
 then that victim double crack the 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:26.150
 sweat on the app 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:30.620
 so that's very simple the virus to 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:32.240
 nebek scans of 0 06 47 so one 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.290
 detected by the heart by stimulating life 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.050
 different 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:38.419
 so it's really one of the best 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.580
 who will tell me that some jets that gekko 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:41.900
 is new so when next for 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.790
 retrieve victim information 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.340
 it will be very simple we will 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:49.640
 connect in very thick the know either 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:52.090
 fast with a tiffany why bullpen 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.220
 tftp dapper at points like 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:57.410
 bertone identifier for me and then 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.060
 the password we were not crying that by 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.470
 a I have several pc that are created 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.860
 which as a sense the sizes are 2 0 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:05.360
 because I'm just from the east 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.230
 to inject them and as you go 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.420
 that they will go into 

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:12.920
 information you will have you will have 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.760
 the information they have they typed 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.810
 on their computer 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:20.930
 so that's a pretty short tutorial 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.850
 because it's pretty simple the software 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.320
 is very easy to use and 

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.980
 works very well 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:30.410
 I am quite satisfied so I have 

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:33.460
 finished for this tutorial I hope you 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.460
 you will have understood everything 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.310
 but the explanation is for all 

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:40.070
 question or additional information 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.530
 you'll eat to send them to me 

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:45.830
 by ip or email we mastered 

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:47.030
 mayila available and that's so I 

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:51.430
 wish you a very good day and 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.430
 then make yourself more
