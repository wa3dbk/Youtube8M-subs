cons so let me go ahead and do a little

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.410 
cons so let me go ahead and do a little
demo<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.360> what<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.630> do<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:26.400> take<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.910> open<00:02:27.300> it

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
demo so what I do is I take I open it

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.340 
demo so what I do is I take I open it
obviously<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.580> just<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.209> don't<00:02:30.989> know<00:02:31.170> if<00:02:31.290> I

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
obviously and I just I don't know if I

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.530 
obviously and I just I don't know if I
can<00:02:31.530> do<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:31.739> without<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.070> mirror<00:02:32.130> but<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.820> just

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
can do this without a mirror but I just

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.540 
can do this without a mirror but I just
set<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.840> down<00:02:33.870> like<00:02:34.350> just<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.950> way<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.280> in

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
set it down like just the way it is in

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.280 
set it down like just the way it is in
the<00:02:35.760> corner<00:02:36.150> just<00:02:37.670> set<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.790> down<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.330> then

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
the corner just set it down and then

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
the corner just set it down and then
start<00:02:40.700> drawing<00:02:41.700> my<00:02:41.760> line<00:02:42.090> towards<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:44.130> in

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
start drawing my line towards the in

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.840 
start drawing my line towards the in
inner<00:02:45.180> corner<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:48.090> there<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.110> go<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.800> as<00:02:50.700> you

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
inner corner so there you go and as you

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.729 
inner corner so there you go and as you
can<00:02:51.000> see<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.840> kind<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.170> hard<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.590> tricky

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
can see this is kind of hard and tricky

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.290 
can see this is kind of hard and tricky
without<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.130> mirror<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:53.670> bear<00:02:53.940> with<00:02:53.970> me

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
without a mirror so bear with me

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.410 
without a mirror so bear with me
but<00:02:54.810> um<00:02:55.110> let's<00:02:55.769> do<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.100> just<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.120> little<00:02:57.269> bit

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
but um let's do this just a little bit

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.890 
but um let's do this just a little bit
over<00:02:57.810> here<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.580> just<00:02:59.730> kind<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.330> set<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.690> down

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
over here so I just kind of set it down

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.050 
over here so I just kind of set it down
flat<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:02.400> then<00:03:03.269> draw<00:03:03.570> my<00:03:04.200> line<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:05.100> then<00:03:05.970> I

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
flat and then draw my line and then I

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:14.210 
flat and then draw my line and then I
just<00:03:06.239> fill<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.570> in<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:11.690> there<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.810> go<00:03:13.160> that<00:03:14.160> was

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
just fill it in so there you go that was

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.979 
just fill it in so there you go that was
quick<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.730> easy<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.299> let<00:03:15.390> me<00:03:15.480> try<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.720> do<00:03:15.900> the

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
quick and easy and let me try to do the

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.420 
quick and easy and let me try to do the
other<00:03:16.110> eye<00:03:16.290> it's<00:03:16.680> really<00:03:16.920> hard<00:03:17.160> without<00:03:17.310> a

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
other eye it's really hard without a

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.840 
other eye it's really hard without a
mirror<00:03:17.790> but<00:03:18.230> like<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.380> said<00:03:19.440> bear<00:03:20.280> with<00:03:20.459> me<00:03:20.610> so

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
mirror but like I said bear with me so

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.610 
mirror but like I said bear with me so
once<00:03:21.570> again<00:03:21.750> I'm<00:03:22.049> going<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.230> show<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:22.380> that<00:03:22.560> I

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
once again I'm going to show you that I

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.910 
once again I'm going to show you that I
just<00:03:22.680> set<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:23.370> down<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:24.019> by<00:03:25.019> doing<00:03:25.230> so<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.769> just

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
just set it down and by doing so it just

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.150 
just set it down and by doing so it just
creates<00:03:26.070> that<00:03:26.340> perfect<00:03:26.790> angle<00:03:26.970> for<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.510> so

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
creates that perfect angle for you so

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.690 
creates that perfect angle for you so
and<00:03:29.160> then<00:03:29.310> just<00:03:29.519> draw<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:30.510> line<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.950> fill<00:03:32.580> it

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
and then just draw the line and fill it

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.630 
and then just draw the line and fill it
in

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.270 

so<00:03:39.640> that<00:03:39.790> was<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.150> that<00:03:40.629> was<00:03:40.659> my<00:03:41.230> little<00:03:41.829> demo

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
so that was it that was my little demo

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.179 
so that was it that was my little demo
for<00:03:42.310> you<00:03:42.670> guys<00:03:42.879> and<00:03:43.239> hopefully<00:03:43.450> you<00:03:44.409> can<00:03:44.739> see

for you guys and hopefully you can see

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
how easy and precise the line is the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.839 
how easy and precise the line is the
little<00:03:47.860> wing<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:49.860> these<00:03:50.860> I<00:03:51.250> bought<00:03:51.459> this<00:03:51.670> at

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
Ulta for around $5 and it could be more

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.559 
Ulta for around $5 and it could be more
or<00:03:56.140> less<00:03:56.379> depending<00:03:57.010> on<00:03:57.189> where<00:03:57.489> you<00:03:57.609> live<00:03:57.819> but
