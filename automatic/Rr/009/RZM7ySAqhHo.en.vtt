00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
first generation they come in at one

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.479 
first generation they come in at one
point<00:00:32.579> two<00:00:33.000> ounces<00:00:33.239> which<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.050> very<00:00:34.680> light<00:00:35.010> now

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
point two ounces which is very light now

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.860 
point two ounces which is very light now
I've<00:00:35.640> used<00:00:35.670> these<00:00:36.030> for<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> little<00:00:36.420> while<00:00:36.540> and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
I've used these for a little while and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.240 
I've used these for a little while and
these<00:00:36.960> are<00:00:37.079> much<00:00:37.320> more<00:00:37.380> comfortable<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
these are much more comfortable the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.560 
these are much more comfortable the
screens<00:00:38.610> are<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> little<00:00:39.030> bit<00:00:39.210> brighter<00:00:39.450> than

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
screens are a little bit brighter than

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.389 
screens are a little bit brighter than
the<00:00:39.690> last<00:00:39.870> generation<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.559> they<00:00:41.010> seem<00:00:41.250> to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
the last generation and they seem to

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.830 
the last generation and they seem to
have<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> little<00:00:41.790> bit<00:00:41.879> less<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.270> tilt<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
have a little bit less of a tilt to the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.779 
have a little bit less of a tilt to the
glasses<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.590> do<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> more<00:00:44.340> direct<00:00:44.610> view

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
glasses and you do a more direct view

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.190 
glasses and you do a more direct view
and<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.239> think<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.660> actually<00:00:45.690> works<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.110> lot

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
and I think it actually works a lot

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.810 
and I think it actually works a lot
better<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.649> it'll<00:00:46.920> reduce<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.309> lot<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.550> strain

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
better and it'll reduce a lot of strain

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.850 
better and it'll reduce a lot of strain
in<00:00:47.910> your<00:00:48.030> eyes<00:00:48.180> now<00:00:48.690> these<00:00:48.989> are<00:00:49.140> extremely

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
in your eyes now these are extremely

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.439 
in your eyes now these are extremely
light<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.100> extremely<00:00:51.090> comfortable

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
light and extremely comfortable

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.060 
light and extremely comfortable
especially<00:00:51.600> compared<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> last<00:00:52.350> ones<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
especially compared to the last ones the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.200 
especially compared to the last ones the
last<00:00:53.219> ones<00:00:53.370> are<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> little<00:00:53.579> bit<00:00:53.730> too<00:00:53.940> tight<00:00:54.149> on

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
last ones are a little bit too tight on

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.970 
last ones are a little bit too tight on
me<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> don't<00:00:54.750> know<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.110> don't<00:00:55.230> know<00:00:55.469> if<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.770> had<00:00:55.949> a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.139 
big head or what but they just were not
that<00:00:58.590> comfortable<00:00:58.829> these<00:00:59.340> are<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.820> light<00:01:00.000> you

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
that comfortable these are so light you

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.029 
that comfortable these are so light you
forget<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:01.079> them<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.500> they're

forget that you have them on they're

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.310 
forget that you have them on they're
very<00:01:02.430> thin<00:01:02.820> all<00:01:03.090> around<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.480> edges<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
very thin all around the edges and the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.050 
very thin all around the edges and the
front<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.680> pretty<00:01:04.890> much<00:01:04.949> all<00:01:05.159> glass<00:01:05.580> with<00:01:05.820> just

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
front is pretty much all glass with just

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.870 
front is pretty much all glass with just
the<00:01:06.180> middle<00:01:06.600> being<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.080> only<00:01:07.200> sizable<00:01:07.920> part

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.370 

now<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.939> nose<00:01:12.210> piece<00:01:12.450> itself<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:13.049> actually

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
now the nose piece itself can actually

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.230 
now the nose piece itself can actually
be<00:01:13.470> replaced<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.310> actually<00:01:14.520> pull<00:01:14.760> off<00:01:14.790> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
be replaced can actually pull off and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.760 
be replaced can actually pull off and
you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.390> actually<00:01:15.479> put<00:01:15.750> anyone<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.680> it

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
you can actually put anyone on so it

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.899 
you can actually put anyone on so it
comes<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.100> replacement<00:01:17.549> one<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.759> case

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
comes to the replacement one in case

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.370 
comes to the replacement one in case
anything<00:01:18.210> ever<00:01:18.270> happens<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:18.990> one<00:01:19.200> and

these<00:01:31.619> here<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.979> have<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.460> BR<00:01:32.960> 250<00:01:33.960> which<00:01:34.140> is

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
these here I have of the BR 250 which is

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.020 
these here I have of the BR 250 which is
the<00:01:34.350> last<00:01:34.590> generation<00:01:34.770> see<00:01:35.640> these<00:01:35.790> don't

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
the last generation see these don't

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.370 
the last generation see these don't
really<00:01:36.090> move<00:01:36.329> out<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.689> sides<00:01:36.990> very<00:01:37.170> much

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
really move out to the sides very much

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.380 
really move out to the sides very much
it<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.799> very<00:01:38.009> tight<00:01:38.369> especially<00:01:38.850> after

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
it can be very tight especially after

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.819 
it can be very tight especially after
for<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> couple<00:01:39.900> hours<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.259> movie<00:01:40.409> watching<00:01:40.560> you

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
for a couple hours of movie watching you

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.410 
for a couple hours of movie watching you
can<00:01:40.950> really<00:01:41.189> start<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.430> be<00:01:41.490> painful<00:01:41.970> if<00:01:42.329> you

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
can really start to be painful if you

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.700 
can really start to be painful if you
look<00:01:42.509> at<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.630> titanium<00:01:43.110> ones<00:01:43.200> they<00:01:43.350> impede

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
look at the titanium ones they impede

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.230 
look at the titanium ones they impede
been<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.159> are<00:01:44.250> much<00:01:44.369> lighter<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.030> they're

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
been and are much lighter so they're

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.060 
been and are much lighter so they're
actually<00:01:45.540> much<00:01:45.659> more<00:01:45.840> flexible<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.590> do<00:01:46.920> not

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
actually much more flexible and do not

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.770 
actually much more flexible and do not
give<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.460> much<00:01:47.579> screen<00:01:47.909> now<00:01:48.390> here's<00:01:48.630> the

give you so much screen now here's the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.450 
give you so much screen now here's the
charging<00:01:49.140> port<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.680> last<00:01:49.920> generation

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
charging port on the last generation

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.120 
charging port on the last generation
here<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.299> side<00:01:51.770> it<00:01:52.770> was<00:01:52.890> kind<00:01:53.100> of

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
here on the side it was kind of

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.889 
here on the side it was kind of
obnoxious<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.729> open<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.090> up<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.390> close<00:01:54.720> it

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
obnoxious to open this up and close it

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.929 
obnoxious to open this up and close it
as<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.350> see<00:01:55.590> did<00:01:56.009> not<00:01:56.040> stay<00:01:56.399> very<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.759> does

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
as you can see did not stay very it does

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.760 
as you can see did not stay very it does
not<00:01:57.090> even<00:01:57.270> stay<00:01:57.540> closed<00:01:58.020> very<00:01:58.259> well<00:01:58.469> by<00:01:58.619> itself

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
not even stay closed very well by itself

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.649 
not even stay closed very well by itself
it<00:01:59.040> was<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.310> very<00:01:59.460> smooth<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.509> kind

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
it was not very smooth and it just kind

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.219 
it was not very smooth and it just kind
of<00:02:00.719> obnoxious<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.409> use<00:02:02.930> one<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.079> main

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
of obnoxious to use one of the main

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.959 
of obnoxious to use one of the main
difference<00:02:04.560> here<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.829> going<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.009> be<00:02:05.100> size<00:02:05.369> as

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
difference here is going to be size as

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.210 
difference here is going to be size as
you<00:02:06.149> can<00:02:06.270> see<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.630> old<00:02:06.810> ones<00:02:07.079> are<00:02:07.200> much<00:02:07.619> much

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
you can see the old ones are much much

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.279 
you can see the old ones are much much
bigger<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.789> much<00:02:08.910> heavier<00:02:09.209> than<00:02:09.869> these<00:02:10.080> new

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
bigger and much heavier than these new

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.680 
bigger and much heavier than these new
ones<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.790> lot<00:02:11.940> just

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
ones so it's a lot just

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.850 
ones so it's a lot just
more<00:02:12.900> comfortable<00:02:13.320> that's<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.650> biggest

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
more comfortable that's the biggest

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.200 
more comfortable that's the biggest
thing<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.340> can<00:02:14.460> say<00:02:14.640> about<00:02:14.760> these<00:02:15.000> new

thing that I can say about these new

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.910 
thing that I can say about these new
ones<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:16.080> here<00:02:16.350> I<00:02:16.380> want<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.590> show<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.800> couple

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
ones so here I want to show you a couple

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.110 
ones so here I want to show you a couple
other<00:02:17.070> things<00:02:17.340> were<00:02:17.490> kind<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.820> giving<00:02:18.030> me<00:02:18.060> a

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
other things were kind of giving me a

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.660 
other things were kind of giving me a
little<00:02:18.180> bit<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.450> an<00:02:18.570> issue<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.400> as<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.490> can<00:02:20.610> see

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
little bit of an issue so as you can see

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.780 
little bit of an issue so as you can see
here<00:02:21.180> on<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.450> left<00:02:21.750> lens<00:02:22.070> the<00:02:23.070> glasses<00:02:23.460> are

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
here on that left lens the glasses are

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.310 
here on that left lens the glasses are
kind<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.000> fused<00:02:24.360> together<00:02:24.540> there<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:24.990> there's

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
kind of fused together there and there's

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.590 
kind of fused together there and there's
just<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:25.770> imperfection<00:02:26.730> going<00:02:27.240> around<00:02:27.420> the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
just this imperfection going around the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.840 
just this imperfection going around the
edges<00:02:27.960> of<00:02:27.990> these<00:02:28.170> glasses<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.490> see<00:02:29.820> a

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
edges of these glasses you can see a

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.090 
edges of these glasses you can see a
little<00:02:30.000> bit<00:02:30.180> like<00:02:30.390> it's<00:02:30.540> kind<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:31.100> softer

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
little bit like it's kind of a softer

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.670 
little bit like it's kind of a softer
gel<00:02:33.000> glue<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:34.170> these<00:02:34.320> are<00:02:34.410> going<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.590> be

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
gel glue that these are going to be

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.120 
gel glue that these are going to be
fused<00:02:35.040> together<00:02:35.160> with<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:36.590> it's<00:02:37.590> kinda<00:02:38.010> just

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
fused together with and it's kinda just

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.160 
fused together with and it's kinda just
I<00:02:38.460> mean<00:02:38.580> it's<00:02:38.730> just<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.940> little<00:02:39.090> small<00:02:39.480> thing<00:02:39.720> to

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
I mean it's just a little small thing to

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.470 
I mean it's just a little small thing to
me<00:02:40.350> but<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.100> total<00:02:41.250> quality<00:02:41.640> is<00:02:41.820> so<00:02:42.000> good<00:02:42.030> and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
me but the total quality is so good and

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.910 
me but the total quality is so good and
then<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:42.660> have<00:02:42.810> something<00:02:43.140> small<00:02:43.500> like<00:02:43.530> this

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
then you have something small like this

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.490 
then you have something small like this
weather<00:02:44.250> just<00:02:44.370> like<00:02:44.490> this<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:45.260> don't<00:02:46.260> know<00:02:46.380> they

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
weather just like this I don't know they

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.720 
weather just like this I don't know they
just<00:02:46.530> weren't<00:02:46.860> paying<00:02:46.950> attention<00:02:47.070> but<00:02:47.640> they

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
just weren't paying attention but they

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.910 
just weren't paying attention but they
have<00:02:47.910> these<00:02:48.120> things<00:02:49.050> going<00:02:49.260> around<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.560> edges

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
have these things going around the edges

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.440 
have these things going around the edges
and<00:02:50.040> stuff<00:02:50.280> like<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.120> don't<00:02:51.270> know<00:02:51.360> if

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
and stuff like that so I don't know if

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.850 
and stuff like that so I don't know if
these<00:02:51.540> would<00:02:51.750> start<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.200> like<00:02:52.350> wear<00:02:52.590> down<00:02:52.800> over

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
these would start to like wear down over

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.530 
these would start to like wear down over
time<00:02:53.190> athenewins<00:02:53.700> kind<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.060> start<00:02:54.240> to<00:02:54.300> pick

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
time athenewins kind of start to pick

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.110 
time athenewins kind of start to pick
off<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.050> flake<00:02:55.620> apart<00:02:55.770> and<00:02:56.160> which<00:02:56.700> would<00:02:56.940> not

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
off and flake apart and which would not

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.490 
off and flake apart and which would not
be<00:02:57.150> good<00:02:57.390> for<00:02:57.450> this<00:02:57.630> glasses<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:58.080> be<00:02:58.200> used

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
be good for this glasses to be used

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.870 
be good for this glasses to be used
together<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.860> stuff<00:02:58.980> like<00:02:59.100> that<00:02:59.310> since<00:02:59.520> the

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
together and stuff like that since the

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.660 
together and stuff like that since the
whole<00:03:00.060> 3d<00:03:00.600> thing<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:00.900> in<00:03:00.990> there<00:03:01.140> but<00:03:01.800> either

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
whole 3d thing is in there but either

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.950 
whole 3d thing is in there but either
way<00:03:02.880> this<00:03:03.030> was<00:03:03.180> something<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:03.450> was<00:03:03.660> starting

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
way this was something that was starting

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.020 
way this was something that was starting
to<00:03:04.020> really<00:03:04.110> bug<00:03:04.530> me<00:03:04.590> as<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.460> was<00:03:05.580> looking<00:03:05.790> at

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
to really bug me as I was looking at

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.670 
to really bug me as I was looking at
these<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.480> especially<00:03:06.720> compared<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.530> that

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
these and especially compared to that

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.770 
these and especially compared to that
these<00:03:07.860> cost<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.670> hundred<00:03:08.730> dollars<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:09.390> was

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
these cost a hundred dollars I was

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.840 
these cost a hundred dollars I was
really<00:03:09.990> hoping<00:03:10.260> for<00:03:10.440> something<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.980> little<00:03:11.640> bit

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
really hoping for something a little bit

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.370 
really hoping for something a little bit
something<00:03:12.630> like<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:12.990> there<00:03:13.170> shouldn't<00:03:13.320> be

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
something like that there shouldn't be

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.729 
something like that there shouldn't be
so<00:03:13.500> many<00:03:13.650> imperfections<00:03:14.250> compared<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.739> you
