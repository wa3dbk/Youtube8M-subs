00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
that's pretty much it the way the game

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.490 
that's pretty much it the way the game
plays<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:55.610> you<00:00:56.899> tap<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.680> colors<00:00:59.609> that<00:01:00.120> are

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
plays is you tap the colors that are

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.990 
plays is you tap the colors that are
that<00:01:01.500> go<00:01:01.649> out<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.280> got<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.550> tap<00:01:02.730> him<00:01:02.910> in

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
that go out and you got to tap him in

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.759 
that go out and you got to tap him in
order<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.629> farther<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.110> go<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.650> better

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
order and the farther you go the better

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.479 
order and the farther you go the better
you<00:01:05.040> do

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
you do

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.609 
you do
pretty<00:01:06.060> simple<00:01:06.360> don't<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.810> think<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.229> think

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
pretty simple don't you think I think

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.300 
pretty simple don't you think I think
however<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.729> does<00:01:09.330> test<00:01:10.110> your<00:01:10.409> brain<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.130> your

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
however it does test your brain and your

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.960 
however it does test your brain and your
memory<00:01:11.670> because<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:14.280> not<00:01:14.520> as<00:01:14.790> easy

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
memory because the the it's not as easy

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.679 
memory because the the it's not as easy
as<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.360> looks<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.350> do<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:17.130> know<00:01:17.689> maybe

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
as it looks you can do you know maybe

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.690 
as it looks you can do you know maybe
you<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.080> do<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> few<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.130> normal<00:01:20.430> speed

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you can do a few on the normal speed

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.090 
you can do a few on the normal speed
maybe<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.570> get<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.170> whatever<00:01:22.650> five

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
maybe you can get up to whatever five

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.870 
maybe you can get up to whatever five
ten<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.540> know<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.049> as<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.770> goes<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.280> higher

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
ten you know but as it goes to higher

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.789 
ten you know but as it goes to higher
numbers<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.600> definitely<00:01:28.110> more<00:01:28.619> difficult

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
numbers it's definitely more difficult

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.920 
numbers it's definitely more difficult
to<00:01:29.310> remember<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.970> when<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> faster

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
to remember and when you do the faster

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.990 
to remember and when you do the faster
mode<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.470> pretty<00:01:31.920> quick<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.610> doesn't

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
mode it's pretty quick and it doesn't

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.260 
mode it's pretty quick and it doesn't
give<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:34.079> lot<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.530> time<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.579> remember<00:01:36.060> so

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
give you a lot of time to to remember so

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.539 
give you a lot of time to to remember so
you<00:01:36.299> got<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.869> some<00:01:37.740> type<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.189> memory

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
you got to have some type of a memory

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.100 
you got to have some type of a memory
you're<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.720> something

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
you're going to have to have something

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.710 
you're going to have to have something
in<00:01:40.170> there<00:01:40.290> between<00:01:40.439> your<00:01:40.770> ears<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.600> know
