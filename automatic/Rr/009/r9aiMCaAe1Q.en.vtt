00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.020
 Hi everyone, I'm back river trance. 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.370
 to resolve another issue there of the 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.590
 and either 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.990
 before you were on our YouTube channel and 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.990
 neither was mateus meadow the staff involves 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.160
 a little question about the sciences of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.890
 nature 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.170
 This is an issue that 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.690
 shows on a map of Brazil including 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.510
 with information from the researchers is not 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.700
 that go through the stages of a house 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.430
 I'll show you both in the woods and 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.470
 after that he name a few stretches where the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.559
 height of what I'm coming along 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.500
 from the way they managed to say that 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.870
 type of environment and ecosystem 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.530
 Brazilian they are talking then a 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.489
 pen in brazil 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:58.770
 here the yuan 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:03.510
 you see that one up here in the region 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.299
 only of the amazon and it descends and 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.860
 literally it goes down here until the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.110
 South region 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.690
 since the two he's here just in 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.200
 region here northeast near the 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:20.640
 mountains a line emerging 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.830
 part more inner beauty then you can 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.090
 falling is not leaving the Amazon is 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.250
 going by plant 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.530
 the other is coming right off the beach 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.320
 and going beyond doing more 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.310
 hinterlands is a bit all day here're right 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.400
 getting easy 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.560
 there the first one that left the amazon 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.119
 inscribed two excerpts the first excerpt 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.200
 to see what kind of ordeal that is 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.180
 only kind of vegetation see because of the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.579
 drastic reduction of species 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.680
 vegetables of this ecosystem as the 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.369
 little ones have resulted in process 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.689
 extinction 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:58.439
 the papa tire pine pine 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:01.880
 I only spent what kills te araucarias with 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.590
 that and we call our question is not 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.770
 only a knife had be can not a 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.989
 therefore practically 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.760
 deletion you easily eliminate 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.209
 the second was so 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.040
 since then with populous peels 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.250
 that predominates in this ecosystem 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.500
 which are being used in categories 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.290
 It's already on the way there the region is leaving. 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.280
 north and south 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.159
 the togo toró can only be what is wrong 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.599
 beauty as already in relation to the 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.459
 according to the researcher 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.769
 he speaks thus of the palm trees that 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.450
 predominate in this region can be 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.620
 extracted substances that are important 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.250
 for the regional economy 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.220
 can only be who can only be the people 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.299
 in the localities the forest of beauty and 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.849
 last talk like this 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.840
 despite the cleanliness we found 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.030
 many thorny plants are joão mió 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.220
 Northeast thorny thorny people do not get 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.879
 can express their biodiversity are 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.819
 precisely in the caatinga is not this 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:08.159
 My goodness and that's what I do. 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.230
 ecosystems received this 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.359
 often ecosystems identification 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.760
 is a characteristic of this competence 8 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.889
 alternative conclusion this time of 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.129
 corinthians pican peon world beauty 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:23.340
 like so and then enjoy 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:27.329
 information on this beautiful material of the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:31.160
 enem is on ww via had punto org.br 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.160
 Beauty a hug until the next question
