00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.269 
Mac and C 35 more or less and I felt
like<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.720> was<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.050> best<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.439> shade<00:00:25.859> match

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
like this was the best of shade match

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.890 
like this was the best of shade match
for<00:00:26.609> me<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.820> give<00:00:26.970> me<00:00:27.119> brightness<00:00:27.539> underneath

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
for me to give me brightness underneath

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.779 
for me to give me brightness underneath
the<00:00:28.019> eyes<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.560> do<00:00:28.830> feel<00:00:29.189> like<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.460> could<00:00:29.609> use

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the eyes I do feel like I could use

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.150 
the eyes I do feel like I could use
lights<00:00:30.179> but<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:30.689> more<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> natural<00:00:32.009> look

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
lights but it's more for a natural look

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.440 
lights but it's more for a natural look
it<00:00:32.309> doesn't<00:00:32.550> give<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.669> brightness<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.329> would

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
it doesn't give that brightness it would

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.600 
it doesn't give that brightness it would
probably<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.230> same<00:00:34.260> color<00:00:34.829> as<00:00:35.070> my<00:00:35.100> skin

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
probably be the same color as my skin

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.520 
probably be the same color as my skin
tone<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.360> that's<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.870> for<00:00:37.020> reference<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.500> you

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
tone so that's just for reference so you

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.290 
tone so that's just for reference so you
guys<00:00:37.739> know<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.399> think<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:39.030> someone<00:00:39.270> who

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
guys know this I think that someone who

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.780 
guys know this I think that someone who
is<00:00:39.390> very<00:00:39.719> extremely<00:00:40.320> pale<00:00:40.710> would<00:00:41.309> not<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.640> able

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
is very extremely pale would not be able

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.369 
is very extremely pale would not be able
to<00:00:41.879> find<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.180> shade<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.809> because<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
to find a shade in this because of the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.610 
to find a shade in this because of the
fact<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.950> range<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.850> deep<00:00:45.629> that

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
fact that this range is so deep that

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.990 
fact that this range is so deep that

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.220 
the eye it's very long wearing as long
as<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.160> set<00:03:16.430> this<00:03:16.639> with<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:17.150> powder<00:03:17.480> if<00:03:18.170> you

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
as you set this with a powder if you

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.140 
as you set this with a powder if you
don't<00:03:18.680> set<00:03:18.829> it<00:03:18.859> with<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.040> powder<00:03:19.100> it<00:03:19.579> kind<00:03:20.000> of

don't set it with a powder it kind of

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.180 
don't set it with a powder it kind of
does<00:03:20.660> kind<00:03:21.049> of<00:03:21.139> tend<00:03:21.319> to<00:03:21.410> move<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.829> little<00:03:21.980> bit
