of hoping for a Mark Henry return here

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.770 
of hoping for a Mark Henry return here
maybe<00:04:20.609> return<00:04:21.000> Mark<00:04:21.209> Henry<00:04:21.419> as<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.539> face

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
maybe return Mark Henry as a face

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.540 
maybe return Mark Henry as a face
because<00:04:22.109> he<00:04:22.140> was<00:04:22.380> feuding<00:04:22.620> with<00:04:22.740> Big<00:04:23.039> Show<00:04:23.280> and

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
because he was feuding with Big Show and

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.640 
because he was feuding with Big Show and
I<00:04:24.210> think<00:04:24.419> it<00:04:24.510> would<00:04:24.599> be<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.720> great<00:04:24.900> opportunity

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
I think it would be a great opportunity

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.890 
I think it would be a great opportunity
for<00:04:25.740> WWE<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.639> return<00:04:27.030> somebody<00:04:27.509> on<00:04:27.660> Raw

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
tonight I thought that would've been a

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.100 
tonight I thought that would've been a
great<00:04:29.580> spot<00:04:30.000> to<00:04:30.030> put<00:04:30.300> in<00:04:30.389> Mark<00:04:30.570> Henry<00:04:30.840> but<00:04:30.990> they

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
great spot to put in Mark Henry but they

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.719 
great spot to put in Mark Henry but they
didn't<00:04:31.410> and<00:04:31.560> it<00:04:31.680> was<00:04:31.800> very<00:04:31.919> pointless<00:04:32.310> segment

I'm<00:04:32.850> just<00:04:33.000> gonna<00:04:33.090> give<00:04:33.300> it<00:04:33.330> half<00:04:33.570> because<00:04:33.810> it

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
I'm just gonna give it half because it

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.400 
I'm just gonna give it half because it
was<00:04:34.139> boring<00:04:34.440> and<00:04:34.590> it<00:04:35.160> was<00:04:35.280> just<00:04:35.430> pointless<00:04:36.410> so
