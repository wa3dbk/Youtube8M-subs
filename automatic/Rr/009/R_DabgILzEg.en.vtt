generally<00:00:34.440> they're<00:00:34.649> not<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.010> issue<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.550> think

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
generally they're not the issue I think

generally they're not the issue I think
I've<00:00:36.000> only<00:00:36.149> changed<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.870> crank<00:00:37.170> sensors<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.770> my

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
I've only changed to crank sensors in my

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.380 
I've only changed to crank sensors in my
history<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.430> working<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> six<00:00:39.149> liter

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
diesel and cam sensors I think I've only

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.600 
diesel and cam sensors I think I've only
changed<00:00:43.379> one<00:00:43.469> only<00:00:43.860> because<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.370> was<00:00:44.460> on<00:00:44.579> a

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
changed one only because it was on a

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.979 
changed one only because it was on a
lark<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.750> was<00:00:45.899> not<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.260> actual<00:00:46.410> problem

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
lark and it was not the actual problem

lark and it was not the actual problem
we<00:00:48.989> will<00:00:49.680> find<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.550> six<00:00:50.910> liter<00:00:51.120> is

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
we will find on the six liter is

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.200 
we will find on the six liter is
generally<00:00:51.780> an<00:00:52.170> ejector<00:00:53.100> has<00:00:53.280> probably<00:00:53.730> welded

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
generally an ejector has probably welded

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.510 
generally an ejector has probably welded
itself<00:00:54.570> shut<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.890> shorting<00:00:56.280> out<00:00:56.340> the

itself shut and it is shorting out the

itself shut and it is shorting out the
victim<00:00:56.850> you'll<00:00:57.690> still<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.050> 48<00:00:58.469> volts<00:00:59.030> on

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
victim you'll still have 48 volts on

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.990 
victim you'll still have 48 volts on
your<00:01:00.329> victim<00:01:00.690> voltage<00:01:01.250> but<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.489> has<00:01:02.670> actually

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
your victim voltage but it has actually

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.570 
your victim voltage but it has actually
shorted<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.719> out<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.170> will<00:01:04.350> not<00:01:04.559> start<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
shorted it out and it will not start and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.160 
shorted it out and it will not start and
when<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.760> crank<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.390> sounds<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.869> one<00:01:07.080> of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
when you crank it it sounds like one of

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.539 
when you crank it it sounds like one of
the<00:01:07.260> Pistons<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.799> trying<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.100> send<00:01:08.280> itself

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the Pistons is trying to send itself

the Pistons is trying to send itself
backwards<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:10.110> one<00:01:10.320> here<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.619> had<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> code

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
backwards on this one here we had a code

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.270 
backwards on this one here we had a code
four<00:01:11.340> cylinder<00:01:11.729> six<00:01:12.799> so<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:14.040> just

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
four cylinder six so we just

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.390 
four cylinder six so we just
disconnected<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.000> off<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:16.170> valve<00:01:16.920> cover<00:01:17.189> a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
disconnected it off the valve cover a

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.340 
disconnected it off the valve cover a
pin<00:01:18.119> connector<00:01:18.540> there<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.869> really<00:01:18.990> hard<00:01:19.229> to

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
pin connector there it's really hard to

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.960 
pin connector there it's really hard to
see<00:01:19.500> I'm<00:01:19.650> sorry<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:21.240> disconnected<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.020> and

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
see I'm sorry but we disconnected it and

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.100 
see I'm sorry but we disconnected it and
third<00:01:23.970> codes<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:25.380> truck<00:01:25.590> fired<00:01:25.830> right<00:01:25.979> up

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
third codes and the truck fired right up

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.630 
third codes and the truck fired right up
mind<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.200> has<00:01:28.470> an<00:01:28.619> audible<00:01:29.159> miss

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
mind you has an audible miss

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.610 
mind you has an audible miss
we<00:01:31.150> were<00:01:31.330> doing<00:01:31.480> some<00:01:31.720> work<00:01:31.870> here<00:01:31.900> on<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.410> fuel

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
we were doing some work here on the fuel

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.320 
we were doing some work here on the fuel
pressure<00:01:32.890> regulator<00:01:33.220> because<00:01:33.550> if<00:01:33.820> this<00:01:34.150> truck

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
pressure regulator because if this truck

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.180 
pressure regulator because if this truck
was<00:01:34.510> ran<00:01:34.750> dry<00:01:35.050> fuel<00:01:35.680> twice<00:01:36.040> and<00:01:36.730> that<00:01:37.980> as<00:01:38.980> you

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
was ran dry fuel twice and that as you

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.730 
was ran dry fuel twice and that as you
know<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.400> guys<00:01:39.550> who<00:01:39.730> drive<00:01:40.150> it<00:01:40.450> don't<00:01:41.350> realize

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
know the guys who drive it don't realize

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.250 
know the guys who drive it don't realize
that<00:01:41.770> when<00:01:42.010> you<00:01:42.130> run<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.310> diesel<00:01:42.700> empty<00:01:43.000> it<00:01:43.260> does

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
that when you run a diesel empty it does

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.410 
that when you run a diesel empty it does
a<00:01:44.290> lot<00:01:44.440> of<00:01:44.590> damage<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:44.950> them<00:01:45.250> so<00:01:46.090> we<00:01:46.180> ended<00:01:46.330> up

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
a lot of damage to them so we ended up

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.880 
a lot of damage to them so we ended up
putting<00:01:46.570> a<00:01:46.690> fuel<00:01:46.900> pressure<00:01:47.110> regulator<00:01:47.440> on<00:01:47.650> it

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
putting a fuel pressure regulator on it

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.000 
putting a fuel pressure regulator on it
new<00:01:48.070> filters<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:49.410> that<00:01:50.410> made<00:01:50.590> no<00:01:50.770> difference

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
new filters and that made no difference

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.190 
new filters and that made no difference
I<00:01:51.280> already<00:01:51.490> knew<00:01:51.610> what<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.790> issue<00:01:52.030> was<00:01:52.200> it's

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
I already knew what the issue was it's

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.350 
I already knew what the issue was it's
just<00:01:53.350> we<00:01:53.470> did<00:01:53.620> it<00:01:53.710> anyway<00:01:54.100> before<00:01:54.700> we<00:01:55.090> do<00:01:55.210> any

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
just we did it anyway before we do any

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.200 
just we did it anyway before we do any
more<00:01:55.450> damage<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.200> truck

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
more damage to the truck

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.080 
more damage to the truck
here<00:01:58.810> we<00:01:58.930> are<00:01:58.960> new<00:01:59.380> fuel<00:01:59.650> in<00:01:59.830> it<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.160> just

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
here we are new fuel in it and just

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.480 
here we are new fuel in it and just
disconnected<00:02:01.660> number<00:02:01.900> six<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.410> away<00:02:03.310> we<00:02:03.460> go

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
disconnected number six and away we go

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.250 
disconnected number six and away we go
she<00:02:03.670> fired<00:02:04.060> up<00:02:04.240> so<00:02:04.750> if<00:02:04.840> you<00:02:04.870> ever<00:02:05.020> get<00:02:05.110> those

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
she fired up so if you ever get those

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.850 
she fired up so if you ever get those
two<00:02:05.440> codes

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
two codes

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.980 
two codes
26:14<00:02:06.750> 2617<00:02:07.750> try<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.560> ignore<00:02:09.009> them<00:02:09.190> and

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
26:14 2617 try to ignore them and

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.510 
26:14 2617 try to ignore them and
hopefully<00:02:10.990> there's<00:02:11.200> another<00:02:11.830> code<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.460> your

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
hopefully there's another code in your

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.870 
hopefully there's another code in your
truck<00:02:13.000> for<00:02:13.930> an<00:02:14.290> injector<00:02:15.010> or<00:02:15.220> something<00:02:15.670> along

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
truck for an injector or something along

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.770 
truck for an injector or something along
those<00:02:16.000> lines<00:02:18.000> what<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.120> can<00:02:19.270> do<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.630> if<00:02:19.750> you

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
those lines what you can do is if you

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.150 
those lines what you can do is if you
have<00:02:20.110> more<00:02:21.100> advanced<00:02:21.459> scan<00:02:21.880> tool<00:02:22.150> is<00:02:23.040> do<00:02:24.040> an

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
have more advanced scan tool is do an

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.980 
have more advanced scan tool is do an
injector<00:02:24.550> buzz<00:02:24.790> test<00:02:25.150> if<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.540> will<00:02:25.690> let<00:02:25.840> you

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
injector buzz test if it will let you

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.830 
injector buzz test if it will let you
and<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:27.580> generally<00:02:28.300> will<00:02:28.390> tell<00:02:28.570> you<00:02:28.660> what

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
and I generally will tell you what

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.110 
and I generally will tell you what
cylinder<00:02:29.320> has<00:02:29.560> failed<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.130> then<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:30.940> can

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
cylinder has failed and then you can

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.210 
cylinder has failed and then you can
disconnect<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.900> inject<00:02:32.590> corresponding

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
disconnect that inject corresponding

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.510 
disconnect that inject corresponding
injector<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.950> decipher<00:02:35.950> your<00:02:36.070> problem

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
injector and decipher your problem

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.510 
injector and decipher your problem
generally<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:37.930> what<00:02:38.170> causes<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.430> a

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
generally this is what causes it is is a

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.510 
generally this is what causes it is is a
burp<00:02:39.940> injector<00:02:40.630> it<00:02:40.810> is<00:02:41.110> not<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.950> cam<00:02:42.220> sensor

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
burp injector it is not the cam sensor

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.670 
burp injector it is not the cam sensor
or<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:42.880> crank<00:02:43.239> sensor<00:02:43.450> is<00:02:43.780> generally<00:02:44.440> and

or the crank sensor is generally and
almost<00:02:45.250> every<00:02:45.550> time<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:46.030> burnt<00:02:46.360> injector<00:02:46.900> so

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
almost every time a burnt injector so

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.900 
almost every time a burnt injector so
thanks<00:02:48.190> for<00:02:48.310> watching<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.850> have<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.660> good<00:02:49.750> day
