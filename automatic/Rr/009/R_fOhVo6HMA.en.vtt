the<00:02:21.860> first<00:02:22.070> thing<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.430> notice<00:02:22.610> with<00:02:23.209> 18<00:02:23.690> to

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
the first thing you notice with 18 to

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.250 
the first thing you notice with 18 to
135<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.830> how<00:02:25.130> big<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.700> wide<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.390> zoom<00:02:26.690> barrel

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
135 is how big and wide the zoom barrel

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.100 
135 is how big and wide the zoom barrel
has<00:02:27.560> been<00:02:27.830> designed<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:29.270> is<00:02:29.480> more<00:02:29.690> than<00:02:29.810> half

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
has been designed it is more than half

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.460 
has been designed it is more than half
the<00:02:30.320> length<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.980> lens<00:02:31.190> when<00:02:31.610> contracted

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
the length of the lens when contracted

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.410 
the length of the lens when contracted
this<00:02:33.470> makes<00:02:33.770> it<00:02:33.920> easier<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.400> zoom<00:02:34.790> in<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.270> out

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
this makes it easier to zoom in and out

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.100 
this makes it easier to zoom in and out
without<00:02:35.810> looking<00:02:36.440> away<00:02:36.560> from<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.250> viewfinder

without looking away from the viewfinder

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.110 
without looking away from the viewfinder
it<00:02:39.110> is<00:02:39.320> so<00:02:39.500> much<00:02:39.680> easier<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.220> grab<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.940> turn

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
it is so much easier to grab and turn

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.550 
it is so much easier to grab and turn
having<00:02:41.600> such<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.870> big<00:02:42.200> grip<00:02:42.680> area<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:45.290> zoom
