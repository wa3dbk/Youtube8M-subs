00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
drive it today and hopefully we don't

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.979

we'll<00:03:12.880> see<00:03:13.060> cars<00:03:13.360> that<00:03:13.690> actually<00:03:13.959> look<00:03:14.140> like

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
we'll see cars that actually look like

this<00:03:14.440> on<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.739> road<00:03:14.860> I<00:03:15.160> don't<00:03:15.579> know<00:03:15.730> whether

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
this on the road I don't know whether

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.500 
this on the road I don't know whether
I'd<00:03:16.930> personally<00:03:17.610> own<00:03:18.610> something<00:03:19.090> like<00:03:19.239> this

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
I'd personally own something like this

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.360 
I'd personally own something like this
but<00:03:19.720> I<00:03:19.780> think<00:03:19.900> it's<00:03:20.170> too<00:03:20.380> soon<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.769> say<00:03:20.980> maybe

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
but I think it's too soon to say maybe

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.670 
but I think it's too soon to say maybe
it's<00:03:21.579> a<00:03:21.640> generational<00:03:21.790> leap<00:03:22.450> maybe<00:03:22.720> our<00:03:23.380> kids

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
it's a generational leap maybe our kids

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.800 
it's a generational leap maybe our kids
will<00:03:23.950> be<00:03:24.070> driving<00:03:24.340> vehicles<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.299> look<00:03:25.540> and

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
will be driving vehicles that look and

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.050 
will be driving vehicles that look and
work<00:03:26.530> like<00:03:26.769> this<00:03:26.980> maybe<00:03:27.310> they're<00:03:27.549> not<00:03:27.670> for<00:03:28.030> us

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
work like this maybe they're not for us

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.300 
work like this maybe they're not for us
but<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:29.110> fact<00:03:29.380> that<00:03:29.500> they're<00:03:30.160> actually

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
but the fact that they're actually

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.370 
but the fact that they're actually
working<00:03:30.640> they're<00:03:31.420> not<00:03:31.450> just<00:03:31.840> concepts

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
working they're not just concepts

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.199 
working they're not just concepts
they're<00:03:32.680> working<00:03:33.160> they're<00:03:33.400> driving<00:03:33.880> on

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
they're working they're driving on

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.900 
they're working they're driving on
deserted<00:03:35.170> air<00:03:35.410> strips<00:03:35.769> is<00:03:36.760> pretty<00:03:37.660> amazing
