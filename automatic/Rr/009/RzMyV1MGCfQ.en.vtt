so<00:00:29.940> after<00:00:30.900> doing<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.290> Close<00:00:31.620> Grip<00:00:31.650> push

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
so after doing that Close Grip push

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.120 
so after doing that Close Grip push
incline<00:00:33.060> we<00:00:33.870> went<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.500> super<00:00:34.950> set

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
incline we went to the super set

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.920 
incline we went to the super set
directly<00:00:35.430> into<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> normal<00:00:36.540> incline

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
directly into the normal incline

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.470 
directly into the normal incline
dumbbell<00:00:37.350> press<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.580> it's<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.000> tough<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:39.420> to

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
dumbbell press so it's a tough one to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.140 
dumbbell press so it's a tough one to
really<00:00:39.750> push<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.260> way<00:00:40.640> so<00:00:41.640> once<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.000> reach

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
really push this way so once you reach

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.820 
really push this way so once you reach
below<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.630> way<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.380> still<00:00:43.620> keep<00:00:43.770> going

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
below this way you can still keep going

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.590 
below this way you can still keep going
in<00:00:44.220> a<00:00:44.280> more<00:00:44.460> traditional<00:00:44.610> way<00:00:44.910> that's<00:00:45.240> why<00:00:45.420> we

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
in a more traditional way that's why we

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.360 
in a more traditional way that's why we
did<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.989> way<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.290> mean<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.710> think<00:00:47.040> we<00:00:47.220> can

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
did it that way I mean you think we can

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.060 
did it that way I mean you think we can
stop<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.700> guys<00:00:48.110> it's<00:00:49.110> mentally<00:00:49.650> challenging

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
stop it guys it's mentally challenging

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.950 
stop it guys it's mentally challenging
because<00:00:50.250> we've<00:00:50.520> already<00:00:50.730> fatigued<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.660> that

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
because we've already fatigued that that

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.260 
because we've already fatigued that that
movement<00:00:52.489> we<00:00:53.489> could<00:00:53.640> drop<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.970> weight<00:00:54.120> down

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
movement we could drop the weight down

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.970 
movement we could drop the weight down
good<00:00:56.630> it's<00:00:57.630> important<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.350> choose<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.800> right

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
good it's important to choose the right

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.610 
good it's important to choose the right
way<00:00:59.250> yeah<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.940> mean<00:01:00.150> it's<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.690> too<00:01:00.809> easy<00:01:00.900> to<00:01:01.080> let

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
way yeah I mean it's all too easy to let

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.329 
way yeah I mean it's all too easy to let
the<00:01:01.710> ego<00:01:01.920> get<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.160> way

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
the ego get in the way

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.490 
the ego get in the way
want<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.239> look<00:01:03.360> for<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.570> heavier<00:01:03.809> weights<00:01:04.019> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
want to look for the heavier weights and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.380 
want to look for the heavier weights and
just<00:01:04.920> try<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.190> lift<00:01:05.370> that<00:01:05.580> heavy<00:01:05.790> weight<00:01:05.880> how

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
just try and lift that heavy weight how

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.690 
just try and lift that heavy weight how
effective<00:01:06.870> is<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:06.990> really<00:01:07.380> when<00:01:07.620> when<00:01:08.580> you're

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
effective is it really when when you're

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.220 
effective is it really when when you're
not<00:01:08.820> engaged<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.300> the<00:01:09.360> muscle<00:01:09.630> fibers<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.110> it's

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
not engaged in the muscle fibers so it's

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.320 
not engaged in the muscle fibers so it's
not<00:01:10.440> lots<00:01:10.800> of<00:01:10.890> weight<00:01:11.040> down<00:01:11.240> even<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.300> little

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
not lots of weight down even a little

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.730 
not lots of weight down even a little
bit<00:01:12.570> high<00:01:12.690> reps<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.230> look<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.560> we're<00:01:13.710> doing

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
bit high reps you look like we're doing

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.310 
bit high reps you look like we're doing
today<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.400> really<00:01:14.790> recruiting<00:01:15.570> those<00:01:16.020> deep

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
today just really recruiting those deep

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.530 
today just really recruiting those deep
type<00:01:16.680> 2<00:01:16.950> muscle<00:01:17.130> weathers<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.270> growth

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
type 2 muscle weathers the the growth

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.710 
type 2 muscle weathers the the growth
factor<00:01:19.020> yeah<00:01:19.290> yes<00:01:20.010> I<00:01:20.190> think<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.030> really

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
factor yeah yes I think it's the really

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.360 
factor yeah yes I think it's the really
key<00:01:21.900> point<00:01:22.200> between<00:01:22.350> bar<00:01:22.770> lifting<00:01:23.159> and

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
key point between bar lifting and

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.760 
key point between bar lifting and
bodybuilding<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:24.570> like<00:01:24.750> focused<00:01:25.530> on

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
bodybuilding is really like focused on

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.969 
bodybuilding is really like focused on
the<00:01:26.010> muscle<00:01:26.550> more<00:01:26.940> than<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.210> weight<00:01:27.979> yeah

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the muscle more than the weight yeah

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.580 
the muscle more than the weight yeah
that's<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.520> key<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.150> what<00:01:30.659> was<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.930> what<00:01:31.560> was

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
that's a key and what was the what was

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.380 
that's a key and what was the what was
that<00:01:31.710> saying<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.070> kept<00:01:32.220> saying<00:01:32.400> when<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.150> said

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
that saying you kept saying when it said

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.760 
that saying you kept saying when it said
squeeze<00:01:34.340> focus<00:01:35.600> not<00:01:36.600> gone<00:01:36.810> that's<00:01:37.080> enough

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.020 

it's<00:01:40.770> done<00:01:41.010> as<00:01:41.160> when<00:01:41.370> you're<00:01:41.490> hitting<00:01:41.670> failure

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
it's done as when you're hitting failure

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.450 
it's done as when you're hitting failure
so<00:01:42.690> we<00:01:43.470> moved<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:43.950> fourth<00:01:44.160> exercise

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
so we moved on to a fourth exercise

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.700 
so we moved on to a fourth exercise
after<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.090> yes<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.870> lot<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.110> cables

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
after that yes a lot of cables

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.540 
after that yes a lot of cables
yeah<00:01:46.890> look<00:01:47.400> super<00:01:47.760> sit<00:01:47.910> there<00:01:48.090> yeah<00:01:48.660> so<00:01:48.900> cables

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
yeah look super sit there yeah so cables

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.440 
yeah look super sit there yeah so cables
nothing<00:01:50.550> let's<00:01:50.670> not<00:01:50.820> forget<00:01:51.060> about<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
nothing let's not forget about the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.930 
nothing let's not forget about the
push-ups<00:01:51.660> you<00:01:52.050> add<00:01:52.410> it<00:01:52.620> at<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.770> end<00:01:53.760> of<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
push-ups you add it at the end of the

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.190 
push-ups you add it at the end of the
superset<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.450> was<00:01:54.690> my<00:01:54.840> little<00:01:55.110> bit

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
superset that was my little bit

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.620 
superset that was my little bit
efficient<00:01:55.620> there<00:01:55.800> so<00:01:56.070> yeah<00:01:56.940> we<00:01:57.120> were<00:01:57.240> focusing

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
efficient there so yeah we were focusing

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.670 
efficient there so yeah we were focusing
on<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> upper<00:01:58.170> chest

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
on the upper chest

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.310 
on the upper chest
basically<00:01:59.160> it<00:01:59.520> was<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.670> tricep<00:02:00.180> yeah<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.840> little

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
basically it was a tricep yeah a little

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.480 
basically it was a tricep yeah a little
strip<00:02:01.530> set<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.830> terms<00:02:02.010> of<00:02:03.800> neutral<00:02:04.800> grip<00:02:05.010> yeah

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
strip set in terms of neutral grip yeah

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.270 
strip set in terms of neutral grip yeah
incline<00:02:06.030> dumbbell<00:02:06.180> press<00:02:06.380> into<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.410> column

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
incline dumbbell press into a column

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.279 
incline dumbbell press into a column
just<00:02:08.429> traditional<00:02:08.970> gumbo<00:02:09.300> pressure<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.080> then

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
just traditional gumbo pressure and then

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.110 
just traditional gumbo pressure and then
switched<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.800> around<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.730> same<00:02:11.910> kind<00:02:12.090> of

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
switched it around it's the same kind of

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.850 
switched it around it's the same kind of
thing<00:02:12.239> when<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.420> do<00:02:12.569> an<00:02:12.750> do<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.080> squat<00:02:13.500> into<00:02:13.709> a

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
thing when you do an do a squat into a

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.530 
thing when you do an do a squat into a
leg<00:02:14.010> press<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.370> change<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.120> flip<00:02:15.360> around

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
leg press you change and flip around

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.630

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.270 
yeah it's training for an illusion I saw
this<00:04:53.240> thing<00:04:53.539> if<00:04:54.050> then<00:04:54.380> if<00:04:54.590> people<00:04:54.919> watching

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
instances where some of these machines

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.560 
instances where some of these machines
aren't<00:05:04.250> available<00:05:04.400> yeah<00:05:04.970> how<00:05:05.330> would<00:05:05.389> you

machine e the dumbbells well a different

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.719 
machine e the dumbbells well a different
kind<00:05:09.229> of<00:05:09.320> movement<00:05:09.530> if<00:05:10.160> you<00:05:10.220> want<00:05:10.460> to<00:05:10.550> chip

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
like just with this machine you chip the

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.350 
like just with this machine you chip the
detention<00:05:13.070> all<00:05:13.250> the<00:05:13.340> way<00:05:13.430> through<00:05:13.669> so<00:05:14.120> I<00:05:14.150> would

detention all the way through so I would

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.080 
detention all the way through so I would
go<00:05:14.780> with<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:15.200> dumb<00:05:15.620> decline<00:05:16.400> bench<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:16.970> I'm

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
go with the dumb decline bench and I'm

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.909 
go with the dumb decline bench and I'm
between<00:05:17.360> to<00:05:17.720> like<00:05:18.020> cable<00:05:18.380> okay
