00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hey people welcome to a new show 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.549
 a computational machine before i do this 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.350
 imagine I have to put it briefly, is 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.580
 as I said, not something from me if I 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.070
 now also say 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.840
 this one has won him as the fv disco 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.089
 I already have my machine in front of him 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.100
 presented to him and you can do it right 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.330
 money and he has now before two 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.060
 days house makes it a fact 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.350
 calculator in minecraft moist that 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.930
 Show how it works shows times 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.369
 short the redstone technique and is 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.590
 Actually, of course, it receives it as always 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.320
 very compact and is just the idea 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.510
 is cool because he just manages 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.950
 to compact to a small place 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.930
 and now I show just once as the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.100
 whole works so important is so 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.350
 I would like to say now 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.910
 I want 20 + 10 you can be funny too 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.230
 but that's a bit easy me 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.370
 just make two presses 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.760
 first the two and so that a 2 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.649
 come now because and 20 is explain me 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.030
 right now if you have a 2 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.879
 you want to have the zeros first 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.789
 press and then the 2 so about 20 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.710
 then we do plus and you always have to 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.600
 Wait a bit because that lasts here 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.250
 is that is calculated a bit 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.990
 then plus x 5 so that you too very much 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.150
 with the 05 05 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.320
 only 25 will come 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.110
 As I said, it takes a while 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.210
 the last and exalted 25 because the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.530
 There is a small slope there 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.110
 direction around has already said 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.610
 for example here snow leads glass 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.829
 not and is currently trying to 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.759
 and that is actually the whole thing 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.470
 I'll go 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.229
 this is about your bags you the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.640
 name reset download as I said from 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.619
 the map will be described in more detail and 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.600
 also the manufacturer of course manufacturer 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.680
 rehabilitated then I just do it again 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:53.420
 what - here what he just 20 times - 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:59.040
 10 220 sometimes nice with it 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:08.239
 then notice - then it shows too 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:10.050
 just about it - at exactly 10 1 and the 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.620
 people to crack 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.600
 This is 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:21.020
 here are notes and blocks 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:22.520
 stop the noise then would have 10 20 10th 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.380
 Every child knows how to see the same 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.670
 Well that was already the machine 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.830
 actually pretty funny now 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.990
 no mini games right but I think it's 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.700
 just awesome that you can get in here then 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.490
 minecraft and calculator can build 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.830
 and I just think of genius guys 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.810
 and that was already the case with the ledger 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.430
 Hope you have these little machines 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.980
 like what is short is short but 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.720
 is cool and then I would just go 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.720
 say until next time check people
