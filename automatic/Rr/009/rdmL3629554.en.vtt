00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.990
 the audi tt family should grow bigger 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.080
 at least it is conceptual 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.139
 you that the audi offroad concept 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.820
 at the beginning of 2014 at the auto show in 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.890
 Peking 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.869
 the audi tt sportback concept drew the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.500
 Look up at the Paris Motor Show 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.300
 audi tt sportback concept just yet 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.550
 in paris at the fair already here 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.390
 in cannes on the promenade and here the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.820
 little brother 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.769
 but before we get right here with him 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.890
 We want to venture out into the street 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.510
 let's take a closer look 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.239
 the five-door concept is four meters 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.030
 and 47 is a school year 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.520
 three more than the series ducks 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.280
 centimeters deeper and 6 cm wider on 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.910
 the asphalt the wheelbase grows at twelve 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.640
 centimeter 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.570
 the sportback should of course be as tt too 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.640
 recognize 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.180
 That's why the designers had to be careful 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.859
 deal with the succinct forms when 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.469
 we tt from the side then look 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.729
 There are three elements that are typical 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.630
 for ntt so the solid hull of always 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:11.520
 with convex surfaces works very much 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.860
 a lot of pressure on it just got really busy 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.689
 is and the attached cabin and the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.210
 Attached cabin always has one 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.610
 arc as a page window graphic if we 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.409
 So let's say implant two more 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.990
 then we talk a bit 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.659
 of a still elegance theme still dares 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.820
 apply and this longer 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.180
 page window graphic in the sense but 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.350
 still with this typical 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.180
 the iconic line guide the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.400
 works differently in the case 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.310
 important element in the pc sits over the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.140
 wheels properly a tt is basically 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.790
 grad emphasizes that we already have in the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.070
 first generation shown will show 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.780
 almost always mounted wheel arches and in 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.149
 the case, of course, a little further 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.070
 exhibited as a serial vehicle and 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.200
 you also see convex ones here again 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.270
 flats at tt we have this beautiful 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.290
 round tail what everyone knows and now 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.890
 Let's get on the hatchback 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.960
 therefore 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.860
 We are still off the top 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.329
 down a very great tail but we 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.360
 in principle have the rear light 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.459
 a spoiler tail introduced with what 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.410
 we knew these quasi these here 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.300
 especially in the direct 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.160
 Side view really in the middle 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.320
 of the vehicle by a few centimeters 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.810
 could extend and with it we can 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.960
 almost this elegance as the conclusion of 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.240
 perfectly implant a sportback 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.990
 the tail reminds somehow also 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.340
 jaguar 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.080
 you can just do not reshape 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.860
 but invent as in this case 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.720
 Cleverly combine that crisp 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.210
 rear also looks like the loading edge is 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.280
 extremely high there you can feel the water box 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.040
 in the intervertebral discs the interior is 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.720
 typically the challenge here is the 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.590
 new space sent into the environment 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.020
 to adjust 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.860
 the focus at tt iss on sportiness 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.450
 but just through these functionalities 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.330
 So just extend this too 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.450
 the ergonomics to be able to sit behind 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.920
 room to have big big tailgate too 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.590
 have big trunk 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.840
 those were the main points though 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.710
 still the core tt must be clear 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.720
 be recognizable 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.720
 it takes longer than one now on the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.730
 first look thinks that it takes if 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.470
 that now with you or the customer like that 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.230
 So arrives says sit down purely 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.810
 recognize again dt they are great 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.670
 then the biggest compliment and that is 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.440
 actually the largest, the largest 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.450
 challenge the proportions again 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.790
 so that you can really do that 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.740
 Feeling that fits this is now 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.510
 balanced, it is harmonious, it's just 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.280
 still this sportiness 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.610
 this river or we will test it already 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.860
 once on the model line up 20 times 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.900
 and down and change until then 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.300
 At some point, it fits on the street 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.430
 with the single piece accompanied by a 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.739
 police escort and an audi 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.540
 Employees in the passenger seat are allowed 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.670
 we the sportback over the boulevard de 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.620
 control la croisette 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.260
 So we drive to the audi tt 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.930
 sportback could 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.360
 a priceless car sits next to her 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.180
 if from audi beware that they are not 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.280
 drive too much on the gas pedal 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.170
 Here is 25 is also completely okay 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.489
 theoretically, of course, there is much more in it 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.209
 because under the hood is inserted 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.609
 two liter tfsi with 400 ps 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.590
 you can not extend that because 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.419
 For one, of course, is the traffic and 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.370
 on the other hand, the landing gear and the steering 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.600
 not yet properly tuned but 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.690
 I can imagine that 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.949
 the suspension comfort here one more 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.260
 tick is better than for example in the 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.760
 small series coupe is the wheelbase 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.650
 still a bit longer 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.080
 I am the way, in this concept 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.479
 not strapped on the one hand we have 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.320
 Police in front of us and behind us on 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.380
 watch us 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.169
 on the other hand, it is just not a production car 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.280
 but it works well 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.669
 yes, even keep everything a bit 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.590
 and that's why I'm allowed to ride without a belt 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.720
 and that you have that concept at all k 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.490
 let's go sometimes can move 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.520
 that's really a great thing because 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.199
 when do you have the opportunity? 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.729
 priceless car here about this 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.490
 nice role was to control 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.750
 the 400 ps flow over a seven-speed 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.210
 s tronic on the permanent 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.110
 four-wheel drive quattro the sprint of 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.229
 zero to 100 km h would be 3.9 seconds 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.840
 done 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.940
 The front is from a huge single 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.120
 frame grill with honeycomb lattice dominates 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.610
 the headlights with laser light and 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.550
 LED daytime running lights but already good in 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.840
 Compare to the tt coupe fit here 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.000
 in fact we are also pure for people 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.490
 have seen it the mister becker the 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.990
 interior designer of course sat in one 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.150
 bit folded but at least 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.729
 which is also almost 1 meter 90 tall but 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.440
 it went and I think for one 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.490
 normal distance you get in everyday life 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.410
 overcome 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.270
 That's enough of course and completely 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:48.110
 there is still the trunk in 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.940
 my back has 350 liters on the back 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.979
 Paper would be the two single seats in the 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.020
 Fund foldable what was still in the study 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.720
 would not work it would be that 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.639
 maximum luggage compartment volume at 8 159 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.440
 liters 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.729
 because with audi would ask which car 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.580
 We should build it very clearly 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.889
 say sportback why 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.750
 For one thing, I think there is enough suv 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.180
 on the streets and on the other like 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.500
 me this limousine coupe form right 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.690
 really good 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.110
 another point is, of course 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.860
 mercedes cl would have a really nice one 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.139
 competitors and then I'm fine again 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.949
 really nice duel ingolstadt against 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:26.659
 stuttgart and how it works out yes 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:28.699
 hopefully in our car with this 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:30.680
 If you wish, the test drive ends and 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.539
 despite the police escort and the passenger 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.259
 I gladly rejoice the car 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:35.259
 to be able to turn off 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.030
 The designers are convinced that 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.280
 the two variants of tt sportback 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.199
 and offroad fit into the audi program 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.000
 certainly one or the other 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:54.560
 Customer of aaa or core models 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.930
 So I would change 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.969
 to wish 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.380
 We are very honest and we are 

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:02.860
 looking forward to ingolstadt 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:06.680
 after all, it decides in the spring 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:11.259
 2015 a new series tt namely 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.259
 roadster the open tt pleasure
