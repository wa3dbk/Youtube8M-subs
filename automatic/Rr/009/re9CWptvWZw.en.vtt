00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.529
 and then we meet again today I will introduce you and the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.590
 legislator so that's part of the purchases I made 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.469
 during my visit to women and men of course that I have you 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.209
 presented on paris by bastille 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.460
 so really I keep saying a little bit if you have the opportunity to move on to 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.849
 the act on bastille go go ahead it's really an exceptional boutique held 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:24.949
 by professionals very good advice 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.819
 so percent in this respect so can leave a reprieve 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:33.149
 good here is the title had last recorded on the compact range which 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.530
 had made his glory 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.829
 a lot of tactics 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.160
 the perfect set is a death knife that is perfect 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.330
 Why 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.090
 because you have 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.150
 its condition is very compact 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.720
 in terms of size if you want to see grant the four experts course 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.390
 this is the level of the station so we can think a little smaller 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.190
 again 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.480
 so we have a knife 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.080
 in addition with a very very good specification 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.580
 plate and screws 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.280
 at the neck 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.250
 we have not 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.020
 platelets it's anna 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.920
 for the neck party with 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.410
 after the exodus 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.210
 auxerre 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.350
 here and there 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.350
 then it is founded 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.880
 not really very very good product 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.500
 as for the right-handed or left-handed covers the particularity 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.590
 of these annoying the fact of having stopped directly on the blade 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.500
 as you can see in your 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.320
 there is no stubborn 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.229
 agreement 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.700
 the abutment and directly on the blade of the goods 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.640
 it is to be on the Shiite movement was rather well done 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.420
 a coated paper version 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.220
 surveillance is ready to go up 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.830
 as you can see here 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.120
 and this is the belt clip 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.820
 all sectors are equipped with belts this way there is I 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.810
 very very badly to locate in this sense us if you put on a 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.460
 simple put back to the belt but fits in the pocket 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.010
 you have all the part of the knife that comes out of this pool of blood you do not 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.579
 was not worn by elvis presley 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.939
 it is the reproach that I would europe and simple of these factors we have a blow 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.579
 belt very very low so that we have in hand a raid 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.149
 very important maybe downwind 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:19.200
 but these three little ones 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.659
 both paws 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.430
 I say it very clearly as we reproduced 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.790
 % of a knife and hurt so there we are really on which he is 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.099
 nice reputation that is more to do 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.930
 a version he did very little
