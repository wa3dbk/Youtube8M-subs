our new superfast stick today we're

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.019 
our new superfast stick today we're
actually<00:00:19.199> be<00:00:19.439> doing<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.920> motion<00:00:20.550> capture<00:00:20.699> of

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
actually be doing a motion capture of

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.060 
actually be doing a motion capture of
Jonathan's<00:00:21.449> swing<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.320> we<00:00:22.470> can<00:00:22.650> do<00:00:22.769> some

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
Jonathan's swing so we can do some

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.679 
Jonathan's swing so we can do some
analysis<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.580> make<00:00:23.850> sure<00:00:24.000> again<00:00:24.180> we<00:00:24.359> put<00:00:24.510> that

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
analysis and make sure again we put that

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.570 
analysis and make sure again we put that
back<00:00:24.869> into<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> product<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.800> also<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.430> get

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
back into the product and also to get

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.690 
back into the product and also to get
Jon's<00:00:27.090> feedback<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.720> our<00:00:27.840> new<00:00:27.930> product

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.590 

Jonathan<00:00:35.700> one<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.090> things<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.329> did<00:00:36.510> on

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
Jonathan one of the things we did on

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.970 
Jonathan one of the things we did on
this<00:00:36.750> stick<00:00:36.989> we've<00:00:37.230> actually<00:00:37.380> changed<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
this stick we've actually changed the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.910 
this stick we've actually changed the
blade<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.000> have<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.320> speed<00:00:40.320> pocket<00:00:40.739> now<00:00:40.860> in

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
blade so we have a speed pocket now in

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.310 
blade so we have a speed pocket now in
the<00:00:41.040> blade<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.610> whole<00:00:41.879> idea<00:00:42.210> behind<00:00:42.320> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the blade so the whole idea behind the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.500 
the blade so the whole idea behind the
RBZ<00:00:43.680> family<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.760> idea<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.090> trampoline

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
RBZ family is that idea that trampoline

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.940 
RBZ family is that idea that trampoline
effect<00:00:45.660> off<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> blades<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.469> get<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.739> nice

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
effect off the blades to get that nice

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.709 
effect off the blades to get that nice
fast<00:00:47.309> release<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.850> fast<00:00:48.149> pop<00:00:48.480> off<00:00:48.690> your

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
fast release that fast pop off your

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.750 
fast release that fast pop off your
blade<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.680> what<00:00:49.860> we've<00:00:50.010> done<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.370> we've<00:00:50.489> taken

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
blade and what we've done is we've taken

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.180 
blade and what we've done is we've taken
and<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.539> now<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> full<00:00:52.410> pocket<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.920> speed

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and have now a full pocket a speed

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.430 
and have now a full pocket a speed
pocket<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> RBZ<00:00:54.059> super<00:00:54.480> fast<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.320> that's

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
pocket on the RBZ super fast so that's

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.660 
pocket on the RBZ super fast so that's
really<00:00:55.649> what<00:00:55.860> you're<00:00:55.920> gonna<00:00:56.039> feel<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.460> terms

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
really what you're gonna feel in terms

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.520 
really what you're gonna feel in terms
of<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.910> trampoline<00:00:57.149> effect<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:58.170> gonna<00:00:58.320> be

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
of that trampoline effect it's gonna be

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.500 
of that trampoline effect it's gonna be
even<00:00:58.890> more<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.460> effect<00:00:59.940> where<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.210> had

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
even more of that effect where you had

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.200 
even more of that effect where you had
on<00:01:01.109> your<00:01:01.230> previous<00:01:01.410> versions

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.580 

when<00:01:08.210> I<00:01:08.240> go<00:01:08.479> release<00:01:08.810> in<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.109> back<00:01:09.259> and<00:01:09.500> just

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
when I go release in the back and just

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.950 
when I go release in the back and just
come<00:01:09.920> paints<00:01:10.759> come<00:01:11.000> come<00:01:11.390> lay<00:01:11.539> quicker<00:01:11.810> a

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
come paints come come lay quicker a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.260 
come paints come come lay quicker a
little<00:01:12.170> bit<00:01:12.289> I<00:01:12.579> think<00:01:13.579> it's<00:01:13.700> good<00:01:13.880> I<00:01:13.909> mean<00:01:14.030> when

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
little bit I think it's good I mean when

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.060 
little bit I think it's good I mean when
you<00:01:14.360> come<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:14.899> know<00:01:15.110> got<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:15.740> goalie<00:01:15.950> you

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
you come you know got the goalie you

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.249 
you come you know got the goalie you
know<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.429> goalie<00:01:16.729> things<00:01:17.600> gonna<00:01:17.780> be<00:01:17.869> able<00:01:18.049> to

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
know the goalie things gonna be able to

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.109 
know the goalie things gonna be able to
slower<00:01:18.500> but<00:01:18.710> it<00:01:18.860> comes<00:01:19.009> quicker<00:01:21.969> the<00:01:22.969> other

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
slower but it comes quicker the other

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.730 
slower but it comes quicker the other
thing<00:01:23.299> about<00:01:23.329> the<00:01:23.630> RBZ<00:01:24.020> family<00:01:24.380> we've<00:01:24.530> always

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
thing about the RBZ family we've always

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.440 
thing about the RBZ family we've always
had<00:01:25.009> as<00:01:25.159> well<00:01:25.310> boys<00:01:25.520> had<00:01:25.670> that<00:01:25.850> custom<00:01:26.270> kick

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
had as well boys had that custom kick

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.910 
had as well boys had that custom kick
point<00:01:26.689> so<00:01:26.959> that<00:01:27.079> constants<00:01:27.590> different

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
point so that constants different

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.949 
point so that constants different
profile<00:01:28.310> so<00:01:28.909> we<00:01:29.000> can<00:01:29.119> show<00:01:29.299> you<00:01:29.329> later<00:01:29.630> on<00:01:29.750> the

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
profile so we can show you later on the

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:31.690 
profile so we can show you later on the
video<00:01:30.229> is<00:01:30.530> when<00:01:30.890> you<00:01:30.920> can<00:01:31.219> move<00:01:31.310> your<00:01:31.520> bottom

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
video is when you can move your bottom

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.639 
video is when you can move your bottom
hand<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.569> stick<00:01:32.810> actually<00:01:33.229> flex<00:01:33.530> the

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
hand the stick actually flex the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:34.809 
hand the stick actually flex the
difference<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.130> if<00:01:34.219> you're<00:01:34.310> taking<00:01:34.579> a<00:01:34.640> wrist

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
difference so if you're taking a wrist

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:36.639 
difference so if you're taking a wrist
shot<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.539> your<00:01:35.659> hand<00:01:35.840> more<00:01:36.020> towards<00:01:36.319> the<00:01:36.409> top

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
shot and your hand more towards the top

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.499 
shot and your hand more towards the top
the<00:01:37.130> stick<00:01:37.369> isn't<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.670> flex<00:01:37.939> more<00:01:38.149> towards<00:01:38.420> the

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
the stick isn't a flex more towards the

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.210 
the stick isn't a flex more towards the
top<00:01:38.720> but<00:01:39.229> if<00:01:39.289> you<00:01:39.349> take<00:01:39.470> a<00:01:39.500> slap<00:01:39.799> shot<00:01:39.829> you

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
top but if you take a slap shot you

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.649 
top but if you take a slap shot you
really<00:01:40.429> lean<00:01:40.579> until<00:01:40.909> your<00:01:41.060> hand<00:01:41.239> moves<00:01:41.450> down

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
really lean until your hand moves down

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.510 
really lean until your hand moves down
just<00:01:42.229> take<00:01:42.349> actually<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.890> Flex<00:01:43.130> point<00:01:43.399> when

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
just take actually the Flex point when

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.919 
just take actually the Flex point when
you<00:01:43.610> further<00:01:43.819> down<00:01:44.060> so<00:01:44.599> that's<00:01:44.720> that

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
you further down so that's that

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:46.510 
you further down so that's that
constants<00:01:45.530> difference<00:01:45.829> profile<00:01:46.250> that<00:01:46.399> we

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
constants difference profile that we

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.460 
constants difference profile that we
have<00:01:46.670> in<00:01:46.819> our<00:01:46.880> circuit<00:01:49.720> it<00:01:50.720> didn't<00:01:51.049> it<00:01:51.170> doesn't

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
have in our circuit it didn't it doesn't

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.169 
have in our circuit it didn't it doesn't
flex<00:01:51.679> at<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:51.979> bottom<00:01:52.310> first<00:01:52.579> you<00:01:52.700> know<00:01:52.819> always

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
flex at the bottom first you know always

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.969 
flex at the bottom first you know always
go<00:01:53.479> wait<00:01:53.689> where<00:01:53.959> your<00:01:54.140> hand<00:01:54.319> is<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:54.679> I<00:01:54.739> think

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
go wait where your hand is so I think

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.889 
go wait where your hand is so I think
it's<00:01:55.099> good<00:01:55.280> for<00:01:55.310> your<00:01:55.579> cue<00:01:56.209> accuracy<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:56.840> I

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
it's good for your cue accuracy and I

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.990 
it's good for your cue accuracy and I
think<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.170> power<00:01:57.349> you<00:01:57.619> have<00:01:57.739> so<00:01:58.039> on<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:58.789> video

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
think the power you have so on the video

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.850 
think the power you have so on the video
you<00:01:59.179> see<00:01:59.420> where<00:01:59.599> you<00:01:59.719> keep<00:02:00.049> stick<00:02:00.289> backs<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:00.799> I

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
you see where you keep stick backs and I

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.740 
you see where you keep stick backs and I
think<00:02:01.069> it's<00:02:01.159> always<00:02:01.310> will<00:02:01.579> you<00:02:01.670> put<00:02:01.849> your<00:02:01.880> hand

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750
