concealer palette and it comes in green
yellow<00:00:10.019> pink<00:00:11.240> to<00:00:12.240> skin<00:00:12.540> tones<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.230> darker

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
yellow pink to skin tones and a darker

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.039 
yellow pink to skin tones and a darker
kind<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.280> bronzy<00:00:14.639> skin<00:00:14.910> tone<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.809> comes

kind of bronzy skin tone and it comes

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.859 
kind of bronzy skin tone and it comes
with<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> little<00:00:17.359> applicator<00:00:18.359> brush<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:18.810> you

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
with a little applicator brush so you

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.990 
with a little applicator brush so you
can<00:00:19.020> just<00:00:19.279> apply<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:22.580> basically<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.699> think

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
can just apply and basically I think

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.790 
can just apply and basically I think
this<00:00:24.090> palette<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.539> pretty<00:00:24.900> good<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.410> not

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
this palette is pretty good it's not

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.849 
this palette is pretty good it's not
great<00:00:26.310> but<00:00:26.340> um<00:00:27.300> what<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.109> really<00:00:28.470> like<00:00:28.710> about

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
great but um what I really like about

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.010 
great but um what I really like about
this<00:00:29.220> palette<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:30.480> um<00:00:31.940> the<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.510> helps

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
this palette is that um the it helps

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.270 
this palette is that um the it helps
great<00:00:34.410> with<00:00:34.559> discoloration<00:00:35.690> except<00:00:36.690> with<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
great with discoloration except with the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.670 
great with discoloration except with the
green<00:00:39.090> I'd<00:00:39.450> say<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.809> green<00:00:40.020> doesn't<00:00:40.260> work<00:00:40.500> as

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
green I'd say the green doesn't work as

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.990 
green I'd say the green doesn't work as
great<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.129> discoloration<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:41.670> everything

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
great for discoloration but everything

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.680 
great for discoloration but everything
else<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.300> pretty<00:00:42.510> good<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.879> the<00:00:44.879> only<00:00:45.120> flaw<00:00:45.390> I

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
else is pretty good and the only flaw I

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.600 
else is pretty good and the only flaw I
would<00:00:45.870> say<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.980> doesn't<00:00:47.280> work<00:00:47.370> great

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
would say is that it doesn't work great

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.270 
would say is that it doesn't work great
with<00:00:47.700> blemishes<00:00:47.969> or<00:00:48.559> not<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.739> perfect<00:00:49.920> skin

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
with blemishes or not so perfect skin

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.350 
with blemishes or not so perfect skin
like<00:00:50.460> rough<00:00:50.730> skin<00:00:51.180> or<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:52.110> big<00:00:52.320> pores<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
like rough skin or we have big pores and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.459 
like rough skin or we have big pores and
the<00:00:54.360> reason<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.629> say<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.050> because<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
the reason I say that is because the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.189 
the reason I say that is because the
consistency<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.579> palette<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.360> really

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
consistency of the palette is really

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.610 
consistency of the palette is really
creamy<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.030> it<00:01:00.030> doesn't<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.379> creamy

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
creamy and it doesn't and it's so creamy

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.709 
creamy and it doesn't and it's so creamy
that<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.920> put<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.850> know<00:01:03.629> how

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
that you put it on and you know how

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.109 
that you put it on and you know how
blemishes<00:01:04.140> are<00:01:04.290> usually<00:01:04.559> oily<00:01:05.070> then<00:01:05.700> if<00:01:05.970> you

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
blemishes are usually oily then if you

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.510 
blemishes are usually oily then if you
kind<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.990> put<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:08.369> it

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
kind of if you put it on it's like it

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.580 
kind of if you put it on it's like it
wipes<00:01:08.850> off<00:01:09.090> really<00:01:09.390> easily<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:11.040> um<00:01:11.420> it

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
wipes off really easily and it um it

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.320 
wipes off really easily and it um it
just<00:01:13.590> doesn't<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.250> won't<00:01:14.460> stay<00:01:14.790> under<00:01:15.180> your

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
just doesn't it won't stay under your

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.620 
just doesn't it won't stay under your
foundation<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.280> that's<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.360> only

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
foundation so that that's the only

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.520 
foundation so that that's the only
negative<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.259> would<00:01:19.439> say<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:21.020> as<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.880> the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
negative I would say and as for the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.060 
negative I would say and as for the
actual<00:01:25.530> each<00:01:26.159> one<00:01:26.869> I'd<00:01:27.869> say<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.380> green<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
actual each one I'd say the green is the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.590 
actual each one I'd say the green is the
only<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:29.430> I'm<00:01:29.610> actually<00:01:30.060> kind<00:01:30.540> of

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
only one I'm actually kind of

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.770 
only one I'm actually kind of
disappointed<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.640> because<00:01:32.640> green<00:01:33.540> is

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
disappointed in because green is

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.490 
disappointed in because green is
supposed<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.290> hide<00:01:35.130> redness<00:01:36.290> because<00:01:37.290> like

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
supposed to hide redness because like

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.289 
supposed to hide redness because like
they're<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> opposite<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.640> color

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
they're on the opposite of the color

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.810 
they're on the opposite of the color
wheel<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.960> they<00:01:40.110> cancel<00:01:40.470> each<00:01:40.500> other<00:01:40.619> out<00:01:40.820> but

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
wheel so they cancel each other out but

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.810 
wheel so they cancel each other out but
um<00:01:42.740> based<00:01:43.740> off<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:43.979> theory<00:01:45.560> this<00:01:46.640> this<00:01:47.640> is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
um based off that theory this this is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.510 
um based off that theory this this is
the<00:01:48.000> green<00:01:48.240> concealer<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:49.020> not<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:49.979> green

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the green concealer it's not that green

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.160 
the green concealer it's not that green
and<00:01:51.049> because<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.380> green<00:01:53.540> it<00:01:54.540> won't

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and because it's not that green it won't

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.039 
and because it's not that green it won't
it<00:01:55.619> won't<00:01:55.649> cover<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> redness<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.969> well<00:01:57.149> so

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
it won't cover the redness that well so

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.420 
it won't cover the redness that well so
it<00:01:58.409> looks<00:01:58.649> almost<00:01:58.979> white<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.240> ask<00:02:00.390> me<00:02:00.659> so

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
it looks almost white if you ask me so

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.490 
it looks almost white if you ask me so
that<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:03.420> doesn't<00:02:03.600> really<00:02:03.750> make<00:02:03.930> sense<00:02:03.990> to

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
that that doesn't really make sense to

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.469 
that that doesn't really make sense to
me<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.340> doesn't<00:02:05.520> really<00:02:05.759> do<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.030> well<00:02:06.299> vag

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
me so it doesn't really do that well vag

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.389 
me so it doesn't really do that well vag
all<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.810> green<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.140> does<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.469> little<00:02:07.890> bit<00:02:08.039> but

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
all the green it does a little bit but

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.940 
all the green it does a little bit but
not<00:02:08.459> enough<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:09.569> i<00:02:09.599> need<00:02:10.020> personally<00:02:10.709> or<00:02:10.890> i

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
not enough that i need personally or i

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.809 
not enough that i need personally or i
would<00:02:11.910> like<00:02:12.090> so

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
would like so

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.220 
would like so
how's<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.060> odd<00:02:14.239> to<00:02:14.269> say<00:02:14.450> about<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.719> green<00:02:14.959> and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
how's it odd to say about the green and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.489

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
eye circles and they're not so bad right

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.940 
eye circles and they're not so bad right
now<00:02:35.329> like<00:02:35.689> but<00:02:36.200> I'm<00:02:36.409> wearing<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.799> right<00:02:36.829> now

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
now like but I'm wearing it right now

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.129 
now like but I'm wearing it right now
and<00:02:37.069> it<00:02:37.280> looks<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:38.329> doesn't<00:02:38.659> it<00:02:38.840> doesn't<00:02:38.870> look

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:39.139 
and it looks it doesn't it doesn't look

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.530 
and it looks it doesn't it doesn't look
like<00:02:39.230> i<00:02:39.379> have<00:02:39.500> really<00:02:39.829> bad<00:02:40.040> circles<00:02:40.579> so<00:02:40.790> it

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
like i have really bad circles so it

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.179 
like i have really bad circles so it
works<00:02:41.719> pretty<00:02:41.810> good<00:02:42.019> like<00:02:42.379> my<00:02:42.709> normal

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:43.189 
works pretty good like my normal

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.220 
works pretty good like my normal
pantsuit<00:02:43.579> concealer<00:02:43.999> can't<00:02:44.299> do<00:02:44.419> that<00:02:44.569> so<00:02:44.930> I

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
pantsuit concealer can't do that so I

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.629 
pantsuit concealer can't do that so I
think<00:02:45.560> that's<00:02:45.799> great<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.250> for<00:02:46.879> the<00:02:47.000> pink<00:02:47.389> um

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
think that's great and for the pink um

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.399 
think that's great and for the pink um
that's<00:02:49.639> supposed<00:02:50.090> to<00:02:50.269> highlight<00:02:50.900> your<00:02:50.930> you

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
that's supposed to highlight your you

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.369 
that's supposed to highlight your you
know<00:02:51.530> cheekbones<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.340> brow<00:02:53.030> bone<00:02:53.299> and<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:54.109> find

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
know cheekbones and brow bone and I find

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.059 
know cheekbones and brow bone and I find
that<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:55.010> works<00:02:55.370> well<00:02:56.260> for<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.290> base<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.799> wouldn't

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
that it works well for a base I wouldn't

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.640 
that it works well for a base I wouldn't
use<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.340> alone<00:02:59.120> but<00:02:59.689> if<00:02:59.810> you<00:02:59.930> if<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:00.349> use<00:03:00.500> it

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
use it alone but if you if you use it

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.990 
use it alone but if you if you use it
and<00:03:00.799> then<00:03:00.889> put<00:03:00.919> your<00:03:01.159> highlight<00:03:01.549> over<00:03:01.819> it<00:03:01.909> i

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
and then put your highlight over it i

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.220 
and then put your highlight over it i
think<00:03:02.209> it'll<00:03:02.359> really<00:03:02.569> make<00:03:02.719> it<00:03:02.870> your

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
think it'll really make it your

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.679 
think it'll really make it your
cheekbones<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.949> the<00:03:04.909> high<00:03:05.060> points<00:03:05.480> in<00:03:05.569> your

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:05.689 
cheekbones and the high points in your

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.709 
cheekbones and the high points in your
face<00:03:05.870> really<00:03:06.079> pop<00:03:06.439> and<00:03:06.769> um<00:03:07.699> it<00:03:08.239> would<00:03:08.419> make<00:03:08.689> it

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:08.719 
face really pop and um it would make it

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.349 
face really pop and um it would make it
more<00:03:08.989> long-lasting<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:09.889> I<00:03:09.919> like<00:03:10.219> that<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.790> as

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
more long-lasting so I like that and as

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:17.199 
more long-lasting so I like that and as
for<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.629> three<00:03:11.900> um<00:03:13.719> color<00:03:14.859> skin<00:03:15.859> tones<00:03:16.069> um<00:03:16.370> I

for the three um color skin tones um I

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.599
