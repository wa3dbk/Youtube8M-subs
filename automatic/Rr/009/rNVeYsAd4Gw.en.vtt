00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:08.299
 we follow here in 85 his name by 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:10.889
 please Miguel angel did not want the vice 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:15.089
 because it's called the okay because 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.179
 I took that nickname from Chavito and 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.089
 they put the nickname of the vice and so it takes 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:23.820
 my name the pulquerÃ­a although how many 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.039
 years has that crap to exist 19 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.419
 years 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:32.419
 how good this came from pulque and 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:35.840
 I bring it from a very young man when I 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:39.350
 I was 14 years old I worked with 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.659
 an uncle that he was compadre of the owner of the 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.300
 tinacal of aculco and that's where I 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:47.340
 I started to support the pulque branch 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.760
 and then here you prepare the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.620
 pulque and everything here I prepare it I do it 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.440
 He cured him and I already only have the people 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.170
 cured the pulque as is the process of 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.150
 elaboration of this because good depends 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.369
 what do they want to know about white or 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.400
 cured 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.600
 well the white pulque is extracted from 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.909
 maguey that is the juice of the maguey that 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.060
 we call it honey water honey water or 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.539
 You take it out of the maguey and you put it to ferment 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.759
 on the third day it is pulque after 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.190
 that procedure that is because I already 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.280
 comes the preparation that is part of me 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:33.330
 business that is to do it cured with fruits 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.179
 pineapple guava oat tomato is not 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.530
 mamey opinion of all varieties 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:41.940
 the fruits 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.940
 there is a 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.460
 strong is to say with a blender or 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.520
 how it was done and the giant key doom 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.979
 two types should do the curing not good 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.640
 that is important there are fruits that are 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.400
 they have to crush with a stick in a 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.890
 wooden container also because yes 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.729
 you put the blender gives it the flavor 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.190
 iron then that flavor can not only 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.380
 remove you have to do it by hand and there are by 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.680
 say the cereals like the nut the 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.170
 Oats peanut because it is and they hold the 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.080
 blender blade and you must one of 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.720
 do it with the blender when the 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.440
 beer arrived here in Mexico over there 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.370
 the 1900s 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.270
 in companies these that came to 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.310
 compete in the market 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.370
 they ran a black legend that the 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.850
 pulque you got some mona not for 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.900
 what ferment this is true that part 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.400
 we are not going is totally false 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.800
 good in those times of the 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.170
 landowners 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.930
 the pulque called the hacendados the 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.150
 white parrot because this was what 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.610
 he left more taxes that took him to 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.740
 the gain to Spain that here 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.260
 They called in Mexico the new Spain now 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:06.720
 then when the beer came 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.310
 they invented a legend not a myth that the 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.860
 Pulque fermented it with time 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.140
 when it is pure everything is a lie 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.380
 because if as you know why 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.490
 they are live bacteria and it is the bacteria 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.740
 to be very careful about hygiene 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:26.420
 feed him because he's just like 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:30.630
 let's talk about a relative of 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.850
 the Bulgarians of the typical ones that 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.290
 they call them or they are live bacteria 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.260
 pulque are also bacteria and you have to 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.220
 feed it either with honey or sweet water 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.900
 or sugar 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.450
 because there is something else that you want 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.860
 add then that I can add what you 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:54.150
 I was invited to all the friends of the 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:56.770
