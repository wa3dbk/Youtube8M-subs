00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Training a One Way Alert

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.001
(for sounds, diabetic and other medical alerts)

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:05.522
One way sound alerts are trained

00:00:05.523 --> 00:00:07.003
when you want a dog to alert you to

00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:08.514
a specific sound, but you do not want him to

00:00:08.515 --> 00:00:10.005
lead you to the source.

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:11.506
Train and practice the alert behavior first.

00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:13.507
You may want your dog to paw your hand, nudge your knee,

00:00:13.508 --> 00:00:15.008
lay down beside you etc.

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.509
* indicates a click to mark the desired behavior

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.010
Use a target such as a piece of tape.

00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:25.011
Change positions.

00:00:25.012 --> 00:00:28.012
This helps prevent superstitious behavior

00:00:29.013 --> 00:00:33.013
and your dog learns to be consistent in the alert location.

00:00:38.014 --> 00:00:41.014
Add Distance

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:45.015
Because I am changing one criteria (distance)

00:00:46.016 --> 00:00:49.016
I am more lax on another (exact location of the nudge)

00:00:58.017 --> 00:01:01.017
Distance is added over several training sessions.

00:01:01.018 --> 00:01:03.018
Placing a piece of tape on the floor at the distance

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.019
you are working on

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.020
keeps you from asking for too much.

00:01:08.021 --> 00:01:11.021
Connect the Alarm Sound to the Alert Behavior

00:01:14.022 --> 00:01:16.022
(Bzzzzz represents the alarm sound)

00:01:17.023 --> 00:01:20.023
I help her by pointing to the nudge location the first few times.

00:01:23.024 --> 00:01:25.024
Fade the alert behavior cue

00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:27.025
so the alarm sound  itself become the cue

00:01:27.026 --> 00:01:29.026
to do the alert behavior.

00:01:37.027 --> 00:01:40.027
Fade the nose target (green tape)

00:01:43.028 --> 00:01:45.028
I fade the finger point the second time.

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:47.329
Change Positions

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.030
Stand up, face away, turn to the side, squat, crouch,

00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:51.031
lay down, face the sink etc.

00:02:08.032 --> 00:02:11.032
The tape on my leg helps her to target the right spot.

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:14.033
Add Distance (in one foot intervals)

00:02:29.034 --> 00:02:31.034
Mark the distance of the floor with a piece of tape.

00:02:44.035 --> 00:02:47.035
Change Position of the Dog in Relation to the Sound

00:02:53.036 --> 00:02:56.036
Jessie must pass the sound to get to me.

00:03:05.037 --> 00:03:08.037
Jessie hesitates with her new postion in relation to the sound

00:03:08.038 --> 00:03:10.038
but I give her a few seconds to figure out what to do.

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:15.039
This is more familiar as I am standing near the source of the sound.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.040
Practice Two Criteria Together

00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:18.041
I start with an upright position

00:03:22.042 --> 00:03:25.042
before changing to one she has trained, but not as much.

00:03:37.043 --> 00:03:40.043
Ask a Helper to Set off the Sound

00:03:43.044 --> 00:03:45.044
My helper was asked to avoid eye contact

00:03:45.055 --> 00:03:47.045
and to ignore any attempts to alert him.

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:50.046
Jessie quickly figures out that she is only rewarded

00:03:50.047 --> 00:03:51.047
for alerting me.

00:04:01.048 --> 00:04:04.048
Add Distractions one at a time

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.049
Set the Alarm for Longer Intervals like 5 to 15 minutes.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.050
then periodically throughout the day.

00:04:18.051 --> 00:04:20.051
Trigger the alarm when you dog is:

00:04:20.052 --> 00:04:23.052
relaxing, in a light sleep, in a deep sleep (after much training)

00:04:32.053 --> 00:04:34.053
Jackpot Reward!

00:04:36.054 --> 00:04:39.054
Generalize the Behavior by Training from the Beginning

00:04:39.055 --> 00:04:41.055
at several different locations.

00:04:41.056 --> 00:04:43.056
In the garage,

00:04:47.057 --> 00:04:49.057
on the deck etc

00:04:51.058 --> 00:04:53.058
Take Training on the Road

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:56.059
to your office or wherever you might need the alert.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.440
Use this process to train for:

00:04:57.441 --> 00:04:59.061
person calling your name, wake up alarm, fire alarm,

00:04:59.062 --> 00:05:01.062
smoke detector, horn honking, car or truck backing up,

00:05:01.063 --> 00:05:02.503
low blood sugar levels (diabetic alert)

00:05:03.024 --> 00:05:06.064
One Way Alert is the first half of training a Two Way Alert.

00:05:06.065 --> 00:05:08.065

00:05:13.066 --> 00:05:16.066

00:05:16.067 --> 00:05:18.067
