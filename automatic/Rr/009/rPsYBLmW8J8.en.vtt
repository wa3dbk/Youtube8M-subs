if you don't know it's there you may

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.670 
if you don't know it's there you may
drop<00:02:03.300> it<00:02:03.510> and<00:02:03.570> lose<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.080> will<00:02:04.260> need<00:02:04.440> that

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
drop it and lose it you will need that

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.070 
drop it and lose it you will need that
to<00:02:04.830> seal<00:02:05.100> these<00:02:05.280> up<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:06.390> you'll<00:02:06.540> have<00:02:06.600> one<00:02:06.930> at

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
to seal these up and you'll have one at

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.729 
to seal these up and you'll have one at
both<00:02:07.230> ends<00:02:08.899> then<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.019> replacement<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
both ends then a replacement of the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.860 
both ends then a replacement of the
filter<00:02:12.319> is<00:02:13.819> nothing<00:02:14.819> more<00:02:15.060> than<00:02:15.300> just<00:02:15.629> simply

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
filter is nothing more than just simply

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.339 
filter is nothing more than just simply
unbolting<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.129> revolting<00:02:17.870> now<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.170> is

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
unbolting and revolting now this is

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.930 
unbolting and revolting now this is
tapped<00:02:19.590> into<00:02:19.830> threads<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.370> are<00:02:20.430> tapped<00:02:20.700> into

tapped into threads that are tapped into
the<00:02:21.150> frame<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:21.840> just<00:02:22.019> put<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.200> wrench

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
the frame so you can just put a wrench

the frame so you can just put a wrench
on<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:22.859> take<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.519> loop<00:02:23.730> out<00:02:23.969> I<00:02:25.430> find<00:02:26.430> if<00:02:26.609> you

on this take that loop out I find if you

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.729 
on this take that loop out I find if you
take<00:02:27.060> you're<00:02:27.629> going<00:02:27.749> to<00:02:27.810> be<00:02:27.930> turning<00:02:28.170> this

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739

fitting<00:02:29.129> down<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.510> loosen<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.209> set<00:02:33.510> your

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
fitting down to loosen so you set your

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.470 
fitting down to loosen so you set your
wrenches<00:02:33.959> like<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.469> and<00:02:34.999> then<00:02:35.999> with<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.209> little

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
wrenches like so and then with a little

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.920 
wrenches like so and then with a little
hand<00:02:36.689> pressure<00:02:38.120> you'll<00:02:39.120> just<00:02:39.329> crack<00:02:39.599> it<00:02:39.749> loose

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
hand pressure you'll just crack it loose

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.059 
hand pressure you'll just crack it loose
you<00:02:41.540> can<00:02:42.540> see<00:02:42.749> we<00:02:42.870> got<00:02:43.049> some<00:02:43.109> dirt<00:02:43.499> and<00:02:43.530> whatnot

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
you can see we got some dirt and whatnot

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.879 
you can see we got some dirt and whatnot
coming<00:02:44.340> out<00:02:44.489> of<00:02:44.609> there<00:02:44.730> but<00:02:45.349> one<00:02:46.349> more<00:02:46.560> turn

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889

since<00:03:02.549> you've<00:03:02.730> changed<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.150> filter<00:03:03.329> you're

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
since you've changed the filter you're

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.149 
since you've changed the filter you're
gonna<00:03:03.719> have<00:03:03.930> some<00:03:04.109> corrosion<00:03:04.290> built<00:03:04.769> up<00:03:04.980> on

that what I would recommend is before

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.649 
that what I would recommend is before
you<00:03:07.829> even<00:03:08.010> get<00:03:08.219> into<00:03:08.400> changing<00:03:08.909> is<00:03:09.060> get<00:03:09.480> some

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
you even get into changing is get some

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.110 
you even get into changing is get some

just to break things loose and this

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.699 
just to break things loose and this
should<00:03:35.849> eventually<00:03:36.090> work<00:03:36.540> loose<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.349> if<00:03:37.590> it

should eventually work loose and if it

doesn't even right away just by working
back<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.739> forth<00:03:40.909> eventually<00:03:41.909> it'll<00:03:42.060> crack

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
back and forth eventually it'll crack

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.149 
back and forth eventually it'll crack
loose<00:03:42.599> and<00:03:42.900> you'll<00:03:43.139> be<00:03:43.290> able<00:03:43.439> to<00:03:43.680> change<00:03:43.950> it

that's the site that's going to be
facing<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:17.280> engine<00:04:18.049> so<00:04:19.049> it'll<00:04:19.380> be<00:04:19.470> installed

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
facing the engine so it'll be installed

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.580

in that position you don't want to get
it<00:04:22.710> backwards<00:04:22.919> it'll<00:04:23.669> reduce<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.150> efficiency

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
it backwards it'll reduce the efficiency

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.659 
it backwards it'll reduce the efficiency
of<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.870> filter<00:04:25.230> and<00:04:25.350> that's<00:04:26.160> pretty<00:04:26.460> much<00:04:26.610> a
