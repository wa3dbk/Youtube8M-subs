00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
we're going to be going over a quick way

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.420 
we're going to be going over a quick way
to<00:00:29.450> remove<00:00:29.990> a<00:00:30.080> scratch<00:00:30.410> by<00:00:30.740> sanding<00:00:31.250> and

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
to remove a scratch by sanding and

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:40.210 
to remove a scratch by sanding and
polishing<00:00:38.110> so<00:00:39.110> here's<00:00:39.320> our<00:00:39.410> scratch<00:00:39.739> here<00:00:40.040> on

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
polishing so here's our scratch here on

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.580 
polishing so here's our scratch here on
this<00:00:40.430> sale<00:00:40.700> panel<00:00:41.180> it<00:00:41.390> is<00:00:41.420> not<00:00:41.780> too<00:00:42.080> deep<00:00:42.290> and

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
this sale panel it is not too deep and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.229 
this sale panel it is not too deep and
generally<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:43.610> rule<00:00:43.790> is<00:00:43.970> when<00:00:44.120> you're

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
generally the rule is when you're

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.910 
generally the rule is when you're
polishing<00:00:44.750> if<00:00:44.870> you<00:00:44.960> can<00:00:45.110> catch<00:00:45.320> it<00:00:45.350> with<00:00:45.710> your

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
polishing if you can catch it with your

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.040 
polishing if you can catch it with your
fingernail<00:00:46.670> then<00:00:47.150> it's<00:00:47.360> not<00:00:47.450> going<00:00:47.630> to<00:00:47.720> polish

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
fingernail then it's not going to polish

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.320 
fingernail then it's not going to polish
out<00:00:48.280> this<00:00:49.280> one<00:00:49.460> here<00:00:49.489> you<00:00:49.850> could<00:00:50.000> sort<00:00:50.239> of

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
out this one here you could sort of

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.680 
out this one here you could sort of
catch<00:00:50.890> just<00:00:51.890> all<00:00:52.100> along<00:00:52.519> that<00:00:52.670> style<00:00:53.089> lines<00:00:53.420> so

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
catch just all along that style lines so

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.479 
catch just all along that style lines so
I'm<00:00:53.870> a<00:00:53.960> bit<00:00:54.170> concerned<00:00:54.199> on<00:00:54.710> how<00:00:54.739> much<00:00:55.250> of<00:00:55.400> this

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
I'm a bit concerned on how much of this

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.009 
I'm a bit concerned on how much of this
scratch<00:00:55.730> can<00:00:55.940> actually<00:00:56.210> get<00:00:56.330> out<00:00:56.449> so<00:00:56.660> we're

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
scratch can actually get out so we're

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.540 
scratch can actually get out so we're
gonna<00:00:57.110> have<00:00:57.320> a<00:00:57.350> go<00:00:57.530> at<00:00:57.710> it<00:00:57.739> and<00:00:58.010> start<00:00:58.370> sanding

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
gonna have a go at it and start sanding

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.640 
gonna have a go at it and start sanding
it<00:00:58.760> down<00:00:58.879> here<00:00:59.150> first<00:00:59.390> with<00:00:59.629> some<00:00:59.780> 1500<00:01:00.500> grit

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
it down here first with some 1500 grit

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.950 
it down here first with some 1500 grit
sandpaper<00:01:00.949> now<00:01:01.489> you<00:01:02.390> want<00:01:02.540> to<00:01:02.570> try<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:02.839> use<00:01:02.930> a

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
sandpaper now you want to try and use a

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.110 
sandpaper now you want to try and use a
block<00:01:03.290> here<00:01:03.650> whenever<00:01:03.980> possible<00:01:04.309> but<00:01:04.790> I<00:01:04.850> find

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
block here whenever possible but I find

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.330 
block here whenever possible but I find
sometimes<00:01:05.540> on<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.840> style<00:01:06.110> lines<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:06.920> need<00:01:07.100> to

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
sometimes on the style lines you need to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.640 
sometimes on the style lines you need to
switch<00:01:07.970> it<00:01:08.000> up<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:08.510> either<00:01:09.020> use<00:01:09.170> your<00:01:09.290> fingers

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
switch it up and either use your fingers

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.590 
switch it up and either use your fingers
or<00:01:09.830> use<00:01:10.070> something<00:01:10.400> a<00:01:10.430> little<00:01:10.640> smaller<00:01:10.970> to

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
or use something a little smaller to

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.670 
or use something a little smaller to
level<00:01:11.990> it<00:01:12.050> with<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.230> scratch<00:01:14.290> now<00:01:15.290> there's<00:01:15.590> a

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
level it with the scratch now there's a

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.230 
level it with the scratch now there's a
very<00:01:15.830> fine<00:01:16.130> line<00:01:16.190> between<00:01:16.520> sanding<00:01:17.090> too

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
very fine line between sanding too

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.690 
very fine line between sanding too
little<00:01:17.479> and<00:01:17.720> too<00:01:17.780> much<00:01:18.500> so<00:01:18.890> if<00:01:19.100> you<00:01:19.220> sand<00:01:19.430> too

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
little and too much so if you sand too

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.560 
little and too much so if you sand too
much<00:01:19.880> you're<00:01:20.060> going<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:20.240> go<00:01:20.330> right<00:01:20.540> through

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
much you're going to go right through

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.630 
much you're going to go right through
the<00:01:20.840> clear<00:01:21.170> into<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.740> base<00:01:21.980> coat<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.490> it's

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
the clear into the base coat and it's

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.510 
the clear into the base coat and it's
gonna<00:01:22.760> require<00:01:22.910> be<00:01:23.390> painting<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:25.040> fix<00:01:25.370> it

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
gonna require be painting to fix it

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.550 
gonna require be painting to fix it
properly<00:01:25.850> now<00:01:26.570> if<00:01:26.780> you<00:01:26.870> don't<00:01:26.990> say<00:01:27.200> it<00:01:27.230> enough

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
properly now if you don't say it enough

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.740 
properly now if you don't say it enough
then<00:01:27.890> you're<00:01:28.070> gonna<00:01:28.160> see<00:01:28.520> some<00:01:29.210> trace<00:01:29.480> of<00:01:29.630> the

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
then you're gonna see some trace of the

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.180 
then you're gonna see some trace of the
scratch<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:30.230> this<00:01:30.380> really<00:01:30.650> just<00:01:30.680> comes<00:01:31.100> with

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
scratch and this really just comes with

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.220 
scratch and this really just comes with
experience<00:01:31.550> I<00:01:32.120> can't<00:01:32.570> really<00:01:32.720> tell<00:01:33.050> you<00:01:33.080> how

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
experience I can't really tell you how

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.700 
experience I can't really tell you how
much<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:34.540> sand<00:01:35.540> out<00:01:35.960> before<00:01:36.440> you<00:01:36.530> break

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
much to sand out before you break

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.490 
much to sand out before you break
through<00:01:36.980> I<00:01:37.790> guess<00:01:38.420> once<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:38.870> kind<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.320> lose

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
through I guess once you kind of lose

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.370 
through I guess once you kind of lose
the<00:01:39.770> orange<00:01:39.890> peel<00:01:40.280> look<00:01:40.840> maybe<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:42.140> could<00:01:42.260> give

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
the orange peel look maybe it could give

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.990 
the orange peel look maybe it could give
you<00:01:42.470> some<00:01:42.740> sort<00:01:42.860> of<00:01:42.980> indication<00:01:43.340> that<00:01:43.640> you're

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
you some sort of indication that you're

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.390 
you some sort of indication that you're
running<00:01:44.150> out<00:01:44.390> of<00:01:44.480> space<00:01:44.720> but<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:46.190> know<00:01:46.310> an

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
running out of space but you know an

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.980 
running out of space but you know an
experience<00:01:46.850> is<00:01:46.910> really<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.390> biggest<00:01:47.570> factor

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
experience is really the biggest factor

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.830 
experience is really the biggest factor
here<00:01:48.140> either<00:01:48.290> way<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:48.650> are<00:01:48.860> impairing<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.850> UV

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
here either way you are impairing the UV

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.570 
here either way you are impairing the UV
protection<00:01:51.560> in<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:51.890> area<00:01:52.220> where<00:01:52.400> you've

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
protection in that area where you've

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.070 
protection in that area where you've
been<00:01:52.700> standing<00:01:55.300> once<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.480> sanding<00:01:56.930> is

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
been standing once the sanding is

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.530 
been standing once the sanding is
complete<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:57.740> should<00:01:57.890> have<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.460> hazy<00:01:58.940> kind<00:01:59.420> of

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
complete you should have a hazy kind of

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.300 
complete you should have a hazy kind of
look<00:01:59.750> over<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.230> area<00:02:00.560> where<00:02:00.800> your<00:02:00.950> ring<00:02:01.160> or

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
look over the area where your ring or

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.940 
look over the area where your ring or
sandpaper<00:02:01.730> over<00:02:02.150> and<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:03.110> polisher<00:02:03.590> is<00:02:03.620> going

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
sandpaper over and the polisher is going

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.410 
sandpaper over and the polisher is going
to<00:02:04.010> bring<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.310> shine<00:02:04.520> back<00:02:04.790> up<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.240> first

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
to bring the shine back up so the first

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.940 
to bring the shine back up so the first
step<00:02:05.690> we're<00:02:05.870> gonna<00:02:05.930> do<00:02:06.230> is<00:02:06.410> go<00:02:06.590> over<00:02:06.620> it<00:02:06.830> with<00:02:06.890> a

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
step we're gonna do is go over it with a

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.219 
step we're gonna do is go over it with a
coarse<00:02:07.280> cutting<00:02:08.000> compound<00:02:08.209> I'm<00:02:08.509> using<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.840> 3m

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
coarse cutting compound I'm using a 3m

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.070 
coarse cutting compound I'm using a 3m
system<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:09.920> that's<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.789> 3m<00:02:11.120> wool<00:02:11.330> pad<00:02:11.569> on<00:02:11.780> there

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
system and that's a 3m wool pad on there

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.830 
system and that's a 3m wool pad on there
with

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
with

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.750 
with
extra<00:02:14.590> cut<00:02:14.770> compound<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:15.489> could<00:02:15.610> use<00:02:15.730> a

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
extra cut compound you could use a

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.479 
extra cut compound you could use a
composit<00:02:16.360> foam<00:02:16.569> pad<00:02:16.870> as<00:02:17.050> well<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.770> just<00:02:18.160> chose

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
composit foam pad as well I just chose

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.040 
composit foam pad as well I just chose
to<00:02:18.610> use<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.849> wool<00:02:19.000> here<00:02:21.450> now<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:22.510> can<00:02:22.720> use<00:02:22.840> any

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
to use the wool here now you can use any

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.080 
to use the wool here now you can use any
system<00:02:23.410> you'd<00:02:23.530> like<00:02:23.739> most<00:02:24.370> companies<00:02:24.880> are

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
system you'd like most companies are

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.880 
system you'd like most companies are
gonna<00:02:25.209> have<00:02:25.480> between<00:02:25.840> two<00:02:26.050> to<00:02:26.170> three<00:02:26.200> polishes

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
gonna have between two to three polishes

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.620 
gonna have between two to three polishes
and<00:02:26.920> maybe<00:02:27.370> two<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.819> three<00:02:27.849> pounds<00:02:28.480> as<00:02:28.599> well

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
and maybe two to three pounds as well

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.460 
and maybe two to three pounds as well
and<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:30.400> general<00:02:30.819> idea<00:02:31.330> with<00:02:31.750> polishing<00:02:32.349> is

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
and the general idea with polishing is

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.380 
and the general idea with polishing is
you're<00:02:32.620> gradually<00:02:33.160> going<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.819> finer<00:02:34.150> and

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
you're gradually going to a finer and

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.780 
you're gradually going to a finer and
finer<00:02:34.420> compound<00:02:35.349> refining<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.190> scratch<00:02:36.489> to

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
finer compound refining the scratch to

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.240 
finer compound refining the scratch to
make<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.180> less<00:02:37.900> coarse<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.410> less<00:02:38.560> visible<00:02:38.739> and

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
make it less coarse and less visible and

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:59.360 
make it less coarse and less visible and
bring<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.670> gloss<00:02:39.849> back<00:02:40.090> up

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.610 

now<00:02:59.940> after<00:03:00.300> you<00:03:00.390> go<00:03:00.510> over<00:03:00.780> with<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.290> course

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
now after you go over with the course

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.350 
now after you go over with the course
compound<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.340> need<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.610> wipe<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.940> down<00:03:03.120> and

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
compound you need to wipe it down and

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.690 
compound you need to wipe it down and
switch<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.470> something<00:03:04.800> finer<00:03:05.250> I'm<00:03:05.519> going<00:03:05.640> to

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
switch to something finer I'm going to

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.180 
switch to something finer I'm going to
use<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.569> swirl<00:03:06.959> mark<00:03:07.230> remover<00:03:07.620> with<00:03:07.950> the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
use the swirl mark remover with the

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:23.350 
use the swirl mark remover with the
black<00:03:08.430> 3m<00:03:09.390> pad

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.720 

now<00:03:23.900> I<00:03:23.930> could<00:03:24.290> take<00:03:24.440> it<00:03:24.500> one<00:03:24.800> more<00:03:24.830> step<00:03:25.040> here

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
now I could take it one more step here

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.420 
now I could take it one more step here
and<00:03:25.940> switch<00:03:26.210> it<00:03:26.390> to<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.870> ultra<00:03:27.470> FINA<00:03:27.770> compound

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
and switch it to the ultra FINA compound

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.090 
and switch it to the ultra FINA compound
which<00:03:28.580> is<00:03:28.610> kind<00:03:29.210> of<00:03:29.330> like<00:03:29.630> a<00:03:29.930> bit<00:03:30.470> of<00:03:30.590> overkill

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
which is kind of like a bit of overkill

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.640 
which is kind of like a bit of overkill
on<00:03:31.160> this<00:03:31.490> particular<00:03:31.910> job<00:03:32.510> this<00:03:33.380> will<00:03:33.500> show

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
on this particular job this will show

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.990 
on this particular job this will show
you<00:03:33.740> the<00:03:33.770> basics<00:03:34.100> of<00:03:34.130> getting<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.430> scratch<00:03:34.730> out

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000

you the basics of getting a scratch out
the<00:03:35.660> ultra<00:03:35.960> Fein<00:03:36.140> is<00:03:36.320> going<00:03:36.530> to<00:03:36.590> give<00:03:36.770> you<00:03:36.920> like

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
the ultra Fein is going to give you like

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.890 
the ultra Fein is going to give you like
a<00:03:37.190> showroom<00:03:37.610> gloss<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.450> really<00:03:38.720> isn't

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
a showroom gloss that really isn't

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.530 
a showroom gloss that really isn't
required<00:03:39.470> at<00:03:40.040> this<00:03:40.220> point<00:03:40.520> but<00:03:40.700> if<00:03:40.940> you<00:03:41.390> want

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
required at this point but if you want

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.360 
required at this point but if you want
to<00:03:41.600> take<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:41.990> that<00:03:42.110> extra<00:03:42.440> step<00:03:42.740> you<00:03:42.950> can

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
to take it that extra step you can

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.030 
to take it that extra step you can
definitely<00:03:43.820> do<00:03:43.970> that<00:03:44.150> if<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:45.620> want<00:03:45.800> to<00:03:45.890> see<00:03:46.010> a

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
definitely do that if you want to see a

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.100 
definitely do that if you want to see a
demonstration<00:03:46.550> of<00:03:46.760> using<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:47.210> ultra<00:03:47.570> FINA<00:03:47.810> I

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
demonstration of using the ultra FINA I

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.740 
demonstration of using the ultra FINA I
do<00:03:48.170> have<00:03:48.740> that<00:03:49.010> on<00:03:49.250> a<00:03:49.700> video<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.360> did<00:03:50.570> called

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
do have that on a video I did called

00:03:50.750 --> 00:04:18.199 
do have that on a video I did called
polishing<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.620> black<00:03:51.920> car

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.050 

so<00:04:18.810> here<00:04:19.109> is<00:04:19.289> the<00:04:19.560> end<00:04:19.769> result<00:04:20.039> now<00:04:20.579> that

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
so here is the end result now that

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.360 
so here is the end result now that
scratch<00:04:21.479> I<00:04:21.660> couldn't<00:04:22.049> extract<00:04:22.650> completely

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
scratch I couldn't extract completely

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.040 
scratch I couldn't extract completely
rate<00:04:23.550> along<00:04:23.820> that<00:04:24.030> style<00:04:24.389> line<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.870> was<00:04:25.020> a

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
rate along that style line it was a

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.600 
rate along that style line it was a
little<00:04:25.289> deeper<00:04:25.440> as<00:04:25.680> they<00:04:25.830> said<00:04:26.039> earlier<00:04:26.220> and

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
little deeper as they said earlier and

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.999 
little deeper as they said earlier and
you<00:04:27.000> can<00:04:27.150> still<00:04:27.389> somewhat<00:04:27.990> see<00:04:28.199> it<00:04:28.289> but<00:04:28.560> you

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:29.009 
you can still somewhat see it but you

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.439 
you can still somewhat see it but you
know<00:04:29.130> what<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:29.580> can<00:04:29.699> see<00:04:29.880> here<00:04:30.090> is<00:04:30.240> obviously

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
know what you can see here is obviously

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.110 
know what you can see here is obviously
a<00:04:30.960> significant<00:04:31.830> improvement<00:04:32.310> from<00:04:32.460> what<00:04:32.970> we

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
a significant improvement from what we

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.090 
a significant improvement from what we
started<00:04:33.419> with<00:04:33.630> so<00:04:33.900> I<00:04:34.080> think<00:04:34.440> we're<00:04:34.889> pretty

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
started with so I think we're pretty

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.810 
started with so I think we're pretty
happy<00:04:35.310> with<00:04:35.639> the<00:04:36.150> result<00:04:36.509> we<00:04:36.600> got<00:04:36.780> here<00:04:37.080> so<00:04:37.820> one

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
happy with the result we got here so one
