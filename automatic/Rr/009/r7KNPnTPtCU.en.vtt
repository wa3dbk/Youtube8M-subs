00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
don't this video is pretty much useless

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.060 
don't this video is pretty much useless
to<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.930> it<00:00:48.930> was<00:00:49.050> destroyed<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.360> was<00:00:52.070> really

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
to you it was destroyed and I was really

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.729 
to you it was destroyed and I was really
amazed<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.610> someone<00:00:53.820> had<00:00:54.090> managed<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.230> get

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
amazed that someone had managed to get

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.010 
amazed that someone had managed to get
the<00:00:55.949> get<00:00:56.250> their<00:00:56.399> hands<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.780> think

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the get their hands on this and I think

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.380 
the get their hands on this and I think
because<00:00:58.649> they<00:00:58.859> have<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> museum<00:00:59.460> server<00:01:00.059> where

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
because they have a museum server where

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.200 
because they have a museum server where
they<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.140> entire<00:01:01.410> map<00:01:01.710> up<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.210> people

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
they have the entire map up and people

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.109 
they have the entire map up and people
can<00:01:03.390> go<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.870> walk<00:01:04.650> around<00:01:04.860> they<00:01:05.670> can't<00:01:05.909> place

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
can go and walk around they can't place

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.780 
can go and walk around they can't place
blocks<00:01:06.420> or<00:01:06.750> destroy<00:01:07.080> anything<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.830> someone

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
blocks or destroy anything and someone

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.429 
blocks or destroy anything and someone
managed<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.299> download<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.840> map<00:01:10.020> from<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
managed to download the map from the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.859 
managed to download the map from the
server<00:01:10.740> somehow<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.340> guess<00:01:12.270> there's<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.510> mod<00:01:12.720> out

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
server somehow I guess there's a mod out

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.020 
server somehow I guess there's a mod out
there<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.680> they<00:01:13.799> used<00:01:14.070> once<00:01:14.549> again<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.760> don't

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
there that they used once again I don't

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.890 
there that they used once again I don't
know<00:01:15.090> if<00:01:15.180> I'm<00:01:15.299> gonna<00:01:15.390> get<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.600> trouble<00:01:15.630> for

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
know if I'm gonna get in trouble for

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.370 
know if I'm gonna get in trouble for
this<00:01:15.990> hopefully<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.590> don't<00:01:16.850> if<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.150> do

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
this hopefully I don't if I do

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.210 
this hopefully I don't if I do
wanted<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.430> show<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.700> guys<00:01:21.439> some<00:01:22.439> spoilers<00:01:22.920> I

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
guess let me make it daytime because I

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.569 
guess let me make it daytime because I
was<00:01:28.259> walking<00:01:28.590> around<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.040> they<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.430> these

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
was walking around and they have these

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.300 
was walking around and they have these
big<00:01:30.090> bedrock<00:01:31.079> barriers<00:01:31.650> around<00:01:31.950> stuff<00:01:32.159> that

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
big bedrock barriers around stuff that

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.160 
big bedrock barriers around stuff that
they<00:01:32.369> don't<00:01:32.549> want<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.750> into<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.079> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
they don't want you to get into on the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.039 
they don't want you to get into on the
museum<00:01:34.500> server<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.970> super<00:01:36.299> pic<00:01:36.509> like

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
museum server but I have super pic like

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.170 
museum server but I have super pic like
so<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.189> destroy<00:01:38.579> stuff<00:01:38.790> real<00:01:38.970> quickly

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
so I can just destroy stuff real quickly

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.620 
so I can just destroy stuff real quickly
without<00:01:39.479> having<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:40.130> actually<00:01:41.130> mine<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.600> I

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
without having to actually mine it so I

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.889 
without having to actually mine it so I
can<00:01:42.899> go<00:01:43.079> into<00:01:43.890> those<00:01:43.979> bedrock<00:01:44.460> barriers<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.360> I

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
can go into those bedrock barriers and I

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.370 
can go into those bedrock barriers and I
found<00:01:46.110> some<00:01:46.380> interesting<00:01:47.360> stuff<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.990> say<00:01:49.229> the
