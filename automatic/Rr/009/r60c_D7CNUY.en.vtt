00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
Bollywood made its presence felt but I

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.680 
Bollywood made its presence felt but I
think<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.220> biggest<00:03:08.550> highlight<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.209> ever<00:03:09.390> was

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
think the biggest highlight the ever was

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.680 
think the biggest highlight the ever was
was<00:03:10.050> Karan<00:03:11.010> Johar<00:03:11.130> varnville<00:03:11.550> show<00:03:11.970> which

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
was Karan Johar varnville show which

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.720 
was Karan Johar varnville show which
brought<00:03:12.989> out<00:03:13.020> which<00:03:13.739> was<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.890> quite<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.160> contrast

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
brought out which was a quite a contrast

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:35.870
