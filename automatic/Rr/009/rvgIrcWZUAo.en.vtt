five bars and that's weird as well you

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.089 
five bars and that's weird as well you
can<00:02:33.730> see<00:02:33.849> it<00:02:33.879> lags<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.359> lot<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:35.349> just<00:02:35.950> as<00:02:36.010> you

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
let's see masked origin it's really 64

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:19.979 
let's see masked origin it's really 64
Giga<00:03:08.590> bit<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:17.159> properties<00:03:18.159> and<00:03:18.599> all<00:03:19.599> it<00:03:19.780> says

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
Giga bit so properties and all it says

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.559 
Giga bit so properties and all it says
is<00:03:21.900> 48<00:03:23.010> well<00:03:24.010> that<00:03:24.340> is<00:03:24.489> pretty<00:03:24.639> fake<00:03:25.000> too<00:03:25.389> bad

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
is 48 well that is pretty fake too bad

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.199 
is 48 well that is pretty fake too bad
and<00:03:26.530> one<00:03:26.980> thing<00:03:27.639> I've<00:03:27.819> noticed<00:03:29.519> which<00:03:30.519> looks<00:03:31.000> a

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
and one thing I've noticed which looks a

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.789 
and one thing I've noticed which looks a
lot<00:03:31.419> of<00:03:31.509> like<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:31.989> real<00:03:32.349> iPhone<00:03:32.590> 4s<00:03:33.310> is<00:03:34.799> that

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
lot of like the real iPhone 4s is that

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.890 
lot of like the real iPhone 4s is that
it<00:03:35.919> uses<00:03:36.129> the<00:03:36.310> same<00:03:36.400> SIM<00:03:36.909> card<00:03:37.180> technology<00:03:37.329> and

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
it uses the same SIM card technology and

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.729 
it uses the same SIM card technology and
it<00:03:37.989> even<00:03:38.349> uses<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:38.829> micro<00:03:39.250> SIM<00:03:39.459> card<00:03:40.739> which

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
it even uses that micro SIM card which

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.969 
it even uses that micro SIM card which
goes<00:03:41.979> inside<00:03:42.340> of<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.579> iPhone<00:03:43.349> so<00:03:44.349> that's

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:44.979 
goes inside of the iPhone so that's

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:46.710 
goes inside of the iPhone so that's
pretty<00:03:45.189> much<00:03:45.280> you<00:03:45.489> think<00:03:45.729> thanks<00:03:46.569> for

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
pretty much you think thanks for

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.259 
pretty much you think thanks for
watching<00:03:46.989> goodbye
