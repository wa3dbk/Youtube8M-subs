00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.560
 hello and welcome to the show 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.240
 grow today let's see 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.759
 how to react if your child has been 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.790
 adopted and demand to know his 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.790
 origins 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.330
 the first mistake to avoid would have been 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.439
 obviously to hide his origins 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.970
 today to adopted children have said 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.189
 from the beginning that they were adopted 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.439
 like that it's a lot easier to 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.260
 talk later about the second mistake to 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.030
 avoid it is to introduce yourself as the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.190
 guarantors of his prehistory 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.570
 there are elements on his story that 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.180
 were communicated to you by 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.190
 the orphanage where by the social services 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.870
 you can pass them on but you 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.510
 in no way the guarantors it does not 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.149
 do not want your child to believe that you 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.680
 have been witnesses to his life before 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.820
 you became his parents so you have to 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.680
 that things are clear if you 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.719
 give him information said 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.340
 him although you are absolutely not 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.090
 the guarantors of what you are telling him 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.010
 pass the third error to avoid 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.210
 it's to believe you are less legitimate than 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.830
 his biological parents 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.720
 it was you who lifted it 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.400
 who gave him his name for sure 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.400
 you that he took model is you 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.330
 parents so do not feel less 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.610
 per year than biological parents 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.920
 often this skull by the way does that 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.360
 you are very anxious about the idea that 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.159
 the teen asks you about his 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.170
 biological parents and often 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.659
 the teenager himself without this fear 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.090
 and the convent was slow before you 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.170
 ask basic questions about 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.360
 roots of its existence 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.290
 finally the last hour to avoid is 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.770
 to put everything on the account of 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.329
 adoption 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.040
 it's not because your child was 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.170
 adopted that he behaves so 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.159
 opponent who does not do well 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.470
 to work at school 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.939
 these problems there we meet them all 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.649
 as often in children who have not 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.780
 not been adopted so you do not have to put 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.659
 everything about the adoption account is 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.920
 thought it absolutely necessary that he 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.460
 finds his biological parents for 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.460
 that things get better 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.010
 the first thing to do is to 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.440
 tranquilize 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.480
 these questions are normal that does not you 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.430
 do not hurt you are ready to help him 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.970
 accompany him to try to answer to 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.430
 these questions 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.229
 second course of action rather than 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.770
 speak is the listened but it is the 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.950
 speak out 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.240
 but that's the saying how he imagines 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.030
 his biological parents 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.350
 let him say what he expects of them 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.340
 let it be said of what they imagine 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.740
 finally of the abandonment of which he was the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.860
 subject let him express himself to the fullest 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.810
 around this prehistory which you do not 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.670
 do not know much about them 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.450
 seem to ignore the entire third 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.730
 to behave 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.640
 it's not too anticipate its 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.530
 steps let him do them himself 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.750
 steps obviously to the extent of his 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.780
 opportunities to measure maturity 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.370
 when he will feel ready accompanied 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.410
 but do not do things in his place 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.940
 if there is a phone call to pass 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.880
 the past the phone call but stay at 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.360
 his sides if he wants to have access to his 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.550
 folder 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.910
 well, go with him to swing 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.890
 of course has digested 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.570
 information that they might discover 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.610
 do not forget in the conduct to hold 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.180
 that you are not the guarantors of his 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.160
 prehistory 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.510
 so you can send it to him 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.090
 the elements that were communicated to you 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.590
 but you tell him that nothing comes out 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.330
 would have that's elements that you 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.739
 have been transmitted but you have not 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.320
 not known his biological parents that 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.080
 you are certain of nothing 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.209
 always leave him a part of 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.530
 hope because sometimes we learn 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.060
 terrible things 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.550
 it's very lapidary spices and 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.820
 little things here or there such a woman has 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.170
 been the victim of those where you are the man 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.650
 did not want a child for such or 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.220
 such reason 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.890
 it's sometimes information like that 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.670
 written a bit to the cookie cutter out of 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.040
 any context 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.680
 so he'll have to have if he has any 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.330
 information of this type recontextualize 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.880
 things and maybe allow him 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.290
 to write a novel about his birth a 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.340
 little more developed than the few 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.100
 lines that we could find in a 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.900
 file if steps are taken 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.700
 and of course you accompany him but 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.970
 you are also preparing it for the worst if she 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.920
 wanted to prepare to be disappointed by the 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.730
 parents who might finally meet 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.170
 it happens that 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.319
 search either vain and that ultimately 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.220
 it is impossible to meet his 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.260
 biological parents 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.120
 well, you have to know how to say stop 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.000
 know how to stop research 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.620
 maybe new elements 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.660
 will occur in the future at and him 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.389
 will allow to know more but 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.430
 in the meantime we pause we stop and 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.380
 we resume the course of his current life 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.850
 because the risk is obviously 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.889
 drown in the search for his past 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.979
 thank you for your attention and for the week 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.979
 next
