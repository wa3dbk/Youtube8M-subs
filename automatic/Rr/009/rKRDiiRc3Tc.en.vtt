00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:27.820
 For a long time one of the 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.349
 Popular East Frisian islands a 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.809
 important factor is i believe you 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:35.079
 car-free we have in 16 kilometers 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:37.120
 long beach yet it is cozy 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.339
 There is only a small village 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.989
 even I think for nature-loving 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:42.879
 people may not be in the 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.860
 There is also a desire to bring oneself north 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.879
 the possibility to hike bike too 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.879
 drive and so on 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.130
 the special feature of the house is belief 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.040
 I am the location on the island we are close 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.740
 At the village we are close to the beach if you are 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.920
 so old old schullandheim confesses too 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.440
 this before then we did not have that 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.840
 very nice steel beds we have 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.330
 today all the rooms with wooden furniture 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.430
 furnished wooden beds but we have 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.759
 also usually for two 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.009
 room in the sanitary area so that it 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.530
 not only the community showers are there 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.200
 as in the standard houses 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.179
 we'll just work with you 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.190
 School classes that's the standard 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.830
 but we also accommodate fair in 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.140
 groups but also families with children 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.960
 for which we have certain times in the year 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.679
 always reserve 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:01.500
 We can accommodate up to 120 people here 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:04.530
 and we have two more 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.390
 apartments with six beds each 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.489
 so for large families we orient 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.760
 once at the meals the kitchen 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.340
 even standard offers the food 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.799
 is offered buffet style breakfast 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.829
 lunch and dinner in between 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.290
 the groups design their programs 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:27.209
 we are self-employed at the house directly 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.250
 a playground with different ones 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.870
 play equipment 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.480
 but otherwise it is crucial 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.400
 near the beach only five minutes or couple 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.579
 Steps to the beach and I think so 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.730
 this is for children and families 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.549
 most important actually me personally 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.220
 I just think that's it 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:49.950
 nature experience here is very nice that is 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.170
 then again and again very pleasant harbor 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.620
 to arrive on the island railway 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.670
 then here to go out and more and 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.670
 to smell water
