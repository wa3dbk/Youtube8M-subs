check<00:00:19.380> out<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.619> Kawasaki

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.229 

first<00:00:51.070> biggest<00:00:51.460> thing<00:00:51.640> you<00:00:51.730> notice<00:00:52.030> is<00:00:52.210> just

first biggest thing you notice is just

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.329 
first biggest thing you notice is just
kind<00:00:52.899> of<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.050> size<00:00:53.260> difference<00:00:53.800> surprisingly

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
kind of the size difference surprisingly

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.060 
kind of the size difference surprisingly
enough<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:55.359> the<00:00:55.629> Kawasaki<00:00:56.320> feels<00:00:56.739> like<00:00:56.949> it

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
enough the the Kawasaki feels like it

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.060 
enough the the Kawasaki feels like it
has<00:00:57.250> quite<00:00:57.670> a<00:00:57.699> bit<00:00:57.909> more<00:00:58.089> mass<00:00:58.420> and<00:00:58.809> and<00:00:59.109> size

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.009 
has quite a bit more mass and and size
to<00:01:00.429> it<00:01:00.549> than<00:01:00.699> the<00:01:00.789> Honda<00:01:01.210> and<00:01:01.390> it<00:01:01.839> actually

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
to it than the Honda and it actually

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.289 
to it than the Honda and it actually
feels<00:01:02.469> like<00:01:02.649> it's<00:01:02.949> a<00:01:03.039> little<00:01:03.250> bit<00:01:03.369> more<00:01:04.030> well

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
feels like it's a little bit more well

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:05.940 
feels like it's a little bit more well
made<00:01:04.600> which<00:01:04.960> is<00:01:04.989> kind<00:01:05.259> of<00:01:05.289> surprising<00:01:05.409> because

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
made which is kind of surprising because

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.490 
made which is kind of surprising because
Honda's<00:01:06.820> pretty<00:01:07.060> notorious<00:01:07.270> for<00:01:07.869> making<00:01:07.899> real

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
Honda's pretty notorious for making real

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.740 
Honda's pretty notorious for making real
quality<00:01:08.770> products<00:01:09.399> and<00:01:10.119> it's<00:01:10.299> not<00:01:10.420> that<00:01:10.600> the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
quality products and it's not that the

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.950 
quality products and it's not that the
250r<00:01:11.229> is<00:01:11.470> not<00:01:11.740> sub<00:01:12.580> par<00:01:13.030> it<00:01:13.330> just<00:01:13.659> was

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
250r is not sub par it just was

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.260 
250r is not sub par it just was
surprising<00:01:14.560> that<00:01:14.649> the<00:01:14.939> kawasaki<00:01:15.939> seem

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
surprising that the kawasaki seem

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.740 
surprising that the kawasaki seem
superior<00:01:16.750> also<00:01:17.409> the<00:01:18.039> Kawasaki<00:01:18.520> vibrates<00:01:19.479> it's

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
superior also the Kawasaki vibrates it's

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.389 
superior also the Kawasaki vibrates it's
a<00:01:19.869> substantial<00:01:20.560> amount<00:01:20.710> less<00:01:21.009> it<00:01:21.159> almost

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
a substantial amount less it almost

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.010 
a substantial amount less it almost
vibrates<00:01:21.850> none<00:01:22.149> which<00:01:22.420> is<00:01:22.539> pretty<00:01:22.750> amazing

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
vibrates none which is pretty amazing

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.930 
vibrates none which is pretty amazing
for<00:01:24.810> 250<00:01:25.810> twin<00:01:26.140> and<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.799> Kawasaki<00:01:27.280> also<00:01:27.729> feels

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
for 250 twin and the Kawasaki also feels

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.880 
for 250 twin and the Kawasaki also feels
like<00:01:28.060> it<00:01:28.240> has<00:01:28.360> a<00:01:28.390> bit<00:01:28.630> more<00:01:28.659> legs<00:01:29.110> up<00:01:29.380> top<00:01:29.590> it

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
like it has a bit more legs up top it

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.980 
like it has a bit more legs up top it
cruises<00:01:30.459> out<00:01:30.700> a<00:01:30.729> little<00:01:31.000> bit<00:01:31.090> lower<00:01:31.240> rpm<00:01:31.810> on

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
cruises out a little bit lower rpm on

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.169 
cruises out a little bit lower rpm on
the<00:01:32.080> freeway<00:01:32.500> overall<00:01:33.490> though<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.789> bikes<00:01:34.000> are

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
the freeway overall though the bikes are

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.600 
the freeway overall though the bikes are
pretty<00:01:34.390> close<00:01:34.720> though<00:01:35.380> at<00:01:35.709> this<00:01:35.950> stage<00:01:36.220> where

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
pretty close though at this stage where

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.930 
pretty close though at this stage where
we're<00:01:36.729> at<00:01:36.850> right<00:01:36.880> now<00:01:37.119> so<00:01:38.080> far<00:01:38.319> it<00:01:38.470> looks<00:01:38.530> like

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
we're at right now so far it looks like

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.520 
we're at right now so far it looks like
the<00:01:39.940> tried-and-true<00:01:40.600> green<00:01:40.929> machine<00:01:41.350> might

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
the tried-and-true green machine might

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.169 
the tried-and-true green machine might
be<00:01:41.560> poking<00:01:42.039> ahead<00:01:42.220> a<00:01:42.250> little<00:01:42.459> bit<00:01:42.670> so<00:01:42.940> let's

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
be poking ahead a little bit so let's

00:01:43.179 --> 00:02:03.859 
be poking ahead a little bit so let's
see

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.569 

overall<00:02:04.869> these<00:02:05.320> motorcycles<00:02:06.070> they're<00:02:06.340> both

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
overall these motorcycles they're both

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.460 
overall these motorcycles they're both
really<00:02:06.850> excellent<00:02:07.299> but<00:02:07.630> if<00:02:07.810> I<00:02:08.050> was<00:02:08.259> on<00:02:08.440> the

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
really excellent but if I was on the

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.990 
really excellent but if I was on the
market<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:08.979> buy<00:02:09.129> a<00:02:09.160> brand<00:02:09.580> new<00:02:09.729> motorcycle

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
market to buy a brand new motorcycle

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.390 
market to buy a brand new motorcycle
brand-new<00:02:10.840> 250cc<00:02:11.379> support<00:02:11.950> bike<00:02:12.129> I

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.550 
brand-new 250cc support bike I
definitely<00:02:13.000> go<00:02:13.060> with<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.239> Kawasaki<00:02:13.690> it's

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
definitely go with the Kawasaki it's

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.780 
definitely go with the Kawasaki it's
cheaper<00:02:15.000> it's<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.239> little<00:02:16.480> more<00:02:16.599> versatile<00:02:17.050> and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
cheaper it's a little more versatile and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.699 
cheaper it's a little more versatile and
I<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:19.660> plain<00:02:19.870> like<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.319> little<00:02:20.410> bit<00:02:20.560> better

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
I just plain like it a little bit better

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.190 
I just plain like it a little bit better
than<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:20.950> Honda
