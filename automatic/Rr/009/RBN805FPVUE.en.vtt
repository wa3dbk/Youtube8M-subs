than that horrible candle light you know

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.450 
than that horrible candle light you know
that<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> mage<00:01:30.299> spell<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.990> gives<00:01:31.200> off<00:01:31.350> that

that the mage spell just gives off that
ugly<00:01:32.460> cold<00:01:33.360> harsh<00:01:33.930> light<00:01:34.409> whereas<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.950> gives

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
ugly cold harsh light whereas this gives

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.030 
ugly cold harsh light whereas this gives
off<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.820> same<00:01:36.119> light<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.780> your<00:01:37.380> torch<00:01:37.619> which

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
off the same light as your torch which

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.060 
off the same light as your torch which
is<00:01:38.250> much<00:01:39.180> more<00:01:39.420> pleasant<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.110> my<00:01:40.350> opinion<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
of course the second reason it's very

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.600
