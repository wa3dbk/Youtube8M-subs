00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
for two weeks which is the minimum that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.750 
for two weeks which is the minimum that
you're<00:00:52.649> supposed<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.010> allow<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.430> sit<00:00:53.699> for

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760

you're supposed to allow it to sit for
maximum<00:00:54.449> flavor<00:00:54.690> then<00:00:55.410> i<00:00:55.440> let<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.770> sit<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
maximum flavor then i let it sit in the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.830 
maximum flavor then i let it sit in the
fridge<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.340> two<00:00:56.610> days<00:00:56.850> before<00:00:57.059> i<00:00:57.239> open<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.660> up

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
fridge for two days before i open it up

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.619 
fridge for two days before i open it up
and<00:00:58.489> as<00:00:59.489> you'll<00:00:59.760> see<00:00:59.910> from<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.210> original

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
and as you'll see from the original

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.090 
and as you'll see from the original
video<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> results<00:01:01.680> were<00:01:01.770> kind<00:01:02.010> of

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
video that the results were kind of

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.039 
video that the results were kind of
lackluster<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:03.239> beer<00:01:03.449> didn't<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.899> very

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
lackluster the beer didn't have very

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.950 
lackluster the beer didn't have very
much<00:01:04.320> flavor<00:01:04.650> was<00:01:05.129> overly<00:01:06.030> sweet<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.659> under

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
much flavor was overly sweet and under

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.010 
much flavor was overly sweet and under
carbonated<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:08.970> we're<00:01:09.150> hoping<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.540> after

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
carbonated so we're hoping that after

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.440 
carbonated so we're hoping that after
three<00:01:10.530> weeks<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.920> model<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.880> has<00:01:12.090> gotten<00:01:12.420> a

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
three weeks and model that has gotten a

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.570 
three weeks and model that has gotten a
little<00:01:12.600> bit<00:01:12.810> better<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.860> though<00:01:14.189> we're<00:01:14.400> going

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
little bit better and though we're going

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.280 
little bit better and though we're going
to<00:01:14.640> continue<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.060> do<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.450> every<00:01:16.110> week

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
to continue to do this every week

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.170 
to continue to do this every week
letting<00:01:16.740> an<00:01:16.950> age<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> little<00:01:17.520> bit<00:01:17.640> longer<00:01:17.820> until

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
letting an age a little bit longer until

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.060 
letting an age a little bit longer until
all<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.110> bottles<00:01:19.380> are<00:01:19.500> gone<00:01:19.680> she'll<00:01:20.040> probably

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
all the bottles are gone she'll probably

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.219 
all the bottles are gone she'll probably
be<00:01:20.520> about<00:01:20.729> seven<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.210> eight<00:01:21.360> weeks<00:01:21.630> after<00:01:22.080> it's

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
be about seven or eight weeks after it's

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.929 
be about seven or eight weeks after it's
actually<00:01:22.590> been<00:01:22.740> bottled<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.549> hopefully<00:01:23.759> by

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
actually been bottled so hopefully by

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.969 
actually been bottled so hopefully by
the<00:01:24.119> end<00:01:24.240> it'll<00:01:24.780> be<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> really<00:01:25.409> good<00:01:25.530> beer<00:01:25.799> that

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the end it'll be a really good beer that

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.249

the one thing that i would change right

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.410 
the one thing that i would change right
off<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.620> bat<00:04:26.800> is<00:04:27.040> rather<00:04:27.550> than<00:04:27.790> using<00:04:28.030> tap

off the bat is rather than using tap

water i would go out and buy some sort

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.520 
water i would go out and buy some sort

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
anything like that in the water that are

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.990 
anything like that in the water that are
going<00:04:41.650> to<00:04:41.740> change<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.220> flavor<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:42.760> beer

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
going to change the flavor of the beer

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.390 
going to change the flavor of the beer
because<00:04:43.630> when<00:04:44.230> it<00:04:44.320> comes<00:04:44.500> down<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:44.710> it<00:04:45.040> you

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
because when it comes down to it you

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.370 
because when it comes down to it you
have<00:04:45.430> to<00:04:45.610> remember<00:04:45.790> that<00:04:46.380> ninety-five

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
have to remember that ninety-five

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.050 
have to remember that ninety-five
percent<00:04:47.710> of<00:04:48.040> everything<00:04:48.160> that's<00:04:48.550> in<00:04:48.700> beer<00:04:48.940> is

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
percent of everything that's in beer is

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.640 
percent of everything that's in beer is
water<00:04:49.300> and<00:04:49.840> your<00:04:49.930> water's<00:04:50.230> going<00:04:50.350> to<00:04:50.500> have<00:04:50.620> a

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
water and your water's going to have a

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.740 
water and your water's going to have a
huge<00:04:51.010> effect<00:04:51.160> on<00:04:51.520> how<00:04:51.790> it<00:04:51.940> comes<00:04:52.090> out<00:04:52.240> and<00:04:52.510> the

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
huge effect on how it comes out and the

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.170 
huge effect on how it comes out and the
flavor<00:04:52.990> of<00:04:53.200> it<00:04:53.350> so<00:04:54.100> that's<00:04:54.670> definitely<00:04:54.910> the

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
flavor of it so that's definitely the

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.470 
flavor of it so that's definitely the
one<00:04:55.270> thing<00:04:55.450> that<00:04:55.480> i<00:04:55.630> would<00:04:55.750> change<00:04:56.220> and<00:04:57.480> the

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
one thing that i would change and the

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.360 
one thing that i would change and the
thing<00:04:58.720> that<00:04:58.930> I'm<00:04:59.170> going<00:04:59.710> to<00:04:59.800> continue<00:05:00.070> to<00:05:00.220> do

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
thing that I'm going to continue to do

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.760 
thing that I'm going to continue to do
is<00:05:00.700> just<00:05:01.120> let<00:05:01.360> it<00:05:01.510> let<00:05:01.780> it<00:05:01.840> age<00:05:02.110> because<00:05:02.620> it

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
is just let it let it age because it

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.250 
is just let it let it age because it
seems<00:05:03.070> that<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:03.850> know<00:05:03.940> from<00:05:04.570> week<00:05:04.870> to<00:05:05.080> week

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
seems that you know from week to week

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.050 
seems that you know from week to week
three<00:05:05.650> it<00:05:05.830> has<00:05:05.980> gotten<00:05:06.310> dramatically<00:05:06.820> better

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
three it has gotten dramatically better

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.030 
three it has gotten dramatically better
and<00:05:07.390> I<00:05:07.690> can't<00:05:07.900> wait<00:05:08.050> to<00:05:08.080> see<00:05:08.290> what<00:05:08.500> week<00:05:08.680> 4<00:05:08.920> is

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
and I can't wait to see what week 4 is

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.460 
and I can't wait to see what week 4 is
like<00:05:09.220> but<00:05:10.060> until<00:05:10.480> next<00:05:10.660> time<00:05:10.900> this<00:05:11.169> has<00:05:11.350> been

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
like but until next time this has been

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.120 
like but until next time this has been
the<00:05:11.620> review<00:05:12.070> and<00:05:12.490> I<00:05:12.520> hope<00:05:12.550> you<00:05:12.790> enjoyed<00:05:13.090> it
