00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.610
 cooking one more week 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.700
 today we are going to make tuna in onion a 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.119
 recipe that they gave me the style of 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.670
 barbate I think it's a plate 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.690
 you're going to see that it's very 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:39.590
 easy to do very fast and without more 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:43.510
 procrastination as always ingredients 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.629
 basic tuna for tuna with onions 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.170
 many onions we have chopped 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:54.030
 about 13 large tuna bags have been 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.030
 1 half kilo 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.160
 we go to later to flavor we have a 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.560
 little 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.910
 of paprika from Vera a little bit of 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.900
 laurel 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.600
 low and then also 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.270
 we have a garlic clove 1 and a half 2 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.830
 it depends on the size then we have our 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.720
 fish broth and white wine in addition to 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.530
 our olive oil which is essential 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.479
 always for our dishes 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.820
 madrid- with onion as you see is 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.680
 chopped 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.440
 in julienne is to say you do not have it 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.630
 chop a lot just studying what 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.280
 you speak Julian the point that remains for 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.280
 say let's cook 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.259
 Well we are here we have done 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.240
 as we have always put our oil 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.270
 of olive to heat the arts because 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.250
 we are going to mark the tuna we are going to mark it 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.439
 one by one or two by two but 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.470
 little bit so we can mark the 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:57.189
 conditions you give the brand is going to be very 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.729
 small we just want it done 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.729
 outside 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.079
 shouts 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.079
 i 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.250
 points 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.390
 a little too 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.390
 outside 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.340
 If it were like this, we want to be like this 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.920
 we 're going to do it all because then 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.110
 it will finish of kitchens inside when 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.470
 let's do it with the onion so 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.470
 everyone 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.989
 Well, we have already taken the last 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.300
 piece of here from the pan that we are going to 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.780
 do now once we have marked 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.110
 this we are going to add garlic a little bit of 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.840
 more oil we add the garlic and add 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.209
 also the onion when it is no longer 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.510
 a little side of garlic very little 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:55.310
 time because it burns us so very 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.310
 little time we add the garlic 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.270
 a little bit 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.989
 then we will add the onion 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.690
 the onion 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.959
 and what are we going to do now the pan that 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.260
 crazy let's do the following we're going 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:22.120
 to catch let's add the little bit of 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:25.720
 laurel also directive we are going to 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.770
 add a little broth that is not 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.860
 drop a little broth 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.720
 a little more 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.350
 a little bit of broth we will follow 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.160
 wetting with a little 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.160
 of white wine 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.450
 a little bit of paprika that in this case 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.760
 the paprika of Vera is a hundred 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.330
 one hundred very good with denomination of 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.460
 origin 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.460
 Now we move and let it simmer 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.680
 that this goes caramelized that we see that 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:01.670
 It lacks a little bit of broth that has not yet 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.190
 is and that is sticking or that is not 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.680
 still at its point we take a little 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.940
 more broth or a little more wine and 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.940
 we keep leaving until it's 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.420
 Well, as you can see, it's ready 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.490
 it's ready, we lower the fire a little and 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.550
 Now what we are going to do is add the 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.280
 tuna to finish doing here 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.360
 we have already thrown salt but 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.270
 you have to always remember 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.460
 pour the salt to taste try it and if you 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.550
 missing a little more and always with much 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.320
 careful not to pass because if they stay 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.950
 short to fix but if you want 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.950
 long 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.660
 the tuna we put here prepared from before 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.760
 so hot and so it's over 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.580
 the onion is important 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.520
 approximately has been reducing and 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.080
 striking for 25 minutes 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.640
 effectively also this approx avoided 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.530
 ceramic and has taken a little longer 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.380
 also as always you have to be 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.060
 you attentive to how long always 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.110
 we give estimates but you 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.950
 It has to be time because each 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.950
 kitchen is world 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.950
 Lets put 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.940
 blue and now once ready 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.510
 We continue with our suggestion 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.510
 presentation 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.310
 Well, now we have the tuna ready and only 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.040
 is the presentation we what are we going 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.360
 to do today so let's go and we'll 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:46.139
 put a base of the onion sauce 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.620
 onion 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.620
 Y 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.780
 Y 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.880
 A) Yes 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.880
 and a little more 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.810
 a woman 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.880
 from Japan 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.880
 it can be perfectly this 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:22.040
 it can also be perfectly this 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.880
 and finally it can also be 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.880
 perfectly 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:35.920
 and now that we can put a 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:40.840
 little touches of green in the center and 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.529
 example is a droplet for the color d 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.270
 wood 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:47.340
 very relieved 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.190
 there are some who see it as a great help in 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.800
 the kitchen and you have to see it as something 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:58.050
 who does not like us we like 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.050
 if you want to give it effectively 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:12.120
 and with this we have a presentation 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:15.090
 soft somewhat sober but 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.610
 a little pretty and pretty as we say 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.280
 always and as it says saves with this that 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.500
