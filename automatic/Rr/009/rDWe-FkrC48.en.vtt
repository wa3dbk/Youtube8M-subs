00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
foundation with this program as we all

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.820 
foundation with this program as we all
know<00:04:24.360> you<00:04:24.420> know<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.840> first<00:04:25.080> couple<00:04:25.410> years<00:04:25.530> did

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
know you know the first couple years did

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.640 
know you know the first couple years did
the<00:04:25.860> winds<00:04:26.520> were<00:04:26.670> not<00:04:26.880> as<00:04:27.030> numerous<00:04:27.660> as<00:04:27.870> he

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
the winds were not as numerous as he

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.070 
the winds were not as numerous as he
wanted<00:04:28.920> them<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.190> be<00:04:29.340> but<00:04:30.270> again<00:04:30.390> built<00:04:30.960> a

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
wanted them to be but again built a

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.390 
wanted them to be but again built a
great<00:04:31.290> foundation<00:04:31.500> on<00:04:32.070> what<00:04:32.280> the

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
great foundation on what the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.210 
great foundation on what the
expectations<00:04:33.120> are<00:04:33.470> what<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.620> goal<00:04:34.800> is<00:04:34.830> what

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
expectations are what the goal is what

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.580 
expectations are what the goal is what
the<00:04:35.310> mission<00:04:35.520> is<00:04:35.730> what<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:36.000> plan<00:04:36.270> is<00:04:36.350> and<00:04:37.350> then

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
the mission is what the plan is and then

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.010 
the mission is what the plan is and then
obviously<00:04:38.070> our<00:04:38.850> players<00:04:39.180> have<00:04:39.630> bought<00:04:39.840> into

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
obviously our players have bought into

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.660 
obviously our players have bought into
that<00:04:40.170> you<00:04:40.500> know<00:04:40.530> going<00:04:40.890> from<00:04:41.010> two<00:04:41.220> wins<00:04:41.490> that

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
that you know going from two wins that

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.490 
that you know going from two wins that
three<00:04:41.880> ones<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.210> for<00:04:42.420> once<00:04:42.660> to<00:04:42.810> a<00:04:42.840> twins<00:04:43.260> I

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
three ones to for once to a twins I

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.910 
three ones to for once to a twins I
think<00:04:44.280> paints<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.030> picture<00:04:45.210> of<00:04:46.080> where<00:04:46.770> we're

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
think paints a picture of where we're

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.040 
think paints a picture of where we're
headed<00:04:47.220> with<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:48.000> UV<00:04:48.270> program<00:04:48.660> there's<00:04:48.960> a

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
headed with the UV program there's a

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.320 
headed with the UV program there's a
great<00:04:49.380> family<00:04:49.980> atmosphere<00:04:50.310> obviously<00:04:51.120> it's

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
great family atmosphere obviously it's

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.270 
great family atmosphere obviously it's
something<00:04:51.540> that<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:52.050> know<00:04:52.200> we<00:04:52.380> promote<00:04:52.890> you

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
something that you know we promote you

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.160 
something that you know we promote you
know<00:04:53.370> on<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.550> daily<00:04:53.760> basis<00:04:54.300> you<00:04:54.600> know<00:04:54.630> that<00:04:55.050> we

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
know on a daily basis you know that we

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.080 
know on a daily basis you know that we
are<00:04:55.290> a<00:04:55.320> football<00:04:55.740> family<00:04:56.010> you<00:04:56.430> know<00:04:56.550> I<00:04:56.580> think

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
are a football family you know I think

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.870 
are a football family you know I think
that's<00:04:57.510> congruent<00:04:58.020> with<00:04:58.320> a<00:04:58.650> lot<00:04:58.860> of<00:04:59.010> programs

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
that's congruent with a lot of programs

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.610 
that's congruent with a lot of programs
but<00:05:00.120> it's<00:05:00.270> special<00:05:00.480> around<00:05:00.900> here<00:05:01.080> obviously<00:05:01.290> I

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
but it's special around here obviously I

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.430 
but it's special around here obviously I
think<00:05:02.100> that<00:05:02.400> we<00:05:02.730> duel<00:05:02.940> we<00:05:03.750> do<00:05:03.870> a<00:05:03.900> lot<00:05:03.960> of<00:05:04.110> things

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
think that we duel we do a lot of things

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.440 
think that we duel we do a lot of things
