00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.399 
training ground you know so we can
really<00:01:21.119> bond<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.600> perhaps<00:01:21.840> talk<00:01:22.140> about

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
really bond and perhaps talk about

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.200 
really bond and perhaps talk about
things<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.280> wouldn't<00:01:23.490> usually<00:01:23.850> talk

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
things that you wouldn't usually talk

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.210 
things that you wouldn't usually talk
about<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.540> know<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:25.320> bonding<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.890> spirit

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
about you know that bonding and spirit

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.410 
about you know that bonding and spirit
is<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.549> crucial<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.970> guess<00:01:27.119> over<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
is going to be crucial I guess over the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.940 
is going to be crucial I guess over the
next<00:01:27.570> few<00:01:27.720> weeks<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.110> Christmas<00:01:28.470> period<00:01:28.680> is

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
next few weeks a Christmas period is

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.039 
next few weeks a Christmas period is
massive<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.640> gear<00:01:29.850> lever<00:01:30.180> they<00:01:30.390> definitely<00:01:30.900> in

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
massive in gear lever they definitely in

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.390 
massive in gear lever they definitely in
a<00:01:31.110> Christmas<00:01:31.409> tree<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.650> massive<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.189> think

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
a Christmas tree is massive I think

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.990 
a Christmas tree is massive I think
we've<00:01:32.520> got<00:01:33.140> 66<00:01:34.140> games<00:01:34.350> or<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.700> know

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
there's a lot of point to be picked up

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.289 
there's a lot of point to be picked up
there<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.770> know<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.400> know<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:38.790> we<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.119> you

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
the most disappointing thing with Darby

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.740

important<00:03:05.170> but<00:03:05.290> it's<00:03:05.860> majorly<00:03:06.250> important

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
important but it's majorly important
