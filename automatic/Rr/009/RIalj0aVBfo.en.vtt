the top can down into the bottom can so

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.849 
the top can down into the bottom can so
we<00:00:50.850> want<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.120> make<00:00:51.269> that<00:00:51.480> cut<00:00:52.109> as<00:00:52.350> neat<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
we want to make that cut as neat and

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.770 
we want to make that cut as neat and
clean<00:00:53.129> as<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.519> possibly<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:56.030> so<00:00:57.030> what<00:00:57.660> I've

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
clean as we possibly can so what I've

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.470 
clean as we possibly can so what I've
done<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.699> using<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> directions<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> book

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
done is using the directions in the book

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.160 
done is using the directions in the book
I've<00:01:00.920> measured<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.100> made<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> mark<00:01:03.149> at<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
I've measured and made a mark at the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.350 
I've measured and made a mark at the
proper<00:01:04.559> height<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.670> bottom<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.150> can

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
proper height for the bottom of the can

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.880 
proper height for the bottom of the can
and<00:01:08.600> I'm<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.900> take<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> permanent<00:01:10.590> marker

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
and I'm going to take a permanent marker

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.300 
and I'm going to take a permanent marker
and<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.840> use<00:01:13.050> anything<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.710> hold<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.070> pan

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
and you can use anything to hold the pan

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.170 
and you can use anything to hold the pan
up<00:01:14.610> at<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.000> right<00:01:15.300> height<00:01:19.820> you<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:21.000> use<00:01:21.150> a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
up at that right height you can use a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.770 
up at that right height you can use a
stack<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.570> books<00:01:21.780> or<00:01:22.670> your<00:01:23.670> ruler<00:01:24.150> or<00:01:24.330> such<00:01:24.690> as

your cutting guide the first step in
cutting<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.250> aluminum<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.270> I'm<00:01:42.870> going<00:01:43.050> to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
cutting the aluminum can is I'm going to

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.460 
cutting the aluminum can is I'm going to
cut<00:01:43.350> above<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.890> mark<00:01:44.160> and<00:01:45.020> I'm<00:01:46.020> not<00:01:46.260> going<00:01:46.410> to

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
cut above the mark and I'm not going to

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.670 
cut above the mark and I'm not going to
worry<00:01:46.710> too<00:01:47.220> much<00:01:47.250> about<00:01:47.780> what<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.530> edge

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
worry too much about what the the edge

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.670 
worry too much about what the the edge
looks<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:51.590> I'm<00:01:52.590> using<00:01:52.800> a<00:01:53.070> small<00:01:53.670> pair<00:01:54.000> of

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
looks like I'm using a small pair of

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.750 
looks like I'm using a small pair of
very<00:01:55.680> sharp<00:01:56.010> scissors<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:59.300> this<00:02:00.300> first<00:02:00.570> cut

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
very sharp scissors and this first cut

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.880 
very sharp scissors and this first cut
will<00:02:02.760> be<00:02:02.820> quite<00:02:03.330> rough<00:02:03.660> and<00:02:03.870> jagged<00:02:04.110> if<00:02:04.770> you

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
will be quite rough and jagged if you

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.290 
will be quite rough and jagged if you
try<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.160> put<00:02:05.370> something<00:02:05.580> like<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.060> together

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
try to put something like that together

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.469 
try to put something like that together
it<00:02:07.020> will<00:02:07.290> actually<00:02:07.680> split<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.340> tear<00:02:08.700> where

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
it will actually split and tear where

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.390 
it will actually split and tear where
those<00:02:09.690> jagged<00:02:09.989> edges<00:02:10.289> are<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.129> order<00:02:11.250> to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
those jagged edges are so in order to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.539 
those jagged edges are so in order to
make<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.970> smooth<00:02:12.930> I'm<00:02:13.379> going<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.010> now<00:02:14.159> use<00:02:14.219> a

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
make it smooth I'm going to now use a

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.750 
make it smooth I'm going to now use a
slightly<00:02:15.480> larger<00:02:15.750> pair<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.260> scissors<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.670> I'm

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
slightly larger pair of scissors and I'm

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.020 
slightly larger pair of scissors and I'm
going

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
going

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.670 
going
cut<00:02:18.270> very<00:02:18.810> carefully<00:02:19.140> down<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.280> mark<00:02:21.680> now

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
cut very carefully down to the mark now

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.670 
cut very carefully down to the mark now
I've<00:02:22.800> actually<00:02:22.980> turned<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.850> can<00:02:24.090> around<00:02:24.680> so

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
I've actually turned the can around so

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.550 
I've actually turned the can around so
for<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.070> right-handed<00:02:26.880> person<00:02:27.120> I'm<00:02:27.570> cutting

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
for a right-handed person I'm cutting

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.590 
for a right-handed person I'm cutting
what<00:02:28.740> feels<00:02:29.100> like<00:02:29.220> backwards<00:02:29.670> because<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.330> have

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
what feels like backwards because I have

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.880 
what feels like backwards because I have
the<00:02:30.780> scrap<00:02:31.200> on<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.770> left<00:02:32.040> side<00:02:33.500> as<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.740> can

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
the scrap on the left side as you can

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.830 
the scrap on the left side as you can
see<00:02:35.130> by<00:02:35.310> doing<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.090> makes<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.450> scrap

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
see by doing that it makes the scrap

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.510 
see by doing that it makes the scrap
turn<00:02:37.830> up<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.520> come<00:02:39.180> out<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.540> way<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.520> that

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
turn up and come out of the way and that

00:02:41.520 --> 00:03:11.810 
turn up and come out of the way and that
helps<00:02:41.940> get<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.270> nice<00:02:42.660> clean<00:02:43.320> edge<00:03:10.459> now<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:11.489> have<00:03:11.790> a

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
helps get a nice clean edge now I have a

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.050 
helps get a nice clean edge now I have a
nice<00:03:12.150> clean<00:03:12.690> straight<00:03:13.410> edge<00:03:13.770> see<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.670> little

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
nice clean straight edge see a little

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.680 
nice clean straight edge see a little
bit<00:03:15.600> of<00:03:15.660> wrinkling<00:03:16.380> there<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:17.660> but<00:03:18.660> that

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
bit of wrinkling there and but that

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.900 
bit of wrinkling there and but that
should<00:03:19.080> work<00:03:19.260> pretty<00:03:19.560> well<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.070> that'll<00:03:20.790> make

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
should work pretty well and that'll make

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.199 
should work pretty well and that'll make
the<00:03:21.180> bottom<00:03:22.400> for<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.700> quick<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:23.940> easy

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
the bottom for the quick and easy

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.049 
the bottom for the quick and easy
