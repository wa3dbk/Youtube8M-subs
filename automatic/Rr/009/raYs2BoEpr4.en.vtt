00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
Train can impress a home code and so I

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.820 
Train can impress a home code and so I
think<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.660> divot<00:04:35.960> II<00:04:36.050> will<00:04:36.170> get<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.380> stoppage

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
think the divot II will get the stoppage

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.800 
think the divot II will get the stoppage
in<00:04:36.950> this<00:04:37.100> fight<00:04:37.340> I<00:04:37.610> think<00:04:38.180> it<00:04:38.270> would<00:04:38.360> maybe<00:04:38.480> be

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
in this fight I think it would maybe be

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.340 
in this fight I think it would maybe be
late<00:04:39.560> on<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.920> feet<00:04:40.270> in<00:04:41.270> John<00:04:41.810> Ruby's<00:04:42.110> a

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
late on the feet in John Ruby's a

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.300 
late on the feet in John Ruby's a
stilted<00:04:43.220> but<00:04:43.760> he<00:04:44.360> has<00:04:45.490> cannot<00:04:46.490> do<00:04:46.700> tible<00:04:47.000> so<00:04:47.480> I

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
stilted but he has cannot do tible so I

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.500 
stilted but he has cannot do tible so I
believe<00:04:49.310> that<00:04:49.490> maybe<00:04:49.670> an<00:04:49.970> 11th<00:04:50.330> round

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
believe that maybe an 11th round

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.940 
believe that maybe an 11th round
stoppage<00:04:50.870> tough<00:04:51.320> obviously<00:04:51.680> pecker

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
stoppage tough obviously pecker

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.490 
stoppage tough obviously pecker
production<00:04:52.580> it<00:04:52.700> would<00:04:52.820> be<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.240> diva<00:04:54.200> tea

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
production it would be the diva tea

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.690 
production it would be the diva tea
which<00:04:55.370> stop<00:04:55.760> a<00:04:56.680> John<00:04:57.680> rubies<00:04:57.950> and<00:04:58.130> 11th<00:04:58.520> round

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
which stop a John rubies and 11th round

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.550 
which stop a John rubies and 11th round
