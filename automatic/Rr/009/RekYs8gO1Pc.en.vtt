to pull with this and I'm looking at

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.930 
to pull with this and I'm looking at
this<00:00:13.200> wiring<00:00:13.679> harness<00:00:14.009> here<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.490> after

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
this wiring harness here and after

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.880 
this wiring harness here and after
testing<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.480> out<00:00:15.599> come<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.500> find<00:00:16.740> out<00:00:16.830> that

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
testing it out come to find out that

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.189 
testing it out come to find out that
these<00:00:17.160> two<00:00:17.220> wires<00:00:17.580> are<00:00:18.270> not<00:00:18.330> necessarily<00:00:18.990> for

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
these two wires are not necessarily for

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.609 
these two wires are not necessarily for
what<00:00:19.230> I'm<00:00:19.410> using<00:00:19.650> today<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.220> picked<00:00:21.000> up<00:00:21.210> an

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
what I'm using today I picked up an

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.849 
what I'm using today I picked up an
adapter<00:00:22.619> from<00:00:23.580> autozone<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.539> it's<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.590> four

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
adapter from autozone and it's a four

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.040 
adapter from autozone and it's a four
wire<00:00:26.039> adapter<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.269> over<00:00:27.630> here<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:27.900> have

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
wire adapter and this over here we have

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.769 
wire adapter and this over here we have
five<00:00:28.460> after<00:00:29.460> testing<00:00:29.910> found<00:00:30.300> out<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.660> this

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
five after testing found out that this

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.850 
five after testing found out that this
goes<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.700> brake<00:00:32.700> light<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.329> way<00:00:33.480> it's

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
goes to the brake light the way it's

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.130 
goes to the brake light the way it's
designed<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> ground<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.630> then

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
designed to this is the ground and then

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.220 
designed to this is the ground and then
you<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.380> your<00:00:37.530> left<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.860> right<00:00:39.110> you<00:00:40.110> have

going<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.250> splice<00:00:44.670> these<00:00:44.879> wires<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.570> then

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
going to splice these wires and then

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.529 
going to splice these wires and then
show<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.200> how<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.500> tested<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.219> beforehand<00:00:47.910> just

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
show you how I tested it beforehand just

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.729 
show you how I tested it beforehand just
to<00:00:48.629> make<00:00:48.780> sure<00:00:48.809> these<00:00:49.140> wires<00:00:49.350> were<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> little

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
to make sure these wires were a little

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.139 
to make sure these wires were a little
bit<00:00:49.920> longer<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.309> cut<00:00:50.550> them<00:00:50.670> down<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.850> clean

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
bit longer I cut them down and clean

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.520 
bit longer I cut them down and clean
them<00:00:51.270> up<00:00:51.390> they<00:00:51.539> were<00:00:51.600> little<00:00:51.840> tarnished<00:00:52.379> they

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
them up they were little tarnished they

together and I used some heat shrinks
for<00:01:49.420> some<00:01:49.570> data<00:01:49.750> protection<00:01:50.140> this<00:01:50.950> I'm<00:01:51.130> going

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
for some data protection this I'm going

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.830 
for some data protection this I'm going
to<00:01:51.310> keep<00:01:51.490> on<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.729> inside<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.330> vehicle<00:01:52.690> to

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
to keep on the inside of the vehicle to

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.719 
to keep on the inside of the vehicle to
keep<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.140> weather<00:01:53.290> off<00:01:53.649> it<00:01:53.830> because<00:01:54.490> as<00:01:54.640> I

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
keep the weather off it because as I

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.010 
keep the weather off it because as I
mentioned<00:01:54.759> earlier<00:01:55.149> I<00:01:55.390> had<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.660> clip<00:01:55.810> some

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
mentioned earlier I had to clip some

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.320 
mentioned earlier I had to clip some
back<00:01:56.380> way<00:01:56.680> back<00:01:56.890> although<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.880> was<00:01:58.060> taped

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
back way back although it was taped

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.510 
back way back although it was taped
fairly<00:01:58.840> significantly<00:01:59.410> there<00:02:00.190> was<00:02:00.280> a<00:02:00.310> lot<00:02:00.490> of

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
fairly significantly there was a lot of

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.160 
fairly significantly there was a lot of
corrosion<00:02:00.759> in<00:02:01.180> here<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.540> this<00:02:01.660> can<00:02:01.899> cause

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
corrosion in here and this can cause

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.219 
corrosion in here and this can cause
problems<00:02:02.470> if<00:02:02.979> these<00:02:03.130> wise<00:02:03.390> connect<00:02:04.390> you<00:02:05.020> cause
