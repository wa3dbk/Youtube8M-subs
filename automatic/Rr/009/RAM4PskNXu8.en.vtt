00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.650 
stations were so much fun in JC to we
decided<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.400> we<00:02:16.640> wanted<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.000> take<00:02:17.270> them<00:02:17.480> out

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
decided that we wanted to take them out

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.440 
decided that we wanted to take them out
of<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.989> core<00:02:18.260> chaos<00:02:18.709> progression<00:02:19.280> system<00:02:19.459> and

of the core chaos progression system and

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.150 
of the core chaos progression system and
just<00:02:20.630> allow<00:02:20.900> players<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.410> destroy<00:02:21.860> them<00:02:22.040> as

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
just allow players to destroy them as

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.190 
just allow players to destroy them as
many<00:02:22.370> times<00:02:22.640> as<00:02:22.730> they<00:02:22.880> want

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
many times as they want

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.110 
many times as they want
and<00:02:23.620> our<00:02:23.770> physics<00:02:24.160> play<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.400> our<00:02:24.520> favor<00:02:24.819> as<00:02:25.090> a

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
and our physics play to our favor as a

giving him an additional speed boost and
have<00:02:59.769> tons<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.129> fun<00:03:00.310> doing<00:03:00.609> it

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.509 

let's<00:03:04.349> apply<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.680> little<00:03:04.920> out<00:03:05.189> of<00:03:05.219> the<00:03:05.370> box

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
let's apply a little out of the box

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.160 
let's apply a little out of the box
thinking<00:03:05.700> with<00:03:06.209> one<00:03:06.359> of<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.540> many<00:03:06.689> airborne

anything<00:03:10.049> so<00:03:10.709> hijacking<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.489> jet<00:03:11.760> really

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
anything so hijacking is jet really

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.880 
anything so hijacking is jet really
isn't<00:03:12.329> an<00:03:12.420> issue<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:13.200> this<00:03:13.439> might<00:03:13.709> be<00:03:13.859> a

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
isn't an issue and this might be a

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.160 
isn't an issue and this might be a
multimillion-dollar<00:03:14.670> military<00:03:15.299> plane<00:03:15.569> but

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.470 
till stop here thought give you an
opportunity<00:04:16.130> to<00:04:16.490> blow<00:04:16.730> up<00:04:16.880> something<00:04:17.120> truly

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
opportunity to blow up something truly

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.069 
opportunity to blow up something truly
massive

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.159 

I<00:04:20.579> guess<00:04:21.579> we're<00:04:21.759> going<00:04:21.879> man<00:04:22.210> vs.<00:04:22.629> bridge<00:04:22.900> with

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
I guess we're going man vs. bridge with

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.260 
I guess we're going man vs. bridge with
our<00:04:23.319> super<00:04:23.710> powerful<00:04:24.039> Hydra<00:04:24.610> missiles<00:04:24.970> and

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
our super powerful Hydra missiles and

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.110 
our super powerful Hydra missiles and
see<00:04:25.449> what<00:04:25.569> kind<00:04:25.689> of<00:04:25.810> damage<00:04:25.960> we<00:04:26.319> can<00:04:26.409> cause

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.210 

shooting<00:04:31.930> out<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.080> supports<00:04:32.620> will<00:04:32.800> result<00:04:33.100> to

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
shooting out the supports will result to

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.439 
shooting out the supports will result to
the<00:04:33.310> bridge<00:04:33.520> is<00:04:33.699> starting<00:04:34.000> in<00:04:34.090> tons<00:04:34.330> of

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
the bridge is starting in tons of

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.330 
the bridge is starting in tons of
different<00:04:34.510> ways<00:04:34.870> and<00:04:35.740> this<00:04:35.889> means<00:04:36.130> you<00:04:36.310> can

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
different ways and this means you can

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.920 
different ways and this means you can
come<00:04:36.610> up<00:04:36.699> with<00:04:36.850> your<00:04:37.000> own<00:04:37.060> great<00:04:37.660> action

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
come up with your own great action

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.330 
come up with your own great action
moments

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
moments

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.159 
moments
and<00:04:40.790> that's<00:04:40.970> the<00:04:41.090> core<00:04:41.389> of<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.630> sandbox

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:49.250 
and that's the core of the sandbox
experience

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.480

with the bridge out of commission Rico

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.460 
with the bridge out of commission Rico
can<00:04:51.670> focus<00:04:51.880> on<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.240> next<00:04:52.360> objective<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:53.020> to

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
make that a little easier we've

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.200 
make that a little easier we've

notice<00:05:01.870> fire<00:05:02.440> airdrop<00:05:02.970> this<00:05:03.970> beautiful<00:05:04.480> and

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
notice fire airdrop this beautiful and

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.300 
notice fire airdrop this beautiful and
peaceful<00:05:04.780> flight<00:05:05.230> offers<00:05:05.560> us<00:05:05.950> another

peaceful flight offers us another

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.860 
peaceful flight offers us another
opportunity<00:05:06.400> to<00:05:07.120> show<00:05:07.300> off<00:05:07.330> a<00:05:07.450> new<00:05:07.540> feature

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
opportunity to show off a new feature

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.010 
opportunity to show off a new feature
and<00:05:08.200> that's<00:05:08.590> our<00:05:08.740> new<00:05:08.920> stunting<00:05:09.370> system<00:05:09.990> so<00:05:10.990> we

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
and that's our new stunting system so we

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.050 
and that's our new stunting system so we
moved<00:05:11.320> away<00:05:11.470> from<00:05:11.920> the<00:05:12.010> specific<00:05:12.580> authored

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
moved away from the specific authored

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.210 
moved away from the specific authored
points<00:05:13.480> on<00:05:13.630> vehicles<00:05:14.080> from<00:05:14.320> JC<00:05:14.620> to<00:05:14.980> and

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
points on vehicles from JC to and

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.220 
points on vehicles from JC to and
allowed<00:05:15.670> the<00:05:15.820> player<00:05:15.970> total<00:05:16.510> freedom<00:05:16.750> on<00:05:17.020> top

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
allowed the player total freedom on top

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.260 
allowed the player total freedom on top
so<00:05:17.560> if<00:05:17.830> you<00:05:17.980> jump<00:05:18.280> out<00:05:18.400> onto<00:05:18.760> the<00:05:18.850> plane<00:05:19.090> you

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
so if you jump out onto the plane you

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.060 
so if you jump out onto the plane you
can<00:05:19.390> actually<00:05:19.600> walk<00:05:19.990> around<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.530> plane<00:05:20.770> wings

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
can actually walk around the plane wings

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.010 
can actually walk around the plane wings
themselves<00:05:21.700> and<00:05:21.910> of<00:05:22.450> course<00:05:22.660> the<00:05:22.810> plane

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
themselves and of course the plane

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.540 
themselves and of course the plane
itself<00:05:23.380> can<00:05:23.650> be<00:05:23.680> used<00:05:23.980> as<00:05:24.130> a<00:05:24.160> means<00:05:24.400> of

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
itself can be used as a means of

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.580 
itself can be used as a means of
destruction<00:05:24.900> maybe<00:05:25.900> we<00:05:26.050> should<00:05:26.200> get<00:05:26.260> off<00:05:26.410> the

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
destruction maybe we should get off the

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.780 
destruction maybe we should get off the
plane<00:05:26.770> first

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.030 

let's<00:05:32.390> swap<00:05:32.660> out<00:05:32.870> wings<00:05:33.170> four<00:05:33.410> wheels<00:05:33.620> and

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
let's swap out wings four wheels and

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.470 
let's swap out wings four wheels and
take<00:05:34.280> a<00:05:34.310> motorbike<00:05:34.760> for<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.060> remainder<00:05:35.360> of
