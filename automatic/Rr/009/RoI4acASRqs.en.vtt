00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.659 
so I just used that every week and I
just<00:04:25.300> think<00:04:25.509> that<00:04:25.690> that's<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.800> easiest<00:04:27.250> way

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
just think that that's the easiest way

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.070 
just think that that's the easiest way
to<00:04:27.729> deal<00:04:28.120> with<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.360> moisture<00:04:28.720> protein

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
to deal with the moisture protein

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.140 
to deal with the moisture protein
balance<00:04:29.470> as<00:04:30.069> far<00:04:30.310> as<00:04:30.400> your<00:04:30.550> conditioner<00:04:30.940> goes

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
balance as far as your conditioner goes

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.800 
balance as far as your conditioner goes
so<00:04:31.360> that's<00:04:31.539> number<00:04:31.690> three<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:32.710> ORS

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
so that's number three the ORS

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.379 
so that's number three the ORS
replenishing<00:04:34.810> conditioner<00:04:35.729> number<00:04:36.729> for<00:04:37.000> you

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
replenishing conditioner number for you

lightweight<00:04:49.840> I<00:04:50.440> just<00:04:51.300> think<00:04:52.300> it's<00:04:52.479> a<00:04:52.599> really

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780

good<00:04:53.190> leave<00:04:54.190> in<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.699> use<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.419> then<00:04:55.960> i

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
good leave in to use and then i

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.409 
good leave in to use and then i
recommend<00:04:56.560> that<00:04:56.710> you<00:04:56.800> seal<00:04:57.310> with<00:04:57.909> a<00:04:57.940> prote

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
recommend that you seal with a prote

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.330 
recommend that you seal with a prote
like<00:04:58.659> a<00:04:58.810> mayonnaise<00:04:59.409> cream<00:04:59.800> oil<00:05:00.009> like<00:05:00.310> a

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
like a mayonnaise cream oil like a

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.980 
like a mayonnaise cream oil like a
protein<00:05:00.819> oil<00:05:01.030> so<00:05:01.270> there<00:05:01.479> again<00:05:01.750> you're

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
protein oil so there again you're

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.649 
protein oil so there again you're
getting<00:05:02.110> your<00:05:02.409> protein<00:05:03.150> moisture<00:05:04.150> bounds<00:05:04.509> I

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
getting your protein moisture bounds I

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.839
