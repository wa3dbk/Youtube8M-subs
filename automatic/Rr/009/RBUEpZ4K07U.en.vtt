00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.800
 and good day youtube community 3.3 and 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.139
 I think I'm the first to do an analysis 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.510
 general of all the armors of the 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.640
 wit 4 in addition to specifying how it is 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.890
 what are you I think will work and good 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.780
 first of a whole list of all the 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.460
 armor that has revealed us to the 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.619
 today between the armors but not 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.480
 we obviously have the one that I call me 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.580
 join marc 7 and that is the armor that 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.619
 it brings chosen of master this armor 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.420
 obviously it will cost in the campaign 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.370
 but there is no confirmation if it will be in the 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.890
 multiplayer mode and also the other 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.970
 armor less important is the armor 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.070
 predetermined that we have seen in all 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.989
 the photos we know of player until the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.940
 date of now this armor is not yet 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.399
 It has a name but it is the one that is used 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.960
 by default with spartans 4 and 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.510
 the rest of the armors are the 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.430
 following the nato armor that is 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.070
 a second style samurai armor 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.750
 He has a very cool helmet and it is a 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.030
 armor as very attack style 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.100
 stealthy according to me the armor said out 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.989
 that looks like a robot according to me is a 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.580
 armor a bit heavy now to simple 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.380
 seen as good is an armor like now 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.090
 I said of robots you can not talk much 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.290
 from her my favorite armor of those that 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.480
 they revealed what it is 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.400
 armor huston this armor has a 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.560
 spectacular design according to I have a 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.390
 helmet that I think is a 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.740
 kind of heavy helmet reconnaissance 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.560
 of special operations there is no 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.330
 confirmation of this the dead eye helmet 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.920
 which is an apparently good armor 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.630
 as its name says dead eye that 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.940
 good will not change the gameplay at all 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.890
 but it has a very good style of design 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.900
 the armor and a leader who does his 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.120
 return of halo reach this time is not a 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.990
 little different but still maintains its 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.729
 essence 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.650
 I like it more as it looks now that 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.150
 the angels rich comparison on screen 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.070
 and posts leave the comments which you 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.470
 I liked it more like I said I like it a little 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.229
 more this and finally the new armor 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.210
 oceanic that looks a bit like cast 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.400
 cave but this time good have others 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.530
 extra attachments if you look at the 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.970
 feet or in the things that you have up 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.830
 shoulders are like parents and already what 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.170
 things like that the narcosis armor looks 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.720
 oceanic as it should very good also 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.119
 the helmet locus does not locust like those of 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.130
 gears of war not only feels the q 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.470
 final this armor looks like a 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.090
 skull is my favorite helmet that have 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.330
 Halo 4 made more than Chief 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.820
 master still 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.930
 and then you will assign me to obtain what 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.880
 do not have the pre-sale in the store 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.710
 selected and since I said the armors 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.450
 I would like to talk a bit more about the 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.670
 personalization good if we give ourselves 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.530
 count to buy a suit of armor with others 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.300
 we have several pieces that seems to be 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.240
 can customize that it's about 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.260
 left shoulder helmet right shoulder 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:39.020
 torso wrist guards upper leg 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.210
 knee leg lower leg and boots 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.010
 these pieces change armor against 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.940
 armor is to say it seems that you can 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.350
 personalize 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.030
 I also want to talk a little about the 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.100
 skins a lot of people have been telling me 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.200
 that I'm confused and that talking is not 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.209
 do not get confused the skins are not 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.730
 mandatory the skin is to look with 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.709
 a style but as we saw in the trailer 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.780
 of reinforcements halo club 4 or in the 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.610
 video as you want to call him we saw that 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.860
 the spartans were painted and not a 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.540
 mandatory skin images in this 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.420
 moment or the skin is for you 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.770
 choice if you want to see more but more 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.900
 bacano so to speak but it is not 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.640
 obligatory you will continue being able to paint 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.940
 your armor like me in white with green 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.890
 or like my friends in white with blue not 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.850
 I know and also before concluding this 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.710
 video I would like 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.270
 another thing is that lately many have 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.980
 been saying that halo is being 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.460
 becoming increasingly hard and why 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.200
 I say this 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.720
 in this good video is because people 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.850
 it's only a few days away and now and 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.310
 is how they will show us a lot of gameplay 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.290
 inside the multiplayer campaign and 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.150
 Spartans where we will surely see 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.220
 many changes to what we are 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.110
 accustomed before starting with my 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.120
 brothers would like to say that they have in 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.320
 mind that he is not so just scored two 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.780
 tours and but that hello is 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.330
 transforming halo 4 sky not 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.280
 want or be destroyed is only transformed 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.440
 good because it's 1 are treated are house 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.900
 tour and second good the reason is because 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.090
 if ice will become cause and 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.010
 would take the recipe for call of duty and 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.020
 is to do the same game over and over again 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.700
 not surprised by the Cape 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.980
 south and I have nothing against the 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.230
 franchise I'm just clarifying points 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.940
 so that they do not deviate from what is halo 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.900
 and give call of duty classes as he said 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.200
 three four having stress are 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.670
 different franchises and you do not need 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.040
 relate so it is that halo is gay 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.830
 crazy durex cavastur and they will have you 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.260
 like halo but now it will be halo 4 with 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.790
 obvious changes after 10 years of being 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.420
 a similar game I'm not saying it's a 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.190
 equal to the other 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.080
 but just to give a refreshed a bath 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.090
 of cold water to the franchise that was 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.040
 every community I wish you liked the 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.930
 video if it was like this little hand up denle 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.150

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.430
 words comment subscribe safor more
