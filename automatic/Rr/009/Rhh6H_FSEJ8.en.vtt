00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.960
 good to all welcome to the new 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:07.540
 episode of 2,902 coins that we had 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.820
 already car and ten more 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.680
 we are already here and we are going to sign jerome 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.389
 boateng and let's start with a weight 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.050
 heavy no longer defense jerome boateng 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:20.020
 1,100 coins with better numbers 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.250
 defenses of the bundesliga 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.920
 there is very cheap was a modem 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.830
 pretty good the central one of the bayern of 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.869
 Munich 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.119
 this was a boat that was going to make 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.530
 our team is more and more company 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.239
 more competitive 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.470
 of lanz so that we can compete more in 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.720
 the defense plus something also from 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.520
 rapport to the goalkeeper and let's go to 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:49.640
 for the second central and will serve a 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.560
 an old acquaintance of the barclays called 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.810
 past years in cifa 12 and others was 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.540
 an authentic beast of barclays that 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.570
 I played in the arsenal if I remember correctly 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.850
 it was a fixed beast from 11 to 13 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.230
 it was also very good they gave up that 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.089
 where I had tried it, yes, I was going to 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.370
 see that it worked for me 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.360
 I really had very good 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:14.330
 expectations with the defense very very high 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.070
 and that I was going to be a pretty couple 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.650
 pretty good together with jerome boateng 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.390
 and now we are going to go for another transfer 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.479
 more this time and let's put lateral 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.770
 left jansen you will have seen it in 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.570
 others when the des that brought from 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.670
 German or the German league and so on 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.430
 an authentic lateral beast 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.619
 left 191 for a left side 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.399
 had to be yes or yes in this series 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:40.130
 james in very good left side to 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.680
 for him for the team and see that only 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.369
 we have to improve that right side 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.369
 as well 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.830
 the one that had come in the envelope 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.500
 initiation so that's how we would stay 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.330
 the team as they do with youtube with 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.740
 janssen only that side remained 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.500
 bronze right and we're going to go for 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.350
 all the truth that would have been 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.550
 the conversation right you can not and 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.550
 look at the rival team 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.320
 they work already in dm dncd nothing to convince 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.420
 then take icardi from forward in that 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.870
 order and I do for tomorrow and other minute 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.570
 6 missing in his favor will get him out 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.250
 to play with Steven , we're going to 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.390
 steal with ya konan ya konan was going to go 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.340
 by the band well ya konan was going to put it 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:41.810
 and with a lot of luck like that he got the ball 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.790
 for in 0 to 1 in minute 7 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.730
 but these teams without rapport 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.310
 they are the teams that more wars for 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.760
 Above all they were giving us 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.530
 they were giving 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.010
 these teams five moments when 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.890
 they worked the first time 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.650
 aupa calls me and gets us with the grape 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.269
 million tie to one the rival who has 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.980
 made a pretty good play 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.360
 touch with your computer without 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.799
 understanding I understand how they can 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.329
 make a team without communication a 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.760
 play as good as the one I had done 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:15.060
 this opponent in this goal playing and 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.650
 taking it perfect I could not do it 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.540
 understand but very good play by 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.380
 true and had bought the kits from 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.570
 bayern of Munich for 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.300
 to be more stylish and also 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.620
 Wallonia for ya konan ya konan for head 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.340
 that fulfilled a thousand 12 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.549
 well ya konan to put 12 we go back to 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.299
 get ahead but the joy does not 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:42.640
 it was going to last us a bit but here we go 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.940
 repeated the play very good movie without 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.140
 egg beyond head and not good 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.260
 to eat and although it will take away from 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.159
 obraniak who missed goalie again 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.120
 that goes out for grapes and the goal they achieve yak 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.340
 it was not full either, it's not very good 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.930
 goalkeeper because he gets very irregular from the 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.819
 party where he makes a few candidates 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.129
 tremendous but other parties those that 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.620
 does this that is worth the party is like 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.170
 if the goalkeeper was not there and in the 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.540
 90th minute the game is over 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.579
 tied in game if he got to play 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.650
 against the species without rapport 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.350
 but it was almost impossible was 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.900
 playing very well so tied a 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.000
 authentic disappointment tie this match already 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.340
 true that when I found the rival 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.669
 it looked like it was going to be a shake something 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.669
 easy the exception of the front d 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.720
 of his team so nothing and we're going to go 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.030
 already for the other signing this is another weight 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.400
 heavy draxler julian draxler for me the 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:45.180
 best midfielder 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.620
 almost from the after coaches reus 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.240
 second big plus players 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.500
 quite expensive I think that of the 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.750
 cheap is the best player in the 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.639
 bundesliga of the cheap ga claire a 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.889
 mediocentro with a lot of quality and that 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:59.250
 makes me the perfect links the imperfect 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:02.699
 that to top of conversation together our 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.650
 same hundred dropped very good this draxler 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.930
 I had already tried it on other occasions 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.199
 he had laughed is co-leader and here too 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.419
 I bring you the right side that 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:15.840
 We found that today he is going to buy film 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.220
 only 250 coins a hundred percent already 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.020
 that the right sides of the 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.110
 Bundesliga are all pretty pretty 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.120
 expensive so I've decided to this one that by 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.210
 at least run more 80 compensation idea 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.470
 to have the equipment already quite well 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.200
 blended 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.320
 to play there was not going to be yet 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.810
 empty cup match let's take this 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.150
 it was seasonal and look what happened here 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.970
 the rival with arda turan with isco with the 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:46.270
 medium grape and without penetration with 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.430
 karim benzema with alexis sanchez with 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.860
 montoya with pepe con pica with xabi 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.170
 alonso a tremendous contest the ball that 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.940
 I was already square on that first play 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.850
 I want to take the with montoya montoya 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.530
 for natural and the bounce on it is 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.810
 I saw the Raquel trailer to dodge 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.550
 So it's going to go inside that good 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.930
 the move from which we started the marker very 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.020
 good those four is in danger as well 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.430
 used by part of carrying our md 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.610
 that the one who has a bit of art this 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.900
 there to hitler delete it the aspect of 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.260
 this player on the floor but hey 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.780
 pretty good goals and we're going to 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.550
 anticipate me I expected a lot 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.620
 more of this rival with the equipazo that 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.990
 had here we had in the 90th minute that 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.380
 was going to take the ball and it's conan 190 already 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.120
 and ball for car car was going to fall in 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.580
 New air bounce for Brazil is what 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.830
 must already put konan and ya konan was going to 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:38.830
 mark the 0-2 minute 90 the opponent was 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.570
 quite pretty fake when 6 to have 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.750
 the equipped one that had and have there water 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:46.480
 tomorrow with 6 of rapport a little 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.060
 that practice was done and he really played 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.820
 bad of the rival for what he had was 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:55.540
 quite bad enough so nothing like that 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:58.260
 will end here the match 0-2 against 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.900
 this rival that either 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:05.070
 and I did not know what the truth was 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:07.169
 so it's not going here and we're going to go there 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:10.350
 you see from above the state of the fc 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:13.110
 barcelona the camp nou pretty good 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:16.440
 these graphics of the xv uruguay so 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.930
 nothing here I was going to fire this 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.030
 episode in the next one I think I was going 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.520
 to start the euro tournament so we 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.780
 we see in the next episode leave 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.210
 your comments that we have appeared 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.800
 recommend more signings for when 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:33.020
 start high complete a high 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.020
 competition from now I here say goodbye
