00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.160
 when it gets slick on the streets, spreaders and gritting vehicles take care of it 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.259
 that they become passable again 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.340
 Saarland is only scattered to protect the environment if it is for reasons 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.989
 Traffic safety and traffic flow seems inevitable 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.030
 without the structures give it in heavy snowfall or freezing rain 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.159
 hardly a progress 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:29.690
 already the approach to a run 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.930
 create an unused highway 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.330
 the adhesion of the wheels is limited 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.000
 who does not accelerate compassion here 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 lurches after a few meters 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.190
 see traffic signs irradiated and speed limit 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.690
 Do not overtake children or children anymore 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.800
 so it is recommended 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.370
 to comply with the road conditions adapted speed 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.639
 Fall foggy snowy or icy play out 

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:02.639
 ensure a clear view as soon as possible 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.760
 however, the use of salt will increase the risk of accidents 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.710
 on highways 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.410
 which lowered considerably 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.890
 The Federal Ministry of Transport has calculated that per kilometer 20 000 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.570
 d-mark accident consequential costs less occur Velen except when used 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.500
 become 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.910
 if the information was clearing vehicles on both lanes 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.910
 Do not scatter again 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.200
 When changing proposal would have on cleared roads surfaces or 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.899
 vice versa 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.380
 is because of the different 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.600
 Attention, but careful 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.600
 So far, Bonn has remained 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.680
 strong visual disabilities due to the sudden onset of winter 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.550
 he knew about it 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.670
 the windscreen promises 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.670
 refrain from overtaking under such conditions 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.590
 on slippery roads is often driven with too little distance 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.750
 In winter, every motorist should be at least twice as long 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.750
 Keep safety distance 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:16.759
 the emergency station slowed the vehicle remained in the overtaking Straubing 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:25.789
 new motorway exit which necessarily reduce the speed 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:28.879
 and start up in the daytime 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.279
 May suddenly be in snowfall, the entrances and exits are still hoping 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:34.999
 uncleared 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:38.099
 for visual impairments in the previous quarter 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.120
 Such questions in the winter the four forehand mistakes again and again 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.489
 be underestimated 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:45.969
 freedom
