00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.560
 good wave that I've done is a family business 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:12.239
 this is jaldín to see gamboa 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:14.439
 in miramar of mérida 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.289
 there comes the name of marquez 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.859
 we 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.859
 that company but sometimes in family businesses 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.789
 the one that jewelery December in law 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.789
 but now 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.340
 we are all in the thud 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.280
 we were eliminated 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.280
 the script of the first venue that was opened to whom the blow is 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.440
 really start with a jewelry case 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.500
 working for some manufacturers 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.530
 visit us wholesale customers 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.150
 she split the idea that I could form a group 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.910
 of people selling 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.470
 when strong customers did not ask us 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.010
 then invite to participate 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.400
 to people who had then the beauty salon that a housewife 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.850
 to trade we could call informal 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.390
 who will buy us when the 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.460
 the big businesses did not buy us the standard that is a company with 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.460
 years and 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.850
 days approximately 10 years 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.850
 to be positioning it that is the mark of the Marquis's as such 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.940
 exist 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.940
 of this business 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.090
 of a brand 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.090
 that comes from the roots 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.500
 of our Mexico 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.500
 weather aston villa 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.220
 you must answer this difference of 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.120
 we try to make everything natural 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.660
 the glass we do not make too 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.810
 it takes labor 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.810
 the system that is a 100% Mexican company 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.809
 proudly 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:12.019
 reflects the talent 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.739
 of designers 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.119
 of goldsmiths 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:19.119
 important number of people who work every day to 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.509
 in the markets 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.999
 quality designs for us 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:28.079
 given the opportunities 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.269
 of business 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.409
 we do everything that is a strategic planning constantly in the 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.370
 business note in this strength of those weaknesses see what opportunities there are 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.759
 that threaten 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:41.499
 this is good I think right now 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:45.439
 there have been closings late to the pope the coin quesada the falleros things we 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.459
 affect 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.459
 asked for the citation not just in this country I think it is 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:55.059
 because these that 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:59.239
 many people and where you attend an act like this we will reject las vegas 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.419
 and the one of madrid for example 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.049
 much more people participated 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.269
 yes one has noticed 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.899
 the situation is very 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:10.179
 but nevertheless 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:11.569
 in other markets 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.299
 the export and that is a very good option 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.349
 to the times that we are spending here our country 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.569
 we understand what it is 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.029
 all the time is generating added value 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:24.019
 to create differentiation 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.449
 to take advantage of all the cultural wealth 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:30.069
 that we have in our country to reflect the value-added yoquese 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.069
 abroad where it is highly appreciated 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:36.029
 globalization demands us 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:37.629
 a lot of dynamism 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.099
 it demands us to act with a lot of speed 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.499
 not only 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:43.709
 to capture and develop 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.849
 to grasp absolve trends you develop designs 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:49.879
 but also to go 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.289
 because constantly changing 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:57.559
 said a good friend that we can not have a different color we are 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:59.489
 immersed in a 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.459
 changing every day where there is no time 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.759
 over time we can win and that is the great challenge 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:08.139
 then I consider as 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.059
 industrial entrepreneurship 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:13.869
 of externar motatán wonderful and as exciting as is the jewelry 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:17.829
 the great challenge that industrialists in this field have today 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:22.289
 that this world so mobile so globalized 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.680
 that demands us 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.919
 every time be much more creative much more dynamic 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.340
 and above all 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.050
 of generation of added value 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.370
 liberty differentiation
