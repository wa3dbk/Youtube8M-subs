00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello I'll show you one today 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.790
 Connect ssd hard disk to a pc 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.500
 First we need as sata 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.780
 cable one has here and in this end 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.079
 there is a jack plug under the and 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.769
 invited the other side than just 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.869
 to weigh 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.919
 Here come here better and one 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.149
 connect the hard disk 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:29.009
 because of the care we open first 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.529
 I have the side views of the pcs 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:39.179
 already done 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:43.980
 then we look for the hard drives stuck 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:46.730
 insert them here and close that first 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.730
 water cable 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:58.079
 We also know that the 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:01.019
 pronunciation here therefore the fight on the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:07.880
 right side is there you can see it too 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:07.880
 here all festplatz here at the right 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:16.619
 connect 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.890
 next you have to be a straw man 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.780
 Close this need you have to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.050
 just feel a different cable from the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.320
 power supply or an existing one 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:33.030
 these are multiple plugs always easy 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.509
 an existing connect the left 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.509
 connection 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.549
 sometimes a bit difficult because the 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.860
 Cables are not a worry that nothing 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.649
 Broken 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:01.069
 So this page is driving you only have to 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:05.640
 still the cable simply through a gap 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:07.200
 from the pc then lead to the mainboard 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.630
 change now we change now 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.360
 his 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.230
 Now we come to the most important part of the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:21.140
 connection but board search first 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:27.209
 the sata connections are 12 34 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:29.579
 then we put two in each case 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.269
 the cable passed through the 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:37.170
 slit than that is the year this 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.849
 lower so here with the score after 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.319
 above 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.690
 before his pretty plate after 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.880
 above 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.880
 yes, but we can start the pc 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.640
 now you can also see him if one 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.760
 hard disk is connected to the target 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.219
 that my my hard drive a second 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.810
 hard disk with a terabyte and the 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:08.590
 third hard drive the ssd is likely 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.590
 disk space 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.930
 Ok, now we're stuck 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:28.319
 to test it out once it really works 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:28.319
 hard disk now off 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.099
 and the disk disappears stuck 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.099
 again 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.270
 and already has the pure ssd hard disk 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.270
 built-in
