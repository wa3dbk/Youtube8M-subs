 gasoleros the phenomenon of consoles 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.940
 cheap seems to be one of the trends 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.670
 most important for the gamer industry 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.470
 along with the possibility of playing in a 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.280
 console that we all have within reach of 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.350
 the hand and that's the cell phone 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.110
 james is one of the most projects 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.330
 interesting are called game tic a 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.790
 joystick with a controller similar to 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.060
 a pendrive that is plugged in by hdmi to 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:33.260
 the TV its main weapon is the price 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:36.650
 since it would sell for just $ 79 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.150
 and bring about 200 games per factory 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.190
 now he is looking for investors in 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.560
 kickstarter which is a platform for 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.729
 collective financing we will see if 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.729
 it gets to develop 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:55.950
 another option will be one that is already written 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.980
 with and a very small box that works 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.440
 of console that is connected by hdmi to the 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.680
 tele and includes a control its price 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.900
 suggested would be $ 99 your hook 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.880
 it would be that all the games will be free 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.550
 to test them if you like them you can 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.440
 buying the variety would be very big already 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.510
 that will have an open platform so 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.910
 that any developer can create 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.470
 games for wii although there are projects 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.090
 guys and independents 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.100
 the big companies do not want 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.070
 lose this envy business for example 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.990
 ads projects youtube a console 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.780
 which is a joystick with 5 screen 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.030
 inches a chip tegra 4 and the system 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.550
 operative android will also be able 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.710
 connect to the lcd by hdmi and it could 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.010
 incorporate in addition to games to android 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.170
 pc games through the platform 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.520
 estimated these links were presented 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.800
 Figueres 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.420
 again the main idea is to abandon 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.850
 the expensive last consoles 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.790
 generation by simpler equipment more 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.370
 easier economic 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.569
 so we can play more and more 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.569
 easy and cheaper 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:08.580
 the games of the week 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.330
 on this occasion 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.680
 the most famous mouse in the world returns in 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:27.769
 the sequel to the mickey epic 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.230
 in this renamed version of now the 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.780
 power of two can now be played in 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.090
 cooperative mode using mikel and 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.000
 also to osvaldo that was something like 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.980
 the prehistory of mikel as in his 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.659
 previous version the story takes place 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.900
 in the world of disney characters 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:46.370
 old and retired the continuation is 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.799
 quite direct from the mickey epic 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.989
 original and the game form is also 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.599
 very similar the change this time is that 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.030
 osvaldo can be controlled by the 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.280
 machine or by the second player and in 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.859
 instead of a brush like mikel has a 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.590
 Remote control to attack or modify 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.629
 some element of the stage attentive 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.489
 because this game was exclusive before 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.849
 for the wii but now it's also for 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:13.810
 pc for xbox to play for wii and mac and 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.819
 for nintendo 3ds 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.919
 by decision the sad moment and the 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.880
 goodbye I tell you again that we are 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.500
