00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Now that he has the technique all so far 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.430
 have presented but as I said 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.049
 only for the middle range in the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.940
 easy contact I want you to 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.530
 Complete a nice combination with 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.790
 give 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.420
 everything you have learned in the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.859
 last eight videos almost occurs in it 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.600
 and you should have such a combination 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.930
 then you can see pretty much 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:28.460
 Good and the judge will be in contact 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.460
 this combination already proven 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.680
 We did not just introduce ourselves 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.210
 good combination i want it short and 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.980
 keep it crisp 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.530
 we'll do that again with the two 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.320
 We start from scratch purely emanating yet 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.620
 not different with the subsequent one 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.649
 Movement Turned away to blow 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.930
 then I'll get them to understand this is 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.489
 usually at a very fast then get 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.070
 I do not hook with a back 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.609
 stimulates bit in reserve perfect and 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.980
 below capable and so it at the headmaster 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.359
 then he is the opponent diversity 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.200
 really stupid of you really 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.990
 dominant technically clean normal whole 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.060
 move in there while driving 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.060
 come forward fans question in it 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.960
 Nice combinations in any case 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.490
 of course you have chips and vests 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.160
 yes, usually no support because of the 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:31.100
 Complainant at the start must have something completely 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:32.870
 a little bit faster again me 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.720
 notice you notice but already if 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.190
 the hook beats you have already 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.680
 Survey a bit lost that too 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.840
 balance is missing her leg what I 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.660
 wars is pretty easy so how does it fit? 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.520
 like a gear in each other well together 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.190
 The combination was so fast 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.780
 come along once again slipped 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.780
 away so I have to go back to the 6 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.020
 but i can not do it fast 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.060
 do 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.680
 that would fly the ears around me 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.890
 try to make it faster 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:11.110
 a bit back barely more 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:22.040
 a slipped was good the dejected 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:23.330
 have met a bit again 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.030
 she still can not do anything 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.250
 cover at least surcharge for 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.410
 Build the election with a header 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.880
 you can still blocked that 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.440
 but a capable one was already 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.870
 again so something beats off 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.920
 definitely 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.470
 The thing is always just such a thing 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.060
 Landing a combination is natural 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.190
 difficult but you have enough with it 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.190
 do the middle to claim 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.620
 to push his fight forward 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.910
 all other factors like bother 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.760
 I attack 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.830
 there is still a combination then you are 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.050
 Well, that's okay, you're good 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.820
 will you win the fight too? 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.750
 I wish you much success in your 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.030
 fighting somehow always gives a lot 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.040
 these combinations around and tried 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.680
 easy to use in the fight 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.810
 you you take this before the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.140
 that means he's going in for the fight 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.720
 I want this fight once this 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.180
 combination that's exactly the goal 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.550
 Boys then fight when you look at them 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.960
 another case brings to has in the 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.240
 trends fight or a training evening 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.610
 a target 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.040
 I will bring this combination someday 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.570
 Once you've made a man you have something 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.570
 it works well
