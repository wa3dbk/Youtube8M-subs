00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
whether it be another nail polish or

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.900 
whether it be another nail polish or
another<00:04:47.990> product<00:04:48.320> and<00:04:48.710> it's<00:04:49.190> a<00:04:49.310> great<00:04:49.490> time<00:04:49.760> to

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
another product and it's a great time to

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.940 
another product and it's a great time to
add<00:04:50.060> on<00:04:50.270> one<00:04:50.750> of<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:50.960> polishes<00:04:51.440> because<00:04:51.740> they

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
add on one of the polishes because they

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.470 
add on one of the polishes because they
actually<00:04:52.070> end<00:04:52.370> up<00:04:52.430> being<00:04:52.640> really<00:04:52.850> inexpensive

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
actually end up being really inexpensive

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.880 
actually end up being really inexpensive
instead<00:04:53.750> of<00:04:53.870> paying<00:04:54.110> like<00:04:54.290> fourteen<00:04:54.770> dollars
