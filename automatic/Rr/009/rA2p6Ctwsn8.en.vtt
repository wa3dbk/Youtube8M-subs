00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
barely gonna pressure 969 60 millibars

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:04.959 
barely gonna pressure 969 60 millibars
and<00:04:01.719> we<00:04:02.719> were<00:04:02.930> in<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.290> eye<00:04:03.319> and<00:04:04.249> we<00:04:04.489> found<00:04:04.700> some
