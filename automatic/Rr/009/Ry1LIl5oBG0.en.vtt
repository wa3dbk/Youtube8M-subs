00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
you line up your line to the position

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.279 
you line up your line to the position
that<00:00:23.580> you'd<00:00:23.730> like<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.090> be<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.390> right<00:00:24.869> now<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.170> is

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
that you'd like to be in right now it is

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.740 
that you'd like to be in right now it is
in<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.470> off<00:00:25.680> position<00:00:26.210> you<00:00:27.210> would<00:00:27.300> turn<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.630> to

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
in the off position you would turn it to

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.519 
in the off position you would turn it to
the<00:00:27.869> right<00:00:28.910> to<00:00:29.910> turn<00:00:30.150> into<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.840> cook<00:00:31.050> position

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
the right to turn into the cook position

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.000 
the right to turn into the cook position
or<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:32.489> turn<00:00:32.669> your<00:00:32.850> oven<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.649> you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.829> also

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
or to turn your oven on you can also

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.900 
or to turn your oven on you can also
hear<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.730> fan<00:00:36.000> kicks<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:37.640> when<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.760> turn

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
hear that the fan kicks on when you turn

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.950 
hear that the fan kicks on when you turn
it<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.390> cook<00:00:39.780> mode<00:00:41.390> now<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.629> turn<00:00:42.809> it

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
it to the cook mode now you can turn it

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.310 
it to the cook mode now you can turn it
back<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.530> off<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.640> then<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.270> over<00:00:45.690> here<00:00:45.899> is

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
back to off and then this over here is

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.160 
back to off and then this over here is
cool<00:00:46.739> down<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.789> would<00:00:47.910> turn<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.270> dial<00:00:49.020> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
cool down so you would turn the dial to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.520 
cool down so you would turn the dial to
the<00:00:49.350> left<00:00:50.180> to<00:00:51.180> put<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.690> into<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.079> cool<00:00:52.289> down

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the left to put it into the cool down

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.470 
the left to put it into the cool down
position<00:00:52.710> which<00:00:53.039> would<00:00:53.399> quickly<00:00:53.850> cool<00:00:54.300> your

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
position which would quickly cool your

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.330 
position which would quickly cool your
oven<00:00:54.750> from<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.140> temperature<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.770> another<00:00:56.010> or

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
oven from one temperature to another or

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.900 
oven from one temperature to another or
cool<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.210> off<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.809> end<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.230> day<00:00:58.910> you

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
cool it off for the end of the day you

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.479 
cool it off for the end of the day you
also<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> option<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.170> lights<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:02.430> you
