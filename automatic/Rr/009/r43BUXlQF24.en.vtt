00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.040 
in its class so this weapon kills it
about<00:00:41.190> two<00:00:42.059> shots<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.480> close<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.899> medium

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
about two shots that close to medium

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.709 
about two shots that close to medium
range<00:00:43.500> which<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.040> very<00:00:44.430> good<00:00:44.700> looking<00:00:45.570> at<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
range which is very good looking at a

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.779 
range which is very good looking at a
long<00:00:45.899> distance<00:00:45.930> shot<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.800> may<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.010> three<00:00:47.760> or

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
long distance shot it may be three or

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.299 
long distance shot it may be three or
four<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:49.320> still<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.530> really<00:00:49.739> good<00:00:50.039> gun

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
four but it's still a really good gun

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.000 
four but it's still a really good gun
with<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.000> being<00:00:51.180> said<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:52.020> fire<00:00:52.530> rate<00:00:52.860> is

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
with that being said the fire rate is

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.880 
with that being said the fire rate is
the<00:00:53.699> second<00:00:54.390> slowest<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:55.860> actually

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the second slowest so that can actually

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.549 
the second slowest so that can actually
affect<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.789> games<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.989> way<00:00:58.109> maximum

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
affect you in games the way maximum

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.200 
affect you in games the way maximum

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
rifle should be played it should be used

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.479 
rifle should be played it should be used

back at a sit on the edges of the map
and<00:01:05.100> picking<00:01:05.489> people<00:01:05.670> off<00:01:05.939> supporting<00:01:06.689> those

attachments I'm using I'm using red dot
sight<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.070> silencer<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.750> red<00:01:12.960> dot<00:01:13.170> sight

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
sight and silencer so the red dot sight

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.109 
sight and silencer so the red dot sight
is<00:01:13.470> gonna<00:01:13.619> give<00:01:13.770> me<00:01:13.950> better<00:01:14.250> accuracy<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
is gonna give me better accuracy and

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.940 
is gonna give me better accuracy and
better<00:01:15.390> precision<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:16.110> my<00:01:16.320> shot<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
better precision with my shot and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.649 
better precision with my shot and
generally<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.490> prefer<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:18.090> over<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.420> iron

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
generally I prefer it over the iron

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.560 
generally I prefer it over the iron
sights<00:01:18.990> are<00:01:19.320> gestures<00:01:19.770> red<00:01:20.070> dot<00:01:20.390> going<00:01:21.390> down

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
sights are gestures red dot going down

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.749 
sights are gestures red dot going down
to<00:01:21.720> suppress<00:01:22.200> said<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> suppressor<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.580> this

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
to suppress said the suppressor so this

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.640 
to suppress said the suppressor so this
the<00:01:24.150> reason<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.450> chose<00:01:24.659> suppressor<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.320> this

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the reason I chose suppressor is this

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.920 
the reason I chose suppressor is this
weapon<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.369> two-shot<00:01:26.939> kill<00:01:26.970> with<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
weapon is a two-shot kill with and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.230 
weapon is a two-shot kill with and
without<00:01:28.290> suppressor<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.939> may<00:01:30.090> as<00:01:30.150> well

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
without suppressor so you may as well

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.450 
without suppressor so you may as well
put<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.780> suppressor<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.409> trying<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.070> avoid

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
put the suppressor on trying to avoid

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.870 
put the suppressor on trying to avoid
those<00:01:32.759> unfair<00:01:33.710> gunfights<00:01:34.710> or<00:01:34.950> encounters<00:01:35.610> on

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
those unfair gunfights or encounters on

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.160 
those unfair gunfights or encounters on
the<00:01:36.060> enemy<00:01:36.329> team<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.869> may<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.020> well<00:01:37.079> just

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
the enemy team so you may as well just

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.800 
the enemy team so you may as well just
use<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.579> going<00:01:38.759> down<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.210> my<00:01:39.329> secondary

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
use it so going down to my secondary

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.749 
use it so going down to my secondary
lethal<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.350> tactical<00:01:40.380> I'm<00:01:41.070> not<00:01:41.280> using<00:01:41.460> any

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
lethal and tactical I'm not using any

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.090 
lethal and tactical I'm not using any

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
just because I don't really like the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.230 
just because I don't really like the
secondaries<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.280> wanted<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.610> maximize<00:01:47.759> my

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
secondaries and I wanted to maximize my

like like my crosshairs that way I can

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.080 
like like my crosshairs that way I can
maybe<00:02:04.140> get<00:02:04.350> those<00:02:04.560> hipfire<00:02:05.100> shots<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.880> course

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
maybe get those hipfire shots of course

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.050 
maybe get those hipfire shots of course
distance<00:02:06.570> because<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.469> quite<00:02:07.770> bad<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060

so<00:02:12.220> yeah<00:02:12.450> without<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.599> quick-draw

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
so yeah without the quick-draw

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.170 
so yeah without the quick-draw
quick-draw<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.920> gonna<00:02:15.220> allow<00:02:15.519> me<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.700> snap<00:02:16.030> on

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
quick-draw is gonna allow me to snap on

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.390 
quick-draw is gonna allow me to snap on
to<00:02:16.209> that<00:02:16.450> enemies<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.870> lot<00:02:17.230> quicker<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.830> get

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
to that enemies a lot quicker and get

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.119 
to that enemies a lot quicker and get
the<00:02:18.549> picks<00:02:19.510> faster<00:02:20.049> than<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.409> enemy<00:02:20.799> would

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
the picks faster than the enemy would

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:21.809 
the picks faster than the enemy would
get<00:02:21.340> on<00:02:21.430> me

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
get on me

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.729

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
so is it makes aiming just a little bit

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.190 
so is it makes aiming just a little bit
faster<00:02:24.159> and<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.430> lot<00:02:24.610> better<00:02:24.819> that<00:02:25.629> sounds<00:02:25.989> I'm

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200
