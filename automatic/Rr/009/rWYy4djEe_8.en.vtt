00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
and while listening to it I started

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.149 
and while listening to it I started
thinking<00:01:52.750> how<00:01:52.869> in<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.290> world<00:01:53.320> do<00:01:53.979> they<00:01:54.100> talk

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
thinking how in the world do they talk

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.800 
thinking how in the world do they talk
that<00:01:54.490> fast<00:01:54.520> like<00:01:55.060> I<00:01:55.149> really<00:01:55.450> just<00:01:55.630> can't

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
that fast like I really just can't

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.170 
that fast like I really just can't
comprehend<00:01:56.560> how<00:01:56.800> they<00:01:56.950> can<00:01:57.100> do<00:01:57.220> this<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:57.520> I'm

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
comprehend how they can do this and I'm

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.370 
comprehend how they can do this and I'm
starting<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:58.509> think<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.869> rappers<00:01:59.200> just

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
starting to think the rappers just

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.950 
starting to think the rappers just
aren't<00:01:59.560> human<00:01:59.890> like<00:02:00.130> I<00:02:00.369> mean<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:01.570> makes<00:02:01.810> sense

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
aren't human like I mean it makes sense

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.749 
aren't human like I mean it makes sense
right<00:02:02.290> I<00:02:02.530> wonder<00:02:02.920> where<00:02:03.009> all<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.220> animals<00:02:03.610> go

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
right I wonder where all the animals go

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.490 
right I wonder where all the animals go
when<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.390> starts<00:02:04.600> raining<00:02:04.720> I<00:02:05.020> wonder<00:02:05.320> if<00:02:05.409> they

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
when it starts raining I wonder if they

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.749 
when it starts raining I wonder if they
all<00:02:05.649> just<00:02:05.860> go<00:02:05.979> underground<00:02:06.190> sound<00:02:06.580> like<00:02:06.729> a
