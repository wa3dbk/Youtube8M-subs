00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.766
 Find the absolute value of x, symbolized by the form | | | 

00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:09.336
 Where x = 5, x = - 10 and x = - 12 

00:00:09.336 --> 00:00:11.032
 If the absolute value is 

00:00:11.032 --> 00:00:14.382
 The method of writing will be 

00:00:14.382 --> 00:00:16.499
 More complex than they actually are 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:21.516
 The absolute value is actually the distance from (zero) to (x) 

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:25.632
 Distance from zero 

00:00:25.632 --> 00:00:28.581
 So let me draw the line here 

00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:31.988
 Let's put a zero here 

00:00:31.988 --> 00:00:34.982
 Since we take the distance from zero 

00:00:34.982 --> 00:00:39.785
 Let's think about , When x = 5 

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:43.164
 This means the absolute value of 5 

00:00:43.164 --> 00:00:45.351
 We are only compensating x for number 5 

00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:48.816
 | 5 | The distance is from 0 to 5 

00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:51.967
 We'll go 1,2,3,4,5 

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:55.448
 5 is exactly 5 to the right of zero 

00:00:55.448 --> 00:00:59.849
 If | Are (5) 

00:00:59.849 --> 00:01:01.581
 Now, I think you already see it 

00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:02.765
 It is a very straightforward concept 

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:04.140
 Now, let's do something more interesting 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.325
 To reckon | - 10 | 

00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:10.484
 Or | , Where (x = - 10) 

00:01:10.484 --> 00:01:12.781
 We only put - 10 instead of (x) 

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:16.420
 This is the distance between 0 and 10 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:24.039
 Let's go -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.349
 You must extend the setup line more 

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:28.500
 We put - 10 here 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.053
 How far is from 0? 

00:01:32.053 --> 00:01:34.700
 10 units to the left of zero 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.949
 If so, put 10 here 

00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:40.672
 If in general the absolute value is always positive 

00:01:40.672 --> 00:01:45.087
 If we think of absolute value it is only numbers 

00:01:45.087 --> 00:01:48.533
 The absolute value will be the positive version of the same number 

00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:49.949
 Let us try another number 

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:51.448
 This invites us to try another number 

00:01:51.448 --> 00:01:54.915
 | , When x = -12 

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:58.233
 If we have the absolute value of the number -12 

00:01:58.233 --> 00:01:59.577
 We will not need to look at the setup line 

00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:02.649
 The positive version will be for 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.149
 If equal to 12 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.333
 This means that 12 is 12 units from zero 

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:10.798
 We can draw it here 

00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:12.742
 -11, -12 here 

00:02:12.742 --> 99:59:59.999
 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 units of zero
