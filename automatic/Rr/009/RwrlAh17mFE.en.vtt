 smadi madrid i introduce you to martín hello madrid 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.050
 it is really splendid truth is as big as a horse 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.250
 that took me my first question as a Great Dane session as mario is the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.620
 quala race for me 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.560
 First of all it is to say which race best suits your lifestyle and 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.670
 you know your life 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.620
 I do not know if with your work team I will be very much at home or not 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.910
 but in your case there was pointed with you will find a great agency 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.060
 marriage to say it in some way that will help to choose the correct race 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.400
 for you 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.490
 how does it work 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.840
 you ask simple questions or your personality I'm not sure if they are 29 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.020
 questions however I'm not sure I want to answer some of your 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.720
 questions but asks you about the kind of environment in which these and things 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.439
 well the board with all the information to basically find the race more 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:36.620
 right for you 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.870
 when I know that I want to 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.870
 I'm just looking for a creator to specialize that race 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.030
 it is not so simple who because unfortunately not all 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.250
 creators are equal 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.410
 is to look for the right creator in general have excellent facilities have 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.909
 healthy dog ​​is important that a dog is healthy che obviously 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.159
 I prefer to think that they also feel passion for the race that they really believe 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.600
 in what they are doing that makes sense of course 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.200
 If you feel passion for something, you will strive to be the best that is why 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.199
 please tell us more about what to look for in the facilities 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:15.249
 well when I go to the booths for a creator's dogs, check if they are 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:16.060
 Very clean 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.770
 And not only do you smell smells, check if they are clean if they are very organized 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.420
 and the hugs you will feel and treat the dogs well and take good care of something else 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.960
 What I like to find out is if they have a good database or record of 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.550
 dogs you know the reason your history your background 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.410
 because those things are very important if they have a police record or something 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.029
 A) Yes 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.079
 I guess it's the safest way to know your puppy's inase 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:43.590
 that's the way it is, we always look for something 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.950
 if you are looking for working dogs dogs that have done the work before if you are looking 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.920
 confirmation if you want to exhibit it you should also look for that kind of thing 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.980
 Once I went through the hatchery and I liked what I saw it had 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.420
 ask the creator 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.240
 I suppose my first question is always when you have a terror speak 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.130
 like why he chose to raise Great Dane dogs in the first place or because he wants 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.890
 raise golden bridge investors an obvious question if you understand that they feel 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.899
 for the dog which would be an example of correct answer 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:15.459
 any answer they speak as tenth of the dedication and love for 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.610
 the race the creator 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.970
 if you want to see someone who really believe what they are doing and know that 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.429
 you deal with a reliable professional 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:26.359
 and could be it is an example of a bad reason to become a creator 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:31.449
 good your senses will tell you if the creator only does it for money or if 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:36.229
 does it for mercenary reasons to say it in some way because if so and they go 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:37.819
 to take shortcuts 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.090
 google I hear that that's not the cars 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.179
 they have a business but they must do it for the love of the race 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:44.890
 Well sure look for that 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.569
 I should ask about the puppy's health 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.249
 Nowadays any dog ​​can have small physical defects explained 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:53.540
 this puppy you buy from a creator 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.969
 must have received two groups of vaccines and be dewormed two groups 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:00.499
 of cattle and dewormed understood madrid 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:02.559
 what yes 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:07.029
 and again I prefer to have puppies that have between seven and a half weeks and 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:10.709
 eight weeks of age eight weeks or more because 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.890
 because they had time to be with their brothers with their mother 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.700
 this one could correct them a bit but also more than that by the 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.220
 socialization the creator will also have started with the idea of 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.400
 socialization towards the eighth week or should have done it or what is yours 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.490
 envying something 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.509
 yes the parents of the puppy 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.729
 do not mention it enough for the simple reason that the dog will be like 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.400
 if a creator has nothing to hide he should be proud of 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.099
 show that to the parents and care if you can not show the parents or 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.340
 parents' health certificates it makes sense to increase 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.810
 father healthy healthy puppies so it is in general 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.860
 can show you the female because the mother should be there 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.880
 but sometimes the father is miles away, you know he was only 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:55.849
 while the fun lasted, ask him creator about the personality of the 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.770
 parents if you can see them you can judge for yourself but the parents if you have 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.909
 some idea about their histories their personalities their characteristics and if 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.759
 present any type of aggressiveness I would think twice before 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.259
 Take me your puppy

 a pleasure
