00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
completely covers or this thing will

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.210

tiny bit of olive oil on top and that's
going<00:05:31.500> to<00:05:31.560> keep

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
going to keep

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.700 
going to keep
the<00:05:33.010> oxygen<00:05:33.670> out<00:05:33.850> oxygen<00:05:34.480> is<00:05:34.810> not<00:05:35.170> our<00:05:35.470> friend

the oxygen out oxygen is not our friend

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.780 
the oxygen out oxygen is not our friend
when<00:05:36.250> it<00:05:36.370> comes<00:05:36.610> to<00:05:36.940> sauerkraut<00:05:37.600> so<00:05:38.080> this<00:05:38.320> just

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
when it comes to sauerkraut so this just

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.140 
when it comes to sauerkraut so this just

and keeps keeps it all safe and from
molding<00:05:47.980> okay<00:05:48.610> so<00:05:49.360> every<00:05:50.230> day<00:05:50.380> I'm<00:05:50.500> going<00:05:50.650> to

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
molding okay so every day I'm going to

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.650 
molding okay so every day I'm going to
need<00:05:50.920> to<00:05:51.040> make<00:05:51.160> sure<00:05:51.220> to<00:05:51.490> off-gas<00:05:51.970> this<00:05:52.330> all

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
need to make sure to off-gas this all

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.220 
need to make sure to off-gas this all
that<00:05:53.320> means<00:05:53.590> is<00:05:53.830> simply<00:05:54.270> open<00:05:55.270> it<00:05:55.420> up<00:05:55.570> let<00:05:56.080> the

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
that means is simply open it up let the

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.920 
that means is simply open it up let the
air<00:05:56.410> out<00:05:56.440> and<00:05:57.180> in<00:05:58.180> the<00:05:58.270> meantime<00:05:58.300> I'm<00:05:58.750> going<00:05:58.870> to

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
air out and in the meantime I'm going to

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.930 
air out and in the meantime I'm going to
keep<00:05:59.020> it<00:05:59.350> on<00:05:59.410> my<00:05:59.590> countertop<00:06:00.010> so<00:06:00.400> I<00:06:00.430> can<00:06:00.670> watch

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
keep it on my countertop so I can watch

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.900 
keep it on my countertop so I can watch
it<00:06:01.270> and<00:06:01.480> make<00:06:02.320> sure<00:06:02.470> the<00:06:02.590> brine<00:06:02.830> level<00:06:03.580> doesn't

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
it and make sure the brine level doesn't

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.970 
it and make sure the brine level doesn't
go<00:06:04.030> too<00:06:04.090> low<00:06:04.450> and<00:06:04.750> I'll<00:06:05.200> put<00:06:05.380> it<00:06:05.500> in<00:06:05.590> a<00:06:05.740> bowl

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:05.980 
go too low and I'll put it in a bowl

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.460 
go too low and I'll put it in a bowl
because<00:06:06.220> once<00:06:07.000> it<00:06:07.120> starts<00:06:07.540> really<00:06:07.900> going<00:06:08.260> it's

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
because once it starts really going it's

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:15.110 
because once it starts really going it's
going<00:06:08.740> to<00:06:08.830> bubble<00:06:09.040> over<00:06:09.400> and<00:06:09.820> make<00:06:10.120> a<00:06:10.150> mess

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120
