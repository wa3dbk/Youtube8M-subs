00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 So I show you today what I mean 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.000
 hair wash steep thesis like mine 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.830
 hair after washing steep my 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.019
 first hartmut ihne knows her craving 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.280
 the video was something very long this 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.990
 Routine was a bit long because of that 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.730
 shorter okay so I have it 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.800
 first a deep short to 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.300
 I have my hair for that 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.640
 first cleaned by the whole 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.619
 Deposits of living conditions and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.050
 all possible that I so currently 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.550
 with it and instead of having a shampoo 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.160
 I then apple cider vinegar and that cleans 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.899
 Apple vinegar hair and scalp 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.570
 quite naturally from these deposits 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.890
 and it's good for the hair roots all the way 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.230
 So to massage a I s easy 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.760
 like a shampoo sometimes applied for 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.020
 not all of it with water and 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.390
 leave to act for a short time 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.460
 for all for the apple cider maybe 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.770
 I would have their too severe smell 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.579
 black tea recommend the one animal 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.739
 I'm fine, too 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.930
 or not your silicone freis 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.500
 Just shampoo such a mild shampoo 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.059
 with some salt more salt for example ever 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.220
 after seeing the apple it's the apple 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.560
 then I played one out 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.640
 I just made a deep impression 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.860
 this the pavement of 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.480
 in the year everything goes well 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.270
 distributed and then with the head against it 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.430
 came all over again nicely combed 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.440
 okay so the hq is now played out 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.990
 I used to run in style 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.880
 conditioner this is the mother of 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.670
 canton and he is without silicone without 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.560
 parabens and so on cables to 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.540
 seal it off and caress that 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.910
 it with a topical oil and yoga is for 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.640
 the hairline and the tips quite well 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.020
 begin with dry hand are 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.310
 not too wet with it the hair too 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.310
 do not take too long to meet 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.830
 So there are two possibilities either 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.340
 I let my hair dry and air 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.130
 Sometimes it takes almost the whole time 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:41.139
 dry and dry in these evenings 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:44.530
 then i will not take my hair 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:46.000
 sleep the samples on the head and on 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.789
 My hair will be next morning 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.080
 only a bit more beautiful shaped that 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.729
 means they have more volume and are 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.969
 stretched out a bit stretch 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:05:00.229
 through this then so we want or have 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:02.360
 I would have to faster my hair 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:06.610
 first a little and then 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:10.900
 interest air spaces yes and I feel 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.900
 middle level and pick up later 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.290
 So the whole I leave now first 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:39.270
 air dry and show you later 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:40.500
 otherwise class out of about 25 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.080
 hours later my hair is now 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.640
 almost completely dried I have the 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.050
 a week high can just always be 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.380
 just refresh and at the end of the week 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.480
 So I'll do it if you ask 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.850
 for example, what products i have on 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.250
 dearest use then looks best 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.320
 Also the description is not sentences link 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.250
 this is from my previous video tips 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.960

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:06.990
