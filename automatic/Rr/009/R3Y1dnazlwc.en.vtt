00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello people welcome example 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.690
 with me I have something again today 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.550
 something similar for violet fans 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.340
 I already imagined that is 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.320
 namely violetta's diary but this 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.789
 Diary is a very special one 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.619
 we'll see right away that is 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.570
 a diary can be found on the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.500
 press diamonds and then that starts 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.320
 to shine 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.550
 the only violet diary with colorful 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.239
 lights very exciting, it is 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.040
 Depressed and I'll be easy now 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.380
 times open and is looking us 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.750
 a little closer 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.460
 I 've got the book and it 's homemade 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.829
 seems to be just a normal book 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.140
 So its a biscuit book here in front of you 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.710
 first page is very colorful with 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.250
 different symbols with violet and 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.899
 your friends and here on every page 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.649
 is also such a nice pattern 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.420
 below 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.420
 with little hearts with butterflies 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:09.530
 but what stands out from the side of this 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.780
 Title These titles are here 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.080
 especially thick behind us all 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.660
 normal as a book the 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.880
 front is very deep and especially 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.310
 that's because there's a lot behind it 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.910
 hiding technology I press on the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.910
 diamonds 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.920
 violet top shines violet 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.080
 animal his lights up the chain 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.630
 and up here the headphones and that 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.270
 Cable from the headphones everything in the shining 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.640
 colors that we recognize each other correctly 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.430
 the cable of the headphones can light up 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:51.140
 blue headphones also pink the chain 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.690
 and the top part are little white ones 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.770
 candles dots 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.789
 which does not matter if it's up again too 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.110
 blinking I think I have to look again 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.299
 exactly when I press it again 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.780
 then it stops flashing again 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:09.950
 So it can turn it on and off 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:13.010
 it blinks properly then it grows 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:18.560
 lights all so a real of 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:21.549
 The sun is shining in the dark 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.549
 very good 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.440
 now there is no player 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.740
 I thought I would have with other 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.690
 pressure off it's all by itself 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.250
 went out 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.010
 I think that's really cool because 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.720
 you can not see it that way 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.130
 small light elements are that is 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.200
 here relatively smooth when talking about it 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.410
 leads you do not feel so very little 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.940
 where this really small and here 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.180
 The diamond are also completely normal 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.770
 does not look at pick button 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.770
 but it looks like a normal one 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.620
 diary and also from the inside that falls 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.150
 which is not only on this is one 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.650
 Small fold is there you can 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.760
 replace the battery if it is 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.940
 someday no longer lights and tada 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.370
 it lights up again 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.140
 She likes a very interesting diary 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.610
 I think 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.630
 if you like it then write it in 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.880

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.530
 write me something you think if 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.930
 we find that good with the lighting effects 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.790
 or if said oh that's the must have 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.160
 Not be 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.140

 Collect all sorts if you 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.520

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:58.160

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.000
 so just take a look at age groups 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.770
