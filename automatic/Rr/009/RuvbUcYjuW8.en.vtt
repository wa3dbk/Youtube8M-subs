00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.660 
clean it out and then you know work on
the<00:02:02.549> health<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.030> skin<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.510> that

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
the health of the skin is that

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.249 
the health of the skin is that
after<00:02:04.030> effect<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.159> don't<00:02:06.900> choose<00:02:07.900> to<00:02:08.140> do

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
after effect but I don't choose to do

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.350 
after effect but I don't choose to do
that<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.619> think<00:02:08.890> it's<00:02:09.099> it's<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.179> better

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
that I think it's it's a better

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.540 
that I think it's it's a better
procedure<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.230> easier<00:02:11.680> for<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:11.980> client<00:02:12.370> if

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
procedure and easier for the client if

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.449 
procedure and easier for the client if
and<00:02:13.330> depending<00:02:13.870> on<00:02:13.989> what<00:02:14.170> they<00:02:14.349> need<00:02:14.650> if<00:02:14.950> they

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
and depending on what they need if they

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.490 
and depending on what they need if they
have<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.670> lot<00:02:15.790> of<00:02:15.970> blockage<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.840> they<00:02:17.290> have

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
have a lot of blockage and they have

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.309 
have a lot of blockage and they have
some<00:02:17.800> problematic<00:02:18.340> skin<00:02:18.730> issues<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.780> think

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
some problematic skin issues I think

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.949 
some problematic skin issues I think
it's<00:02:20.470> better<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:21.180> gradually<00:02:22.180> work<00:02:22.540> on<00:02:22.720> that

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
it's better to gradually work on that

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.380 
it's better to gradually work on that
you<00:02:23.500> can<00:02:23.680> do<00:02:23.830> that<00:02:24.010> with<00:02:24.220> facials<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:25.030> can<00:02:25.209> use

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
you can do that with facials you can use

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.050 
you can do that with facials you can use
micro<00:02:25.840> dermabrasion<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:27.069> can<00:02:27.340> use<00:02:27.520> product

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
micro dermabrasion you can use product

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.449 
micro dermabrasion you can use product
and<00:02:28.390> because<00:02:29.260> we<00:02:29.410> have<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:29.769> many<00:02:29.920> things<00:02:30.280> at

our fingertips now so many different

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.280 
our fingertips now so many different
procedures<00:02:33.519> to<00:02:33.700> use<00:02:33.880> there<00:02:34.599> isn't<00:02:34.840> any<00:02:35.019> reason

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
procedures to use there isn't any reason

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.160 
procedures to use there isn't any reason
why<00:02:36.130> somebody<00:02:36.880> needs<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.360> come<00:02:37.569> in<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:37.989> then
