00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:05.210
 nobody believes us that way 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:16.580
 a small club in the afternoon his 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:19.460
 Penalty does not wrap up 2012 in humans 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.880
 the hope needs bright spots on 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.880
 trip 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.760
 the best place in the middle of you 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.680
 so nice in the middle and also have one 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.160
 bit for you was wanted was 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.450
 yes third advent 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.730
 I still see a few walls of land 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.260
 have even so small shell 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.170
 was not important to me yet how are you 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.910
 no rivers any more 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.530
 there's something on the outside I think so 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.420
 we can remember today 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.160
 a little cozy round here and 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.780
 I think that is still one 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.410
 can be a little warmer what means 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.410
 its heft one goes sometimes 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.900
 you are actually right in the middle of it 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.340
 Your tour played exactly this evening 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.350
 or here in MÃ¼nster another concert yes 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.270
 super cool that we somehow for ourselves 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.610
 Double layer pushes that would be perfect 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.840
 why do you support bright lights 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.220
 why are you saying we have to join in? 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.210
 we are tonight actually already 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.760
 are fully booked 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.840
 So we support ourselves since 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.780
 a few years our own 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.770
 benefit action fans help and we know 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.900
 what it all belongs to 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.460
 that's all in the people that's the most 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.840
 also volunteer then volunteer 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.230
 do and organize and get it 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.850
 To take care of 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.020
 and something like that on his legs 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.250
 we really can already ask 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.020
 quite cool and therefore said 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.040
 human when he is around the corner and I 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.040
 play but then you come up 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.690
 do not do it together as you can 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.690
 you can me 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.690
 because 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.650
 you have to 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.180
 we knew 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.110
 thailand and 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.110
 slim 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.050
 neither out of you 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.060
 more 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.350
 we're just playing a bit unplugged 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.370
 So little bit quieter 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.140
 dignified for the third volume 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.550
 actually ideal is so with 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.860
 Contemplation may still come 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.340
 Chocolate Santa Claus in the room and pulls 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.340
 from 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.620
 but I go 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.620
 by the none 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.860
 I 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.280
 Thank you 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.280
 win 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.500
 and I know 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.430
 under coach 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.430
 H 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.130
 Thanks so much music is now 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.480
 relatively her charity made herself so 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.980
 charity belongs almost a bit 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.380
 together what do you think why as well 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.150
 that fits together so that's what it does 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.310
 Nice is that music is one 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.750
 Language is the one that connects a great deal 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.720
 and I always find when you are 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.700
 So something positive can take advantage 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.340
 then you should do that and music 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.880
 brings together many people and 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.430
 It can also be a bit 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.840
 I find communication and that is then 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.150
 that also perfectly legitimate that too 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.070
 somehow so to use a bit and 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.690
 I believe or hope that at least 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.490
 Club is getting busy today and then 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.410
 let's neat the bush 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.090
 go around and then they are hopefully 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.090
 At the end of the day also nice and full 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.450
 warned 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.730
 I wish you much fun now 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.500
 and then I hope that quite a lot 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.580
 donate together we have that too 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.580
 every case the same 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.530
 Euro 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.250
 very beautiful 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.100
 for all 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.100
 that's a really cool thing
