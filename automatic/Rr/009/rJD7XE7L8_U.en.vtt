material like this I asked him if I
could<00:01:44.119> do<00:01:44.330> a<00:01:44.360> video<00:01:44.570> analysis<00:01:45.170> of<00:01:45.380> this<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:45.890> he

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
could do a video analysis of this and he

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.600 
could do a video analysis of this and he
very<00:01:46.520> quickly<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:47.479> fizzy<00:01:47.960> a<00:01:47.990> sickly<00:01:48.610> replied

go go go so with that being said I want
to<00:01:53.869> show<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:54.440> some<00:01:54.680> of<00:01:54.740> my<00:01:54.860> video<00:01:55.130> analysis

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
to show you some of my video analysis

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.010 
to show you some of my video analysis
everything<00:01:56.030> that<00:01:56.060> I<00:01:56.210> do<00:01:56.270> is<00:01:56.690> going<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.899> be<00:01:56.960> at

everything that I do is going to be at

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.450 
everything that I do is going to be at
the<00:01:57.110> bottom<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.530> screen<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:58.070> I'll<00:01:58.250> kind

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
the bottom of the screen and I'll kind

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.990 
the bottom of the screen and I'll kind
of<00:01:58.520> talk<00:01:58.729> a<00:01:58.759> long<00:01:58.970> as<00:01:59.149> we<00:01:59.240> go<00:02:00.310> can<00:02:01.310> report<00:02:01.880> this

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
of talk a long as we go can report this

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.100 
of talk a long as we go can report this
object<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.630> be<00:02:02.840> burnt<00:02:03.500> orange<00:02:04.039> in<00:02:04.310> color<00:02:04.580> and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
object to be burnt orange in color and

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.249 
object to be burnt orange in color and
he<00:02:06.110> also<00:02:06.409> believed<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.159> primary<00:02:07.640> object<00:02:08.259> was

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
he also believed the primary object was

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.880 
he also believed the primary object was
acting<00:02:10.220> as<00:02:10.399> some<00:02:10.670> type<00:02:10.910> of<00:02:10.940> portal<00:02:11.600> so<00:02:12.590> let's

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
acting as some type of portal so let's

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.300 
acting as some type of portal so let's
switch<00:02:13.069> you<00:02:13.190> folks<00:02:13.400> think<00:02:14.950> obviously<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
switch you folks think obviously the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.870 
switch you folks think obviously the
brightness<00:02:16.640> has<00:02:16.760> been<00:02:16.910> altered<00:02:17.060> here<00:02:18.880> the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
brightness has been altered here the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.020 
brightness has been altered here the
night<00:02:20.030> ranger<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.840> not<00:02:21.049> output<00:02:21.530> at<00:02:21.709> a<00:02:21.739> huge

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.840 

screen<00:02:26.030> size<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:28.010> Ken's<00:02:28.519> original<00:02:28.910> video<00:02:29.180> is

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
screen size so Ken's original video is

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:38.319 
screen size so Ken's original video is
presented<00:02:31.850> it<00:02:32.150> 240<00:02:34.060> pixels<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:38.180> of

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
presented it 240 pixels and this of

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.390 
presented it 240 pixels and this of
course<00:02:38.360> is<00:02:38.660> zoomed<00:02:38.959> in<00:02:39.110> slowed<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.920> the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
course is zoomed in slowed of the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.890 
course is zoomed in slowed of the
initial<00:02:40.880> filming<00:02:41.209> of<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.329> primary<00:02:41.750> object

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
initial filming of the primary object

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.860 
initial filming of the primary object
the<00:02:42.260> entire<00:02:42.560> sighting<00:02:43.130> can<00:02:43.720> reports<00:02:44.720> was

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
the entire sighting can reports was

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.340 
the entire sighting can reports was
about<00:02:45.109> 15<00:02:45.530> minutes<00:02:46.299> so<00:02:49.630> very<00:02:50.630> odd<00:02:50.780> behavior

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
about 15 minutes so very odd behavior

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.509 
about 15 minutes so very odd behavior
there<00:02:51.560> it's<00:02:51.829> going<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.070> get<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:52.220> little<00:02:52.310> bit

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
there it's going to get a little bit

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.050 
there it's going to get a little bit
weirder<00:02:52.850> though

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.080 

and<00:02:58.630> there<00:02:58.780> were<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.930> variety<00:02:59.800> of<00:03:00.220> secondary

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
and there were a variety of secondary

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.839 
and there were a variety of secondary
objects<00:03:01.630> that<00:03:02.080> either<00:03:02.380> came<00:03:02.890> from<00:03:03.220> primary

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
objects that either came from primary

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:15.520 
objects that either came from primary
object<00:03:04.170> or<00:03:05.170> just<00:03:05.410> appeared<00:03:05.770> on<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:05.950> scene

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.150 

this<00:03:16.190> is<00:03:17.260> what<00:03:18.260> appears<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.709> be<00:03:18.800> some<00:03:18.950> type<00:03:18.980> of

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
this is what appears to be some type of

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.490 
this is what appears to be some type of
morphing<00:03:19.970> going<00:03:20.690> on<00:03:20.810> between<00:03:21.050> the<00:03:21.290> primary

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
morphing going on between the primary

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.680 
morphing going on between the primary
object<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.970> we're<00:03:23.180> going<00:03:23.300> to<00:03:23.330> go<00:03:23.480> ahead<00:03:23.569> and

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
object and we're going to go ahead and

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.070 
object and we're going to go ahead and
look<00:03:23.870> at<00:03:24.020> it<00:03:24.140> again<00:03:24.260> but<00:03:25.390> I've<00:03:26.390> altered<00:03:26.690> it<00:03:27.020> a

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
look at it again but I've altered it a

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.270 
look at it again but I've altered it a
little<00:03:27.200> bit<00:03:27.380> differently<00:03:27.770> you<00:03:28.010> can<00:03:28.160> almost

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
little bit differently you can almost

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.970 
little bit differently you can almost
detect<00:03:28.850> a<00:03:29.560> depth<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:30.860> contour<00:03:31.340> as<00:03:31.580> this<00:03:31.910> thing

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
detect a depth and contour as this thing

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.680 
detect a depth and contour as this thing
pulses<00:03:33.980> and<00:03:34.220> change<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.030> shape<00:03:37.690> and

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
pulses and change the shape and

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:51.600 
pulses and change the shape and
eventually<00:03:39.410> disappears

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.140 

I<00:03:51.670> think<00:03:52.480> this<00:03:52.780> object<00:03:53.650> is<00:03:53.830> emitting<00:03:54.370> or

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
I think this object is emitting or

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.960 
I think this object is emitting or
demonstrating<00:03:55.900> rather<00:03:56.110> a<00:03:56.970> biological

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
demonstrating rather a biological
