 they take the curve to the right 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.140
 Entering the avenue of our lady 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.490
 the juve must have a couple of motorcycles that 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.440
 they are going to stumble but it will not have 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.400
 no consequence in the race there 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.240
 you see they are going to get up 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.240
 very fast
