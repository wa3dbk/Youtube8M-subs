or<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> bad<00:00:18.480> glow<00:00:18.750> plug<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.460> she's<00:00:20.460> probably

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
or a bad glow plug so she's probably

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:36.340

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.709 
help it start in the winter now will be
the<00:00:59.649> glow<00:00:59.829> plugs<00:01:00.129> so<00:01:00.789> I'd<00:01:00.940> imagine<00:01:01.089> number

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
the glow plugs so I'd imagine number

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.029 
the glow plugs so I'd imagine number
seven<00:01:02.050> cylinders<00:01:02.379> having<00:01:02.769> a<00:01:02.829> rough<00:01:03.010> time

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
seven cylinders having a rough time

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.710 
seven cylinders having a rough time
right<00:01:03.250> now<00:01:03.460> considering<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.269> glow<00:01:04.479> plug

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
right now considering that glow plug

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.889 
right now considering that glow plug
isn't<00:01:04.899> working<00:01:09.090> there's<00:01:10.090> a<00:01:10.180> fair<00:01:10.479> amount<00:01:10.509> of

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
isn't working there's a fair amount of

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:17.750 
isn't working there's a fair amount of
smoke<00:01:11.229> coming<00:01:11.500> too

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.590 

Oh<00:01:18.440> God

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.660 

it's<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:22.140> idle<00:01:22.440> smooth<00:01:22.710> Hut<00:01:23.010> I'll<00:01:23.190> kick<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.550> in

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
it's the idle smooth Hut I'll kick it in

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:34.810 
it's the idle smooth Hut I'll kick it in
the<00:01:24.440> here

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.090 

a<00:01:35.110> minute<00:01:36.110> let's<00:01:36.260> move<00:01:36.560> out<00:01:36.680> a<00:01:36.710> little<00:01:36.890> bit

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
a minute let's move out a little bit

00:01:37.100 --> 00:02:21.320 
a minute let's move out a little bit
more<00:01:37.310> which<00:01:37.580> it's<00:01:37.790> getting<00:01:38.360> better<00:01:38.659> now

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.540 

there<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.050> have<00:02:22.200> it

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.310 

she<00:02:24.970> definitely<00:02:25.180> doesn't<00:02:25.540> like<00:02:25.780> being<00:02:26.050> not

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
she definitely doesn't like being not

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.860 
she definitely doesn't like being not
plugged<00:02:26.650> in
