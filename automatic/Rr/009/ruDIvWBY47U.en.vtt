it's pretty cool

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.639 
it's pretty cool
it<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.850> installs<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.360> your<00:00:42.510> GTA<00:00:42.809> 5<00:00:43.050> directory

and<00:00:43.920> yeah<00:00:44.789> alright<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.270> basically<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:46.079> use

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
and yeah alright so basically you use

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.540 
and yeah alright so basically you use
the<00:00:46.410> same<00:00:46.620> controls<00:00:47.039> as<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.250> would<00:00:47.370> with<00:00:47.520> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the same controls as it would with a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.190 
the same controls as it would with a
native<00:00:47.940> trainer<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.450> it's<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.780> numpad<00:00:48.989> keys

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
native trainer so it's the numpad keys

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.410 
native trainer so it's the numpad keys
I'm<00:00:49.649> not<00:00:49.800> sure<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> keys<00:00:50.520> will<00:00:50.730> be<00:00:50.820> mapped

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
I'm not sure if the keys will be mapped

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.000 
I'm not sure if the keys will be mapped
to<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> other<00:00:51.899> one<00:00:52.110> people<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.590> don't<00:00:52.920> have

know<00:04:34.830> help<00:04:35.640> as<00:04:35.850> well<00:04:36.030> but<00:04:36.270> they<00:04:36.390> just<00:04:36.600> stand

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
know help as well but they just stand

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.250 
know help as well but they just stand
around<00:04:36.990> most<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.710> time<00:04:37.770> in<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:39.630> that's<00:04:39.840> it
