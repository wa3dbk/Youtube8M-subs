 menezes and today I want to talk about a 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.039
 interesting topic some tricks for 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.020
 improve or alleviate injuries that good 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.150
 they appear then of the training 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.859
 just a bad execution in a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.640
 certain moment of overload 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.030
 type injuries due to muscle overload 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.219
 or tendinitis and even tendinosis very 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.780
 usual for example those of the elbow of 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.230
 tennis player 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.079
 or inflammation of the biceps tendon or 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.789
 well in the supraspinatus determined 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.070
 injuries all injuries that 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.950
 imply a certain inflammation of 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.079
 tissues as you know is very 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.180
 important the application of ice the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.250
 application in this case more than 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.650
 cold ice and there are 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.580
 in recent years, because infinity of 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:06.640
 models of chemical things like this that 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.900
 an angel appears in the image 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.660
 put in the freezer 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.970
 and it seems very cold and is moldable 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.130
 good that it has to make malleable 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.100
 It can be adjusted in any 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.370
 articulation and even with a velcro 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.310
 we can carry it subject do not get 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:29.270
 more than 10 minutes in a chemical bag and 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.450
 3 or 4 times a day to reduce pain 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.500
 and inflammations and so on this would be one 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.960
 of the methods well known in the 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.750
 only let's say limitation that this has 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.950
 method is that it does not really allow us 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.250
 do a deep massage 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.280
 to help speed up recovery 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.429
 then there is a very simple trick 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 that you can follow and it is simply with 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.469
 We fill a plastic cup with water 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.649
 in this case this is empty we go to 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:05.520
 sink we fill 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.100
 and we put it in the freezer 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.319
 okay 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.840
 right now this glass has water 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.290
 frozen inside then what we have 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.209
 what to do is simply cut the 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.430
 glass here is worth and will stay a 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:29.569
 part of the ice poking we take a cloth 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.120
 because being cold has already come out and what 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.870
 we have to be cold because it's going to 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.730
 cool your hand very much and with the tip 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.120
 let's apply what is called a kid 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.550
 massage a massage with a cold when having 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.069
 a rounded tip we will be able to 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.900
 apply pressure on this base that is 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.870
 wide enough to 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.860
 take it by hand and we will apply 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.730
 pressure and we do a circular massage 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.640
 about the pain area 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.830
 with applying some force in the 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.170
 clockwise this is 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.500
 called the baby massage practically until 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.650
 that we spend the ice with a wipe and 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.269
 we apply it you will see that it relieves a lot 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.870
 any type of injury that involves 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:19.230
 Tendinous inflammation or any type 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.450
 of muscle pain even for 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.400
 apply it in 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.950
 in the area of ​​the trapeze that is usually 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.360
 contracture with cold massages after 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.569
 we can apply a little heat to 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.630
 relax and take circulation 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.690
 again to the area 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.300
 I guarantee that it will relieve you and in 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.870
 many cases recover injuries that 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.250
 they are certainly somewhat chronic 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.870
