for the two bundles of 14 inches and

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
that was basically it so but so far I

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.219 
that was basically it so but so far I
love<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.580> hair<00:05:02.789> i<00:05:02.820> love<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.240> weight<00:05:03.419> feel<00:05:03.780> um

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.439 
love the hair i love the weight feel um
i<00:05:04.830> think<00:05:04.949> with<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.490> curling<00:05:06.030> when<00:05:06.180> i<00:05:06.210> try<00:05:06.419> to

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
i think with the curling when i try to

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.490 
i think with the curling when i try to
curl<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:06.870> hair<00:05:07.760> it<00:05:08.760> takes<00:05:09.210> a<00:05:09.300> little<00:05:09.810> longer<00:05:10.050> I

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
curl the hair it takes a little longer I

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.100 
curl the hair it takes a little longer I
think<00:05:10.530> but<00:05:11.520> not<00:05:11.729> that<00:05:11.940> long<00:05:12.210> or<00:05:12.570> whatever<00:05:12.900> but

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
think but not that long or whatever but

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.330 
think but not that long or whatever but
to<00:05:13.260> me<00:05:13.410> it<00:05:13.500> just<00:05:13.530> takes<00:05:13.800> a<00:05:13.919> minute<00:05:13.949> for<00:05:14.190> the

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
to me it just takes a minute for the

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.029 
to me it just takes a minute for the
curl<00:05:14.669> and<00:05:14.850> it's<00:05:15.030> not<00:05:15.210> really<00:05:15.510> like<00:05:15.539> a<00:05:16.039> tomato

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
curl and it's not really like a tomato

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.310 
curl and it's not really like a tomato
really<00:05:17.400> give<00:05:17.520> a<00:05:17.550> good<00:05:17.639> curl<00:05:18.090> or<00:05:18.389> whatever<00:05:18.960> so<00:05:19.289> I

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
really give a good curl or whatever so I

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.260 
really give a good curl or whatever so I
think<00:05:19.560> that's<00:05:19.889> one<00:05:20.220> of<00:05:20.250> the<00:05:20.430> downfalls<00:05:20.699> of<00:05:21.150> the

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
think that's one of the downfalls of the

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.790 
think that's one of the downfalls of the
hair<00:05:21.449> I<00:05:21.479> just<00:05:21.810> don't<00:05:21.960> think<00:05:22.080> it<00:05:22.199> curled<00:05:22.560> that

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
hair I just don't think it curled that

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.150 
hair I just don't think it curled that
well<00:05:23.070> to<00:05:23.370> me<00:05:23.580> but<00:05:24.270> it<00:05:25.229> does<00:05:25.470> Colonel<00:05:25.800> but<00:05:26.039> it's

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
well to me but it does Colonel but it's

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.000 
well to me but it does Colonel but it's
more<00:05:26.340> like<00:05:26.550> a<00:05:26.580> light<00:05:26.940> tahsil<00:05:27.570> tousled<00:05:28.380> curl<00:05:28.680> to

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
more like a light tahsil tousled curl to

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.930 
more like a light tahsil tousled curl to
me<00:05:29.160> and<00:05:29.970> that's<00:05:30.180> it<00:05:30.450> but<00:05:31.200> uh<00:05:31.580> that's<00:05:32.580> basically

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
me and that's it but uh that's basically

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:39.940
