00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
do the moves never think like it's like

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.050 
do the moves never think like it's like
how<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.890> street<00:02:19.280> fire<00:02:19.490> moves<00:02:19.730> would<00:02:19.820> be<00:02:19.910> that

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
how the street fire moves would be that

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.910 
how the street fire moves would be that
simple<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.780> come<00:02:20.959> out<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.230> everything<00:02:21.620> once

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
simple to come out and everything once

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.949 
simple to come out and everything once
you're<00:02:22.040> not<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.340> little<00:02:22.640> direction<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.720> do<00:02:23.840> it

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
you're not a little direction and do it

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.110 
you're not a little direction and do it
I<00:02:24.200> think<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.770> moves<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.430> moves<00:02:25.640> are<00:02:25.790> kind<00:02:26.000> of

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
I think the moves the moves are kind of

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.140 
I think the moves the moves are kind of
easy<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.570> do<00:02:26.690> is<00:02:26.810> all<00:02:27.020> I<00:02:27.320> think<00:02:28.070> that<00:02:28.520> when

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
easy to do is all I think that when

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.210 
easy to do is all I think that when
you're<00:02:29.270> playing<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.630> game<00:02:29.810> obviously<00:02:30.220> some

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
you're playing a game obviously some

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.610 
you're playing a game obviously some

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
people acting are nice too easy but if

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.699 
people acting are nice too easy but if
if<00:02:34.070> it's<00:02:34.310> easy<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.760> get<00:02:34.940> into<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:36.260> enjoy<00:02:36.590> it

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
if it's easy to get into you enjoy it

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.370 
if it's easy to get into you enjoy it

something else I've never seen before
one<00:03:50.780> of<00:03:50.810> these<00:03:50.959> games<00:03:51.200> is<00:03:51.440> as<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:51.769> mentioned

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
one of these games is as you mentioned

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.880 
one of these games is as you mentioned
earlier<00:03:52.459> that<00:03:52.489> the

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
earlier that the

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.320 
earlier that the
interactive<00:03:53.310> background<00:03:53.790> that's<00:03:54.000> like

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
interactive background that's like

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.300 
interactive background that's like
really<00:03:54.900> heavy<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.530> we've<00:03:55.710> seen<00:03:55.950> people

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
really heavy that we've seen people

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.800 
really heavy that we've seen people
going<00:03:56.520> through<00:03:56.580> stage<00:03:57.030> floors<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:57.630> sort

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
going through stage floors and that sort

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.590 
going through stage floors and that sort
of<00:03:57.840> thing<00:03:57.930> but<00:03:58.319> actual<00:03:58.830> items<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.850> pieces

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
of thing but actual items and pieces

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.110 
of thing but actual items and pieces
which<00:04:00.840> are<00:04:01.260> fully<00:04:01.950> interactive<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.640> mean<00:04:02.790> where

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
which are fully interactive I mean where

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.340 
which are fully interactive I mean where
did<00:04:03.209> you<00:04:03.330> come<00:04:03.420> up<00:04:03.480> with<00:04:03.690> that<00:04:03.720> sort<00:04:03.990> of<00:04:04.020> idea

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
did you come up with that sort of idea

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.230 
did you come up with that sort of idea
well<00:04:04.590> I<00:04:04.620> think<00:04:05.040> with<00:04:05.160> every<00:04:05.459> game<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:05.850> we<00:04:05.970> do

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
well I think with every game that we do

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.050 
well I think with every game that we do
we<00:04:06.720> want<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.110> introduce<00:04:07.500> something<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.459> the

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
we want to introduce something to the

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.800 
we want to introduce something to the
fighting<00:04:09.660> genre<00:04:10.580> category<00:04:11.580> that<00:04:11.910> that<00:04:12.209> wasn't

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
fighting genre category that that wasn't

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.720 
fighting genre category that that wasn't
in<00:04:13.080> any<00:04:13.230> previous<00:04:13.560> ones<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.190> that<00:04:14.310> was<00:04:14.430> that

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
in any previous ones and that was that

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.039 
in any previous ones and that was that
was<00:04:14.880> really<00:04:15.150> one<00:04:15.300> of<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.450> big<00:04:15.600> features<00:04:15.750> that

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
was really one of the big features that

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.110 
was really one of the big features that
we<00:04:16.200> added<00:04:16.560> in<00:04:16.650> this<00:04:16.799> game<00:04:17.040> and<00:04:17.310> that's<00:04:17.880> always

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
we added in this game and that's always

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.729 
we added in this game and that's always
been<00:04:18.450> something<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.350> know<00:04:19.500> we've

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
been something that you know we've

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:20.930 
been something that you know we've
always<00:04:19.919> kind<00:04:20.130> of<00:04:20.220> asked<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.519> question<00:04:20.850> you

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
always kind of asked the question you

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.810 
always kind of asked the question you
know<00:04:21.380> what<00:04:22.380> does<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.710> backgrounds<00:04:23.280> role<00:04:23.520> play

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
know what does the backgrounds role play

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.190 
know what does the backgrounds role play
it<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:24.060> normally<00:04:24.419> is<00:04:24.480> just<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.720> pretty<00:04:24.930> picture

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
it it normally is just a pretty picture

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.750 
it it normally is just a pretty picture
so<00:04:25.890> we<00:04:26.010> were<00:04:26.130> just<00:04:26.160> kind<00:04:26.370> of<00:04:26.520> saying<00:04:26.669> okay

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
so we were just kind of saying okay

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.760 
so we were just kind of saying okay

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
let's put objects out there it was just

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.310 
let's put objects out there it was just
a<00:04:28.890> natural<00:04:29.070> evolution<00:04:29.910> after<00:04:30.480> making<00:04:30.840> many

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
a natural evolution after making many
