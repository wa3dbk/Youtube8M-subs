I<00:00:00.030> think<00:00:00.210> John<00:00:00.870> was<00:00:01.020> curious<00:00:01.790> this<00:00:02.790> is<00:00:02.970> how<00:00:03.149> a

00:00:03.579 --> 00:00:03.589 
I think John was curious this is how a

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:06.680 
I think John was curious this is how a
little<00:00:04.589> option<00:00:05.460> startup<00:00:05.850> thing<00:00:06.029> works<00:00:06.210> on<00:00:06.420> the

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
little option startup thing works on the

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.220 
little option startup thing works on the
MacBook<00:00:07.020> Air<00:00:07.200> um<00:00:08.210> it's<00:00:09.210> like<00:00:09.360> Rob<00:00:09.660> remote<00:00:09.990> disc

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
MacBook Air um it's like Rob remote disc

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.539 
MacBook Air um it's like Rob remote disc
here<00:00:10.440> have<00:00:12.019> remote<00:00:13.019> install<00:00:13.440> as<00:00:13.860> ten<00:00:14.130> here<00:00:14.429> on

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
here have remote install as ten here on

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.510 
here have remote install as ten here on
the<00:00:14.790> mini<00:00:15.260> I'm<00:00:16.260> just<00:00:16.590> gonna<00:00:16.680> run<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.100> hardware

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
the mini I'm just gonna run the hardware

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.740 
the mini I'm just gonna run the hardware
test<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:17.970> figured<00:00:18.210> I'd<00:00:18.300> filmed<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.570> all

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
test and I figured I'd filmed this all

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.220 
test and I figured I'd filmed this all
for<00:00:18.960> you

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
for you

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.050 
for you
so<00:00:19.890> go<00:00:20.010> through<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.220> couple<00:00:20.369> steps<00:00:20.640> there<00:00:20.910> and

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
so go through a couple steps there and

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.720 
so go through a couple steps there and
see<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:22.010> application<00:00:23.010> install<00:00:23.310> disk<00:00:23.640> I

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
see the application install disk I

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.450 
see the application install disk I
suppose<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.119> hardware<00:00:24.420> test<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.810> it

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
suppose the hardware test on it

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.640 
suppose the hardware test on it
stack<00:00:26.460> your<00:00:26.490> utilities<00:00:27.180> um<00:00:28.609> anyway<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:30.650> hold

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
stack your utilities um anyway so I hold

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.560 
stack your utilities um anyway so I hold
down<00:00:31.769> option<00:00:32.009> when<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.369> starts<00:00:33.059> out<00:00:33.149> there<00:00:33.360> and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
down option when it starts out there and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.200 
down option when it starts out there and
it<00:00:33.660> shows<00:00:33.870> me<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:35.070> hard<00:00:35.250> drive<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:37.110> year

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
it shows me the hard drive and this year

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.520 
it shows me the hard drive and this year
click<00:00:39.210> here<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.540> doesn't<00:00:39.719> see<00:00:39.930> anything<00:00:40.140> that

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
click here it doesn't see anything that

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.000 
click here it doesn't see anything that

and<00:01:19.240> haha<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:22.180> show's<00:01:22.950> applications<00:01:23.950> install

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
and haha the show's applications install

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.380 
and haha the show's applications install
disk<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.560> I<00:01:26.610> choose<00:01:27.610> just<00:01:27.850> start<00:01:28.150> up<00:01:28.240> off<00:01:28.360> of

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
disk so I choose just start up off of

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:37.070 
disk so I choose just start up off of
that<00:01:30.270> here<00:01:31.270> that<00:01:31.420> may<00:01:31.570> be<00:01:31.630> making<00:01:32.050> sounds<00:01:32.470> now

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.050 

that's<00:01:38.080> over<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.500> air<00:01:38.619> loops<00:01:39.100> up<00:01:39.280> that<00:01:39.490> now<00:01:40.410> no

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
that's over the air loops up that now no

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.359 
that's over the air loops up that now no
this<00:01:43.060> is<00:01:43.210> changed<00:01:43.570> to<00:01:43.800> now<00:01:44.800> available<00:01:45.220> on<00:01:45.280> your
