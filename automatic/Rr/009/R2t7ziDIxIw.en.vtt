desk at our live action and what

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.069 
desk at our live action and what
happened<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.420> use<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.690> thing<00:00:51.870> called

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
happened is we use the thing called

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.939 
happened is we use the thing called
glass<00:00:52.289> epoxy

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
glass epoxy

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.850 
glass epoxy
glass<00:00:53.610> epoxy<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.300> almost<00:00:54.780> like<00:00:54.989> polyurethane

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
glass epoxy is almost like polyurethane

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.340 
glass epoxy is almost like polyurethane
it<00:00:56.460> gets<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> desk<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.090> nice<00:00:57.329> shine<00:00:57.989> really

coating well what happened is the guy
paid<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.019> build<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.379> desk<00:01:05.420> kind<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.600> messed<00:01:06.810> up

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
paid to build the desk kind of messed up

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.990 
paid to build the desk kind of messed up
on<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.979> lines<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.960> he<00:01:09.960> we<00:01:10.140> bought<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.560> bad<00:01:11.000> batch

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
on the lines of he we bought a bad batch

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.600 
on the lines of he we bought a bad batch
of<00:01:12.330> glass<00:01:12.570> epoxy<00:01:12.930> that's<00:01:13.860> what<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.189> only<00:01:14.400> can

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
of glass epoxy that's what we only can

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.749 
of glass epoxy that's what we only can
assume<00:01:14.939> because<00:01:15.299> most<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> desks<00:01:16.890> 75%<00:01:17.729> of

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
assume because most of the desks 75% of

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.969 
assume because most of the desks 75% of
the<00:01:17.850> desk<00:01:18.090> well<00:01:18.479> more<00:01:18.720> than<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.900> 90%<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
the desk well more than that 90% of the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.820 
the desk well more than that 90% of the
desk<00:01:20.189> came<00:01:20.850> out<00:01:21.000> perfect<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:22.200> little<00:01:22.530> spots

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
desk came out perfect but little spots

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.399 
desk came out perfect but little spots
of<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.100> desk<00:01:23.310> never<00:01:23.670> would<00:01:23.909> dry<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.450> since

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
of the desk never would dry and since

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.760 
of the desk never would dry and since
the<00:01:25.560> look<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:26.040> glass<00:01:27.030> epoxy<00:01:27.390> doesn't<00:01:28.020> dry<00:01:28.380> I

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
the look in glass epoxy doesn't dry I

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.469 
the look in glass epoxy doesn't dry I
said<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.189> used<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> term<00:01:29.670> dry<00:01:29.880> but<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.299> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
said I used the term dry but it's a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.640 
said I used the term dry but it's a
chemical<00:01:30.810> reaction<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.729> takes<00:01:32.970> it

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
chemical reaction and it takes it

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.219 
chemical reaction and it takes it
basically<00:01:34.650> takes<00:01:35.280> stuff<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> air<00:01:35.939> at<00:01:36.509> a

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
basically takes stuff in the air at a

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.460 
basically takes stuff in the air at a
certain<00:01:37.710> temperature<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.430> harden<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.470> if

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
certain temperature to harden it and if

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.920 
certain temperature to harden it and if
it's<00:01:40.710> not<00:01:41.369> mixed<00:01:41.820> right<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.420> hardener<00:01:42.899> and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
it's not mixed right the hardener and

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.590 
it's not mixed right the hardener and
sealants<00:01:43.560> not<00:01:43.680> mix<00:01:43.950> right<00:01:44.189> or<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.299> the
