00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.689
 of my grandmother 's city. 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.539
 and my mother was born only the guy who 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.970

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.300
 I tried to get her back here for you guys. 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.410
 mega state secret but for you 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.930
 I will tell everything 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.329
 So we're going to need milk. 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.670
 be whole or skimmed syrup 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.610

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.680
 whole or skimmed milk and condensed milk 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.750
 in addition we will still need 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.980
 popsicles and if you do not have 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.840
 As he stays there at home you can 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.000
 improvise with ice sheets and 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.340
 toothpicks and we also need to 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.660
 of something to measure the cml of 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.000
 Ingredients 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.949
 so we're not the best measure for you 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.900
 stay at meter level 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:13.470

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:16.259
