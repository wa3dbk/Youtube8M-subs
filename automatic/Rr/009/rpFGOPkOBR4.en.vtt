 Each other was of the Well in 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:44.470
 It's about before I entered elementary school , so my brother played soccer , so I 'm going to see it 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.310
 It is first grade primary school student who started doing in earnest 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:53.060
 Besides that, I want to look good with sports 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:58.400
 Swimming Toka but his brother and gold I was doing fine various things 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:05.400
 Well I have to ask me to play the piano or anything else 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:10.980
 3 older brothers at the time of the football that really disaster prevention Toka 6-year-old to a writer was the first year of elementary school 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:13.320
 Well I also wanted to do maybe myself and kick the ball alone in the nursery or something 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:18.240
 I think I was crazy and flower beds Toka hit deceased Te 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.000
 We'd keep Strip before entering Bessho year was Nakahara So have Takana' kicking Well much ball 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.150
 Hmm 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.170
 Who also Toka say Well and has been doing much devoted to soccer 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.170
 I'm not getting ripe 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.610
 Well what 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.100
 I believe if on your own So I appeal of the soccer that has continued in soccer devoted to Hokon 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.810
 Have felt 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:48.409
 It looks attractive 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:53.060
 It's more fun than anything, but if it is now it's a pro and enjoy it 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:56.600
 Have fun and enjoy buying with a supporter together Enjoy it 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.840
 There is also, but it is not such a thing to start doing 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.800
 Anyway, I am enjoying what Tteyuu writer 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.790
 Be engrossed 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.530
 What was it 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.080
 I apply it 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:14.120
 When I was so small I had to take care of myself 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.380
 Is there that I thought, for example, the concept or training 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.740
 Toka 4 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:27.860
 I was excited in my week of Asian life 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:27.860
 You have heard what not be said quite something because I think I was doing and think yourself to Kochi 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:37.360
 If it is so important quality is important to sexuality, but it is enough 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.020
 The point is to receive but how the horse feels 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:45.380
 It is very important what you think 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:48.770
 A child who is trying to do what was said in the end not to think that kind of sensibility 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:56.300
 I think I will not be able to go up 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:03:01.670
 I think even so it was a nasty guy when my great players than me who wonder if it was sore loser 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:05.370
 Or Don I was shell'm not out why that was not the Pastor to me that occur in the exercises 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.550
 When I think is losing because there was much Tteyuu want to win and is 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.090
 People were more than sorry 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.090
 What 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:20.610
 Even so, but I 'm not serious about soccer 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:23.220
 I may not be able to get my heart because I'm doing it somehow and there are also schools at that time 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.660
 There is not, but various things overlap 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:31.660
 But was that the Tteyuu'm not Yan have there in what has turned him into a great dark if 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:36.580
 When Ya doing amazing probably at that time the same because they say Naa 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:40.870
 Pula was the opponent the ball that has been rolling ball much it ordeal you may have thought me I Ya Do guy 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.990
 If you could take it would be what to say so I or through is be was a good name cunning Once now 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.180
 but 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:51.950
 But I think it was amazing because I did not want to lose 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:55.060
 I learned this now, but I felt when I was in the top team 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.690
 Sometimes the communication we had also risen back at that time 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.590
 The first talk about cooking before 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.620
 Because if do not remember do not remember I remember was heard what has changed 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.620
 Oh 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:12.270
 When I heard that, I have a sense of responsibility I entered first 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:15.730
 Was Rassha' in Kedomo I'm heard want to hear anymore the word 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:20.229
 This is a very important thing 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:23.290
 I probably saw it a while ago , what should I do to win the team ? 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:27.520
 It is the fact that I was thinking since I was sore loser small 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:31.509
 Kedomo I think the experience of the journey that you have more feel it 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:37.360
 Kedomo Well it may be quite hard to say with the sense of responsibility to the elementary school students 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:39.169
 Yeah it's yeah-it's a delusion that I hate losing it, but when I went to that caress that 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.160
 I thought 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:46.370
 That 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:48.050
 Format I have had first year - I do with I think Datte do I not been out very strongly'm not out why 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.340
 The 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:56.910
 But his own that he is a good pressure that I'll take yourself a point if we were could be the game is what 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:05:01.290
 Or tooth wonder that I think is strongly Tteyuu 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:06.840
 Hey I want to go Ehime because I want to enter the Olympic Games a member of the in but I was strong 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.900
 What Tteyuu has changed its sense of responsibility in Ehime to this I said, away went the previous rental 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.400
 Is 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:15.350
 When standing with a team 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:19.759
 Yourself to do something for myself is but it is is not a team win 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:23.479
 -2 o'clock was not that I just have to play good 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:27.350
 Let's manage by yourself playing better than winning or losing 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:30.390
 If you want to appeal to join the members of the Olympic Games 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:36.050
 Is important but what can you do for the team first 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:37.780
 Or say that he was found to Tteyuu to do something on that thought of Tteyuu 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:42.550
 So finally Oh 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:47.380
 It's something like this, but I 've been using it for a long time since I came back 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:54.660
 It will change when you come to think of what you can do for a good team 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:54.660
 It's maybe I've extended my studies , I think it 's your own star
