 Take a look at the topic a bit 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.390
 More precisely, we have an 8 inch here 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.980

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.590

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.320
 Memory options always measure around that 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.700
 we'll see around there as well 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.340
 no matter how thin it is only six 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.290
 millimeter that is significantly thinner than 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.300
 Most of the tablets out there, especially 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.570

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.590
