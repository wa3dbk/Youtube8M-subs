body<00:01:29.430> part<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.790> day<00:01:29.939> yeah<00:01:30.930> your<00:01:31.229> body's<00:01:31.380> gonna

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
body part a day yeah your body's gonna

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.530 
body part a day yeah your body's gonna
break<00:01:31.799> down<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.790> see<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> thing<00:01:33.180> about<00:01:33.210> to

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
break down so you see the thing about to

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.230 
break down so you see the thing about to
bark<00:01:33.869> asses<00:01:34.280> because<00:01:35.280> my<00:01:35.520> works<00:01:35.729> was<00:01:35.939> because

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
bark asses because my works was because

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.969 
bark asses because my works was because
protein<00:01:37.110> breakdown<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.619> elevated

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
protein breakdown this elevated

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:38.960 
protein breakdown this elevated
obviously<00:01:38.340> when<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.520> when<00:01:38.670> you're<00:01:38.790> training

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
obviously when you when you're training

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.359 
obviously when you when you're training
right<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.540> also<00:01:40.259> protein<00:01:40.740> synthesis<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
right and also protein synthesis the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.130 
right and also protein synthesis the
response<00:01:41.759> after<00:01:41.970> workout<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.570> also<00:01:42.810> elevated

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
response after workout is also elevated

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.330 
response after workout is also elevated
right<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.409> go<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.560> Jimmy<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.979> break<00:01:44.189> down

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
right you go to Jimmy you break down

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.069 
right you go to Jimmy you break down
protein<00:01:44.820> when<00:01:45.000> you're<00:01:45.119> doing<00:01:45.360> chest<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.930> back

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
protein when you're doing chest and back

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.830 
protein when you're doing chest and back
and<00:01:46.350> legs<00:01:46.530> all<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.890> one<00:01:47.009> day<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.540> your<00:01:48.540> body's

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
and legs all in one day and your body's

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.120 
and legs all in one day and your body's
ready<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.140> recover<00:01:49.439> from<00:01:49.470> everybody<00:01:49.860> has<00:01:50.009> no

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
ready to recover from everybody has no

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.319 
ready to recover from everybody has no
problem<00:01:50.369> recovering<00:01:50.820> that's<00:01:50.970> why<00:01:51.060> don't<00:01:51.210> like

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
problem recovering that's why don't like

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.580 
problem recovering that's why don't like
people<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.600> stress<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.259> trenches

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
people that stress in the trenches

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.289 
people that stress in the trenches
because<00:01:52.950> yes<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.310> possible<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.939> overtrain

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
because yes it's possible to overtrain

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.630 
because yes it's possible to overtrain
but<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:55.320> long<00:01:55.619> as<00:01:55.649> your<00:01:55.950> body<00:01:56.100> time<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.310> recover

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
but as long as your body time to recover

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.090 
but as long as your body time to recover
it<00:01:56.880> will<00:01:56.969> always<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.540> know<00:01:57.689> catch<00:01:58.649> up<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
it will always you know catch up to the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.290 
it will always you know catch up to the
demand<00:01:59.460> but<00:02:00.329> here's

doing its place the full body workout
the<00:02:11.260> very<00:02:11.620> first<00:02:11.920> thing<00:02:12.100> you<00:02:12.340> should<00:02:12.370> check<00:02:12.790> is

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
the very first thing you should check is

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.700 
the very first thing you should check is
your<00:02:13.060> nutrition<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:14.020> gotta<00:02:14.320> eat<00:02:14.530> more

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
your nutrition you gotta eat more

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.020 
your nutrition you gotta eat more
protein<00:02:14.920> guys<00:02:15.340> because<00:02:15.580> you're<00:02:15.730> breaking

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
protein guys because you're breaking

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.520 
protein guys because you're breaking
down<00:02:16.210> more<00:02:16.450> protein<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:16.990> gotta<00:02:17.140> eat<00:02:17.350> more

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
down more protein you gotta eat more

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.200 
down more protein you gotta eat more
carbs<00:02:17.920> puts<00:02:18.160> work<00:02:18.310> acquisition<00:02:18.820> you're

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
carbs puts work acquisition you're

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.940 
carbs puts work acquisition you're
depleting<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.690> lot<00:02:19.810> more<00:02:19.960> glycogen<00:02:20.320> this<00:02:20.620> place

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
depleting a lot more glycogen this place

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.220 
depleting a lot more glycogen this place
guys<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:21.910> we<00:02:22.060> met<00:02:22.240> I<00:02:22.330> was<00:02:22.600> gonna<00:02:22.780> get<00:02:22.960> small<00:02:23.200> I

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
guys so we met I was gonna get small I

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.510 
guys so we met I was gonna get small I
can't<00:02:23.350> see<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.740> like<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.920> small<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.190> might<00:02:24.340> get

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
can't see you like a small you might get

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.040 
can't see you like a small you might get
stronger<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.210> possible<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.630> get<00:02:25.780> strong

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
stronger it is possible to get strong

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.230 
stronger it is possible to get strong
enough<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.470> not<00:02:26.590> have<00:02:26.800> muscle<00:02:27.160> gains<00:02:27.310> don't

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
enough and not have muscle gains don't

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.430 
enough and not have muscle gains don't
don't<00:02:28.420> get<00:02:28.570> it<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.780> stated<00:02:29.140> there's<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.290> lot

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
don't get it to a stated there's a lot

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.110 
don't get it to a stated there's a lot
of<00:02:29.470> people<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.830> are<00:02:29.950> strongest<00:02:30.340> fuck<00:02:30.610> but<00:02:31.090> I

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
of people that are strongest fuck but I

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.970 
of people that are strongest fuck but I
look<00:02:31.270> like<00:02:31.390> they<00:02:31.540> even<00:02:31.750> live<00:02:31.900> right<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:32.920> is

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
look like they even live right so it is

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.230 
look like they even live right so it is
possible<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.400> get<00:02:33.490> stronger<00:02:33.730> your<00:02:33.880> body<00:02:34.000> might

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
possible to get stronger your body might

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.000 
possible to get stronger your body might
get<00:02:34.420> stronger<00:02:34.600> for<00:02:34.900> survival<00:02:35.380> mechanism<00:02:35.860> it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
get stronger for survival mechanism it

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.460 
get stronger for survival mechanism it
has<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.490> know<00:02:36.610> as<00:02:36.730> far<00:02:36.760> as<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.960> to<00:02:38.140> protect
