and definitely I notice the difference

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.230 
and definitely I notice the difference
between<00:02:41.620> using<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.370> not<00:02:42.550> using<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.030> and

waxy feeling and you can see just from

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.950 
waxy feeling and you can see just from
doing<00:04:48.259> that<00:04:48.410> this<00:04:49.070> is<00:04:49.280> no<00:04:49.970> back<00:04:50.240> combing<00:04:50.570> at

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
doing that this is no back combing at

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.200 
doing that this is no back combing at
all<00:04:51.410> and<00:04:51.710> it<00:04:52.280> gives<00:04:52.490> it<00:04:52.639> a<00:04:52.759> really<00:04:53.000> nice

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
all and it gives it a really nice

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.589 
all and it gives it a really nice
texture<00:04:53.780> to<00:04:53.870> work<00:04:54.169> with<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:56.180> nice<00:04:56.360> thing

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
texture to work with and the nice thing

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.360 
texture to work with and the nice thing
about<00:04:56.630> it<00:04:56.900> is<00:04:56.930> that<00:04:57.320> it's<00:04:57.470> a<00:04:57.560> powder<00:04:57.889> so<00:04:58.340> it

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
about it is that it's a powder so it

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.300 
about it is that it's a powder so it
actually<00:04:59.440> absorbs<00:05:00.440> oil<00:05:01.270> and<00:05:02.270> uh<00:05:03.160> from<00:05:04.160> your

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
actually absorbs oil and uh from your

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.670 
actually absorbs oil and uh from your
scalp<00:05:04.669> so<00:05:06.760> it<00:05:07.760> almost<00:05:08.240> gives<00:05:08.780> the<00:05:09.020> same<00:05:09.229> kind

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
scalp so it almost gives the same kind

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.529 
scalp so it almost gives the same kind
of<00:05:12.400> effect<00:05:13.400> as<00:05:13.880> if<00:05:14.030> your<00:05:14.180> hair<00:05:14.360> was<00:05:14.510> really

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
of effect as if your hair was really

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.680 
of effect as if your hair was really
dirty<00:05:15.130> because<00:05:16.130> everyone<00:05:16.639> knows<00:05:16.820> dirty<00:05:17.419> hair

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
dirty because everyone knows dirty hair

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.279
