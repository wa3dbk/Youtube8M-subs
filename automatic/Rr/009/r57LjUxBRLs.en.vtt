 do again and stuff a lot 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.219
 level 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.189
 and set the amount of gpon materials 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.189
 yet equal to one 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.900
 this material will be called glass 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.439
 make and his heroin again 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.609
 put a diffuse color absolutely

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.350
 check the reflection for free rent 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.580
 which depends on the angle of view on 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.180
 surface 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.980
 number of units and 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.980
 reduce the maximum depth by three 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.470
 and make a completely white color 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.970

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.650
 and also reduce the value from three to 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.430
 units and maximum depth 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.220
 refractive index leave 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.220
 standard 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.300
 drag the material on the glass

 go into the material and turn it 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.080
 it will be 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.580
 porcelain cup make it for example 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.580
 blue 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.270
 about date gray color

 but will not be on free hire 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.490
 she again reduce the amount 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.819
 divisions 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.819
 set the cup material 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.310
 go to parent 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.449
 material 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.929
 add another child lost 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:33.929
 call it a plate 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.499
 copy material 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:43.499
 mountain in a new slot eat it in 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.639
 expect material new title to 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.919
 he did not conflict with others ask her 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.919
 diffuse color white 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.519
 drag the material onto the plate 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.219
 reveal everything except the plate 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:08.989
 now create 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.519
 materials for 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.519
 pattern on the plate 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.739
 otherwise earlier object picture 0 1 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.919
 Log in and type the material 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.919
 form 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.569
 free cells copy material 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.569
 Kant 

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:43.339
 and white porcelain material for plate 

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:55.429
 go back to the picture material 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.469
 and copy 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:02.059
 real porcelain for the first material 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:05.059
 and edging material on 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.219
 as a mask, use in advance 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.319
 harvested card is black and white where on 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.059
 kart 

00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:18.099
 black color will be used 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.519
 the first material in this case is porcelain 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.769
 accordingly, where there is white on the map 

00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:24.129
 color will be used
