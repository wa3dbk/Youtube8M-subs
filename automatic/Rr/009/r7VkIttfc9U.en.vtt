level in TV displays from Sony we've

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.529 
level in TV displays from Sony we've
heard<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.830> LCD<00:00:20.189> we've<00:00:20.369> heard<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.640> LED<00:00:21.359> we've

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
heard of LCD we've heard of LED we've

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.790 
heard of LCD we've heard of LED we've
heard<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.750> plasma<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.289> now<00:00:22.439> we're<00:00:22.590> going<00:00:22.710> to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
heard of plasma and now we're going to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.980 
heard of plasma and now we're going to
crystal<00:00:23.220> LED<00:00:23.640> yeah<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.510> what<00:00:24.660> we've<00:00:24.810> got<00:00:24.960> here

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
crystal LED yeah so what we've got here

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.630 
crystal LED yeah so what we've got here
is<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.410> future<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.920> television<00:00:26.310> we're

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
is the future of television we're

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.980 
is the future of television we're
looking<00:00:26.880> at<00:00:26.939> how<00:00:27.090> can<00:00:27.119> we<00:00:27.330> elevate<00:00:27.960> that

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
looking at how can we elevate that

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.500 
looking at how can we elevate that
experience<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.830> with<00:00:28.920> crystal<00:00:29.730> LED<00:00:30.240> we're

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
experience and with crystal LED we're

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.450 
experience and with crystal LED we're
actually<00:00:30.720> adding<00:00:31.140> LEDs<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.009> pixel

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
actually adding LEDs that the pixel

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.400 
actually adding LEDs that the pixel
level<00:00:32.640> allowing<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.290> know

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
level allowing you to have you know

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.049 
level allowing you to have you know
there's<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.770> lot<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.920> color<00:00:35.219> filters<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
there's a lot of color filters and

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.760 
there's a lot of color filters and
bezels<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.630> things<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.350> get<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> way

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
bezels and things that get in the way

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.440 
bezels and things that get in the way
and<00:00:37.890> they<00:00:38.129> soften<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.610> picture<00:00:38.940> they<00:00:39.180> reduce

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
and they soften the picture they reduce

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.420 
and they soften the picture they reduce
the<00:00:39.600> viewing<00:00:39.899> angle<00:00:40.200> now<00:00:40.590> with<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:40.950> crystal

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the viewing angle now with this crystal

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.490 
the viewing angle now with this crystal
LED<00:00:41.790> display<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.660> technology<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.320> gives

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
LED display is the technology that gives

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.590 
LED display is the technology that gives
us<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.770> beautiful<00:00:44.190> bright<00:00:44.460> colors<00:00:44.910> really

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
two and the engineers are walking around

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.660 
two and the engineers are walking around
and<00:01:12.630> really<00:01:12.810> babysitting<00:01:13.409> yeah<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.400> what

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
and really babysitting yeah and and what

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.130 
and really babysitting yeah and and what
that's<00:01:15.000> what's<00:01:15.210> great<00:01:15.330> about<00:01:15.420> these<00:01:15.720> shows<00:01:15.960> is

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
that's what's great about these shows is

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.510 
that's what's great about these shows is
it<00:01:16.290> here<00:01:16.680> we've<00:01:16.799> got<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.009> whole<00:01:17.189> bunch<00:01:17.400> of

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
it here we've got a whole bunch of

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.780 
it here we've got a whole bunch of
technology<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.570> glasses-free<00:01:19.500> 3d<00:01:19.680> TV<00:01:20.610> as

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
technology like glasses-free 3d TV as

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.300 
technology like glasses-free 3d TV as
well<00:01:20.820> yeah<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.720> really<00:01:22.259> makes<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.220> a

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
well yeah and this is really makes it a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.440 
well yeah and this is really makes it a
better<00:01:23.430> experience<00:01:23.580> because<00:01:24.210> you're<00:01:24.330> not

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
better experience because you're not

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.270 
better experience because you're not
worried<00:01:24.720> about<00:01:24.780> being<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.170> bulky<00:01:25.439> glass<00:01:25.650> right

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
worried about being a bulky glass right

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.850 
worried about being a bulky glass right
and<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.850> what<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.150> do<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> set<00:01:28.740> of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
and so what we do is we have a set of

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.800 
and so what we do is we have a set of
filters<00:01:29.009> on<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> front<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.850> sort<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.210> make

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
filters on the front that sort of make

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.120 
filters on the front that sort of make
the<00:01:30.960> image<00:01:31.170> go<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> little<00:01:31.650> bit<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> left

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the image go a little bit to the left

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.770 
the image go a little bit to the left
and<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.579> little<00:01:32.850> bit<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> right<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.630> it's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
and a little bit to the right and it's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080 
and a little bit to the right and it's
actually<00:01:33.900> what<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.320> call<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> 4k<00:01:35.189> panel<00:01:35.670> because
