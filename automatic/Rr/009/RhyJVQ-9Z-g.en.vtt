00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.730 

we're<00:00:38.720> gonna<00:00:38.810> start<00:00:39.140> by<00:00:39.170> burning<00:00:39.560> our

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:39.740 
we're gonna start by burning our

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.790 
we're gonna start by burning our
herringbone<00:00:40.400> pattern<00:00:40.880> down<00:00:41.750> each<00:00:42.080> side<00:00:42.410> of

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
herringbone pattern down each side of

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.370 
herringbone pattern down each side of
the<00:00:43.130> cheese<00:00:43.730> board<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:44.570> you<00:00:44.750> use<00:00:44.930> this<00:00:45.110> angle

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
the cheese board and you use this angle

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.530 
the cheese board and you use this angle
tool<00:00:45.800> it<00:00:46.010> makes<00:00:46.070> it<00:00:46.340> super<00:00:46.490> easy<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:47.420> whole

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
tool it makes it super easy the whole

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.300 
tool it makes it super easy the whole
idea<00:00:47.810> here<00:00:48.080> is<00:00:48.230> this<00:00:48.500> is<00:00:48.620> something<00:00:48.950> you<00:00:49.100> made

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
idea here is this is something you made

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.780 
idea here is this is something you made
it's<00:00:50.000> kind<00:00:50.270> of<00:00:50.330> a<00:00:50.420> rustic<00:00:50.810> vibe<00:00:51.170> anyway<00:00:51.890> so

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
it's kind of a rustic vibe anyway so

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.740 
it's kind of a rustic vibe anyway so
turn<00:00:53.240> off<00:00:53.270> your<00:00:54.250> perfectionist<00:00:55.250> tendencies

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
turn off your perfectionist tendencies

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.460 
turn off your perfectionist tendencies
and<00:00:56.750> now<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:56.990> just<00:00:57.440> go<00:00:57.890> down<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.250> other<00:00:58.280> side

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
and now you just go down the other side

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.580 
and now you just go down the other side
making<00:01:00.470> your<00:01:00.770> little<00:01:01.040> hearing<00:01:02.030> them<00:01:02.590> just

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
making your little hearing them just

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.460 
making your little hearing them just
meet<00:01:03.830> up<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.460> one<00:01:04.670> on<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:04.880> other<00:01:05.330> side<00:01:05.480> so

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
meet up the one on the other side so

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.840 
meet up the one on the other side so
we'll<00:01:06.590> just<00:01:06.770> do<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:06.920> down<00:01:07.160> the<00:01:07.370> other<00:01:07.520> side

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
we'll just do that down the other side

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.020 
we'll just do that down the other side
as<00:01:08.030> well<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:08.540> then<00:01:09.140> we<00:01:09.320> can<00:01:09.350> burn<00:01:10.040> our<00:01:10.610> words

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
as well and then we can burn our words

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.080 
as well and then we can burn our words
on<00:01:11.660> to<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.140> front<00:01:12.380> of<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.619> board<00:01:13.030> all<00:01:14.030> right

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
on to the front of the board all right

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.330 
on to the front of the board all right
we're<00:01:14.510> just<00:01:14.540> gonna<00:01:14.750> switch<00:01:15.050> from<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.860> angle

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
we're just gonna switch from the angle

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.190 
we're just gonna switch from the angle
step<00:01:17.560> to<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:19.729> fluid<00:01:20.090> tip<00:01:20.300> so<00:01:20.720> writing
