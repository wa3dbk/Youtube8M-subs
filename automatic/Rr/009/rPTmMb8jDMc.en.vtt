00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.220 
what does the song about mean um the
song<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.780> guess<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.829> my<00:00:56.809> anger<00:00:57.809> song<00:00:58.020> I

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
song I guess is just my anger song I

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.630 
song I guess is just my anger song I
don't<00:00:58.410> really<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.770> any<00:00:58.980> songs<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.550> are

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
don't really have any songs that are

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.240 
don't really have any songs that are
really<00:01:00.030> angry<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.770> think<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.039> kind<00:01:02.160> of

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
really angry and I think it kind of

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.240 
really angry and I think it kind of
embodies<00:01:02.430> all<00:01:03.059> those<00:01:03.449> emotions<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:05.010> think

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
embodies all those emotions and I think

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.590 
embodies all those emotions and I think
it's<00:01:05.369> kind<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.580> universal<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.390> way<00:01:06.540> so

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
it's kind of universal in that way so

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.480 
it's kind of universal in that way so
it's<00:01:06.990> not<00:01:07.140> really<00:01:07.439> about<00:01:07.950> one<00:01:08.310> specific

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
it's not really about one specific

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.210 
it's not really about one specific
situation<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:09.689> opposed<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> culmination<00:01:10.979> of

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
situation as opposed to a culmination of

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.149 
situation as opposed to a culmination of
them<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.490> how<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.580> deal<00:01:11.850> with<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.119> anger<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:13.159> a

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
them and how I deal with the anger and a

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.030 
them and how I deal with the anger and a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
one that I was ever kind of a little

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.530 
one that I was ever kind of a little
nervous<00:03:57.270> about<00:03:57.390> so<00:03:58.200> combining<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.430> two<00:03:59.640> makes
