hey<00:00:00.690> everybody<00:00:01.020> today<00:00:01.350> we're<00:00:01.469> going<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.650> be

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
hey everybody today we're going to be

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.169 
hey everybody today we're going to be
comparing<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.250> quart<00:00:02.460> mechanic<00:00:02.820> in<00:00:02.909> Newman

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
comparing the quart mechanic in Newman

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.450 
comparing the quart mechanic in Newman
era<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.600> d20<00:00:04.110> system<00:00:04.140> in<00:00:04.680> five<00:00:05.069> minutes<00:00:05.370> or

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
era to the d20 system in five minutes or

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.980 
era to the d20 system in five minutes or
less<00:00:05.490> all<00:00:06.240> right<00:00:06.420> so<00:00:06.540> now<00:00:06.629> both<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.810> these

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
less all right so now both of these

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.839 
less all right so now both of these
systems<00:00:07.410> start<00:00:07.680> out<00:00:07.799> pretty<00:00:08.069> similarly<00:00:08.639> and

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
systems start out pretty similarly and

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.339 
systems start out pretty similarly and
that's<00:00:09.030> there<00:00:09.330> are<00:00:09.450> checks<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.929> make<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.230> order

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
that's there are checks to make in order

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.410 
that's there are checks to make in order
to<00:00:10.469> overcome<00:00:10.920> challenges<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.759> generally

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
to overcome challenges and generally

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.999 
to overcome challenges and generally
they<00:00:12.540> rely<00:00:12.780> on<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.929> B<00:00:13.110> 20<00:00:13.410> which<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.650> why<00:00:13.769> we<00:00:13.860> call

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
they rely on a B 20 which is why we call

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.430 
they rely on a B 20 which is why we call
it<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.160> d20<00:00:14.549> system<00:00:14.990> Pathfinder<00:00:15.990> for<00:00:16.260> said

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
it the d20 system Pathfinder for said

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.779 
it the d20 system Pathfinder for said
there's<00:00:16.740> many<00:00:16.920> other<00:00:17.070> systems<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.520> follow

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
there's many other systems that follow

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.029 
there's many other systems that follow
these<00:00:18.000> same<00:00:18.180> rules<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:19.350> mechanic<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.830> pretty

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
these same rules the mechanic is pretty

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.980 
these same rules the mechanic is pretty
simple<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.369> roll<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.670> d20<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.420> add<00:00:21.570> bonuses

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
simple you roll a d20 you add bonuses

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.269 
simple you roll a d20 you add bonuses
you<00:00:22.260> try<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.470> get<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.680> highest<00:00:22.830> number<00:00:23.250> you

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
you try to get the highest number you

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.790 
you try to get the highest number you
can<00:00:23.580> all<00:00:24.150> right<00:00:24.300> now<00:00:24.960> let's<00:00:25.320> compare<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.650> to

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
can all right now let's compare that to

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.160 
can all right now let's compare that to
the<00:00:25.949> new<00:00:26.070> manera<00:00:26.340> system<00:00:26.760> where<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.810> add<00:00:28.019> your

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
the new manera system where you add your

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.290 
the new manera system where you add your
bonuses<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.800> roll<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.039> d20<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.090> try<00:00:30.269> to

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
bonuses you roll a d20 and you try to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.410 
bonuses you roll a d20 and you try to
get<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.599> highest<00:00:30.689> number<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:32.120> now<00:00:33.120> stop

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
get the highest number you can now stop

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.360 
get the highest number you can now stop
you<00:00:33.630> might<00:00:33.780> say<00:00:34.020> those<00:00:34.500> sound<00:00:34.739> like<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.040> exact

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
you might say those sound like the exact

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.880 
you might say those sound like the exact
same<00:00:35.579> thing<00:00:35.850> however<00:00:36.690> very<00:00:37.200> strangely<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
same thing however very strangely the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.350 
same thing however very strangely the
order<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.250> which<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.730> these<00:00:38.910> things<00:00:39.180> is

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
order in which we do these things is

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.209 
order in which we do these things is
going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.629> totally<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.320> dynamically<00:00:40.860> change

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
going to totally and dynamically change

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.369 
going to totally and dynamically change
the<00:00:41.489> way<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:42.329> game<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.660> played<00:00:42.899> leading<00:00:43.200> us

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the way this game is played leading us

collaborative storytelling experience so

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.270 
collaborative storytelling experience so
absolutely<00:00:49.500> not<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.890> i<00:00:49.980> want<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.190> go<00:00:50.250> ahead

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
absolutely not and i want to go ahead

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.860 
absolutely not and i want to go ahead
and<00:00:50.730> take<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> look<00:00:51.000> at<00:00:51.149> both<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.300> these<00:00:51.510> systems

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
and take a look at both of these systems

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.060 
and take a look at both of these systems
and<00:00:52.050> show<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.559> why<00:00:52.800> first<00:00:53.640> up<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.059> d20<00:00:54.480> system

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
and show you why first up the d20 system

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.020 
and show you why first up the d20 system
now<00:00:56.070> if<00:00:56.160> you're<00:00:56.309> familiar<00:00:56.430> with<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
now if you're familiar with this the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.160 
now if you're familiar with this the
very<00:00:57.059> first<00:00:57.420> thing<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.690> happens<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.050> that

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
very first thing that happens is that

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.260 
very first thing that happens is that
the<00:00:58.289> player<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.980> gonna<00:00:59.280> roll<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> d20<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.090> find

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
the player is gonna roll a d20 to find

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.270 
the player is gonna roll a d20 to find
out<00:01:00.390> whether<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:00.780> are<00:01:01.050> successful<00:01:01.379> um

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
out whether they are successful um

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.280 
out whether they are successful um
now<00:01:02.969> they<00:01:03.059> will<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.390> die<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.960> target

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
now they will that die and the target

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.109 
now they will that die and the target
number<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:05.040> don't<00:01:05.159> know<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.820> want<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.030> get

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
number we don't know so we want to get

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.300 
number we don't know so we want to get
as<00:01:06.299> high<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> number<00:01:06.930> as<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.170> can<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
as high of a number as we can the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.410 
as high of a number as we can the
players<00:01:08.490> gonna<00:01:08.640> start<00:01:08.880> looking<00:01:09.119> at<00:01:09.210> different

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
players gonna start looking at different

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.640 
players gonna start looking at different
bonuses<00:01:09.750> they<00:01:09.900> might<00:01:10.049> have<00:01:10.229> maybe<00:01:10.470> they've

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
bonuses they might have maybe they've

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.810 
bonuses they might have maybe they've
got<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> master<00:01:11.100> works<00:01:11.280> or<00:01:11.490> they've<00:01:11.700> got<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
got a master works or they've got a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.670 
got a master works or they've got a
strength<00:01:12.060> bonus<00:01:12.360> they<00:01:12.510> can<00:01:12.630> apply<00:01:12.810> whatever

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
strength bonus they can apply whatever

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.440 
strength bonus they can apply whatever
it<00:01:13.830> takes<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.250> increase<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.909> number<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.299> much

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
it takes to increase that number as much

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.480 
it takes to increase that number as much
as<00:01:15.570> possible<00:01:16.020> now<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.799> GM<00:01:17.100> might<00:01:17.280> say

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
as possible now the GM might say

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.399 
as possible now the GM might say
something<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:17.909> oh<00:01:18.090> you're<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.750> close<00:01:19.170> are

patiently and breathlessly to find out

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.880 
patiently and breathlessly to find out
whether<00:01:45.030> 17<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.780> enough<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:47.310> succeed<00:01:48.710> this<00:01:49.710> is

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
whether 17 is enough to succeed this is

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.889 
whether 17 is enough to succeed this is
our<00:01:50.009> resolution<00:01:50.579> right<00:01:50.790> here<00:01:51.060> that's<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
our resolution right here that's the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.240 
our resolution right here that's the
moment<00:01:52.049> when<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.320> find<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.799> whether<00:01:52.950> we<00:01:53.070> are

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
moment when we find out whether we are

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.550 
moment when we find out whether we are
successful<00:01:53.880> or<00:01:54.000> whether<00:01:54.479> we<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:54.689> failed<00:01:55.079> and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
successful or whether we have failed and

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.530 
successful or whether we have failed and
it's<00:01:55.920> totally<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> GM<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.119> players<00:01:57.329> have

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
it's totally on the GM the players have

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.569 
it's totally on the GM the players have
done<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.840> best<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.200> isn't<00:01:59.159> enough

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
done the best they can isn't enough

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.539 
done the best they can isn't enough
let's<00:02:00.149> ask<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.570> GM<00:02:00.899> if<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:02.009> happens<00:02:02.340> enough

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
let's ask the GM if it happens enough

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.490 
let's ask the GM if it happens enough
that<00:02:02.729> they<00:02:02.850> fail<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.689> lead<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.930> blame

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
that they fail this can lead to blame

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.010 
that they fail this can lead to blame
why<00:02:05.189> does<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.670> GM<00:02:06.000> have<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.390> out<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:06.540> me

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
why does the GM have it out for me

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.440 
why does the GM have it out for me
why<00:02:07.110> can't<00:02:07.439> we<00:02:07.649> beat<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.310> GM<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.090> leads<00:02:09.300> to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
why can't we beat the GM and it leads to

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.240 
why can't we beat the GM and it leads to
this<00:02:09.629> us<00:02:10.110> versus<00:02:10.649> them<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
this us versus them and

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.240 
this us versus them and
a<00:02:11.280> lot<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.820> games<00:02:12.440> not<00:02:13.440> always<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.860> best<00:02:14.010> and

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
a lot of games not always the best and

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.250 
a lot of games not always the best and
the<00:02:14.400> numenera<00:02:14.700> system<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.300> trying<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.080> change

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
the numenera system is trying to change

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.330 
the numenera system is trying to change
that<00:02:16.500> by<00:02:16.650> doing<00:02:16.770> things<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.100> little<00:02:17.190> bit

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
that by doing things a little bit

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.980 
that by doing things a little bit
differently<00:02:17.730> let's<00:02:18.300> see<00:02:18.420> how<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.600> works<00:02:18.750> for

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
differently let's see how it works for

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.190 
differently let's see how it works for
Newman<00:02:19.230> era<00:02:19.400> now<00:02:20.400> here<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.540> very<00:02:21.750> first<00:02:22.020> thing

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
Newman era now here the very first thing

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.600 
Newman era now here the very first thing
that<00:02:22.320> happens<00:02:22.680> after<00:02:22.890> you're<00:02:23.190> told<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.460> make<00:02:23.550> a

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
that happens after you're told to make a

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.160 
that happens after you're told to make a
check<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.240> you're<00:02:24.390> told<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.660> difficulty<00:02:25.140> of

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
check is you're told the difficulty of

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.200 
check is you're told the difficulty of
that<00:02:25.350> check<00:02:25.620> now<00:02:26.370> five<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.820> pretty<00:02:27.000> high<00:02:27.180> I

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
that check now five is pretty high I

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.610 
that check now five is pretty high I
means<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.510> got<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.660> roll<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.900> fifteen<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.470> let's

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
means you got a roll of fifteen so let's

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.900 
means you got a roll of fifteen so let's
go<00:02:28.770> ahead<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.130> take<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> look<00:02:29.459> at<00:02:29.580> some<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.820> our

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
go ahead and take a look at some of our

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.280 
go ahead and take a look at some of our
resources<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.480> see<00:02:30.690> what<00:02:30.810> we<00:02:30.900> can<00:02:31.020> do<00:02:31.110> about

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
resources to see what we can do about

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.980 
resources to see what we can do about
that<00:02:31.400> player<00:02:32.400> checks<00:02:32.670> their<00:02:32.820> bonuses<00:02:33.209> maybe

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
that player checks their bonuses maybe

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.480 
that player checks their bonuses maybe
they've<00:02:34.170> got<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.350> might<00:02:34.530> edge<00:02:34.709> they've<00:02:35.220> got<00:02:35.370> an

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
they've got a might edge they've got an

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.400 
they've got a might edge they've got an
asset<00:02:35.700> artifact<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.630> artifacts<00:02:37.230> good

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
asset artifact that artifacts good

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.840 
asset artifact that artifacts good
because<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.770> lower<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.040> difficulty<00:02:38.400> by<00:02:38.670> one

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
because the lower the difficulty by one

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.150 
because the lower the difficulty by one
good<00:02:39.330> times

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
good times

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.010 
good times

we've got teamwork going immediately
number<00:02:53.730> four<00:02:53.940> player<00:02:54.480> considers<00:02:55.020> using

number four player considers using

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.900 
number four player considers using
effort<00:02:55.680> since<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.040> difficulty<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.610> five

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
effort since the difficulty is a five

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.170 
effort since the difficulty is a five
probably<00:02:57.900> going<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:59.370> with<00:02:59.520> all<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.970> in

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
probably going to so with all that in

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.520

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.920 
tossed around it's on random chance or
maybe<00:03:32.040> it's<00:03:32.760> on<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:32.910> fact<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.330> they<00:03:33.450> didn't

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
maybe it's on the fact that they didn't
