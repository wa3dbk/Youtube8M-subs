 all I have a new video as 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.210
 you are watching today we have a video in 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.680
 both special and seeing these letters 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.140
 that are appearing lately 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.900
 all sites really I do not know for 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.640
 on May 29 or in a little while 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.500
 to leave an update where we are going to 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.080
 be able to download the world cup from 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.309
 football ultimate team will be totally 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.260
 unlinked from ultimate english we 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.910
 will have another menu will have other tournaments 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.020
 that we will talk about next but 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.430
 I also wanted to make this video because 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.050
 I'm really wondering many of 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.670
 you and will affect this in the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.809
 market then it already influences me and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.190
 this video I tried to do it more 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.329
 possible short to clarify your 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.190
 doubts and also to talk a little bit 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.020
 in this way that we think I want to see 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.759
 your comments really if it's going to 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.410
 Like if you do not like it I'd like to know 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.180
 your opinion and I'm watching our 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.619
 screens a computer where you are watching 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.990
 that the Germans pervade the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.460
 English so you can imagine that 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.590
 it's going to be the compensation completely 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.119
 different from the ultimate in here is 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.680
 they will be based on those in the continents 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.450
 more in the nationalities as always 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.310
 but forget about the teams there are 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.130
 the continents where we are going to be able to 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.360
 be able to buy all kinds of players and 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.479
 the truth is that it is striking because 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.200
 it really is different draws attention 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.939
 It is not something new 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.649
 I sincerely want to start 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.630
 try teams to start testing 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.340
 players start do not know I feel like 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.689
 to build something has where 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.100
 I will surely make a couple of videos for 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.229
 share with you so it's going to 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.820
 give another type of air also to the channel 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.789
 but the most important part where 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.500
 I wanted to get there was this really 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.899
 you are seeing that the menu is case 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.369
 eyelashes simply puts us gives us the 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.619
 option to play gives us the option too 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.049
 of the team or the staff and 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.549
 after buying they really take away 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.590
 the market or the new market 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.899
 in this in this game module that I 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.509
 I try to think that why is it because 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.739
 you are really going to open on we are going to 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.390
 gift envelopes to just start 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.280
 will give us all a few envelopes 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.170
 We are going to open them and they are going to 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.640
 surely play very good players 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.220
 because well you know there are only 32 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.930
 nations and in that 32 nations there are 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.610
 far fewer players than in all 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.380
 the ultimate and how can you know that there is 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.780
 Millions of rare banana players 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.160
 rare bright bronze I do not know what's 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.360
 many players then the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.819
 chances of us touching a when 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.530
 well they are going to be very small and here in 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.200
 in this mode of play with this 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.060
 football you making the world cup will be 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.319
 much easier to touch us is not 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.379
 they imagined reus 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.549
 ronaldo one month and wayne rooney we are going to 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.799
 see a lot more possibility then 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.090
 the market would be super saturated I want 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.950
 think that if I'm that they 're not 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.239
 doing some tests or so to be able 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.010
 remove the bar to people who come to 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.530
 market and really take away work 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.870
 I do not know if there are people who say no 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.370
 they are interested there are others that yes I do not know 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.340
 really if it will interest you they would not put 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.930
 5% and would let us enter normal as well 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.250
 that there will be no market the ways 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.319
 we will simply be able to use it 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.269
 to open envelopes or that surely 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.159
 you will see some paco coming for the first time 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.540
 of my channel so consecutive I do not know 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.620
 show off a little bit of everything that touches you 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.359
 the envelopes is going to be totally 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.769
 non-transferable we will not be able to put it 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.719
 in the market we will not be able to send 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.730
 our rally football or anything like that 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:19.810
 be totally separate but what yes 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.430
 it strikes me is that they 're going to 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.719
 to be able to give the option to spend 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.639
 salmon of the last cinema in the last 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.840
 different from the world so I'm going to put 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.129
 an example so that you understand it and 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.199
 you have 100 thousand currencies us in 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.549
 ultimate team so you can go to the 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:32.139
 here you are going to be able to buy 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.599
 envelopes left and right but sinister 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.519
 I really do not know if it will compensate us 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.889
 since this is a game mode that does not 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.019
 I think it covers a lot of time you see that 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.549
 we can not do almost anything, so I 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.350
 surely think twice before 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.820
 of spending nothing on this 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.850
 game to the best to entertain us a 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.350
 Little out of the last pair of world 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.630
 because if you're not going to be able to play against 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.860
 your friends and now we'll talk a little bit about 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.080
 the competitions that will be that too 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.580
 is going to be reduced but I do not think 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.010
 I will spend a hard here and at best 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.930
 I'll play what I win, so I'll 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.700
 I'll spend later here, but I do not think 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.520
 never use the money last team 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.960
 in the last team of the world cup and say 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.670
 watching the game mode there will be 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.650
 simply from eighth quarters hermes 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.350
 and final as it happens in the world 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.239
 really as well I tell you it's a game 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.760
 pretty reduced we're just going to 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.460
 be able to dispute this type of tournaments 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.950
 there are no leagues no special cups no 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.840
 there's no special kind of way out 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.130
 of normal so that's why I tell you that 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.780
 it does not attract so much attention 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.240
 simply tournament players 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.430
 non-transferable all kinds of things 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.140
 they back out yes it is true that it is 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.640
 pretty flashy the game now you are 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.170
 seeing already we have on screen you will continue 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.210
 seeing many of the engines that still 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.970
 leave 6 seeing that yes it is true that 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.360
 They are pretty striking they are beautiful 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.040
 something different it is true we will 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.260
 be able to use all the equipment of 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.030
 all the teams of the world 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.200
 in Spain for us for the 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.760
 Mexicans will also have theirs 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.310
 Mexican for Colombians his 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.550
 Colombian that is something that does not 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.710
 contributes the football of rally also for 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.630
 the maracana is the official ball yes 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.070
 it is true that the color is striking 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.380
 and from all this I really hope to the 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.670
 hour of benefits and all this type 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.770
 of things of all that he gave us 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:15.190
 optimal and tim because this does not reach him nor the 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.470
 20% really yes it's true that we're going 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.210
 to play let's try it on sada also 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.820
 it is said and I do not know if it is true that the 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.220
 graphic engine will change a bit that what 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.720
 they will do different I read something out there 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.020
 but I do not know if you give one hundred percent 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.750
 Certainly I do not know on day 29 is very little 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.370
 we have very little left to see the game 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.320
 you are already seeing in some players 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.150
 that also change positions by 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.820
 Mascherano example happens to be of the 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.890
 central defense to be midfielder 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.600
 defensive as well is in the selection 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.060
 from Argentina also true that the 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.550
 party players will surely come out 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.020
 here also but really yours 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.070
 question was whether it will affect the 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.270
 market when it comes to selling our 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.100
 consumers all this I do not think that 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.300
 affect sincerely it is impossible for them 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.699
 affect since he 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.979
 even I think it would benefit us already 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.389
 that if they have to apply the currencies of 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.220
 last and they have to apply in this 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.750
 so you really have to try 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.310
 more there then you have to buy more 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.509
 you have to sell more so 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.310
 I really think that it's going to 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.289
 benefit I do not think they open up anymore 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.009
 envelopes for the simple fact that 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:16.470
 there really is a new new and another 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:19.030
 the things that I forgot to say is that 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.800
 we are only going to be able to use a computer 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.419
 as you already know in ultimate and we can 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.099
 We can make several templates 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:25.539
 a lot of things but really here 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:27.819
 they are only going to give us the option of being able to 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:29.860
 create a selection another of the things 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:31.449
 I want I like and especially about me 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.409
 I think it was a big shit that 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:34.120
 you can not play against friends 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:36.460
 simply to be able to play online in the 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.900
 Cups in the playoffs but good 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.789
 you see that it really is something that we 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.500
 give away so we can not put 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:44.169
 no complaint is made by the option of 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.759
 try these kinds of games and really 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:48.099
 we're going to have to take advantage of it and nothing 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:50.050
 complain so the opposite is true 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:51.940
 welcome this in this last team of 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.229
 of the world cup we will pass 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.430
 pretty good and if you want, I'll tell you 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:56.650
 we can prove it we can make a 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.569
 miniseries we can do first mexico 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.130
 then colombia after argentina me 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:01.419
 would like to go touching the elections of 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.160
 all the followers that I have for the 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:03.960
 channel 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.830
 and so with this we have reached the end 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.390
 of the video I hope your comments 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.260
 as I've always put like and see you 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.260
 in the next kids
