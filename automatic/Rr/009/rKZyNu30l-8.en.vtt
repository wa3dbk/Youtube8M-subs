00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:14.369 
so let's do that for the text what I did

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:19.190 
so let's do that for the text what I did
was<00:00:15.020> I<00:00:16.369> just<00:00:17.480> double<00:00:18.480> click<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:18.900> then

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
was I just double click here and then

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.370 
was I just double click here and then
we'll<00:00:19.500> both<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.860> material<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:21.320> go<00:00:22.320> to

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
we'll both on the material and go to

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.870 
we'll both on the material and go to
color<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.949> then<00:00:23.070> where<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.340> says<00:00:23.369> texture

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
color and then where it says texture

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.510 
color and then where it says texture
this<00:00:24.270> little<00:00:24.540> arrow<00:00:24.750> click<00:00:25.259> on<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.559> loadimage

or<00:00:35.100> some<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.670> or<00:00:36.289> acid<00:00:37.289> kind<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.649> metal

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
or some with that or acid kind of metal

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.319 
or some with that or acid kind of metal
I<00:00:38.129> don't<00:00:38.399> know<00:00:40.010> so<00:00:41.719> just<00:00:42.719> click<00:00:42.929> on<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
I don't know so just click on it and

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.079 
I don't know so just click on it and
exposure<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.749> don't<00:00:46.170> know<00:00:46.260> oh<00:00:46.670> we<00:00:47.670> don't<00:00:47.789> need

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
exposure I don't know oh we don't need

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:53.799 
exposure I don't know oh we don't need
exposure<00:00:49.760> maybe<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.120> little<00:00:51.239> bit<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.219> um

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
exposure maybe just a little bit and um

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.669 
exposure maybe just a little bit and um
or<00:00:54.809> texture<00:00:56.600> no<00:00:57.600> wait<00:00:57.749> and<00:00:57.929> then<00:00:58.350> go<00:00:58.499> to<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
or texture no wait and then go to the

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.099 
or texture no wait and then go to the
reflection<00:00:59.309> select<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> reflection<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
reflection select the reflection and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.630 
reflection select the reflection and
then<00:01:01.260> go<00:01:01.499> to<00:01:02.449> same<00:01:03.449> thing<00:01:03.479> texture<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
then go to same thing texture here and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.800 
then go to same thing texture here and
select<00:01:05.640> friends<00:01:06.150> self<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:08.540> maybe<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.690> want

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
select friends self and maybe you want

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.880 
select friends self and maybe you want
to<00:01:09.930> reduce<00:01:10.200> reflection<00:01:10.890> but<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.100> little<00:01:11.310> bit

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
to reduce reflection but a little bit

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.240 
to reduce reflection but a little bit
oops<00:01:14.720> make<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.900> 100<00:01:16.470> Mick<00:01:16.620> strength<00:01:16.950> but

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
oops make this 100 Mick strength but

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.690 
oops make this 100 Mick strength but
much<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.480> little<00:01:18.690> bit<00:01:18.780> less<00:01:19.010> so<00:01:20.010> you<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.400> change

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
much a little bit less so you can change

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.220 
much a little bit less so you can change
the<00:01:20.850> color<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.120> inflection

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.640 

just<00:01:26.230> go<00:01:26.350> keep<00:01:26.560> it<00:01:26.680> black<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:28.470> black<00:01:29.470> and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
just go keep it black and black and

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.130 
just go keep it black and black and
white<00:01:29.830> so<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:31.450> drag<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.750> onto<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.110> text<00:01:34.140> all

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
white so then drag it onto the text all

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.960 
white so then drag it onto the text all

it ah blue and now it looks blue black
and<00:02:14.410> blue<00:02:15.160> black<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.459> make<00:02:15.940> it<00:02:16.560> grey<00:02:17.560> I<00:02:18.450> just

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
and blue black and make it grey I just

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.990 
and blue black and make it grey I just
my<00:02:19.600> soul<00:02:19.930> I<00:02:20.170> like<00:02:20.380> oh<00:02:20.530> its<00:02:21.160> reflection<00:02:21.790> and

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
my soul I like oh its reflection and

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.110 
my soul I like oh its reflection and
reflection<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:23.410> texture<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.550> go<00:02:24.730> down<00:02:24.910> to

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
reflection and the texture it go down to

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.640 
reflection and the texture it go down to
pretzel

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.250 

but<00:02:28.310> it<00:02:28.519> was<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:29.269> one<00:02:29.480> date<00:02:29.689> I<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:29.959> to<00:02:30.079> use

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
but it was the one date I like to use

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.490 
but it was the one date I like to use
the<00:02:30.409> most<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:31.870> maybe<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.019> can<00:02:33.140> change<00:02:33.319> the

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
the most so maybe you can change the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.460 
the most so maybe you can change the
color<00:02:33.709> of<00:02:33.769> reflection<00:02:36.129> no<00:02:37.129> hot<00:02:37.519> looks<00:02:38.420> kind<00:02:39.409> of

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
color of reflection no hot looks kind of

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.949 
color of reflection no hot looks kind of
dumb<00:02:42.760> well<00:02:43.760> let's<00:02:44.090> see<00:02:44.269> what<00:02:44.390> that<00:02:44.540> looks<00:02:44.599> like

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
dumb well let's see what that looks like

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:52.839 
dumb well let's see what that looks like
oh<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:49.760> don't<00:02:49.970> like<00:02:50.810> that<00:02:50.950> black<00:02:51.950> thing<00:02:51.980> on<00:02:52.730> too
