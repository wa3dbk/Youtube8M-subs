segment we're going to talk about how to
grow<00:00:04.799> grass<00:00:04.910> around<00:00:05.910> pine<00:00:06.600> trees<00:00:07.099> now<00:00:08.099> I<00:00:08.490> live

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
grow grass around pine trees now I live

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.950 
grow grass around pine trees now I live
in<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:08.970> northwest<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.570> there's<00:00:09.690> lots<00:00:09.870> of

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
in the northwest and there's lots of

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.070 
in the northwest and there's lots of
pine<00:00:10.200> trees<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.830> so<00:00:11.550> growing<00:00:12.120> grass<00:00:12.599> under

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
pine trees and so growing grass under

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.450 
pine trees and so growing grass under
the<00:00:13.110> pine<00:00:13.410> trees<00:00:13.679> can<00:00:13.889> be<00:00:14.009> quite<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> challenge

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
the pine trees can be quite a challenge

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.510 
the pine trees can be quite a challenge
and<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.839> lot<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> times<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.529> moss<00:00:16.770> will<00:00:17.070> fill<00:00:17.310> in

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
and a lot of times the moss will fill in

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.420 
and a lot of times the moss will fill in
over<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.880> winter<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:19.500> leaves<00:00:19.770> come<00:00:20.189> down

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
over the winter and the leaves come down

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.519 
over the winter and the leaves come down
from<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.029> deciduous<00:00:21.539> trees<00:00:21.840> near<00:00:22.080> my<00:00:22.260> pine

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
from the deciduous trees near my pine

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.580 
from the deciduous trees near my pine
trees<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.689> pine<00:00:24.689> needle<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.230> come<00:00:25.439> down

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
trees and the pine needle so come down

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.290 
trees and the pine needle so come down
in<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> storms<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.970> seems<00:00:27.180> like

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
in the storms and it seems like

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.880 
in the storms and it seems like
everything<00:00:27.630> gets<00:00:27.810> covered<00:00:28.170> up<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.590> can't

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
everything gets covered up and I can't

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.370 
everything gets covered up and I can't
get<00:00:29.039> grass<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.429> grow<00:00:29.550> very<00:00:29.820> easily<00:00:30.109> but<00:00:31.109> there

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
get grass to grow very easily but there

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.650 
get grass to grow very easily but there
are<00:00:31.529> some<00:00:31.800> tricks<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.340> I've<00:00:32.460> been<00:00:32.730> persistent

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
are some tricks and I've been persistent

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.810 
are some tricks and I've been persistent
and<00:00:33.930> I've<00:00:34.590> been<00:00:34.800> pretty<00:00:35.040> successful<00:00:35.250> with

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
and I've been pretty successful with

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.340 
and I've been pretty successful with
growing<00:00:36.210> grass<00:00:36.390> under<00:00:36.690> trees<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.170> there's<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
growing grass under trees and there's a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.560 
growing grass under trees and there's a
few<00:00:37.649> rules<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.100> follow<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.670> first<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.450> all

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
few rules that I follow and first of all

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.080 
few rules that I follow and first of all
I<00:00:39.899> add<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> little<00:00:40.680> compost<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.670> some<00:00:41.879> grass

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
I add a little compost in some grass

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.840 
I add a little compost in some grass
seed<00:00:42.120> every<00:00:42.750> spring<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.649> every<00:00:43.710> fall<00:00:43.920> really

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
seed every spring and every fall really

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.660 
seed every spring and every fall really
that's<00:00:45.239> your<00:00:45.450> key<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.989> success<00:00:46.160> because<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.399> lot

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
that's your key to success because a lot

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.160 
that's your key to success because a lot
of<00:00:47.700> times<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> shade<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.780> will<00:00:48.930> lose<00:00:49.140> some

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
of times in the shade you will lose some

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.990 
of times in the shade you will lose some
of<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> grass<00:00:49.739> over<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> year<00:00:50.489> because<00:00:50.820> it's

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
of the grass over the year because it's

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.510 
of the grass over the year because it's
not<00:00:51.149> getting<00:00:51.300> enough<00:00:51.510> Sun<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.289> by<00:00:52.770> reseeding

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
not getting enough Sun and by reseeding

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.430 
not getting enough Sun and by reseeding
it<00:00:53.640> every<00:00:53.879> spring<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.210> every<00:00:54.329> fall<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:55.289> will

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
it every spring and every fall you will

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.310 
it every spring and every fall you will
get<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> lush<00:00:56.010> lush<00:00:56.460> area<00:00:57.059> there's<00:00:57.960> different

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
get a lush lush area there's different

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.080 
get a lush lush area there's different
types<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.620> grasses<00:00:58.859> too<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.910> your<00:01:00.059> research

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
types of grasses too so do your research

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.150 
types of grasses too so do your research
and<00:01:00.809> find<00:01:01.050> out<00:01:01.199> what<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.739> best<00:01:01.920> type<00:01:02.129> of

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
and find out what is the best type of

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.789 
and find out what is the best type of
grass<00:01:02.520> for<00:01:02.910> shade<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.329> your<00:01:03.480> area<00:01:03.930> for<00:01:04.710> example

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
grass for shade in your area for example

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.120 
grass for shade in your area for example
in<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> northwest<00:01:06.090> at<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> fescues<00:01:07.110> fe<00:01:07.650> s<00:01:07.830> CU

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
in the northwest at the fescues fe s CU

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.450 
in the northwest at the fescues fe s CU
e<00:01:08.340> are<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.420> best<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> shade<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.040> tried

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
e are the best for the shade so I tried

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.679 
e are the best for the shade so I tried
to<00:01:11.490> use<00:01:11.760> blends<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> high

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
to use blends that have a high

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.840 
to use blends that have a high
percentage<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.380> fescue<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.369> them<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
percentage of fescue in them in the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.600 
percentage of fescue in them in the
shady<00:01:15.090> area<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:16.439> my<00:01:16.590> rule<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.860> thumb<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.580> if

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
shady area but my rule of thumb is if

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.060 
shady area but my rule of thumb is if
weeds<00:01:18.180> will<00:01:18.479> not<00:01:18.659> grow<00:01:18.960> then<00:01:19.320> your<00:01:19.500> grass<00:01:19.770> will

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
weeds will not grow then your grass will

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.370 
weeds will not grow then your grass will
not<00:01:20.250> grow<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.000> you've<00:01:21.509> got<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.869> water<00:01:22.110> it

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
not grow and you've got to water it

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.200 
not grow and you've got to water it
really<00:01:22.830> well<00:01:23.009> because<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.549> not<00:01:23.700> getting<00:01:24.000> any

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
really well because it's not getting any

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.530 
really well because it's not getting any
rain<00:01:24.509> when<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.350> rains<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.460> always<00:01:26.700> forget<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
rain when it rains so I always forget to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.539 
rain when it rains so I always forget to
water<00:01:27.750> my<00:01:28.080> grass<00:01:28.140> under<00:01:28.740> pine<00:01:28.979> trees

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
water my grass under pine trees

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.700 
water my grass under pine trees
so<00:01:29.939> just<00:01:30.240> by<00:01:30.390> watering<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.320> will<00:01:31.470> find

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
so just by watering it you will find

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.679 
so just by watering it you will find
that<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.070> will<00:01:32.100> grow<00:01:32.340> ten<00:01:32.700> times<00:01:33.000> better

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
that it will grow ten times better

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.499 
that it will grow ten times better
especially<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.040> spring<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> fall<00:01:36.119> or

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
especially in the spring and the fall or

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.580 
especially in the spring and the fall or
in<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.659> middle<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.049> winter<00:01:37.200> where<00:01:37.439> it's

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
in the middle of the winter where it's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.440 
in the middle of the winter where it's
rainy<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.340> don't<00:01:38.520> think<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.240> need<00:01:39.420> to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
rainy and you don't think you need to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.819
