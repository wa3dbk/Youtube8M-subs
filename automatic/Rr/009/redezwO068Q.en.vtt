00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.710
 we know the nexus always and we are two 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:22.509
 tablets it for me but do not inform me 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.930
 To see you this program starts with a 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:28.060
 This fruit is the nexus 7 is the first 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.250
 first tablet with the google brand is 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.090
 made blue and let's go to heaven 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.850
 detail 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:38.620
 now the weight and size of nexus 7 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.629
 comfortable with users 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.250
 only one- handed tablet 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.350
 contrary to what happens with tablets 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.880
 with the most numerous nursery 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.310
 is a good format for reading books 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.800
 site consultation and calendar management 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.050
 including response and average 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.579
 even because incra is the cd has a 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.739
 suspension is high enough for 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.739
 make the pixels almost invisible and 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.630
 reduce this visual line but there are 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.850
 daycare centers they are very 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.740
 we intend to have a little more fixed already 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.140
 that publish useful for applications 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.299
 and makes it even more difficult to use the 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.399
 virtual keyboard is also bad for 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.530
 reading electronic journals or is not 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.780
 possible to zoom in on pages 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.459
 the list of components is evidence that the 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.159
 google did not want to compromise 

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:22.600
 able to reach a competitive price 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.060
 includes all the credits we are 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.579
 accustomed to smartphones and top tablets 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.429
 such as gps or near field 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.829
 communication and a processor capable of 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.109
 make all applications fluid 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.179
 same more demanding games 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:39.100
 it is lack of rear camera and above all 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.079
 3g or 4g 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.179
 are flaws that could alienate some 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.609
 even because these absences 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.979
 particular importance on a tablet 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:50.289
 which is very compact and as such is 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.749
 ideal to accompany the supporter one 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.670
 line would be useful to enhance 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:57.700
 some of the features of android 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.499
 4.1 with highlight for google mal that 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.810
 automatically represents information 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:03.869
 context of geographical corruption of the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.869
 user 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.220
 and we continue to talk about tablets we have 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.050
 now two of the most recent to come 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.050
 market that is in a particularity 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.150
 have a more inviting price and will 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.890
 answering the question is final already worth 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.300
 Worth buying an investing device that 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.300
 it costs under 200 euros 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.910
 bic maxwell plus is a tablet with a screen 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.770
 very compact seven-inch 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.100
 android 4.0 system 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.660
 the screen includes ips technology or 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.420
 offers above-average quality 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.940
 for a tablet it's cheap to pique 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.920
 maxwell is also quite fast 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.320
 we did not notice expenditure during the 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.530
 use even when we won some 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.810
 games only exist the day beats space 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.460
 storage something we can increase 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.460
 through micro sd cards 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.829
 the other model the state is Alex was 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.629
 even more like the ipad since 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.450
 features a screen with almost 10 inches 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.969
 is quality and day care is also quite 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.000
 and the angles of vision are very 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:28.889
 alex years the performance showed more is 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.810
 very good and the 8 gigabytes of 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:34.310
 storage can also be increased 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.310
 through micro SD 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.209
 despite the low price both bic maxwell 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.829
 as alexis are usable for the new 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.769
 and latest operating system 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.120
 google android 4.0 what to improve 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.629
 even more so the performance of these 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.629
 tragedy 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.010
 we leave the tablets and go to various 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.870
 to finish this program and let's 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.569
 realize at last how it is possible 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.400
 to transform radio waves to energy 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.709
 to tell them that in the future 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.509
 and it is possible that it is the spirit 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.180
 who is on the remote control has to come home 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:20.560
 can pass the story already knows all 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.720
 information in the center or in the 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:29.199
 or a computerized examination may 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:31.530
 lose not not feel but there is 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.820
 energy is captured and its form of 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.710
 radiofrequencies and can be used to 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.470
 charge electronic devices 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.509
 varied in sÃ£o bernardo in the outskirts 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.090
 of aveiro researchers from the Instituto de 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.940
 telecoms show as an antenna 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.530
 and a radio compressor. 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.150
 radiofrequency electric power are 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.900
 enough to light two lamps 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.630
 led 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.610
 during the energy capture demonstration 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.470
 come to the time come back but the 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.419
 Aveiro researchers believe is 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.580
 can reach the electrical tensions rose 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.470
 today converting emitted energy 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.220
 radiofrequency commissions 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.039
 powerful 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.699
 this concept this principle works 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:12.729
 with any type of emission damage 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:16.270
 electromagnetic wants to leave fm radio 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.960
 that sms joy fae that this dinner 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.690
 view 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.020
 all the radiofrequency signals that 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.210
 they are in the air I can harvest them and with 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.389
 this will turn them into a day of being 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.599
 to feed the various sensors 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:33.039
 concept council applied all kinds of 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:34.479
 radio frequencies, which means that no 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:36.280
 future can be used in devices 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.710
 with batteries that store energy 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.520
 always go through the 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.590
 radio 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.880
 this same research project had 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.789
 the path to the development of a 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.770
 tv controller that does not need batteries and 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:50.289
 you just need to convert the 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.599
 infrared are emitted by using 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:55.930
 What we have here is a prototype. 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:56.560
 I spent so much time that I do not need 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.919
 walk 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:03.090
 days to run certain energy 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:07.870
 sent by the reader is by law by rf of 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:10.630
 wait is feed all electronics and 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.330
 idea in the future will include the part of 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:16.270
 on the device to be controlled 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:19.389
 ie positive longer 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:22.389
 controlled by interface and tools 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:26.220
 as usually happens and become 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:26.220
 controlled cross radio signals
