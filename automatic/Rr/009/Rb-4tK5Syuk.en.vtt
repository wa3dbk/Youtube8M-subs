00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.779

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.539
 come ice-skating 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.390
 this activity is part of 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.360
 the organization of the haiti on ice show 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.530
 tells us giuliano cubano children 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.480

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.820
 Wednesday from 4pm they can 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.710
 come skate for free and the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.190
 adults can come to see the kids 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.100
 patinated yesterday we have we had the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.930
 visit of the minister who was 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.940
 there she even skated children 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.840
 she was happy and saw that everything 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.030
 works well 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.510
 the ice works well and everything so 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.750
 now we have a small problem it is 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.759
 compared to artists but it's okay 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.910
 do the standard there are monitors there 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:14.670
 roughly I believe 5.6 person who 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.119
 take the kids those who have never 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.950
 never skated and we teach them that's it 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.640
 what's wrong with that? 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.080
 we do not let them go like that on the turntable 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.929
 for the big shows 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.030
 ice skating with skaters 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.640
 stars from abroad 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.860
 again a new date is set hills 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.020
 is scheduled for this weekend explains 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.599
 julian newman or these friday saturday 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.149
 Sunday and Monday and that's really 

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:46.020
 sure there is more than 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:48.000
 problems the ice it works it's 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.950
 just a little problem of artists and there 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.709
 now it's good that's not the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.959
 ticket problem artists problem 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:57.300
 of return plane only this 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.520
 week programming so there is there 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.670
 a small change from 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.690
 dates that was said we had to do this 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.840
 Monday Tuesday 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.869
 Wednesday this show against there we 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.760
 have a small problem back from 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.810
 airline tickets for artists that's 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.910
 still very important 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.000
 so that's only it so we have 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.490
 postponed the show Friday saturday 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.920
 sunday and monday at all is ok we 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.020
 have more than 8 centimeters of ice 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.920
 by the way you can watch yesterday there 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.010
 there was I do not know how many 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.980
 people who skated and everything but there 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.110
 down to the stage elsewhere it was 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.930
 impossible because we surrendered 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.690
 account in the end who had a heat of 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.030
 75 degrees down and I chatted with 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.290
 Martinique footballers because 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.960
 that I am in Martinique and 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.700
 world he this football pitch he is but 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.190
 non but this is true is that a heat 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.620
 for these two of the synthetic so a 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.020
 floor heat of 60 frames we would not have 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.240
 never could it have really worked there 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.510
 it's not possible 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.950
 but now you see it there it's 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.770
 not a dream it's reality 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.090
 waiting for the star skaters on 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.700
 weekend to give the show 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.830
 some young people take the opportunity 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.190
 to learn to skate on 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.650
 ice cream 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.320
 from two of them the experience 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.660
 is quite interesting - its 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.450

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.700
 although we would propose us and we
