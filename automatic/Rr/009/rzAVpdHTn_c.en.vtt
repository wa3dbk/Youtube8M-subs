you're<00:00:45.510> going<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.660> do<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.020> line<00:00:46.230> those<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:47.360> just

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
you're going to do is line those up just

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.770 
you're going to do is line those up just
like<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.829> this<00:00:49.829> clip<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:51.270> imagine<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.719> you

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
like so this clip just imagine it you

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.049 
like so this clip just imagine it you
still<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.170> lined<00:00:52.350> up<00:00:52.530> will<00:00:53.399> slide<00:00:53.760> into

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
still have it lined up will slide into

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.779 
still have it lined up will slide into
this<00:00:54.270> groove<00:00:54.719> here<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.680> hold<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> hose<00:00:56.460> tight

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
this groove here and hold the hose tight

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.010 
this groove here and hold the hose tight
to<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.059> body<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.870> clip<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.410> slip<00:00:58.649> on

to the body the clip is going to slip on
just<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.469> your<00:01:02.100> brake<00:01:02.340> line<00:01:02.579> will<00:01:02.789> screw

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
just like so your brake line will screw

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.719 
just like so your brake line will screw
in<00:01:03.239> through<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.280> tighten<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:07.729> just

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729
