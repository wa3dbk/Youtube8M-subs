00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
motion sensor and I get knocked in a bag

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.710 
motion sensor and I get knocked in a bag
that<00:01:37.740> was<00:01:37.979> merely<00:01:38.250> me<00:01:38.579> not<00:01:38.790> concentrating<00:01:39.570> and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
that was merely me not concentrating and

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.569 
that was merely me not concentrating and
trying<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.290> focus<00:01:40.500> too<00:01:40.829> much<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> actual

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
trying to focus too much on the actual

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.330 
trying to focus too much on the actual
people<00:01:42.299> arm<00:01:42.630> trying<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> shoot<00:01:43.170> at<00:01:43.290> now<00:01:44.130> when<00:01:44.310> I

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
people arm trying to shoot at now when I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.429 
people arm trying to shoot at now when I
spawn<00:01:44.759> we've<00:01:45.090> been<00:01:45.270> counters<00:01:45.720> I'm<00:01:46.170> going<00:01:46.380> to

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
spawn we've been counters I'm going to

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.069 
spawn we've been counters I'm going to
fail<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.680> nate<00:01:47.159> but<00:01:47.430> i<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.689> was<00:01:48.930> only

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
fail this nate but i think this was only

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.510 
fail this nate but i think this was only
the<00:01:49.200> second<00:01:49.680> game<00:01:49.799> i<00:01:49.950> played<00:01:50.189> today<00:01:50.369> I

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520

the second game i played today I
literally<00:01:50.970> hadn't<00:01:51.329> played<00:01:51.509> black<00:01:51.750> ops<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:52.170> a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320

literally hadn't played black ops in a
very<00:01:52.530> long<00:01:52.710> time<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.880> think<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.540> excuse

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
very long time so I think you can excuse

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.959 
very long time so I think you can excuse
me<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.200> now<00:01:55.590> here<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.890> see<00:01:56.159> three<00:01:56.520> guys<00:01:56.729> in

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
you know maybe they had a radar up as I

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.680 
you know maybe they had a radar up as I
have<00:02:08.399> ghost<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:09.000> will<00:02:09.239> appear<00:02:09.479> on<00:02:09.599> their

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
have ghost on I will appear on their

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.070

radar

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
radar

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.810 
radar
and<00:02:10.320> so<00:02:10.680> the<00:02:10.860> sudden<00:02:11.130> you<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.340> gotta<00:02:11.550> be<00:02:11.610> wary

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
and so the sudden you just gotta be wary

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.440 
and so the sudden you just gotta be wary
of<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.210> now<00:02:12.660> let<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.990> UAV<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.070> up<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:15.270> can

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
of so now let the UAV is up and the can

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.900 
of so now let the UAV is up and the can
UAV<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:16.050> gone<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.530> can<00:02:16.890> just<00:02:17.040> carry<00:02:17.220> on<00:02:17.370> chasing

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
UAV is gone I can just carry on chasing

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.460 
UAV is gone I can just carry on chasing
these<00:02:18.030> dots<00:02:18.300> that's<00:02:18.510> something<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.960> was<00:02:19.110> really

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470

good<00:02:19.620> at<00:02:19.710> in<00:02:19.830> black<00:02:20.040> ops<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.460> I<00:02:20.820> managed<00:02:21.030> to

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
good at in black ops and I managed to

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.670 
good at in black ops and I managed to
win<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.450> guy<00:02:21.660> with<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.930> drop<00:02:22.230> shot<00:02:22.410> drop

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
able to pick that guy up very quickly

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.520 
able to pick that guy up very quickly
even<00:02:30.120> though<00:02:30.210> I<00:02:30.240> was<00:02:30.480> damaged<00:02:30.870> if<00:02:31.290> you're<00:02:31.470> not

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
even though I was damaged if you're not

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.110 
even though I was damaged if you're not
so<00:02:31.740> confident<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.520> can<00:02:32.640> just<00:02:32.880> run<00:02:33.030> away

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
so confident you can just run away

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.940 
so confident you can just run away
they're<00:02:33.480> trying<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:34.020> game<00:02:34.350> from<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.650> different

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
they're trying a game from a different

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.130 
they're trying a game from a different
angle<00:02:35.040> now<00:02:35.670> here<00:02:35.880> by<00:02:36.060> using<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.600> cover<00:02:36.900> on

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
angle now here by using this cover on

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.560 
angle now here by using this cover on
the<00:02:37.260> steps<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.800> can<00:02:38.310> easily<00:02:38.760> pick<00:02:39.000> him<00:02:39.150> up<00:02:39.300> once

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
the steps I can easily pick him up once

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.570 
the steps I can easily pick him up once
and<00:02:39.840> pick<00:02:40.230> him<00:02:40.350> up<00:02:40.470> twice<00:02:40.710> it<00:02:41.070> was<00:02:41.280> good<00:02:41.460> to

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
and pick him up twice it was good to

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.550 
and pick him up twice it was good to
stay<00:02:41.790> where<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.030> was<00:02:42.270> because<00:02:42.780> he<00:02:43.290> may<00:02:43.470> have

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
stay where I was because he may have

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.960 
stay where I was because he may have
thought<00:02:43.770> that<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:43.980> would<00:02:44.190> try<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.430> rushes

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
thought that I would try and rushes

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.640 
thought that I would try and rushes
tactical<00:02:45.510> insertion<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:46.140> know<00:02:46.230> maybe<00:02:46.410> try

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
tactical insertion you know maybe try

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.380 
tactical insertion you know maybe try
and<00:02:46.740> go<00:02:46.830> behind<00:02:46.980> him<00:02:47.340> but<00:02:47.790> in<00:02:47.910> this<00:02:48.030> case<00:02:48.240> you

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
and go behind him but in this case you

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.610 
and go behind him but in this case you
know<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.510> was<00:02:48.600> almost<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.900> double<00:02:49.200> bluff<00:02:49.380> and

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
know it was almost a double bluff and

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.110 
know it was almost a double bluff and
there<00:02:49.860> we<00:02:49.980> go<00:02:50.130> i<00:02:50.160> pick<00:02:50.400> up<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.610> Blackbird<00:02:50.970> and

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
there we go i pick up the Blackbird and

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.810 
there we go i pick up the Blackbird and
