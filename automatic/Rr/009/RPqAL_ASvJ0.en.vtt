 and this could be a culinary drama the 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.420
 hake the most popular fish and 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.459
 consumed in the country is at risk of 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.259
 be exhausted due to it to the authority and 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:14.509
 even a drastic decrease in 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.070
 capture fees for both 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.439
 artisanal as for the industrial 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.320
 this decision as expected 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.849
 triggered the massive emergence and 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.029
 out of control of illegal fishing that 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.769
 jeopardizes the sustainability of this 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.869
 cristal resort meneses and Juan Carlos 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.869
 leppe have this story 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.030
 dawns on the Maule coast and dozens of 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.970
 craft boats heading towards the sea 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.399
 open loading the games the only 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.780
 resource that we have in hake 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.399
 historically on the central coast of 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.739
 Chile is the largest volume of 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.559
 see lusa 60 percent is extracted by 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:53.050
 industrial fishing the remaining 40 the 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.030
 and ideally, it would be 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.370
 50 minimum to 50 percent for 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.079
 crafts that we are much more in this 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.460
 moment to the industrialists we are 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.500
 Seeing how many three ships at a level 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.210
 national and how many people are 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.429
 involved in the three ships have 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.090
 involved 30 people and thousands 

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:10.100
 What are we 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.020
 beyond who should fish more or 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.570
 less in the excessive capture of this fish 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.939
 has caused its collapse according to the 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.799
 authority the common hake is one of the 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.200
 fisheries qualified in the state of 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.390
 overexploitation in addition to jack mackerel 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.180
 deep cod and three others 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.040
 varieties should lusa 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.110
 it is projected that at the current rate of 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.420
 exploitation in 10 years could 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.340
 disappear from our tables the popular 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.170
 fishing gives 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.520
 in the case of common hake, 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.200
 fishery very important for the 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.810
 discard sanz that for the restaurants 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.600
 has decreased by more than 70 percent 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.179
 since the last 10 years for the 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.850
 extraction of common hake in 2013 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:53.450
 a quota of 40 thousand tons was fixed on 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.310
 2014 drastically dropped to 19,000 who 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.170
 more were affected with this 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.350
 decrease were the fishermen 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.209
 artisanal fishermen from maule 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.280
 they took and destroyed the offices of 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.709
 be fishing by force entered to 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.649
 the sernapesca offices to claim 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:11.690
 for the hake quota the 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.269
 restriction via quota brought with it the 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.790
 massive and uncontrolled emergence of the 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.430
 Illegal fishing boats that do not 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.290
 they declare their catches is a market 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.200
 black that is tolerated by 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.670
 craftsmen who work legally 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.970
 is given at the same time as legal so that 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:34.319
 we are knowing so we do not have to take out the 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.510
 vote the syringe if sometimes there really 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.730
 than doing it out of necessity because if we 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.340
 We dedicate to declare the quota that we 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.220
 They really give us a couple of 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.349
 targets and there are fishermen who were 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.209
 stopped since September we ended up 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.310
 September October November and December 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.870
 because they were several months unemployed and if 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.120
 they were what is to do the extraction 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.530
 of hake 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.120
 and legal for the theme of a love in the 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.950
 industrial fishery sector calculate that 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.140
 illegal extraction is wall times the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.040
 allocated quota and in passing discard that 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.180
 are they who carry out this illegal 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.180
 in all those houses 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.650
 it's so complicated sir is the 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.540
 download the fundamentally in the sixth 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.730
 and seventh region by a group of 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.770
 fishermen who do fishing on their 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.230
 fee because they probably do not have 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.630
 permission and they are capturing several 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.510
 times the annual fee what is a signal 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.670
 clear that the species is heading to 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.760
 definitive collapse is a small number 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.980
 of ships call in large ports 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.600
 where there are officers in fishing and 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.000
 impossibility therefore that fishing 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.650
 Illegal proceed the industrial center 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.450
 problem of illegal fishing is a big 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.430
 problem right now for us 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.130
 is the most important issue from here to 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.569
 future and sustainability in good 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.890
 part is given by the capacity that 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.790
 we have as a service to be able 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.860
 control that these doors 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.600
 effectively be completed for this year 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.480
 the hake catch quota increased 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.180
 slightly from the 19 thousand last year to 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.190
 23,000 viewers of caleta 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.620
 portals did not agree with 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.989
 this increase contrary to his colleagues 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.239
 from the Maule region they believe that 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.299
 it is necessary to further restrict the quota 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.100
 I can not be increasing or be 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.510
 Please note that the quota be increased while 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.690
 there is no recovery 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.310
 that the change in the 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.870
 fishermen will always keep the 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.360
 same fishermen will not enter 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.700
 young we will win you wise not in this 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.770
 is going to monopolize that there is because 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.960
 we go see the day to day just 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.900
 Norwegian fishermen have not 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.880
 remain passive to illegal fishing assume 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.890
 that the state of overexploitation of the 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.020
 fluff makes it necessary to exercise them 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.870
 same control to ensure 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:50.770
 sustainability to the partner that makes 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:53.169
 illegal fishing sanction it we punish 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.389
 that is, we put them toads 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.740
 south you have to learn to manage the 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.060
 resource 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.060
 manages the fishery 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.400
 help to enunciate those that are illegal 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.460
 there is one because they are doing it harm 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.580
 tremendous for the sustainability of the 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.440
 resource that we will then have 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.449
 hake understand that to the extent that 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.000
 control the capture quota control 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.979
 the price of the product of ValparaÃ­so 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.919
 they demarcate themselves from the commercial strategy 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:26.710
 of the southern fishermen they sell 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:30.699
 the houses of the five never to six thousand 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:39.490
 weights and you do not all sides and six thousand 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:42.039
 to five thousand 750 each well with a spent 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.280
 50 boxes but adjustments that the fees 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:46.380
 they are putting 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.630
 the problem is that there is no 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.180
 real and efficient control 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.710
 competent authority sernapesca delivery 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.210
 to the fishing unions the 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.580
 Responsibility to declare 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.760
 voluntarily there are no officials 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.110
 working in the coves near 900 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.240
 officials throughout the country 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.430
 however this worship is still 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.770
 insufficient to cover all the 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.010
 points from the park and every minute 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.230
 that this happens given this scenario 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.820
 we have developed this strategy 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.310
 of risk so that those points 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.919
 that are more dangerous than they have higher 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.840
 possibility of evasion where we are 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.280
 concentrating our work the director 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.750
 National Fishing is clear that their 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.610
 services do not have vacations for 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.930
 overseeing there is no 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.820
 coordination with the army for 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.860
 control that the boats comply 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.930
 with the regulatory permits in addition 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.700
 what is suspended as illegal fishing 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.070
 on the roads it is already dead and 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:42.080
 can not be confiscated, it only fits 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.080
 a fine in this situation 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.600
 this year the budget law 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.830
 has just picked up an increase in 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.010
 the oversight capabilities of 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.479
 sernapesca is just to go 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.699
 delimiting these illegal fishing spaces 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:55.740
 that all they do is damage the 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:57.240
 recovery of resources and end 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.160
 harming the fishermen themselves not 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.290
 also regarding the increase of the quota 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.360
 of the hake the development institute 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.130
 fishing agency, which by law is the 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.740
 responsible for monitoring and proposing 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.479
 total of marine resource capture 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.030
 defends the increase supported by the 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:13.560
 both scientific studies and analysis 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:17.030
 it was within a range biologically 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.990
 permissible is affecting us in the 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.810
 resource because it was a decision 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:24.690
 absolutely technical and scientific 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:27.060
 attached to the best availability of 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:29.280
 information until recently chile was the 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.530
 third country in fisheries importance today 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.910
 is the seventh clear consequence of 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.010
 collapse that meant to have 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:37.740
 overexploited marine resources by 

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.979
 decades believing that they never left 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.979
 to finish
