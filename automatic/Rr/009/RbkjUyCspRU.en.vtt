00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
all right so before you start you want

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.480 
all right so before you start you want
to<00:00:24.720> be<00:00:24.810> able<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.050> be<00:00:25.740> able<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.949> do<00:00:26.099> frontside

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
to be able to be able to do frontside

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.240 
to be able to be able to do frontside
180<00:00:27.060> slides<00:00:27.810> pretty<00:00:28.080> consistently<00:00:28.680> because

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
180 slides pretty consistently because

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.999 
180 slides pretty consistently because
that<00:00:29.460> really<00:00:29.849> really<00:00:30.180> helps<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.630> trick

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
that really really helps the trick

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.760 
that really really helps the trick
obviously<00:00:32.300> so<00:00:33.300> basically<00:00:33.600> what<00:00:33.840> what<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> do<00:00:34.290> is

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
obviously so basically what what I do is

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.369 
obviously so basically what what I do is
I<00:00:35.070> keep<00:00:35.910> my<00:00:36.150> foot<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.600> about<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> same

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
I keep my foot in about the same

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.189 
I keep my foot in about the same
position<00:00:37.559> as<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.430> frontside<00:00:39.330> power<00:00:39.629> side<00:00:39.870> 180

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
position as a frontside power side 180

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.650 
position as a frontside power side 180
except<00:00:40.920> my<00:00:41.100> back<00:00:41.309> foot<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.360> little<00:00:42.540> bit

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
except my back foot it's a little bit

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.660 
except my back foot it's a little bit
more<00:00:42.780> towards<00:00:43.080> the<00:00:43.140> middle<00:00:43.410> because<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.489> feel

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
more towards the middle because I feel

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.160 
more towards the middle because I feel
like<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.940> helps<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.480> rotation<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.019> little

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
like that helps the rotation a little

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.410 
like that helps the rotation a little
bit<00:00:46.290> better<00:00:46.489> you<00:00:47.489> put<00:00:47.640> your<00:00:47.790> front<00:00:47.970> foot<00:00:48.180> about

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
bit better you put your front foot about

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.770 
bit better you put your front foot about
2-3<00:00:48.870> inches<00:00:49.250> behind<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.460> front<00:00:50.519> bolts<00:00:50.850> your
