00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
could explain so your typical shot in

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.490 
could explain so your typical shot in
the<00:02:56.000> body<00:02:56.269> that<00:02:56.659> would<00:02:56.750> be<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.989> chest<00:02:57.290> the

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
the body that would be the chest the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.280 
the body that would be the chest the
arms<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:58.010> legs<00:02:58.040> that's<00:02:59.000> gonna<00:02:59.180> do<00:02:59.390> 50<00:02:59.959> points

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
arms the legs that's gonna do 50 points

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.470 
arms the legs that's gonna do 50 points
of<00:03:00.440> damage<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:01.069> keep<00:03:01.760> an<00:03:01.879> eye<00:03:01.970> out<00:03:02.090> for<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.329> nice

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
of damage and keep an eye out for a nice

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.690 
of damage and keep an eye out for a nice
scoping<00:03:03.019> you'll<00:03:03.590> see<00:03:03.799> a<00:03:03.829> little<00:03:03.980> gauge<00:03:04.280> just

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
scoping you'll see a little gauge just

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.220 
scoping you'll see a little gauge just
to<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.879> right<00:03:05.000> of<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.209> crosshairs<00:03:05.659> a<00:03:05.930> bunch

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
to the right of the crosshairs a bunch

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.020 
to the right of the crosshairs a bunch
of<00:03:06.319> bars<00:03:06.560> that<00:03:06.769> fill<00:03:07.129> up<00:03:07.159> on<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.489> lightning<00:03:07.879> bolt

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
of bars that fill up on a lightning bolt

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.330 
of bars that fill up on a lightning bolt
that's<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.109> charge<00:03:09.440> on<00:03:09.650> your<00:03:09.769> shot<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.280> the

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
that's the charge on your shot and the

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.460 
that's the charge on your shot and the
longer<00:03:10.609> you<00:03:10.700> stay<00:03:10.879> scoped<00:03:11.359> in<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:12.170> more<00:03:12.349> the

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
longer you stay scoped in the more the

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.319 
longer you stay scoped in the more the
bars<00:03:12.680> fill<00:03:12.950> up<00:03:13.099> and<00:03:13.609> the<00:03:13.730> more<00:03:13.879> charge<00:03:14.180> you

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
bars fill up and the more charge you

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.300 
bars fill up and the more charge you
have<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:15.049> more<00:03:15.260> damage<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.769> shot<00:03:16.040> is<00:03:16.160> gonna

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
have the more damage the shot is gonna

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.460 
have the more damage the shot is gonna
do<00:03:16.519> and<00:03:16.819> after<00:03:17.329> a<00:03:17.480> few<00:03:17.630> seconds<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:18.019> charging

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
do and after a few seconds of charging

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.440 
do and after a few seconds of charging
it'll<00:03:18.709> cap<00:03:18.950> at<00:03:19.069> 100%<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.790> when<00:03:19.880> it's<00:03:20.000> not<00:03:20.090> 100%

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
it'll cap at 100% and when it's not 100%

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.050 
it'll cap at 100% and when it's not 100%
it's<00:03:21.319> gonna<00:03:21.530> do<00:03:21.739> three<00:03:22.310> times<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:22.790> amount<00:03:22.819> of

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
it's gonna do three times the amount of

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.990 
it's gonna do three times the amount of
damage<00:03:23.419> triple<00:03:24.079> so<00:03:24.470> if<00:03:25.280> your<00:03:25.489> regular<00:03:25.639> body

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
damage triple so if your regular body

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.390 
damage triple so if your regular body
shots<00:03:26.269> fifty<00:03:26.750> but<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:27.530> have<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.739> fully<00:03:28.010> charged

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
shots fifty but you have a fully charged

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.879 
shots fifty but you have a fully charged
shot<00:03:28.760> you'll<00:03:29.180> do<00:03:29.329> 150<00:03:30.019> damage<00:03:30.379> with<00:03:30.650> a<00:03:30.709> body

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
shot you'll do 150 damage with a body

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.220 
shot you'll do 150 damage with a body
shot<00:03:31.010> that's<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.120> weird<00:03:32.419> sniper<00:03:32.780> mechanic

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
shot that's the weird sniper mechanic

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.690 
shot that's the weird sniper mechanic
ins<00:03:33.379> game<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.799> other<00:03:33.919> sniper<00:03:34.160> mechanic<00:03:34.609> is

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
ins game the other sniper mechanic is

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.039 
ins game the other sniper mechanic is
very<00:03:34.879> very<00:03:35.060> simple<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:35.599> it's<00:03:35.780> pretty<00:03:35.959> much

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
very very simple and it's pretty much

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:36.819 
very very simple and it's pretty much
where<00:03:36.230> you'd<00:03:36.379> expect

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
where you'd expect

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.339 
where you'd expect
head<00:03:37.280> shots<00:03:37.579> so<00:03:38.269> if<00:03:38.359> you<00:03:38.450> land<00:03:38.690> a<00:03:38.840> headshot

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
head shots so if you land a headshot

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.369 
head shots so if you land a headshot
you'll<00:03:39.859> do<00:03:40.010> 150<00:03:40.699> damage<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.510> this<00:03:42.139> headshot

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
you'll do 150 damage and this headshot

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.470 
you'll do 150 damage and this headshot
mechanic<00:03:42.919> also<00:03:43.069> stacks<00:03:43.519> with<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.239> charge

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
mechanic also stacks with the charge

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.939 
mechanic also stacks with the charge
mechanic<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:44.989> if<00:03:45.049> you<00:03:45.109> have<00:03:45.199> a<00:03:45.260> fully<00:03:45.560> charged

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
mechanic so if you have a fully charged

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:49.390 
mechanic so if you have a fully charged
headshots<00:03:46.430> you'll<00:03:47.000> do<00:03:47.290> 450<00:03:48.290> damage<00:03:48.769> which<00:03:49.370> is

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
headshots you'll do 450 damage which is

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.819 
headshots you'll do 450 damage which is
huge<00:03:50.180> that's<00:03:50.359> enough<00:03:50.629> to<00:03:50.720> kill<00:03:50.900> any<00:03:51.290> enemy<00:03:51.470> in

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
huge that's enough to kill any enemy in

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.369 
huge that's enough to kill any enemy in
the<00:03:51.919> game<00:03:51.949> with<00:03:52.579> one<00:03:52.819> shot<00:03:53.090> so<00:03:53.810> the<00:03:53.930> sniper<00:03:54.079> can

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
the game with one shot so the sniper can

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.199 
the game with one shot so the sniper can
kill<00:03:54.590> absolutely<00:03:55.250> anything<00:03:55.489> he<00:03:55.760> wants<00:03:56.090> as

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
kill absolutely anything he wants as

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.580 
kill absolutely anything he wants as
long<00:03:56.239> as<00:03:56.389> he<00:03:56.540> lands<00:03:56.750> at<00:03:56.870> good<00:03:57.049> enough<00:03:57.079> shots

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
long as he lands at good enough shots

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.470 
long as he lands at good enough shots
and<00:03:58.340> he's<00:03:58.459> really<00:03:58.699> useful<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.150> have<00:03:59.180> on<00:03:59.299> the

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
and he's really useful to have on the

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.720 
and he's really useful to have on the
team<00:03:59.720> if<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.079> enemies<00:04:00.470> are<00:04:00.709> packing<00:04:01.250> lots<00:04:01.549> of

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
team if the enemies are packing lots of

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.839 
team if the enemies are packing lots of
heavies<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:02.959> medics<00:04:03.650> or<00:04:03.919> even<00:04:04.310> soldiers<00:04:04.609> that

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
heavies and medics or even soldiers that

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.220 
heavies and medics or even soldiers that
they<00:04:04.970> can<00:04:05.120> be<00:04:05.209> pretty<00:04:05.419> beefy<00:04:05.599> to<00:04:05.900> but<00:04:06.109> it's

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
they can be pretty beefy to but it's

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.900 
they can be pretty beefy to but it's
mostly<00:04:06.530> heavies<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.010> medics<00:04:07.430> that<00:04:07.579> drive<00:04:07.760> me

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
mostly heavies and medics that drive me

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.789 
mostly heavies and medics that drive me
to<00:04:08.060> switch<00:04:08.269> to<00:04:08.449> sniper<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:09.379> if<00:04:09.470> the<00:04:09.530> enemy<00:04:09.769> team

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
to switch to sniper so if the enemy team

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.280 
to switch to sniper so if the enemy team
have<00:04:10.190> two<00:04:10.579> heavies<00:04:10.879> and<00:04:10.910> one<00:04:11.540> maybe<00:04:11.989> two

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
have two heavies and one maybe two

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.979 
have two heavies and one maybe two
medics<00:04:12.650> which<00:04:12.859> is<00:04:13.239> I'd<00:04:14.239> say<00:04:14.269> one<00:04:14.629> medic<00:04:14.930> is

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
medics which is I'd say one medic is

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.089 
medics which is I'd say one medic is
more<00:04:15.109> plausible<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:15.620> that's<00:04:15.739> enough<00:04:16.010> to

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
more plausible and that's enough to

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.529 
more plausible and that's enough to
cause<00:04:16.250> a<00:04:16.310> big<00:04:16.579> problem<00:04:16.609> for<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.120> enemy<00:04:17.329> team

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
cause a big problem for the enemy team

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.080 
cause a big problem for the enemy team
having<00:04:18.320> just<00:04:18.530> one<00:04:18.950> sniper<00:04:19.340> that's<00:04:19.700> all<00:04:19.940> it

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
having just one sniper that's all it

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.779 
having just one sniper that's all it
takes<00:04:20.299> just<00:04:20.630> to<00:04:20.750> look<00:04:20.989> at<00:04:21.140> a<00:04:21.200> head

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
takes just to look at a head

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.119 
takes just to look at a head
with<00:04:22.210> a<00:04:22.240> fully<00:04:22.539> charged<00:04:22.930> headshot<00:04:23.440> knowing

00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:24.129 
with a fully charged headshot knowing

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:25.770 
with a fully charged headshot knowing
that<00:04:24.250> that's<00:04:24.400> enough<00:04:24.819> to<00:04:24.849> bring<00:04:25.240> down<00:04:25.300> the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
that that's enough to bring down the

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.689 
that that's enough to bring down the
beast<00:04:25.990> like<00:04:26.680> he's<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:26.949> slowest<00:04:27.430> he's<00:04:27.550> the

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
beast like he's the slowest he's the

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.790 
beast like he's the slowest he's the
tallest<00:04:28.000> he's<00:04:28.300> got<00:04:28.449> the<00:04:28.539> biggest<00:04:28.930> head<00:04:29.199> and

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
tallest he's got the biggest head and

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.290 
tallest he's got the biggest head and
when<00:04:29.979> he's<00:04:30.069> revved<00:04:30.280> up<00:04:30.400> as<00:04:30.550> minigun<00:04:30.909> pretty

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
when he's revved up as minigun pretty

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.899 
when he's revved up as minigun pretty
much<00:04:31.449> barely<00:04:32.289> moving<00:04:32.500> it's<00:04:32.830> a<00:04:33.159> really<00:04:33.759> easy

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
much barely moving it's a really easy

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.659 
much barely moving it's a really easy
headshot<00:04:34.780> like<00:04:35.379> one<00:04:35.650> heavy<00:04:35.949> medic<00:04:36.340> pair<00:04:36.520> can

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
headshot like one heavy medic pair can

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.689 
headshot like one heavy medic pair can
cause<00:04:36.879> a<00:04:36.909> huge<00:04:37.599> problem<00:04:38.110> but<00:04:38.620> one<00:04:39.069> sniper<00:04:39.430> is

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
cause a huge problem but one sniper is

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.550 
cause a huge problem but one sniper is
all<00:04:39.819> it<00:04:39.940> takes<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.270> just<00:04:40.449> change<00:04:40.810> that<00:04:40.990> take

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
all it takes to just change that take

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.619 
all it takes to just change that take
the<00:04:41.740> heavier<00:04:42.069> in<00:04:42.310> one<00:04:42.550> shot<00:04:42.879> and<00:04:43.180> then

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:43.629 
the heavier in one shot and then

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:45.059 
the heavier in one shot and then
everyone<00:04:43.960> else<00:04:44.110> can<00:04:44.259> take<00:04:44.409> on<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:44.680> medic<00:04:44.949> or

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.069 
everyone else can take on the medic or

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:46.649 
everyone else can take on the medic or
you<00:04:45.190> can<00:04:45.370> probably<00:04:45.580> kill<00:04:45.879> him<00:04:45.970> yourself<00:04:46.060> if

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:46.659 
you can probably kill him yourself if

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:48.270 
you can probably kill him yourself if
you<00:04:47.050> land<00:04:47.229> a<00:04:47.289> good<00:04:47.440> enough<00:04:47.620> shot<00:04:47.650> hold<00:04:48.039> of<00:04:48.129> it

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
you land a good enough shot hold of it

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.760 
you land a good enough shot hold of it
yeah<00:04:48.639> squirmy<00:04:49.330> bastards<00:04:49.750> like<00:04:50.349> I<00:04:50.440> said<00:04:50.590> I<00:04:50.620> have

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
yeah squirmy bastards like I said I have

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.800 
yeah squirmy bastards like I said I have
a<00:04:50.830> hard<00:04:51.039> time<00:04:51.099> pinning<00:04:51.430> but<00:04:52.150> simply<00:04:52.629> put

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
a hard time pinning but simply put

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.809 
a hard time pinning but simply put
reasons<00:04:53.289> to<00:04:53.409> play<00:04:53.500> sniper<00:04:53.830> if<00:04:54.280> there's<00:04:54.550> lots

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:54.819 
reasons to play sniper if there's lots

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:56.490 
reasons to play sniper if there's lots
of<00:04:54.940> heavies<00:04:55.330> and<00:04:55.360> medics<00:04:55.930> on<00:04:56.050> the<00:04:56.139> other<00:04:56.259> team

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
of heavies and medics on the other team

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.559 
of heavies and medics on the other team
that's<00:04:56.889> kind<00:04:57.280> of<00:04:57.340> what<00:04:57.550> drives<00:04:57.909> me<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.210> do<00:04:58.389> or

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
that's kind of what drives me to do or

00:04:58.569 --> 00:04:59.850 
that's kind of what drives me to do or
if<00:04:58.659> there's<00:04:58.840> a<00:04:58.900> lot<00:04:59.050> of<00:04:59.080> Snipes<00:04:59.470> on<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.740> other

if there's a lot of Snipes on the other

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.589 
if there's a lot of Snipes on the other
team<00:05:00.099> that<00:05:00.550> you<00:05:00.610> need<00:05:00.759> to<00:05:00.819> count<00:05:00.970> a<00:05:01.150> snipe<00:05:01.360> or

team that you need to count a snipe or

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:03.600 
team that you need to count a snipe or
another<00:05:02.560> one<00:05:02.680> it's<00:05:02.800> actually<00:05:02.889> engineers

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
another one it's actually engineers

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.450 
another one it's actually engineers
because<00:05:04.090> a<00:05:04.389> lot<00:05:04.930> of<00:05:05.020> people<00:05:05.259> if<00:05:06.009> they<00:05:06.220> want<00:05:06.400> to

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
because a lot of people if they want to

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.010 
because a lot of people if they want to
take<00:05:06.610> out<00:05:06.819> a<00:05:06.849> sentry<00:05:07.330> gun<00:05:07.479> they<00:05:07.569> have<00:05:07.720> to<00:05:07.810> get

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
take out a sentry gun they have to get

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.200 
take out a sentry gun they have to get
to<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.199> engineer<00:05:08.650> first<00:05:09.009> but<00:05:09.280> they<00:05:09.370> can't<00:05:09.639> get

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
to the engineer first but they can't get

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.430 
to the engineer first but they can't get
close<00:05:10.449> enough<00:05:10.479> to<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:10.780> engineer<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.199> kill<00:05:11.349> him

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
close enough to the engineer to kill him

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.839 
close enough to the engineer to kill him
without<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.620> sentry<00:05:12.039> gun<00:05:12.069> kill<00:05:12.460> them<00:05:12.639> first

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
without the sentry gun kill them first

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:14.670 
without the sentry gun kill them first
but<00:05:13.509> if<00:05:13.630> you're<00:05:13.750> a<00:05:13.780> sniper<00:05:14.050> you<00:05:14.319> can<00:05:14.440> stay<00:05:14.650> out

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
but if you're a sniper you can stay out

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.830 
but if you're a sniper you can stay out
the<00:05:14.919> sentries<00:05:15.340> range<00:05:15.580> and<00:05:15.819> you<00:05:16.330> can<00:05:16.479> work<00:05:16.659> the

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
the sentries range and you can work the

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.420 
the sentries range and you can work the
angle<00:05:17.169> for<00:05:17.349> an<00:05:17.409> easy<00:05:17.620> headshot<00:05:18.190> on<00:05:18.310> an

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
angle for an easy headshot on an

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.070 
angle for an easy headshot on an
engineer<00:05:18.819> who<00:05:19.000> when<00:05:19.270> he's<00:05:19.389> behind<00:05:19.539> this<00:05:19.870> big

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
engineer who when he's behind this big

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.110 
engineer who when he's behind this big
century<00:05:20.590> they're<00:05:21.340> usually<00:05:21.490> standing

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
century they're usually standing

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.879 
century they're usually standing
completely<00:05:22.330> still<00:05:22.750> just<00:05:23.229> whacking<00:05:23.530> it<00:05:23.740> with<00:05:23.860> a

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
completely still just whacking it with a

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:24.240 
completely still just whacking it with a
wrench

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
wrench

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.920 
wrench
and<00:05:24.789> when<00:05:24.940> he's<00:05:25.060> down<00:05:25.270> you<00:05:25.419> can<00:05:25.539> also<00:05:25.659> deal

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
and when he's down you can also deal

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.420 
and when he's down you can also deal
pretty<00:05:26.169> heavy<00:05:26.440> damage<00:05:26.770> to<00:05:26.889> the<00:05:26.979> Sentry<00:05:27.310> than

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
pretty heavy damage to the Sentry than

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.180 
pretty heavy damage to the Sentry than
yourself<00:05:27.849> with<00:05:28.449> your<00:05:28.569> sniper<00:05:28.810> rifle<00:05:29.009> and<00:05:30.009> say

yourself with your sniper rifle and say

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.800 
yourself with your sniper rifle and say
it's<00:05:30.310> about<00:05:30.430> it<00:05:30.729> but<00:05:30.880> reasons<00:05:31.210> not<00:05:31.449> to<00:05:31.509> play

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
it's about it but reasons not to play

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.800 
it's about it but reasons not to play
sniper<00:05:32.080> is<00:05:32.949> if<00:05:33.310> the<00:05:33.460> enemy<00:05:33.729> team<00:05:33.759> are<00:05:34.300> mostly

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
sniper is if the enemy team are mostly

sniper is if the enemy team are mostly
comprised<00:05:35.349> of<00:05:35.819> low<00:05:36.819> health<00:05:37.150> enemies<00:05:37.330> who<00:05:38.050> are

comprised of low health enemies who are

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.100 
comprised of low health enemies who are
difficult<00:05:38.590> to<00:05:38.919> shoot<00:05:39.190> who<00:05:40.060> pose<00:05:40.779> a<00:05:40.810> huge

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
difficult to shoot who pose a huge

difficult to shoot who pose a huge
threat<00:05:41.199> to<00:05:41.650> you<00:05:41.830> and<00:05:42.130> which<00:05:42.849> is<00:05:43.000> simply<00:05:43.270> easy

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
threat to you and which is simply easy

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:44.610 
threat to you and which is simply easy
to<00:05:43.630> kill<00:05:43.840> it<00:05:44.050> if<00:05:44.110> you<00:05:44.199> plays<00:05:44.409> a<00:05:44.440> different

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
to kill it if you plays a different

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.740 
to kill it if you plays a different
class<00:05:45.009> like<00:05:45.310> if<00:05:45.880> there's<00:05:46.090> a<00:05:46.120> lot<00:05:46.300> of<00:05:46.389> scouts

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
class like if there's a lot of scouts

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.050 
class like if there's a lot of scouts
and<00:05:47.020> spies<00:05:47.440> on<00:05:47.680> the<00:05:47.770> other<00:05:47.889> team<00:05:48.130> there's<00:05:48.880> just

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
and spies on the other team there's just

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.089 
and spies on the other team there's just
very<00:05:49.150> little<00:05:49.509> reason<00:05:50.110> to<00:05:50.380> be<00:05:50.469> playing<00:05:50.740> sniper

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
very little reason to be playing sniper

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.519 
very little reason to be playing sniper
at<00:05:51.310> that<00:05:51.430> point<00:05:51.699> because<00:05:51.849> they<00:05:52.659> will<00:05:52.840> destroy

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:53.529 
at that point because they will destroy

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:55.499 
at that point because they will destroy
you<00:05:53.590> and<00:05:54.009> you<00:05:54.550> would<00:05:54.669> deal<00:05:54.819> with<00:05:54.849> them<00:05:55.090> so<00:05:55.360> much

much the end of the game I was quite

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.159 
much the end of the game I was quite
taken<00:06:40.040> aback<00:06:40.250> to<00:06:40.400> see<00:06:40.639> I<00:06:40.669> had<00:06:40.850> 40<00:06:41.210> kills<00:06:41.450> where

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.169 
taken aback to see I had 40 kills where

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:45.220 
taken aback to see I had 40 kills where
37<00:06:43.130> of<00:06:43.190> them<00:06:43.310> were<00:06:43.430> headshots<00:06:43.970> in<00:06:44.780> this<00:06:45.050> one

37 of them were headshots in this one

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.390 
37 of them were headshots in this one
round<00:06:45.440> of<00:06:45.530> Thunder<00:06:45.830> Mountain<00:06:45.950> with<00:06:46.280> the

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
round of Thunder Mountain with the

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.750 
round of Thunder Mountain with the
machina<00:06:46.730> so<00:06:47.830> happy<00:06:48.830> days<00:06:49.130> I<00:06:49.400> was<00:06:49.520> pretty

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:49.760 
machina so happy days I was pretty

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.210 
machina so happy days I was pretty
pleased<00:06:50.090> with<00:06:50.270> that<00:06:50.300> needless<00:06:50.990> to<00:06:51.110> say<00:06:51.139> and<00:06:51.889> it

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.220 
pleased with that needless to say and it

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.590 
pleased with that needless to say and it
wasn't<00:06:52.340> quite<00:06:52.520> the<00:06:52.700> play-by-play<00:06:52.880> commentary

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:53.600 
wasn't quite the play-by-play commentary

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.730 
wasn't quite the play-by-play commentary
I<00:06:53.690> thought<00:06:53.960> it<00:06:54.050> was<00:06:54.139> gonna<00:06:54.230> turn<00:06:54.440> out<00:06:54.560> to<00:06:54.710> be

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
I thought it was gonna turn out to be

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.050 
I thought it was gonna turn out to be
here<00:06:55.010> after<00:06:55.220> the<00:06:55.310> first<00:06:55.490> couple<00:06:55.850> of<00:06:55.880> minutes

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
here after the first couple of minutes

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.180 
here after the first couple of minutes
but<00:06:56.870> either<00:06:57.139> way<00:06:57.350> if<00:06:57.470> you<00:06:57.590> want<00:06:57.740> some<00:06:57.889> familiar

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
but either way if you want some familiar

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.740 
but either way if you want some familiar
with<00:06:58.310> Team<00:06:58.460> Fortress<00:06:58.669> 2<00:06:58.940> sniping<00:06:59.389> before

00:06:59.740 --> 00:06:59.750 
with Team Fortress 2 sniping before

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.540 
with Team Fortress 2 sniping before
hopefully<00:07:00.470> now<00:07:00.620> it<00:07:00.740> makes<00:07:00.889> more<00:07:01.040> sense<00:07:01.100> to<00:07:01.400> you

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.550 
hopefully now it makes more sense to you

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.730 
hopefully now it makes more sense to you
and<00:07:01.730> I<00:07:02.030> hope<00:07:02.210> you<00:07:02.330> enjoyed<00:07:02.660> thank<00:07:03.530> you<00:07:03.590> for
