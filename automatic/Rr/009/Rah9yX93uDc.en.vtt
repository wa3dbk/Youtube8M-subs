hitch on the 99 4runner I don't have my

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.839 
hitch on the 99 4runner I don't have my
light<00:00:09.370> kit<00:00:09.700> in<00:00:09.970> yet<00:00:10.240> orders<00:00:10.959> it<00:00:11.080> off<00:00:11.200> eBay

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
light kit in yet orders it off eBay

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.550 
light kit in yet orders it off eBay
ordered<00:00:12.849> the<00:00:13.059> hitch<00:00:13.570> from<00:00:13.780> advanced<00:00:14.320> auto<00:00:15.390> and

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
ordered the hitch from advanced auto and

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.580 
ordered the hitch from advanced auto and
we're<00:00:17.560> going<00:00:17.680> to<00:00:17.770> put<00:00:17.980> the<00:00:19.710> hitch<00:00:20.710> in<00:00:22.590> let's

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
we're going to put the hitch in let's

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.660 
we're going to put the hitch in let's
see<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:26.230> looks<00:00:26.620> like<00:00:26.890> we<00:00:27.070> may<00:00:27.190> have<00:00:27.220> to<00:00:27.400> drill

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
see it looks like we may have to drill

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:35.290 
see it looks like we may have to drill
one<00:00:27.820> hole<00:00:29.760> so

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:43.319 

let's<00:00:35.870> take<00:00:36.260> a<00:00:36.290> look

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.149 

it<00:00:43.960> looks<00:00:44.199> like<00:00:44.350> we<00:00:44.499> got<00:00:44.649> to<00:00:44.739> drill<00:00:44.920> one<00:00:45.100> hole

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
it looks like we got to drill one hole

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.750 
it looks like we got to drill one hole
in<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.579> frame<00:00:46.589> mmm

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
in the frame mmm

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.009 
in the frame mmm
no<00:00:48.760> right<00:00:49.589> well<00:00:50.589> I<00:00:50.829> don't<00:00:51.399> know<00:00:51.729> struction<00:00:52.719> say

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
no right well I don't know struction say

00:00:53.019 --> 00:01:04.920 
no right well I don't know struction say
that<00:00:54.269> see<00:00:55.269> what<00:00:55.390> they<00:00:55.510> say

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.890 

now<00:01:05.470> it<00:01:05.590> looks<00:01:05.770> like<00:01:05.950> it<00:01:06.160> I<00:01:06.400> don't<00:01:07.270> like<00:01:07.690> that

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
now it looks like it I don't like that

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.870 
now it looks like it I don't like that
but<00:01:08.230> this<00:01:09.010> it'll<00:01:09.220> work<00:01:11.400> extends<00:01:12.400> past<00:01:12.640> the

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
but this it'll work extends past the

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.660 
but this it'll work extends past the
frame<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.790> piece

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.380 

holds<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:22.220> but<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.400> guess<00:01:23.640> that's<00:01:23.730> good

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
holds it on but I guess that's good

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.570 
holds it on but I guess that's good
thick<00:01:24.690> metal<00:01:25.520> I'm<00:01:26.520> crazy<00:01:26.820> about<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.180> but<00:01:28.580> they

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
thick metal I'm crazy about it but they

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.700 
thick metal I'm crazy about it but they
rate<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.420> I'm<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.080> be<00:01:31.170> overloading

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
rate it so I'm going to be overloading

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.200 
rate it so I'm going to be overloading
this<00:01:31.860> thing<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.370> long<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:32.580> it's<00:01:32.820> good<00:01:33.030> for

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
this thing so as long as it's good for

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.350 
this thing so as long as it's good for
what<00:01:33.330> it's<00:01:33.450> rated<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:34.700> anyway<00:01:35.700> that's<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
what it's rated for anyway that's the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.550 
what it's rated for anyway that's the
instructions<00:01:37.080> gives<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:39.140> torque<00:01:40.140> specs

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
instructions gives you the torque specs

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.030 
instructions gives you the torque specs
so<00:01:40.979> I'll<00:01:41.810> do<00:01:42.810> everything<00:01:43.080> with<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> impact

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
so I'll do everything with the impact

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.590 
so I'll do everything with the impact
wrench<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.610> then<00:01:44.670> go<00:01:44.850> back<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.330> torque

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
wrench and then go back to the torque

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.300 
wrench and then go back to the torque
wrench<00:01:45.870> and<00:01:46.170> make<00:01:46.440> a<00:01:46.620> wreath<00:01:46.860> make<00:01:47.160> sure

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
wrench and make a wreath make sure

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.030 
wrench and make a wreath make sure
everything's<00:01:47.640> torqued<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.650> first<00:01:52.890> thing

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
everything's torqued so the first thing

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.940 
everything's torqued so the first thing
we<00:01:53.130> got<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.280> do<00:01:53.540> is<00:01:54.540> get<00:01:55.290> these<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.820> tow<00:01:56.820> hook

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
we got to do is get these a tow hook

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.180 
we got to do is get these a tow hook
parts<00:01:58.950> off<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.460> we'll<00:01:59.610> take<00:01:59.970> and<00:02:00.950> undo<00:02:01.950> those

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
parts off so we'll take and undo those

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.640 
parts off so we'll take and undo those
and<00:02:02.640> then<00:02:03.330> we'll<00:02:03.450> need<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.810> put<00:02:04.050> that<00:02:04.200> piece<00:02:04.470> in

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
and then we'll need to put that piece in

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.800 
and then we'll need to put that piece in
the<00:02:04.740> frame<00:02:05.040> I'm<00:02:05.490> hoping<00:02:06.000> it'll<00:02:06.210> fit<00:02:06.479> without

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
the frame I'm hoping it'll fit without

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.060 
the frame I'm hoping it'll fit without
taking<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.530> bumper<00:02:07.920> off<00:02:08.070> I<00:02:08.399> think<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.239> will<00:02:09.390> so

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
taking the bumper off I think it will so

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.330 
taking the bumper off I think it will so
get<00:02:11.070> those<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.520> there<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:12.209> then<00:02:13.220> actually<00:02:14.220> be

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
get those in there and then actually be

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.650 
get those in there and then actually be
pretty<00:02:14.550> easy<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.940> mean<00:02:16.340> should<00:02:17.340> just<00:02:17.660> bolt

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
pretty easy I mean should just bolt

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.610 
pretty easy I mean should just bolt
right<00:02:18.810> up<00:02:19.550> so

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.130 

you<00:02:25.220> all<00:02:25.489> yeah<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.360> don't<00:02:26.480> know<00:02:26.690> what<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:26.989> can

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
you all yeah I don't know what you can

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:41.470 
you all yeah I don't know what you can
see<00:02:27.409> I<00:02:34.180> get<00:02:35.180> this<00:02:35.450> spot<00:02:40.090> yeah<00:02:41.090> I<00:02:41.120> don't<00:02:41.269> know

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
see I get this spot yeah I don't know

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.220 
see I get this spot yeah I don't know
how<00:02:41.510> that's<00:02:41.959> going<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.230> work<00:02:43.000> so<00:02:44.000> maybe<00:02:44.360> you

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
how that's going to work so maybe you

00:02:45.230 --> 00:03:16.930 
how that's going to work so maybe you
know<00:02:45.349> what<00:02:47.590> we'll<00:02:48.590> take<00:02:48.739> one<00:02:48.980> off

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:31.810 

the<00:03:17.940> impact<00:03:18.300> just<00:03:18.360> makes<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.840> stuff<00:03:19.140> go<00:03:19.290> quick

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.570 

throw<00:03:32.820> some<00:03:33.530> paint<00:03:34.530> right<00:03:34.950> there<00:03:35.190> before<00:03:35.490> we

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
throw some paint right there before we

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.190 
throw some paint right there before we
put<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.850> trailer<00:03:36.000> at<00:03:36.210> John<00:03:36.420> ah<00:03:38.750> found<00:03:39.750> rust

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
put the trailer at John ah found rust

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.030 
put the trailer at John ah found rust
I'll<00:03:40.680> get<00:03:40.830> that<00:03:41.070> goodness<00:03:42.560> that's<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.740> spot<00:03:44.010> I

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
I'll get that goodness that's a spot I

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.710 
I'll get that goodness that's a spot I
guess<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.520> guess<00:03:44.700> they<00:03:44.820> put<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.180> bracket<00:03:45.600> on

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
guess I guess they put that bracket on

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.570 
guess I guess they put that bracket on
then<00:03:45.930> they<00:03:46.050> paint<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.470> frame<00:03:46.710> because

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
then they paint the frame because

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.110 
then they paint the frame because
there's<00:03:47.760> no<00:03:47.880> paint<00:03:48.150> on<00:03:48.240> this<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:50.120> would

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
there's no paint on this so I would

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.850 
there's no paint on this so I would
imagine<00:03:51.270> a<00:03:51.600> northern<00:03:51.960> vehicle<00:03:52.410> this<00:03:52.560> would<00:03:52.710> be

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
imagine a northern vehicle this would be

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.020 
imagine a northern vehicle this would be
a<00:03:52.890> very<00:03:53.280> rust-prone<00:03:53.880> spot<00:03:54.920> so<00:03:55.920> we<00:03:56.490> will<00:03:56.730> throw

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
a very rust-prone spot so we will throw

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.460 
a very rust-prone spot so we will throw
some<00:03:57.210> paint<00:03:57.420> on<00:03:57.630> there<00:03:57.810> now

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
some paint on there now

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.040 
some paint on there now
get<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:59.160> piece<00:03:59.910> slipped<00:04:00.330> up<00:04:00.480> in<00:04:00.630> there<00:04:00.870> and

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
get that piece slipped up in there and

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.310 
get that piece slipped up in there and
we'll<00:04:01.200> start<00:04:01.910> mounting<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.000> up<00:04:05.630> so<00:04:06.630> I've<00:04:07.140> got

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
we'll start mounting it up so I've got

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.550 
we'll start mounting it up so I've got
that<00:04:07.440> piece<00:04:07.680> on<00:04:07.890> through<00:04:08.610> some<00:04:09.410> paint<00:04:10.410> was

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
that piece on through some paint was

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.120 
that piece on through some paint was
brown<00:04:10.890> but<00:04:12.620> doesn't<00:04:13.620> really<00:04:13.740> matter<00:04:13.980> the

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
brown but doesn't really matter the

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.539 
brown but doesn't really matter the
color<00:04:15.020> some<00:04:16.020> of<00:04:16.140> that<00:04:16.200> rusty<00:04:16.980> metal<00:04:17.160> primer

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
color some of that rusty metal primer

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.270 
color some of that rusty metal primer
stuff<00:04:18.320> it'll<00:04:19.320> work<00:04:19.500> good<00:04:21.770> so<00:04:22.770> get<00:04:22.890> this<00:04:23.040> piece

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
stuff it'll work good so get this piece

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.090 
stuff it'll work good so get this piece
in<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.990> we're<00:04:24.990> gonna<00:04:25.490> lift<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:27.500> hitch<00:04:28.500> up<00:04:28.770> and

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
in and we're gonna lift the hitch up and

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.760 
in and we're gonna lift the hitch up and
I<00:04:29.250> won't<00:04:29.460> be<00:04:29.670> able<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.910> video<00:04:30.660> it<00:04:30.870> but<00:04:31.170> just

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
I won't be able to video it but just

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.010 
I won't be able to video it but just
lift<00:04:32.070> it<00:04:32.190> up<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.570> these<00:04:33.570> have<00:04:34.430> welded<00:04:35.430> on<00:04:35.810> nuts

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
lift it up and these have welded on nuts

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.290 
lift it up and these have welded on nuts
so<00:04:37.980> we'll<00:04:38.970> start<00:04:40.400> one<00:04:41.400> of<00:04:41.490> these<00:04:41.580> bolts<00:04:42.030> in

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
so we'll start one of these bolts in

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.120 
so we'll start one of these bolts in
each<00:04:42.480> side<00:04:42.810> one<00:04:43.140> of<00:04:43.230> the<00:04:43.320> original<00:04:43.770> that<00:04:44.070> was

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
each side one of the original that was

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.650 
each side one of the original that was
on<00:04:44.370> the

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
on the

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.770 
on the
so<00:04:46.200> hook<00:04:46.440> one<00:04:47.070> of<00:04:47.190> these<00:04:47.750> start<00:04:48.750> those<00:04:48.960> in<00:04:49.200> I

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
so hook one of these start those in I

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.710 
so hook one of these start those in I
spray<00:04:51.780> em<00:04:51.930> with<00:04:52.110> some<00:04:53.240> silicone<00:04:54.240> or<00:04:54.420> something

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
spray em with some silicone or something

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.000 
spray em with some silicone or something
before<00:04:54.870> put<00:04:55.140> them<00:04:55.260> in<00:04:55.380> there<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:55.560> make<00:04:55.830> sure

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
before put them in there and make sure

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.010 
before put them in there and make sure
they<00:04:56.690> thread<00:04:57.690> up<00:04:57.840> nicely<00:04:58.080> but<00:04:59.720> we'll<00:05:00.720> do<00:05:00.840> that

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
they thread up nicely but we'll do that

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.220 
they thread up nicely but we'll do that
and<00:05:01.290> then<00:05:02.190> we<00:05:02.400> will<00:05:02.550> we'll<00:05:03.420> leave<00:05:03.600> those<00:05:03.870> loose

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
and then we will we'll leave those loose

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.810 
and then we will we'll leave those loose
and<00:05:04.620> we'll<00:05:04.680> start<00:05:04.980> tightening<00:05:05.310> all<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.670> other

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
and we'll start tightening all the other

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.940 
and we'll start tightening all the other
ones<00:05:06.060> make<00:05:06.870> sure<00:05:06.900> we<00:05:07.170> all<00:05:07.290> get<00:05:07.470> them<00:05:07.560> started

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
ones make sure we all get them started

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.470 
ones make sure we all get them started
then<00:05:08.400> we'll<00:05:08.580> just<00:05:08.760> start<00:05:08.970> tighten<00:05:09.270> them<00:05:09.360> up

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
then we'll just start tighten them up

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.080 
then we'll just start tighten them up
and<00:05:09.720> then<00:05:09.900> we'll<00:05:10.110> torque<00:05:10.560> them<00:05:10.680> down<00:05:11.090> pretty

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
and then we'll torque them down pretty

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.020 
and then we'll torque them down pretty
easy<00:05:13.220> something<00:05:14.220> worth<00:05:14.370> noting<00:05:14.670> on<00:05:14.880> this

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
easy something worth noting on this

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.510 
easy something worth noting on this
hitch<00:05:15.240> it's<00:05:15.510> a<00:05:15.600> curt<00:05:15.840> hitch<00:05:16.080> and<00:05:16.460> they<00:05:17.460> were

it's got this bar that goes across like
this<00:06:10.250> but<00:06:11.060> then<00:06:11.180> it's<00:06:11.300> also<00:06:11.800> this<00:06:13.090> the

receiver part is a not mounted on the

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
same level as this it's managed under it

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.670 
same level as this it's managed under it
which<00:06:20.180> could<00:06:20.690> be<00:06:20.810> stronger<00:06:21.380> but<00:06:23.440> you<00:06:24.440> know<00:06:24.560> it

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
which could be stronger but you know it

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.310 
which could be stronger but you know it
makes<00:06:24.860> it<00:06:25.010> low<00:06:25.520> and<00:06:26.120> this<00:06:26.330> thing<00:06:26.570> does<00:06:26.810> even

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
makes it low and this thing does even

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.830 
makes it low and this thing does even
sit<00:06:27.610> the<00:06:28.610> spare<00:06:28.820> tire<00:06:29.030> sits<00:06:29.360> lower<00:06:29.570> than<00:06:29.780> the

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
sit the spare tire sits lower than the

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.170 
gas tank skid plate

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:48.470 
gas tank skid plate
it<00:07:40.290> was<00:07:40.470> hard<00:07:40.710> this<00:07:41.430> one<00:07:41.610> is<00:07:41.700> easy<00:07:42.530> so<00:07:47.330> just<00:07:48.330> get

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:48.480 
it was hard this one is easy so just get

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.400 
it was hard this one is easy so just get
away<00:07:48.540> from<00:07:48.690> a<00:07:49.050> white<00:07:49.650> light<00:07:50.370> wiring<00:07:51.150> kit<00:07:51.410> and

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:52.410 
away from a white light wiring kit and

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:55.780 
away from a white light wiring kit and
then<00:07:53.070> we<00:07:53.340> will<00:07:53.750> have<00:07:54.750> trailer<00:07:55.050> lights

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:55.790 
then we will have trailer lights

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.240 
then we will have trailer lights
actually<00:07:56.790> kind<00:07:56.940> of<00:07:57.000> mix<00:07:57.120> a<00:07:57.210> nice<00:07:57.360> step<00:07:58.130> to<00:07:59.130> get

00:07:59.240 --> 00:07:59.250 
actually kind of mix a nice step to get

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.170 
actually kind of mix a nice step to get
to<00:07:59.280> the<00:07:59.460> roof<00:07:59.610> rack<00:08:01.160> so<00:08:02.160> there<00:08:02.790> we<00:08:02.880> go

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.180 
to the roof rack so there we go

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.990 
to the roof rack so there we go
easy
