summer is switching things up a little

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.390 
summer is switching things up a little
bit<00:00:06.180> in<00:00:07.049> terms<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.379> power<00:00:07.620> feeding<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.160> dogs

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
bit in terms of power feeding the dogs

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.270 
bit in terms of power feeding the dogs
we<00:00:11.990> typically<00:00:12.990> used<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.380> just<00:00:13.620> keep<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:14.009> water

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
we typically used to just keep a water

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.279 
we typically used to just keep a water
can't<00:00:14.639> full<00:00:15.000> all<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.210> time<00:00:15.389> on<00:00:15.780> their<00:00:15.929> house

can't full all the time on their house

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.340 
can't full all the time on their house
in<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.710> summer<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.869> then<00:00:18.869> feed<00:00:19.650> him<00:00:21.170> once<00:00:22.170> at

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
in the summer and then feed him once at

in the summer and then feed him once at
night<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:23.160> would<00:00:23.310> just<00:00:23.460> pour<00:00:24.269> were<00:00:24.390> they

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
night we would just pour were they

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.599 
night we would just pour were they
giving<00:00:24.779> them<00:00:24.900> on<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.019> kibble<00:00:25.439> we<00:00:25.619> were<00:00:25.769> giving

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
giving them on a kibble we were giving

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.380 
giving them on a kibble we were giving
them<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.300> they<00:00:27.449> required<00:00:27.869> um<00:00:28.849> on<00:00:29.849> top<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
them that they required um on top of the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.410 
them that they required um on top of the
water<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:32.420> whoops<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:35.030> they<00:00:36.030> would<00:00:36.180> drink

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
water can whoops and they would drink

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.819 
water can whoops and they would drink
the<00:00:36.540> whole<00:00:36.719> thing<00:00:36.750> down<00:00:37.200> then<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.500> come<00:00:37.800> back

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
the whole thing down then I come back

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.850 
the whole thing down then I come back
around<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.399> filter<00:00:38.610> water<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.270> again<00:00:39.649> and<00:00:40.649> it

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
around the filter water can again and it

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.799 
around the filter water can again and it
it<00:00:41.610> seems<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:43.670> then<00:00:44.670> during<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.149> day<00:00:45.420> they

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
it seems like then during the day they

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.010 
it seems like then during the day they
would<00:00:45.930> never<00:00:46.200> drink<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.680> water<00:00:47.719> so<00:00:49.760> I<00:00:51.020> don't

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
would never drink in water so I don't

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.360 
would never drink in water so I don't
know<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.199> didn't<00:00:52.620> seem<00:00:52.829> right<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.100> they

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
know it just didn't seem right that they

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.010 
know it just didn't seem right that they
weren't<00:00:53.550> drinking<00:00:54.030> their<00:00:54.300> water<00:00:54.329> during<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
weren't drinking their water during the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
weren't drinking their water during the
day<00:00:55.170> unless<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.559> was<00:00:55.680> really<00:00:56.250> really<00:00:56.430> really

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
day unless it was really really really

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.650 
day unless it was really really really
hot<00:00:57.090> but<00:00:57.989> switched<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:59.270> just<00:01:00.270> kind<00:01:00.600> of

one of these labels / / CDs hardly cut

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.030 
one of these labels / / CDs hardly cut
way<00:02:20.530> down<00:02:20.560> on<00:02:20.829> the<00:02:21.040> stool<00:02:21.670> volume<00:02:22.299> and<00:02:23.040> they

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
way down on the stool volume and they

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.229 
way down on the stool volume and they
hardly<00:02:25.620> poop<00:02:26.620> at<00:02:26.769> all<00:02:26.920> I've<00:02:27.849> only<00:02:27.970> been

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
hardly poop at all I've only been

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.580 
hardly poop at all I've only been
scooping<00:02:28.989> it<00:02:29.140> up<00:02:29.290> today<00:02:31.019> hardly<00:02:32.019> nothing<00:02:32.200> in

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
scooping it up today hardly nothing in

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.270 
scooping it up today hardly nothing in
there<00:02:32.799> after<00:02:33.600> after

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.570 

one<00:02:37.880> day<00:02:38.319> so<00:02:39.319> I<00:02:39.350> think<00:02:39.560> it's<00:02:39.800> more<00:02:39.890> efficient

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
one day so I think it's more efficient

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.840 
one day so I think it's more efficient
spreading<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.330> feelings<00:02:41.750> out<00:02:42.520> twice<00:02:43.520> like

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
spreading the feelings out twice like

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.630 
spreading the feelings out twice like
that<00:02:44.620> that's<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.860> point<00:02:46.430> I'm<00:02:46.580> trying<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.880> make

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
that that's the point I'm trying to make

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.550 
that that's the point I'm trying to make
and<00:02:49.640> then<00:02:50.390> they<00:02:50.630> get<00:02:50.840> there<00:02:51.650> taking<00:02:52.340> ingesting

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
and then they get there taking ingesting

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.130 
and then they get there taking ingesting
not<00:02:54.560> as<00:02:54.770> much<00:02:54.980> water<00:02:55.310> as<00:02:55.550> they<00:02:56.420> do<00:02:56.660> at<00:02:56.900> night

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
not as much water as they do at night

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.470 
not as much water as they do at night
but<00:02:57.440> there<00:02:57.709> it's<00:02:57.980> spread<00:02:58.310> out<00:02:58.340> over<00:02:58.489> over<00:02:59.450> a

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
but there it's spread out over over a

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.210 
but there it's spread out over over a
24-hour<00:03:00.050> period<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:00.770> know<00:03:00.800> I<00:03:00.890> feed<00:03:01.190> them

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
24-hour period you know I feed them

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.990 
24-hour period you know I feed them
about<00:03:01.580> every<00:03:01.850> 12<00:03:02.150> hours<00:03:02.330> is<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.870> way<00:03:02.959> it<00:03:03.080> works

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
about every 12 hours is the way it works

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.979 
about every 12 hours is the way it works
so<00:03:05.000> I<00:03:05.739> think<00:03:06.739> they're<00:03:07.040> staying<00:03:07.989> better

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
so I think they're staying better

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.500 
so I think they're staying better
hydrated<00:03:09.800> throughout<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.610> 24-hour<00:03:11.360> period

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
hydrated throughout a 24-hour period

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.360 
hydrated throughout a 24-hour period
doing<00:03:12.230> it<00:03:12.350> this<00:03:12.530> way<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:15.470> they<00:03:15.800> dig<00:03:16.070> it<00:03:16.190> they

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
doing it this way and they dig it they

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.180 
doing it this way and they dig it they
they<00:03:16.700> don't<00:03:16.910> they<00:03:17.750> eat<00:03:17.780> everything<00:03:18.190> there

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
they don't they eat everything there

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.310 
they don't they eat everything there
turkana<00:03:19.940> it's<00:03:20.209> I<00:03:20.600> think<00:03:20.780> it<00:03:20.870> kind<00:03:21.140> of<00:03:21.170> keeps

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
turkana it's I think it kind of keeps

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.370 
turkana it's I think it kind of keeps
them<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.650> little<00:03:21.830> bit<00:03:22.069> hungrier<00:03:22.550> and<00:03:23.380> they

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
them a little bit hungrier and they

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.770 
them a little bit hungrier and they
don't<00:03:24.590> leave<00:03:24.769> any<00:03:25.069> food<00:03:25.400> at<00:03:25.700> all<00:03:25.850> there<00:03:26.660> was

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
don't leave any food at all there was

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.380 
don't leave any food at all there was
sometimes<00:03:27.610> there's<00:03:28.610> alway<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.150> we<00:03:29.269> would

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
sometimes there's alway that we would

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.830 
sometimes there's alway that we would
feed<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:29.840> they<00:03:30.800> would<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.330> you<00:03:32.330> know<00:03:32.450> some<00:03:32.810> of

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
feed that they would a you know some of

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.449 
feed that they would a you know some of
the<00:03:32.959> pickier<00:03:33.350> ones<00:03:33.650> wouldn't<00:03:33.920> finish<00:03:34.160> all

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
the pickier ones wouldn't finish all

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.070 
the pickier ones wouldn't finish all
their<00:03:34.640> food<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:34.940> it<00:03:35.209> would<00:03:35.330> just<00:03:35.360> sort<00:03:35.660> of<00:03:35.810> sit

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
their food and it would just sort of sit

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.640 
their food and it would just sort of sit
sit<00:03:36.860> in<00:03:37.010> there<00:03:37.250> and<00:03:37.840> get<00:03:38.840> gross<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.470> then<00:03:39.620> I

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
sit in there and get gross and then I

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.199 
sit in there and get gross and then I
have<00:03:39.920> to<00:03:40.040> tip<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.280> out<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:40.700> on<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:40.880> Ravens

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
have to tip it out and on the Ravens

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.400 
have to tip it out and on the Ravens
would<00:03:41.390> eat<00:03:41.540> it<00:03:43.299> you<00:03:44.299> know<00:03:44.390> just<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.930> very

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
would eat it you know just a very

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.460 
would eat it you know just a very
pickiest<00:03:45.980> dogs<00:03:46.850> you<00:03:47.420> know<00:03:47.570> we<00:03:47.720> do<00:03:47.900> that<00:03:48.110> but

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
pickiest dogs you know we do that but

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.830 
pickiest dogs you know we do that but
this<00:03:49.340> this<00:03:49.730> way<00:03:49.940> I<00:03:49.970> think<00:03:50.390> it<00:03:50.480> keeps<00:03:50.630> him<00:03:50.810> a

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
this this way I think it keeps him a

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.180 
this this way I think it keeps him a
little<00:03:51.079> bit<00:03:51.170> hungry<00:03:51.410> I<00:03:51.530> mean<00:03:51.799> their<00:03:51.950> weights

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
little bit hungry I mean their weights

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.550 
little bit hungry I mean their weights
are<00:03:52.519> great<00:03:53.329> it's<00:03:53.600> holding<00:03:53.989> their<00:03:54.170> weight<00:03:54.320> just

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
are great it's holding their weight just

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.199 
are great it's holding their weight just
fine<00:03:54.890> but<00:03:55.100> they're<00:03:55.280> eating<00:03:55.640> better<00:03:55.880> and<00:03:56.000> i

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
fine but they're eating better and i

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.550 
fine but they're eating better and i
like<00:03:56.420> that<00:03:56.450> i<00:03:56.690> don't<00:03:56.810> like<00:03:57.049> wasting<00:03:57.500> food

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
like that i don't like wasting food

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.009 
like that i don't like wasting food
obviously<00:03:58.040> i<00:03:58.730> like<00:03:59.360> training<00:03:59.660> them<00:03:59.870> to<00:03:59.900> eat

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
obviously i like training them to eat

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.000 
obviously i like training them to eat
everything<00:04:00.790> so<00:04:01.790> it's<00:04:02.000> I<00:04:02.470> think<00:04:03.470> it's<00:04:03.739> working

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
everything so it's I think it's working

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.220 
everything so it's I think it's working
on<00:04:04.310> a<00:04:04.340> little<00:04:04.610> better<00:04:04.790> to<00:04:05.150> do<00:04:05.269> it<00:04:05.420> this<00:04:05.570> way<00:04:05.810> and

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
on a little better to do it this way and

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.229 
on a little better to do it this way and
I'm<00:04:07.220> not<00:04:07.400> sure<00:04:07.670> how<00:04:07.880> I'm<00:04:08.030> going<00:04:08.180> to

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
I'm not sure how I'm going to

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.410 
I'm not sure how I'm going to
incorporate<00:04:08.570> that<00:04:09.109> into<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.650> winter<00:04:10.420> routine

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
incorporate that into the winter routine

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.240 
incorporate that into the winter routine
but<00:04:11.660> I'm<00:04:11.810> going<00:04:11.989> to<00:04:12.049> try<00:04:12.260> to<00:04:12.880> to<00:04:15.010> spread<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.130> out

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
but I'm going to try to to spread it out

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.170 
but I'm going to try to to spread it out
like<00:04:16.519> that<00:04:16.840> 5050<00:04:18.190> throughout<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.370> day<00:04:19.579> versus

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
like that 5050 throughout the day versus

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.750 
like that 5050 throughout the day versus
we<00:04:20.359> typically<00:04:20.989> would<00:04:21.229> feed<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:21.919> know<00:04:22.460> a<00:04:22.490> heavy

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
we typically would feed you know a heavy

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.210 
we typically would feed you know a heavy
feeding<00:04:23.330> at<00:04:23.450> night<00:04:23.680> and<00:04:24.680> then<00:04:24.830> kind<00:04:25.010> of<00:04:25.100> a

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
feeding at night and then kind of a

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.909 
feeding at night and then kind of a
watering<00:04:25.760> in<00:04:25.880> the<00:04:26.000> morning<00:04:26.450> and<00:04:26.660> it<00:04:27.320> was<00:04:27.710> just

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
watering in the morning and it was just

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.129 
watering in the morning and it was just
sort<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.669> same<00:04:28.910> deal

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
sort of the same deal

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.749 
sort of the same deal
the<00:04:30.499> good<00:04:30.740> eaters<00:04:31.039> would<00:04:31.219> finish<00:04:31.460> it

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
the good eaters would finish it

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.540 
the good eaters would finish it
sometimes<00:04:32.360> that<00:04:32.629> they're<00:04:32.840> tired<00:04:33.169> or<00:04:33.530> or<00:04:34.370> it

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
sometimes that they're tired or or it

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.469 
sometimes that they're tired or or it
was<00:04:34.669> cold<00:04:34.999> out<00:04:35.300> they<00:04:35.569> would<00:04:35.719> they<00:04:36.439> would<00:04:37.479> some

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
was cold out they would they would some

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.890 
was cold out they would they would some
of<00:04:38.569> the<00:04:38.629> pickier<00:04:38.960> ones<00:04:39.199> wouldn't<00:04:39.590> necessarily

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
of the pickier ones wouldn't necessarily

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.269 
of the pickier ones wouldn't necessarily
finish<00:04:41.900> all<00:04:42.080> their<00:04:42.229> food<00:04:42.499> and<00:04:42.740> seemed<00:04:42.979> like<00:04:43.129> we

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:43.279 
finish all their food and seemed like we

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:45.010 
finish all their food and seemed like we
were<00:04:43.310> feeding<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.819> heck<00:04:44.150> of<00:04:44.180> a<00:04:44.330> lot<00:04:44.449> of<00:04:44.509> ravens

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
were feeding a heck of a lot of ravens

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.330 
were feeding a heck of a lot of ravens
last<00:04:45.669> winter<00:04:46.669> I<00:04:47.740> mean<00:04:48.740> they<00:04:48.889> maintain<00:04:49.310> their

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
last winter I mean they maintain their

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.100 
last winter I mean they maintain their
weight<00:04:49.669> pretty<00:04:49.969> good<00:04:50.240> but<00:04:52.659> this<00:04:53.659> way<00:04:53.870> I<00:04:53.900> think

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
weight pretty good but this way I think

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.059 
weight pretty good but this way I think
will<00:04:54.409> be<00:04:54.529> a<00:04:54.560> lot<00:04:54.800> more<00:04:54.830> efficient<00:04:56.680> so<00:04:57.680> I<00:04:57.710> had

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.069 
will be a lot more efficient so I had

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:02.200 
will be a lot more efficient so I had
people<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:59.020> and<00:05:00.020> it's<00:05:00.770> more<00:05:01.340> similar<00:05:01.849> to<00:05:02.090> the

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
people and and it's more similar to the

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.629 
people and and it's more similar to the
way<00:05:02.360> I<00:05:02.389> think<00:05:02.779> that<00:05:03.050> that<00:05:03.319> we<00:05:04.159> feed<00:05:04.460> on

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
way I think that that we feed on

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.570 
way I think that that we feed on
long-distance<00:05:05.000> races<00:05:05.509> to<00:05:05.870> kind<00:05:06.139> giving<00:05:06.379> them

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.990 

even<00:05:10.580> volume<00:05:11.060> feedings<00:05:12.250> more<00:05:13.250> often<00:05:13.729> rather

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
even volume feedings more often rather

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.990
