 injustice and inequality without carrying 15 although before 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.010
 the world is not how they paint it 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.950
 a moment you do not think you're free 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.100
 because you can walk the streets 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.000

 is that the state will solve all the problems 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.740
 of course not 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.510
 because you are a slave of the state 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.310
 the one that followed its course 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.100

 will be that you have the right to change the time to claim the contest without 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.830
 opposition 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.830
 because we've been better young musician like 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.570
 I have not seen God in a world where everyone 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.629
 From birth until we die 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.599
 these are the Christians we believe that the lives of people 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.919
 if we do not have a drama two ears 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:20.119
 a career with many 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.609
 These are the results 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:23.719
 with them 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.539
 we have transcribed tejero 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:28.029
 the head of state 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:31.099
 is that we are locked in our own eyes 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.359
 importing will look for 2-4 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.499

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:43.200
 that they are not 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.820
 Although they are not coming, let us inform ourselves 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.459
 let's ask ourselves 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.589
 you have not realized that power controls everything 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:51.780
 Mutu education 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.509
 your culture religion economics 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:59.579
 the television the radio press everything everything is planned and designed so that 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:00.729
 so be it 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:01.919
 it is not enough 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:02.949
 spinetta 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:06.609
 do not let them talk to you from here to there that spoils your rights 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.839
 tata inti mouth and they throw you dirty rags on your face 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:11.929
 it's great 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:13.199
 but it expired 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.459
 Wozniacki to take the weapons 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.419
 leave your life or harness a revolution not

 what I wish psychiatrists wake up the eye that investigates 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.439
 in another that was all that they tell you 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.129
 that you do not eat into account 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.539
 ask for example 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:31.749
 the scare that 10 families have all the money in the world while millions 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:32.499
 children's 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:33.929
 men and women 

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:35.089
 die of hunger 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:39.249
 because the vaccines that are to prevent diseases are contaminated with 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:41.569
 mercury housing in them 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.809
 if money is just a printed paper with no more value than the fed we have in it 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.809
 because we are suffering from the economic crisis 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:53.169
 because the most powerful leaders of the 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:54.639
 including dad 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.179

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.099
 Your Texas Super Interstate Highway 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.119
 George Bush had the twin towers 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:09.119
 That is why the real purpose of this imperialist power 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.739
 because they want to rob us to hoist and privatize even the soul 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.879
 because there are more than 800 concentration camps in the United States with 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.579
 space for 10,000 prisoners each 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.949
 so that the ain that American 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.249
 has 500 thousand plastic coffins in which they can store up to two million 

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:30.379
 of corpses headed 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:34.079
 these are just some of the thousands of questions to answer 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.839
 I want to give you the key so that you can answer yourself if many of these questions 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.960
 it will only take one club 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.219

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.460
