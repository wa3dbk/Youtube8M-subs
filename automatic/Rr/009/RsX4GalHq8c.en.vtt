00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.280
 Hello my name is not currently being 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.380
 I will share with you a very simple recipe 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.440
 cookies and so for him we need 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.240
 400 milliliters of kefir or sour cream 200 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.330
 gram flour 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.510
 150 grams sugar half a pack of baking powder 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.519
 as well as vanilla extract or vanillin 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.800
 and since I decided to make chocolate 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.810
 cookies then I took another 50 grams of cocoa and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.820
 chocolate bar that I chopped and 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.239
 in large pieces and so take sour cream and 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:39.680
 mix and i first with sugar and 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.680
 little by little we start to add cocoa 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:49.469
 now add flour and add to it 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.570
 baking powder mix first flour with 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.289
 baking powder and gently start 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.289
 kneading dough 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.500
 the very last moment and add 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:05.940
 a few drops of vanilla extract a 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:07.410
 also slices of chocolate paper for 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.230
 baking grease with butter 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.930
 either margarine is generally good paper 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.660
 need to grease me somehow lucky because 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.090
 the one that she herself owes 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.090
 does not want to exfoliate baking 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.140
 now take a mug of water and another 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.570
 spoon or fork than conveniently wet it 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.150
 so that the dough doesn't stick too much 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.760
 and so here neatly form and 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.080
 lozenges such as you 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:44.940
 like thicker and thinner 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:46.729
 in general here already to your taste and now 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.729
 send cookies to the oven at 180 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.729
 degrees 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.219
 the baking time of the cookies depends on 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.530
 how thick you are and how much 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.109
 how do you want to see him i mean i 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.250
 I personally love her to be enough 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:03.459
 Crispy there inside was slightly 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.560
 soft for this it will need an oven 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.520
 somewhere 30 40 minutes with my thickness 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.610
 somewhere in centimeter 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.170
 if you have it a little thinner or you 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.760
 want her to be more 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.349
 soft is enough for 20 minutes so our 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.910
 the cookie is ready but don't rush it 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.420
 I personally recommend putting it on a plate 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.360
 put it on the grill 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.370
 so that it dries a little bit like this 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.319
 that's interesting and the cookies we got 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.450
 its main thing is very easy and simple 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.890
 cook and hope you like it and 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.940
