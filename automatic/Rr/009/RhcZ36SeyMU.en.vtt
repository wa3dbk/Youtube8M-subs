here on earth cannon check out the
pictures<00:00:19.990> this<00:00:20.170> was<00:00:20.350> a<00:00:20.440> huge<00:00:20.830> a<00:00:21.190> solar<00:00:21.730> flare

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.030 
pictures this was a huge a solar flare

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.170 
pictures this was a huge a solar flare
and<00:00:22.450> a<00:00:22.539> CME<00:00:23.230> or<00:00:23.470> a<00:00:23.500> coral<00:00:23.920> mass<00:00:24.190> ejection<00:00:24.460> as<00:00:25.060> we

and a CME or a coral mass ejection as we

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.930 
and a CME or a coral mass ejection as we
call<00:00:25.450> it<00:00:25.480> imagine<00:00:26.260> it<00:00:26.350> as<00:00:26.470> a<00:00:26.560> huge<00:00:27.100> burp<00:00:27.490> of<00:00:27.699> gas

call it imagine it as a huge burp of gas

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.450 
call it imagine it as a huge burp of gas
really<00:00:28.539> that<00:00:29.230> comes<00:00:29.470> off<00:00:29.680> the<00:00:29.710> surface<00:00:30.100> of<00:00:30.340> the

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
really that comes off the surface of the

really that comes off the surface of the
Sun<00:00:30.730> creates<00:00:31.210> solar<00:00:31.570> wind<00:00:31.990> and<00:00:32.199> heads<00:00:32.469> towards

Sun creates solar wind and heads towards

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.950 
Sun creates solar wind and heads towards
the<00:00:32.980> Earth's<00:00:33.190> atmosphere<00:00:33.460> and<00:00:34.390> it<00:00:34.510> comes<00:00:34.780> in

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
the Earth's atmosphere and it comes in

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.290 
the Earth's atmosphere and it comes in
at<00:00:35.230> up<00:00:35.440> in<00:00:35.589> the<00:00:35.949> weak<00:00:36.159> spot<00:00:36.489> so<00:00:36.760> that's<00:00:36.940> around

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
at up in the weak spot so that's around

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.930 
at up in the weak spot so that's around
the<00:00:37.480> poles<00:00:37.809> now<00:00:38.170> yesterday<00:00:38.729> really<00:00:39.729> this

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
the poles now yesterday really this

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.819 
the poles now yesterday really this
thing<00:00:40.179> paint<00:00:40.539> and<00:00:40.780> so<00:00:40.899> funk<00:00:41.229> some<00:00:41.530> flights

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
thing paint and so funk some flights

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.919 
thing paint and so funk some flights
were<00:00:42.039> diverted<00:00:42.219> away<00:00:42.850> from<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.659> poles

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 
were diverted away from the poles

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.139 
were diverted away from the poles
because<00:00:44.319> of<00:00:44.589> concerns<00:00:44.979> for<00:00:45.190> radiation<00:00:45.879> and

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
because of concerns for radiation and

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.270 
because of concerns for radiation and
there<00:00:46.569> are<00:00:46.659> also<00:00:46.749> some<00:00:47.079> issues<00:00:47.499> apparently

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
there are also some issues apparently

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.119 
there are also some issues apparently
with<00:00:48.729> GPS<00:00:49.359> and<00:00:49.389> satellite<00:00:50.350> service<00:00:50.889> but

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
with GPS and satellite service but

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.189 
with GPS and satellite service but
nothing<00:00:51.639> major<00:00:51.999> has<00:00:52.389> been<00:00:52.569> recorded<00:00:53.019> that's

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
nothing major has been recorded that's

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.349 
nothing major has been recorded that's
the<00:00:53.440> good<00:00:53.589> news<00:00:53.649> the<00:00:53.859> bad<00:00:54.190> news<00:00:54.249> is<00:00:54.489> is<00:00:54.819> not

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
the good news the bad news is is not

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.509 
the good news the bad news is is not
completely<00:00:55.870> over<00:00:56.019> and<00:00:56.409> done<00:00:56.679> with<00:00:56.859> just<00:00:57.129> yet

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
completely over and done with just yet

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.639 
completely over and done with just yet
the<00:00:57.760> solar<00:00:58.030> alert<00:00:58.569> remains<00:00:59.139> in<00:00:59.499> effect

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
the solar alert remains in effect

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.319 
the solar alert remains in effect
through<00:01:00.039> today<00:01:00.549> but<00:01:00.760> it's<00:01:00.879> been<00:01:01.030> downgraded

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
through today but it's been downgraded

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.389 
through today but it's been downgraded
so<00:01:01.870> it's<00:01:02.019> down<00:01:02.199> to<00:01:02.379> moderate<00:01:02.829> so<00:01:03.159> what<00:01:03.309> does

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
so it's down to moderate so what does

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.100 
so it's down to moderate so what does
that<00:01:03.459> mean<00:01:03.819> is<00:01:04.030> there<00:01:04.180> anything<00:01:04.329> you<00:01:04.869> need<00:01:05.019> to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
that mean is there anything you need to

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.050 
that mean is there anything you need to
be<00:01:05.229> concerned<00:01:05.799> about<00:01:05.979> while<00:01:06.579> passengers

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
be concerned about while passengers

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.480 
be concerned about while passengers
still<00:01:07.420> in<00:01:07.600> high<00:01:07.810> flying<00:01:08.140> aircraft<00:01:08.439> could<00:01:09.280> be

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
still in high flying aircraft could be

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.609 
still in high flying aircraft could be
exposed<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:10.090> radiation<00:01:10.420> but<00:01:10.990> farther<00:01:11.259> north

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
exposed to radiation but farther north

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.230 
exposed to radiation but farther north
up<00:01:11.799> you<00:01:11.920> go<00:01:12.039> towards<00:01:12.399> the<00:01:12.460> pole<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:13.030> that's

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
up you go towards the pole and that's

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.370 
up you go towards the pole and that's
where<00:01:13.479> that's<00:01:13.570> going<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:13.869> be<00:01:13.990> so<00:01:14.170> if<00:01:14.259> you're

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
where that's going to be so if you're

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.749 
where that's going to be so if you're
flying<00:01:14.560> across<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:15.039> u.s.<00:01:15.280> we<00:01:15.490> think<00:01:15.670> you're

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
flying across the u.s. we think you're

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.670 
flying across the u.s. we think you're
going<00:01:15.909> to<00:01:15.939> be<00:01:16.000> a-ok<00:01:16.539> there<00:01:16.750> today<00:01:16.899> it<00:01:17.289> has<00:01:17.469> four

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
going to be a-ok there today it has four

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.859 
going to be a-ok there today it has four
satellite<00:01:18.100> gps<00:01:18.640> reception<00:01:19.030> well<00:01:19.600> it's<00:01:19.719> going

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
satellite gps reception well it's going

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.050 
satellite gps reception well it's going
to<00:01:19.960> be<00:01:20.079> really<00:01:20.469> kind

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
to be really kind

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.230 
to be really kind
isolated<00:01:21.780> single<00:01:22.470> incident<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.430> basically

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
isolated single incident so basically

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.060 
isolated single incident so basically
for<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.479> most<00:01:24.689> part<00:01:24.899> this<00:01:25.140> thing<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.590> over<00:01:25.799> and

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
for the most part this thing is over and

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.679 
for the most part this thing is over and
done<00:01:26.100> with<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.579> biggest<00:01:26.759> impact<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.540> we

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
done with and the biggest impact that we

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.859 
done with and the biggest impact that we
had<00:01:27.840> from<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.200> overall<00:01:28.880> aurora<00:01:29.880> borealis<00:01:30.149> so

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
had from it overall aurora borealis so

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.139 
had from it overall aurora borealis so
it<00:01:30.930> was<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.110> beautiful<00:01:31.409> wonderful<00:01:32.340> spectacular

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
it was a beautiful wonderful spectacular

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.149 
it was a beautiful wonderful spectacular

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
ice hotel of snow tell as they call it

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.429 
ice hotel of snow tell as they call it
in<00:01:44.280> Sweden<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.390> amazing<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.320> get

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
in Sweden and just amazing so you get

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.960 
in Sweden and just amazing so you get
all<00:01:46.619> these<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:47.070> electrically<00:01:47.670> charged

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
all these like electrically charged

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.969 
all these like electrically charged
particles<00:01:48.030> here<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:49.170> come<00:01:49.350> shooting<00:01:49.740> into

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
particles here they come shooting into

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.380 
particles here they come shooting into
the<00:01:50.070> Earth's<00:01:50.310> atmosphere<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:51.119> as<00:01:51.240> they

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
the Earth's atmosphere and as they

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.109 
the Earth's atmosphere and as they
interact<00:01:51.780> with<00:01:52.320> our<00:01:52.439> gases<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.429> creates<00:01:53.909> this

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
interact with our gases it creates this

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.059 
interact with our gases it creates this
beautiful<00:01:54.450> light<00:01:55.049> show<00:01:55.319> and<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.709> things<00:01:55.950> have

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
beautiful light show and so things have

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:57.710 
beautiful light show and so things have
been<00:01:56.130> really<00:01:56.340> quiet<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.030> Sun<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.479> of

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
been really quiet with the Sun as of

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.419 
been really quiet with the Sun as of
late<00:01:57.959> things<00:01:58.440> are<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.590> starting<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.159> pick<00:01:59.399> up

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
late things are just starting to pick up

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.100 
late things are just starting to pick up
a<00:01:59.640> little<00:01:59.909> bit<00:02:00.090> more<00:02:00.330> expected<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.929> see

a little bit more expected to see
increases<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.009> solar<00:02:02.369> activity<00:02:02.539> through<00:02:03.539> 2013

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
increases in solar activity through 2013

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.919 
increases in solar activity through 2013
what<00:02:05.069> it's<00:02:05.189> expected<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.759> peak<00:02:05.909> Wow<00:02:06.479> all<00:02:06.869> right

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
what it's expected to peak Wow all right

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.810 
what it's expected to peak Wow all right
Jackie<00:02:07.409> thanks<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.039> much<00:02:08.250> sir<00:02:08.810> well
