00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.230
 very good I am from or galilea and today we are going 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.390
 to talk about portraits 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.429
 Welcome to making of and your channel 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.870
 audiovisual training and entertainment 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.240
 on youtube and is that as in the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.789
 landscape photography video today we're going 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.470
 to collect 10 errors that I have had 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.450
 or that I found when making 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.430
 portraits by the way very many thanks 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.900
 for the feedback of 10 errors 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.000
 Photographs of the landscape I will leave you 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.980
 an annotation here in case it's still not 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.360
 you have seen it, I recommend that you 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.310
 Take a look, because good feedback 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.170
 it was quite positive and I've seen that 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.149
 well you have been able to learn from 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.399
 some advice of some type that I gave you 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.679
 so if you have not seen it yet , you can 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.149
 pause this video and click here to 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.100
 the annotation that I have left you to be able to 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.719
 see it so we started with the first 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.149
 error of the portraits and is that no 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.820
 necessarily only the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.920
 face in him 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.079
 you must frame everything that makes you 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.680
 lack of body of the subject of the model 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.840
 since you must get to teach the 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.129
 photograph the soul of the person who 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.079
 are you photographing that is if 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.199
 you need to frame your arms your 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.239
 legs your breasts forward put it in the 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.960
 picture because if necessary you must 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.670
 prove it 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.380
 you must be very careful with the 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.420
 choosing your goals here 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.520
 I will give some example of what happens 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.350
 if you use an angle if you use a 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.570
 normal goal or if you use a 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.979
 telephoto as I tell you very much 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.030
 Beware of the deformations that 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.550
 produce in the face to the objectives 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.280
 angular if that is the result that 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.649
 you are looking to be a portrait a bit 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.780
 more expressive not a little darker or a 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.100
 little bit more turbid, because ahead he uses a 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.550
 angular but if what you want is 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.830
 show in the photograph the subject what 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.960
 closer to reality uses a 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.850
 target of a 70 or a 100 millimeter 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.649
 up the third mistake that I've 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.840
 seen and good is an advice that I can 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.330
 give is to engage a conversation 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.310
 with the model with the subject always 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.720
 from a respectful way especially if 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.820
 we are in sessions that can be a 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.430
 bit delicate as for example 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.140
 with nude photography as I say 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.060
 always from the respect but try 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.370
 be the friendliest the friendliest 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.729
 You can try to start a 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.619
 conversation with the subject but always 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.289
 leaving the boundaries clear is to say he 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.030
 is the model and you are the photographer 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.010
 ask him in a nice way 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.530
 what you want me to pose or how 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.820
 you want it to be placed in the photograph 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.890
 so that's the third tip that you 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.540
 I can give try to start a 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.340
 conversation with him the fourth mistake that 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.840
 I have seen is that not necessarily the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.780
 model must be watching during 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.010
 the whole session to the camera lens 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.470
 invite him to lose his look for 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.150
 other points of the composition as 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.270
 well this will create technical guidelines 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.380
 which are really interesting but not 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.330
 you must forget that 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.250
 what they mainly have the attention 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.260
 in what is the human face are the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.450
 eyes since they bring vitality and it is 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.950
 super important that even be very 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.870
 little but he is perceived in the 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.700
 final photograph the fifth council that 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.800
 I can give you is that you take great care of 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.720
 choice of your diaphragm do not forget 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.940
 that with a very open diaphragm you'll be 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.400
 focusing for example only on the subject and 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.320
 focusing attention on him although this 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.150
 it's not always the right thing to do since you have to 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.520
 understand the context in which it is is 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.890
 say what surrounds the subject or the model 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.080
 what is happening to us though as I say 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.820
 that is depends on what you want 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.980
 get to the end if you are in study 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.170
 with flashes I recommend you use 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.180
 a little 9 a 11 focus since they are usually 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.580
 quite comfortable to work the sixth 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.930
 mistake and this is one thing that I talk to 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.420
 a lot of people and they seem like an ass 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.740
 but not necessarily the most 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.710
 handsome is going to be the one that gives you a better 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.470
 photography test different subjects with 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.750
 different faces of different ages 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.150
 different profiles since the beauty 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.620
 it's like very standardized 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.330
 but what we are going to try is 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.060
 get a portrait that is different 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.640
 not something that is very common not so 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.140
 As I say, I invite you to look for 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.959
 people for example older since 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.150
 they have the face as very marked no 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.920
 It has very marked wrinkles and gives a 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.810
 very beautiful contrast to photography 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.430
 the seventh mistake I've seen is no 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.010
 vary the lighting scheme and I 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.900
 It seems like a real moron and moves 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.910
 all the lights thousands of times as 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.860
 throughout the photo session with 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.170
 very much careful again hit him or 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.720
 that something falls on you or the 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.489
 model but good test different 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.319
 lighting schemes with different 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.760
 diffusers with different centers that 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.000
 they change the color temperature a little 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.620
 of light with different reflectors is 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.510
 say plays a lot with daylight 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.430
 which I think is the key to obtaining 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.840
 a different and curious photograph the 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.540
 eighth mistake that you can not afford 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.979
 is losing the textures and that is that they are 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.440
 super important and provide a 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.090
 amazing expressiveness to the image I think 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.650
 that after the illumination is the 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.870
 aspect that you should take care of the 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.360
 time to edit your photograph ie in 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.370
 post-production and under no circumstances 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.380
 you must lose them the name no error 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.910
 that I have seen in the portraits is to abuse 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.710
 of retouching and is that here I am going to 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.560
 leave some example 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.120
 true masterpieces of the edition 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.540
 in photoshop 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.770
 it is better a very careful subtle retouching 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.270
 touching basic aspects such as 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.630
 lighting as we have seen now the 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.550
 textures the contrast the colors to 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.080
 go over and start using the 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.290
 liquefied tool in a way 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.310
 brutal as these artists have done 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.140
 the liquefied is a very good tool 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.630
 but you have to use it with a lot 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.090
 Care for good elections 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.180
 You raise the marks a little so that 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.250
 well, the figure is very well contrasted 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.260
 so that's my ninth advice the no 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.120
 spend with the photo editing and my 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.920
 The last piece of advice I'm going to give you is that 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.510
 do not copy the works of others 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.490
 photographers with this I want to say 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.290
 well, it does not cal that is exactly the 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.289
 same photograph that has made a 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.210
 photographer you try to do 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.979
 The truth is that you must see many 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.960
 photographs study the works of 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.789
 many photographers but as I say no 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.089
 the copies try to get the best of 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:47.789
 each photographer put it together and even then to that 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:49.830
 add you your own as your own 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:52.499
 framing other own compositions 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.449
 your own elements so like 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:56.309
 final advice I give you this one that does not 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:58.589
 Copy the works of other photographers 

00:05:56.309 --> 00:06:00.089
 so nothing up here the video I hope 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:02.430
 that has been useful to you and that you have been able 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:04.020
 learn something from all these tips if 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.789
 so do not forget to leave your lay that 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.139
 add the video to favorites since 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.149
 you support the channel very much 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.680
 do not forget to share it over your networks 

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:12.419
 social since I 'm sure you have some 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.909
 friend who is interested in this type of 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:18.979
 advice or this type of photography a 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:18.979
 greeting and see you in the next period
