00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:14.309
 I'm so excited 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.190
 I struggle with my new pc 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.410
 I would have saved up 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.350
 Let's show how a layman like me one 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.099
 I'm reasonably cheap at 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.330
 driving a computer can drive 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.980
 I spent a few weeks with the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.560
 set apart theme and I'm there 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.719
 at computer work landed that one 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.290
 known alternate is too expensive for me and 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:42.360
 completely pc complete pcs are mine 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.660
 opinion after the bo censored on mine 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.539
 I am looking for the gaming then 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.719
 completely pc monnaie encountered 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.989
 That's what he calls himself at computer work and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.460
 The same offers then numerous 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.250
 pay options from paypal to 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.570
 installment purchase by micro credit and me 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.170
 I think I've never had a better one 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.140
 Customer service is allowed to experience everything 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.900
 one admittedly quite presumptuous 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.750
 Questions about discounts claimed 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.460
 support sovereign 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.259
 not to be despised are the five percent 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.310
 discount on every order it every 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:24.380
 month for facebook fans is now out 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.380
 First of my configuration 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.560
 do states do we do as he does 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:39.110
 choice of the processor I have 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.910
 for the company 3.0 ghz athlon x4 640 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.250
 the tests and ratings decided 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:47.630
 are consistently good and promise you one 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.869
 powerful pc as a video card have 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.060
 I have a gtx 275 this is enough for me 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.570
 relax from around the game today 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.860
 very high quality play and gtx 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.580
 680 to march is easy for me 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.350
 definitely too expensive and unnecessarily ten 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.700
 gigabytes of RAM are for 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.110
 provide fast multitasking and fun 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.880
 for me quite a 2 terabyte 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.980
 Hard disk I would not smaller 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.360
 recommend if you play many games and 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:22.250
 want to do more with the computer 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.830
 the heike of the decision was with me 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.480
 but at the operating system 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.150
 I chose windows 8 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.730
 since i actually use the user interface 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.610
 right x and windows 7 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.920
 well that is only from microsoft 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.260
 supplied with updates until 2015 and 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.820
 that's why you have to support it 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.330
 actually forced by microsoft 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.480
 this well in the tests quite bad 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.930
 windows 8 to take but well and 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.060
 starts or at least faster then 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.070
 still optical drive cpu-cooler 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.049
 Mainboard take care that the mainboard 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.690
 The main memory supports the housing 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.840
 power supply which enough power for league 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.850
 has to spend the further it is 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.950
 optional multicard plug pc 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.290
 expansion card you just get 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.620
 more plug additional hard drive 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.390
 additional drive office software 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.780
 security software and wlan map 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.970
 orderable 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.110
 then still on shopping cart coupon code 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.590
 enter and order 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.720
 that I did as he did in mine 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.590
 pc is there now he will 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.360
 be later 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:38.010
 I will also box this apropos 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.540
 Shipping from 150 euros is yes at computer 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.640
 away for free which i also very good 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.810
 many as one is for 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.610
 me a must for laymen of my kind 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.010
 offers a foolproof configuration of a 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.140
 high performance pcs with nice support too 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.510
 an unbeatable price as I think 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.090
 and the best I think I think 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.770
 Computerwerk does not only build the pc 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.970
 together they install everything and 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:08.209
 Do a 48- hour stress test on the pc 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.810
 to the limits of his physical 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.810
 should bring loan 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.150
 that was it for the first time that was it 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.480
 then 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.820
 Thanks for watching my box 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.410
 empty work more and more does not come out 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.410
 skin in there, we see ourselves japan boxing
