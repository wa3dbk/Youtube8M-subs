00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.519
 small powerful and enormous 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.950
 fire panel are the main features 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.130
 the new three-cylinder engine from ford 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.039
 with only one liter displacement delivers the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.550
 new turbo loaded ford 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.020
 gasoline direct injection up to 120 ps 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.150
 enough for a dynamic 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.920
 to ensure that the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.960
 Customer will enjoy so little consumption 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.590
 may be due to a number of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.590
 innovations 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.100
 in which the cooling circuit in cold 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.970
 engine first bypasses in cylinder block 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.790
 is the motor was faster 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.140
 this lowers the friction in the engine thus the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.340
 fuel consumption and the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.620
 exhaust gases emissions 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:52.200
 especially in the cold start phase the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.270
 Camshaft is about one in oil 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.150
 driven timing belt 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.690
 the effect here too becomes the friction 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.239
 minimized and saves fuel 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.060
 the variable valve control is optimized 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.920
 the air flow into the combustion chamber at all 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.340
 Speeds especially in 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.960
 partial load range and at full burns 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.140
 it also allows the so-called 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.329
 skating process if one and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.000
 exhaust valves open simultaneously 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.009
 are in this process will burn 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.950
 Residues rinsed out of the combustion chamber 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.100
 cooled and the turbocharger at the same time 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.110
 stimulated by the strong air flow 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.689
 the direct injection of the second 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.689
 generation sits the injection nozzle 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.729
 central and makes for denser and 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.679
 more uniform mixture formation, the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.560
 favors more efficient combustion 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.329
 and reduces fuel consumption 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.739
 as well as a multiple injection 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.649
 is possible is the mixture 

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:52.079
 Injection always on the current 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.000
 Requirement profile set the ford 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.520
 engineers also have the exhaust manifold 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.640
 redesigned and in the cylinder head 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.129
 The new design integrates saving weight 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.569
 and increases the smooth running of the engine and 

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:09.119
 optimizes the exhaust gas flow directly 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.560
 appealing turbo boost increases that 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.470
 torque even at low 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.690
 Speeds The turbines are extra small 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.730
 with correspondingly low inertia so 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.440
 that powerful torque immediately 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.970
 ready 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.579
 the crankshaft is also 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.290
 friction also optimized this measure 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.290
 helps to reduce fuel consumption 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.340
 the here for the first time to use coming 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.200
 Two-stage oil pump ensures that the 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.420
 oil pressure in the engine over the entire 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.420
 speed band remains in the optimum range 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.769
 less fuel consumption less 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.670
 co2 emissions for more power and 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.269
 more driving pleasure 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.610
 the new ford 1 liter ecoboost united 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.810
 future-oriented technologies today
