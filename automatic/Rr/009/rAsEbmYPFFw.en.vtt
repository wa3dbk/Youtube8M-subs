00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.629
 nine guys i'm joshua again 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.160
 cape and today we have the third 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.200
 bundesliga despite review 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.210
 I already have thomas mÃ¼ller 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.660
 and the tan despite the magnifying glass 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.219
 took 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.350
 definitely looks at a channel 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.990
 if you have not seen it yet 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.050
 Definitely worth it, but today 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.810
 Let's start with the one with the 99er 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.670
 pace striker employ aubameyang the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.920
 secrets players from the whole team 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.320
 obsessive of the bundesliga if not 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.840
 even from the whole team of the seas 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.270
 that have come out so far and we 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.340
 his 99 pace but also his 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.780
 other attributes and water too 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.230
 Today you have a close look at the offer 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.410
 to take 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.940
 I would say let's go 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.670
 As always, let's start with his 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.950
 weaken two years I have weaknesses 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.190
 located with him on the one hand 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.980
 his three streetfoods are natural 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.710
 a big problem because if obama of 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.850
 porr is and is just in position in 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.649
 shoot his left 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.359
 he will be his if i have this ball 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.090
 I do not have a single goal 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.890
 achieved with him with left and no 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.720
 Shots have become dangerous with the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.570
 Of course, left shot gave up 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.580
 pity, but as long as he creates him 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.180
 to bring the right foot is everything 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.939
 paletti 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.040
 and what is still negative are his 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.000
 skills he has and tears that applies 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.310
 of course a pity 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.090
 that ensures that he himself of course 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.040
 but can do runs with its 99 ps 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.290
 just the opponents only by his pace 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.579
 can develop yes skills in practical 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.270
 not available you can shoot me 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.820
 make a find 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.150
 you can roll it or you can 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.710
 so what but that was it unfortunately on 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.170
 But now we come to his positive ones 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.320
 sides, of course, comes first 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.270
 since pace that is really outstanding if 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.390
 you people just have him for a while 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.119
 best you can play him 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.799
 in a formation where also a central 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.020
 Attacking midfielder with it 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.049
 is he beautiful in that the balls in 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.509
 The catwalks can then come to the 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.060
 next thing is graduation and that 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.280
 is his struck me most 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.160
 conclusion I think just yet 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.320
 brighter than his pace 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.820
 he really does stand up front 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.370
 every single bude 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.570
 and he has also pressed hard problems 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.580
 to place the ball in the goal 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.950
 I always like to pull in this 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.720
 mÃ¼ller compares briefly with mÃ¼ller im 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.230
 comparison to the bamian was in things 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.600
 nothing at all 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.140
 free kicks are the next yes you see 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.060
 I have three free kick goals here in the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.590
 review I've got a total 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.110
 four pieces shot with him 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.690
 three of them are more in the care 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.750
 I do not think I need to say so 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.150
 then the next thing is his strength 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.490
 of course, to his awesome pace 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.880
 even that he just hard to get off the ball 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.350
 disconnect and that's what she did of course 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.620
 even easier by the opposing 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.540
 rows of defense through to roar and just 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.460
 not to be out of balance 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.980
 the last thing I wanted to mention 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.190
 he is his passing game if you also him 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.170
 as playing stations use volt is 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.250
 despite, of course, the perfect one 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.230
 Man a quick pass out of him 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.980
 central midfield he lies on them 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.170
 the toe gm expires through the zbm lupft 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.840
 the ball over the defense was more in it 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.540
 is the thing yes guys finally 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.240
 my rating i give him 9 out of 10 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.320
 score points away and his money 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.560
 to hinder something 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.450
 but he is still correct in spite of everything 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.150
 really horny storm that is again 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.160
 said that 's it from me as said the 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.100
