 [music] 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.360
 Hello my name is Dmitry, you 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:17.700
 see tea shop 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:21.580
 today on review u on unpacking 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:25.199
 bluedio headphones we already saw them 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.970
 I was already on unpacking but I am not 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.039
 tested them not all chips about 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.120
 This column told there is 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:37.269
 there are small chips in this more precisely 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.129
 these wireless headphone speakers 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:42.120
 this time I was ordered white to 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:52.270
 it was just black black 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:54.340
 Now came first except a and under 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.960
 picking went in my not too 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:02.730
 all said so well let's 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.610
 so here they are these headphones and little white 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.710
 light by the way immediately him very neatly 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.950
 take them off your head because these 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.250
 here you are moving things they 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.560
 plastic meaning its very easy 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:23.920
 break what actually became we 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:27.040
 pairs of my personal headphones therefore 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.189
 be careful because it is very easy 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.369
 here you can break it in this place 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:36.360
 pulled the spirit to take off his race and 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.360
 broke here 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.130
 By picking here charging is trouble 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.710
 instruction minijack stone by the way about 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.380
 minijack cable 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.890
 let's say you are listening to music in these 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.609
 headphones yes I'm on the bluetooth channel and 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.880
 if somebody 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:05.600
 let's say if someone has a liner and 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.009
 in-ear headphones or earpods and 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.549
 included here in this nest not 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.209
 and the person at the end about hearing that 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:21.450
 same as you are in my awesome 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:24.599
 interesting thing such a find is not necessary 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.819
 all sorts there and viewers take these very 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.760
 a trick to fuse a mini jack of just 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.920
 stuck here and everything when you listen 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.340
 music is not over bluetooth through this 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.319
 mini jack 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.750
 three and a half you can just listen 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.680
 music on the wire with a computer with 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.579
 laptop anywhere so let's them them 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.459
 all the same let's hear how they sound if 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:54.480
 we will succeed in doing this 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.299
 question how xconnect did not have time for everyone 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.260
 times it turns out just to press and 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:02.910
 hold the button until here that's not 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.599
 light up blue so he caught fire all 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.660
 we can let it constantly be lit so 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:11.160
 turn on bluetooth 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.160
 we find them here they did not appear weakly 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:19.519
 this is my old hs connect 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.519
 connect to them 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.280
 so all the connection happened where there 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:34.850
 our 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:37.090
 calibration song destur bad love of the 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.090
 midnight 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:44.390
 Well, now you see the volume 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:48.980
 how many percent 30 can hear them they 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:55.810
 play let's add you can add 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.810
 here on the column is added 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.500
 [music] 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:33.650
 remove 2 loud masses 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.650
 seriously we gorgeous sound 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.740
 wireless and 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.940
 just advise it worth x8 don't say i don't 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.550
 because the course is now 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.160
 galloping rises permanent bottom 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.310
 worth 60 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.330
 although not literally scored a rotation of 580 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.580
 us durability 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:58.470
 so that video is not worth 82 not 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.860
