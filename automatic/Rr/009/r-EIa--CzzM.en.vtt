00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
I'd like to talk to you about a base

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.359 
I'd like to talk to you about a base
that's<00:00:11.360> here<00:00:11.660> on<00:00:11.810> consignment<00:00:14.320> this<00:00:15.369> 3/4

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
that's here on consignment this 3/4

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.870 
that's here on consignment this 3/4
violin<00:00:17.089> cornered<00:00:17.539> bass<00:00:17.749> this<00:00:18.679> was<00:00:19.400> the<00:00:19.699> base

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
violin cornered bass this was the base

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.669 
violin cornered bass this was the base
of<00:00:19.909> a<00:00:20.179> lifetime<00:00:20.689> for<00:00:20.929> a<00:00:20.990> man<00:00:21.169> that<00:00:21.199> lived<00:00:21.560> in

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:21.679 
of a lifetime for a man that lived in

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.579 
of a lifetime for a man that lived in
Los<00:00:21.829> Angeles<00:00:22.099> and<00:00:23.089> if<00:00:23.419> you<00:00:23.539> look<00:00:23.779> kinda

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:24.589 
Los Angeles and if you look kinda

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.309 
Los Angeles and if you look kinda
closely<00:00:25.099> here<00:00:25.400> at<00:00:25.519> the<00:00:25.640> top<00:00:25.880> you<00:00:26.119> see<00:00:26.150> a<00:00:26.659> lot<00:00:27.230> of

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:27.319 
closely here at the top you see a lot of

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.120 
closely here at the top you see a lot of
play<00:00:27.589> a<00:00:27.829> lot<00:00:27.980> of<00:00:28.099> patina<00:00:28.489> a<00:00:28.789> lot<00:00:28.999> of<00:00:29.119> wear<00:00:29.329> but

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
play a lot of patina a lot of wear but

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.570 
play a lot of patina a lot of wear but
as<00:00:31.130> we<00:00:31.369> scan<00:00:31.669> down<00:00:32.050> there<00:00:33.050> is<00:00:33.200> no<00:00:33.620> evidence<00:00:34.250> of

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
as we scan down there is no evidence of

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.200 
as we scan down there is no evidence of
cracks<00:00:35.080> either<00:00:36.080> on<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:36.470> base<00:00:36.620> bar<00:00:36.920> side<00:00:37.250> or

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
cracks either on the base bar side or

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.490 
cracks either on the base bar side or
around<00:00:38.810> the<00:00:39.400> sound<00:00:40.400> post<00:00:40.720> and<00:00:41.720> so<00:00:42.110> even<00:00:42.410> though

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
around the sound post and so even though

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.250 
around the sound post and so even though
this<00:00:42.650> base<00:00:42.950> is<00:00:43.400> pre<00:00:44.350> 1900<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:47.120> it's<00:00:47.540> in<00:00:47.750> a<00:00:47.840> very

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
this base is pre 1900 the it's in a very

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.730 
this base is pre 1900 the it's in a very
very<00:00:48.740> healthy<00:00:49.220> condition<00:00:49.990> let<00:00:50.990> me<00:00:51.110> show<00:00:51.680> you

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:51.740 
very healthy condition let me show you

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.770 
very healthy condition let me show you
the<00:00:51.980> ribs<00:00:52.400> here

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
the ribs here

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.530 
the ribs here
these<00:00:54.410> are<00:00:54.820> characteristically<00:00:55.820> German

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
these are characteristically German

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.780 
these are characteristically German
external<00:00:57.290> lining<00:00:57.740> so<00:00:58.010> it's<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.280> German<00:00:58.579> base

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
external lining so it's a German base

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.080 
external lining so it's a German base
though<00:00:59.720> unlabeled<00:01:00.470> and<00:01:01.400> what<00:01:01.730> you<00:01:01.820> see<00:01:02.060> here

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
though unlabeled and what you see here

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.620 
though unlabeled and what you see here
is<00:01:02.510> that<00:01:02.540> the<00:01:02.870> rib<00:01:03.140> width<00:01:04.390> doesn't<00:01:05.390> really

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
is that the rib width doesn't really

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.690 
is that the rib width doesn't really
narrow<00:01:06.050> in<00:01:06.470> much<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:08.360> advantage<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:09.020> can

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
narrow in much and the advantage I can

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.490 
narrow in much and the advantage I can
say<00:01:10.700> from<00:01:11.000> that<00:01:11.210> is<00:01:11.450> that<00:01:11.480> there's<00:01:12.260> a<00:01:12.320> little

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
say from that is that there's a little

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.340 
say from that is that there's a little
more<00:01:12.560> volume<00:01:13.250> of<00:01:13.400> air<00:01:13.580> inside<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.090> box<00:01:15.700> then

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
more volume of air inside the box then

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.080 
more volume of air inside the box then
I'd<00:01:18.350> like<00:01:18.500> you<00:01:18.620> to<00:01:18.740> take<00:01:18.920> a<00:01:18.950> second<00:01:19.490> scope<00:01:19.820> in

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
I'd like you to take a second scope in

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.930 
I'd like you to take a second scope in
on<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.900> flame<00:01:21.440> grain<00:01:22.010> in<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.400> back<00:01:22.610> of<00:01:22.850> this

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
on the flame grain in the back of this

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.350 
on the flame grain in the back of this
base<00:01:23.240> when<00:01:24.080> this<00:01:24.260> space<00:01:24.530> was<00:01:24.800> made<00:01:25.070> this<00:01:26.030> baker

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
base when this space was made this baker

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.920 
base when this space was made this baker
was<00:01:27.320> choosing<00:01:28.010> the<00:01:28.280> best<00:01:28.850> materials<00:01:29.540> that<00:01:29.780> he

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
was choosing the best materials that he

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.060 
was choosing the best materials that he
had<00:01:30.280> beautiful<00:01:31.330> deeply<00:01:32.330> flamed<00:01:32.780> wood<00:01:33.200> with

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
had beautiful deeply flamed wood with

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.460 
had beautiful deeply flamed wood with
stripes<00:01:34.610> going<00:01:34.940> evenly<00:01:35.570> from<00:01:35.750> side<00:01:36.049> to<00:01:36.080> side

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
stripes going evenly from side to side

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.539 
stripes going evenly from side to side
just<00:01:37.720> perfect<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:40.659> so<00:01:42.130> there's<00:01:43.130> further

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
just perfect and so there's further

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.330 
just perfect and so there's further
evidence<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.180> this<00:01:44.420> base<00:01:44.750> was<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:45.710> makers

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
evidence that this base was the makers

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.490 
evidence that this base was the makers
best<00:01:46.729> when<00:01:47.390> we<00:01:47.510> go<00:01:47.690> up<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:48.110> look<00:01:48.260> at<00:01:48.380> the

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
best when we go up and look at the

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.760 
best when we go up and look at the
scroll<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:52.900> it's<00:01:53.900> in<00:01:54.080> here<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.440> tuning

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
scroll and it's in here the tuning

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.460 
scroll and it's in here the tuning
machines<00:01:55.159> these<00:01:56.090> tuning<00:01:56.540> machines<00:01:56.900> were<00:01:57.200> the

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
machines these tuning machines were the

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.830 
machines these tuning machines were the
worm<00:01:57.770> gear<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:59.979> key<00:02:00.979> are<00:02:01.570> forged<00:02:02.570> from

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
worm gear and the key are forged from

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.260 
worm gear and the key are forged from
the<00:02:03.020> same<00:02:03.290> piece<00:02:03.650> this<00:02:04.189> is

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
the same piece this is

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.229 
the same piece this is
characteristically<00:02:05.270> pre<00:02:05.830> 1900<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.340> then<00:02:08.119> you

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
characteristically pre 1900 and then you

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.029 
characteristically pre 1900 and then you
recognize<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.899> French<00:02:09.200> style<00:02:09.500> where<00:02:09.890> they

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
recognize the French style where they

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.770 
recognize the French style where they
crown<00:02:10.520> gear<00:02:11.000> and

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
crown gear and

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.620 
crown gear and
or<00:02:12.440> gear<00:02:12.710> assembly<00:02:13.040> are<00:02:13.490> two<00:02:13.970> separate<00:02:14.420> pieces

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
or gear assembly are two separate pieces

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.630 
or gear assembly are two separate pieces
and<00:02:15.320> what's<00:02:15.470> great<00:02:15.620> about<00:02:15.710> this<00:02:16.100> style<00:02:16.400> of

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
and what's great about this style of

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.310 
and what's great about this style of
machine<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.180> they<00:02:17.360> show<00:02:17.570> the<00:02:17.750> most<00:02:17.960> wood

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
machine is they show the most wood

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.680 
machine is they show the most wood
there's<00:02:18.860> just<00:02:19.100> really<00:02:19.340> not<00:02:19.640> any<00:02:20.030> plate

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
there's just really not any plate

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.550 
there's just really not any plate
they're<00:02:21.530> covering<00:02:22.100> things<00:02:22.310> up<00:02:23.320> when<00:02:24.320> these

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
they're covering things up when these

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.140 
they're covering things up when these
machines<00:02:25.100> were<00:02:25.490> made<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.150> little<00:02:26.540> bit<00:02:26.660> nicer<00:02:27.200> a

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
machines were made a little bit nicer a

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.270 
machines were made a little bit nicer a
brass<00:02:29.150> plate<00:02:29.600> was<00:02:29.960> started<00:02:30.380> on<00:02:30.500> over<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.040> keys

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
brass plate was started on over the keys

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.820 
brass plate was started on over the keys
and<00:02:31.700> then<00:02:32.480> these<00:02:32.780> ones<00:02:33.110> this<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.710> only

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
and then these ones this is the only

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.860 
and then these ones this is the only
time<00:02:34.100> that<00:02:34.130> we've<00:02:34.430> ever<00:02:34.610> seen<00:02:34.820> it<00:02:34.970> here<00:02:35.300> these

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
time that we've ever seen it here these

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.280
