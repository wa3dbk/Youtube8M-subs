00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.630
 Here we are and welcome back to my channel today 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.580
 an unboxing video review later 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.019
 really a lot of time here on mine 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.150
 channel but in view of the purchase of 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.129
 my new headphones in fact thank you 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.080
 so much for advice and comments 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.610
 that you did in so many videos where 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.750
 I asked for advice on which headphones 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.220
 go buy 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.860
 in the end I decided to buy the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.280
 the official stereo headphones for xbox 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.500
 world and then I'll go and tell why 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.150
 so this is the box but true 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.660
 obviously its content and we'll do one 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.750
 short video review on these headphones 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.280
 stereo on these stereo headsets to this one 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.430
 it's the box now I'll show you 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.260
 slowly all its content is a 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.590
 difficult as the box is 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.320
 really beautiful cicciotta barbie 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.940
 unpacking of the box 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.370
 I will show you all the course 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.070
 content then here are the headphones 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.080
 then there is also inside 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.400
 the xbox one stereo headphone adapter 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.980
 flight we're going to analyze 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.430
 then there will obviously be the usb cable for 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.280
 recharging our controller and then 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.830
 obviously all the various manuals 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.450
 with the various user guides 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.970
 installation guide languages and then 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.330
 obviously all the various information 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.910
 to keep ours better 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.920
 ours is so much our pair of 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.540
 headphones then these manuals meanwhile 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.250
 we can go and remove the cable 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.710
 usb meanwhile we can go to 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.800
 remove we start first with 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.810
 the stereo adapter then the adapter 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.820
 for xbox warner stereo headphones 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.030
 it's pretty much what you see 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.320
 particular because why this one goes to 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.360
 implement within the controller 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.460
 of our xbox one 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.700
 I'll show you here is the controller here 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.070
 below we go to place a lot 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.229
 easily and with a click you go to 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.179
 place a very comfortable thing because 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.670
 see we take the joystick like that 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.649
 we will have the possibility to juggle with 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.190
 better all our commands 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.899
 headphones 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.490
 so I think it's really something 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.020
 very comfortable I'm going to unplug it like this 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.369
 at least we are going to analyze it better 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.740
 that we are going to see then further 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.540
 obviously the jack to connect to 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.340
 our headphones or better ours 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.840
 xbox control below we have 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.310
 the three and a half adapter for 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.060
 place our headphones we could 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.040
 also go and put other headphones on 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.620
 game in case we wanted it later 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.660
 go and do here we have on the left 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.760
 two buttons the first allows us to 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.500
 do the game balance while 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.110
 the second the chat balance 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.489
 both are set to 50 and 50 per 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.670
 going to press we can for example 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.569
 go to a 100 0 for example 0 100 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.370
 what we want 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.270
 then we gave central for 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.430
 obviously turn off the microphone e 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.400
 this thing will allow us 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.230
 more than anything else you will see light up with 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.390
 a bar the microphone so this one is 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.299
 lights up orange on the right plus e 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.069
 less to settle the volume of ours 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.560
 volume of at the point of our game 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.840
 hence the game volume therefore very much 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.849
 this is very pleasant and very useful 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.980
 accessory to attach precisely to 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.200
 our controller the headphones instead 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.269
 here they are, look how beautiful they are 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.060
 maastricht and bodied but above all 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.579
 they have a really huge padding 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.000
 look at how big it is indeed it is a 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.950
 design over here that allows precisely the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.560
 maximum comfort on long sessions 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.819
 I obviously play the extendable bow 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.730
 on both sides 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:33.540
 the part above also here as you can 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.030
 see is very soft very much 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.209
 manageable below we obviously have the 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.859
 wire with our three and a half cable 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.989
 another very important thing about 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.659
 left side of our headphones 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.209
 we will have as you can see a giraffe microphone 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:50.340
 which disappears obviously closed 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.919
 they look like normal gaming headphones 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.169
 while then we can obviously do 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.030
 the microphone appears to play then 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:00.329
 to chat with our friends 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.699
 obviously written xbox on one side ed 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:06.329
 aesthetically I resume in glossy black 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:08.010
 on one side of our console and then 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.639
 obviously also the opaque part because 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.769
 you know that xbox van a shiny part e 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:17.220
 a part and opaque with regards to 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:20.220
 instead the audio at a wide wastes a 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.139
 wide audio spectrum ranging from 20 to 20 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.270
 kg verse therefore a complete leg of 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.159
 frequencies from the lowest to the highest 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.400
 I bought them in one of these 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:32.639
 large electronics chains at 49 euros e 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.250
 99 but I think it's really great 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.139
 value for money because why if 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.449
 consider that this accessory is 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.750
 the adapter for racing headphones 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:45.060
 he alone is about twenty euros 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.190
 bought separately consider for 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.759
 exclusion how much these can cost 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.650
 headphones 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:53.250
 obviously the stereo sound year 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.750
 microphone as I said giraffe there are 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.120
 very easy to install because one 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.680
 time we put them with the 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.570
 the adapter we connect and 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.910
 we put on xbox I will leave neither true nor 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.380
 own installation with the download of 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.840
 an important update to make 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.760
 just the whole configuration then 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.860
 in my opinion a value for money 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.020
 really good the audio is 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.120
 really excelled let me know if you 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.949
 you have them if you feel like 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.540
 buy what you think 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.889
 and if you liked the video sign up 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.389
