good playing with a standing and that
game<00:02:18.950> was<00:02:18.980> just<00:02:19.190> like<00:02:19.989> we<00:02:20.989> had<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.170> plan<00:02:21.440> they

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
game was just like we had a plan they

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.150 
game was just like we had a plan they
drafted<00:02:22.400> really<00:02:22.640> well<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.060> our<00:02:23.930> undying<00:02:24.860> pick

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
drafted really well and our undying pick

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.660 
drafted really well and our undying pick
had<00:02:25.550> no<00:02:25.820> real<00:02:26.090> space<00:02:26.600> to<00:02:26.870> do<00:02:27.019> any<00:02:27.800> undying<00:02:28.340> kind

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
had no real space to do any undying kind

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.320 
had no real space to do any undying kind
of<00:02:28.820> things<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.950> was<00:02:31.400> an<00:02:31.519> uphill<00:02:31.640> battle<00:02:31.790> and

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
of things so it was an uphill battle and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.750 
of things so it was an uphill battle and
once<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.170> game<00:02:33.350> got<00:02:33.530> out<00:02:33.590> of<00:02:33.739> hand<00:02:33.860> draw<00:02:34.370> visit

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
once the game got out of hand draw visit

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.120 
once the game got out of hand draw visit
she's<00:02:34.940> just<00:02:35.150> so<00:02:35.750> strong<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:36.350> you<00:02:36.800> know<00:02:36.890> we

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
she's just so strong and you know we

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.979 
she's just so strong and you know we
played<00:02:37.670> with<00:02:37.820> our<00:02:37.910> captain<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.540> we<00:02:38.750> didn't

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
played with our captain and we didn't

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.729 
played with our captain and we didn't
really<00:02:39.140> know<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:39.980> know<00:02:40.010> if<00:02:41.140> what<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.320> do<00:02:42.560> to

player<00:02:47.000> yes<00:02:47.420> definitely<00:02:48.760> I'm<00:02:49.760> really<00:02:50.269> happy

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
player yes definitely I'm really happy

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.800

to<00:02:50.510> extend<00:02:50.810> in<00:02:51.080> for<00:02:51.350> us<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:52.510> think<00:02:53.510> if<00:02:53.630> we

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
to extend in for us and I think if we

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.720 
to extend in for us and I think if we
would<00:02:53.959> have<00:02:54.050> had<00:02:54.230> more

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
would have had more

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.149 
would have had more
importance<00:02:56.480> than<00:02:56.900> seating<00:02:57.319> mattress<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:57.830> think

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
importance than seating mattress I think

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.589 
importance than seating mattress I think
we<00:02:58.220> would<00:02:58.370> have<00:02:58.400> been<00:02:58.879> able<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.120> show<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.390> lot

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
we would have been able to show a lot

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.110 
we would have been able to show a lot
more<00:02:59.750> also<00:03:00.080> but<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:01.280> relevance<00:03:01.700> of<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.909> game

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
more also but the relevance of the game

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.690 
more also but the relevance of the game
mean<00:03:02.959> that<00:03:03.230> also<00:03:03.860> meant<00:03:04.010> that<00:03:04.129> when<00:03:04.430> we<00:03:04.549> play

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
mean that also meant that when we play

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.600 
mean that also meant that when we play
with<00:03:04.849> the<00:03:04.909> stand<00:03:05.180> in<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:06.319> quality<00:03:06.680> is<00:03:06.890> just

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
with the stand in the quality is just

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.360 
with the stand in the quality is just
going<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.819> be<00:03:07.909> hard<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.290> do<00:03:09.290> your<00:03:09.440> best<00:03:09.590> also<00:03:10.069> a

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
going to be hard to do your best also a

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.610 
going to be hard to do your best also a
fun<00:03:11.239> question<00:03:11.629> will<00:03:11.810> we<00:03:11.840> see<00:03:12.049> me<00:03:12.170> but<00:03:12.290> today<00:03:12.470> by

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
fun question will we see me but today by

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.850 
fun question will we see me but today by
you<00:03:13.510> unlikely<00:03:14.510> but<00:03:14.900> there's<00:03:15.739> always<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:16.010> chance

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
you unlikely but there's always a chance

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.390 
you unlikely but there's always a chance
so<00:03:18.860> I<00:03:19.459> think<00:03:19.700> is<00:03:20.120> that<00:03:20.150> so<00:03:20.530> any<00:03:21.530> shutouts<00:03:21.950> maybe
