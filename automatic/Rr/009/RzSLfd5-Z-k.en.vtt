anything<00:00:41.940> my<00:00:42.090> view<00:00:42.510> which<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.110> hit<00:00:43.350> start<00:00:43.800> is

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
anything my view which I hit start is

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.900 
anything my view which I hit start is
Sam<00:00:45.230> he's<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:47.309> being<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.730> its

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
Sam he's that just being out of its

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:58.099 
Sam he's that just being out of its
pepper<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:55.730> that's<00:00:56.730> what<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.809> looks<00:00:57.960> like

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
pepper so that's what it looks like

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.189 
pepper so that's what it looks like
there's<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.500> blue<00:00:58.710> stream<00:00:59.270> this<00:01:00.270> kind<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.870> looks

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
there's a blue stream this kind of looks

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.100 
there's a blue stream this kind of looks
like<00:01:01.320> um<00:01:01.940> it's<00:01:02.940> good<00:01:03.180> little<00:01:03.449> frizzy<00:01:03.870> burner

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
like um it's good little frizzy burner

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.530 
like um it's good little frizzy burner
because<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:05.220> been<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.640> its<00:01:05.760> packet<00:01:06.180> but

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
because it's been out of its packet but

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:42.310 
because it's been out of its packet but
it<00:01:06.840> has<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> really<00:01:07.500> smooth<00:01:07.950> way<00:01:08.159> around<00:01:08.549> it

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.000 

there's<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.530> first<00:01:43.770> with<00:01:44.070> it

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.380 

so<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:49.790> goes<00:01:50.030> out<00:01:50.330> way<00:01:51.130> you<00:01:52.130> can<00:01:52.310> see<00:01:52.550> that<00:01:53.150> way

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
so it goes out way you can see that way

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.970 
so it goes out way you can see that way
that<00:01:53.750> I'm<00:01:53.840> talking<00:01:54.080> about<00:01:54.290> it<00:01:54.680> makes<00:01:54.860> it

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
that I'm talking about it makes it

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.950 
that I'm talking about it makes it
really<00:01:55.130> smooth<00:01:55.610> which<00:01:56.390> most<00:01:56.660> headphones

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
really smooth which most headphones

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.160 
really smooth which most headphones
don't<00:01:57.320> have

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:42.120 

so<00:02:02.740> it's<00:02:02.950> going<00:02:03.190> really<00:02:03.430> well<00:02:03.580> so<00:02:04.000> far

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.830 

really<00:02:43.130> drip<00:02:43.430> that<00:02:43.640> much<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.240> this<00:02:44.480> would<00:02:44.690> be

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
really drip that much so this would be

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.540 
really drip that much so this would be
good<00:02:45.020> felt<00:02:45.290> like<00:02:45.590> leaking<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.400> wasn't<00:02:46.670> like

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
good felt like leaking it wasn't like

00:02:48.550 --> 00:03:51.860 
good felt like leaking it wasn't like
I'm<00:02:49.550> gonna<00:02:49.790> squeeze<00:02:50.570> it<00:02:50.780> back

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.110 

so<00:03:52.870> that's<00:03:53.140> where<00:03:53.440> I<00:03:53.470> just<00:03:53.890> make<00:03:54.460> it<00:03:54.640> really

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
so that's where I just make it really

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.890 
so that's where I just make it really
easy<00:03:55.300> to<00:03:55.750> insert<00:03:56.380> and<00:03:56.770> off<00:03:57.130> what's<00:03:58.030> bucks<00:03:58.450> well

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
easy to insert and off what's bucks well

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
easy to insert and off what's bucks well
sir

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:27.159 

and<00:04:02.920> then<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.340> just<00:04:03.370> opens<00:04:04.000> like<00:04:04.300> a<00:04:04.660> No
