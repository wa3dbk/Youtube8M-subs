00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
big thing I see a lot of recreational

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.980 
big thing I see a lot of recreational
players<00:00:05.549> they<00:00:06.000> don't<00:00:06.029> understand<00:00:06.509> why<00:00:06.750> their

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
players they don't understand why their

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.350 
players they don't understand why their
miss<00:00:07.200> hitting<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.529> ball<00:00:07.710> one<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:09.210> would

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
miss hitting the ball one of the I would

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.089 
miss hitting the ball one of the I would
say<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.780> two<00:00:09.990> biggest<00:00:10.410> causes<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.920> miss

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
say the two biggest causes of miss

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.190 
say the two biggest causes of miss
hitting<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.429> ball<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.790> one<00:00:12.420> when<00:00:13.080> you're

through the stroke okay

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.939 
through the stroke okay
you<00:01:03.329> see<00:01:03.510> pros<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.840> Roger<00:01:04.170> Federer<00:01:04.619> do<00:01:04.769> this

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
you see pros like Roger Federer do this

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.530 
you see pros like Roger Federer do this
they're<00:01:05.309> constantly<00:01:05.939> hitting<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.360> ball

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
they're constantly hitting the ball

they're constantly hitting the ball
staying<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.500> line<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:08.549> looking<00:01:08.880> up<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
staying on line and then looking up the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.719 
staying on line and then looking up the
other<00:01:09.930> fix<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.650> make<00:01:10.950> sure<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.189> stay<00:01:11.460> with

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
other fix is to make sure you stay with

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.250 
other fix is to make sure you stay with
the<00:01:11.909> ball<00:01:12.030> longer<00:01:12.330> I'm<00:01:12.750> going<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.930> demo<00:01:13.110> this

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the ball longer I'm going to demo this

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.350 
the ball longer I'm going to demo this
first<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.590> I'm<00:01:13.680> going<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.890> move<00:01:14.010> out<00:01:14.189> now<00:01:15.090> make

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
first so I'm going to move out now make

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.880 
first so I'm going to move out now make
sure<00:01:15.390> when<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.630> hit<00:01:15.900> I'm<00:01:16.290> going<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.590> stay<00:01:16.860> on

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
sure when I hit I'm going to stay on

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.760 
sure when I hit I'm going to stay on
this<00:01:17.159> outside<00:01:17.729> leg<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.259> then<00:01:19.259> recover

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
this outside leg and then recover

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.460 
this outside leg and then recover
instead<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.720> coming<00:01:21.720> back<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.170> doing<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
instead of coming back and doing the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.679 
instead of coming back and doing the
recovery<00:01:22.860> too<00:01:23.009> soon<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.790> I'm<00:01:24.299> gonna<00:01:24.420> go<00:01:24.509> out

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
recovery too soon so I'm gonna go out

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.710 
recovery too soon so I'm gonna go out
I'm<00:01:25.159> stay<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> outside<00:01:26.490> leg<00:01:29.479> okay<00:01:30.479> outside

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
I'm stay on the outside leg okay outside

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.460 
I'm stay on the outside leg okay outside
leg

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
leg

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.300 
leg
compared<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.100> if<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.689> were<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.140> go<00:01:34.710> out<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.920> try

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
compared to if I were to go out and try

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.039 
compared to if I were to go out and try
to<00:01:35.340> recover<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.240> get<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.479> miss<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.869> can

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
to recover and we get to miss it I can

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.469 
to recover and we get to miss it I can
almost<00:01:37.170> make<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> miss<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.890> happen<00:01:38.240> every<00:01:39.240> time

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
almost make a miss it happen every time

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.420 
almost make a miss it happen every time
because<00:01:39.689> I'm<00:01:39.930> pulling<00:01:40.350> back<00:01:40.380> make<00:01:41.100> sure<00:01:41.280> we

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
because I'm pulling back make sure we

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.590 
because I'm pulling back make sure we
stay<00:01:41.610> out<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:43.799> outside<00:01:44.310> leg<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.970> that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
stay out on the outside leg and that
