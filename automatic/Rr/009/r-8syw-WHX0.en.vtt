00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:12.290
 and hello everyone I find it for 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.120
 the video that is this time on the 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.380
 shield of transformers made by 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.630
 vlad hop it's a type shield 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.369
 immune absorption against 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.010
 electrocution you will only find 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.619
 this type in electrocution immunity you 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.800
 will not find on fire yet at the in 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.650
 explosive then that's 36% of its 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.090
 observations 32 oil capacity of 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.350
 good shields it's the same manufacturer 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.399
 than shame but good compared to his 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.289
 small observation 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.539
 he has a large amount of a great 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.069
 multi ability excuse me or the loot 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:44.690
 but you will only have the look of 

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:46.760
 pierrot the whew because simply 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.239
 I did not succeed even after you 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.949
 put the video need your opinion I 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.539
 still tried in case I got 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.229
 said to make the attempts I tried 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.699
 to activate some quests I think 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.469
 that alain I think that to my subscribers 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.969
 that I have a friend on the xbox live in 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.619
 his monsters shoot who had told me 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.130
 to try a technique in fact it was 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.479
 to go to the species darren cahill fire 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.549
 exploitation preserves to leave the 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.780
 save and reload the map 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:17.990
 unfortunately it does not work I've been here 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.729
 it's this game but it's totally there 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.009
 is totally buggy I thought rather 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.530
 dense is my place and texture bugs 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.090
 it's all coming out of my eyes 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.130
 for as long as they go out they have 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.560
 not even they did not even patch 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.170
 to still correct these small 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.979
 mistakes what is quite confusing because 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.420
 that they made a patch by cons 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.369
 for patty and the be did it for 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.399
 increase the life of some bosses such 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.749
 that terra all that by cons they do 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.800
 fast but for all that 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:48.050
 is 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.660
 patches and patches and textures for them 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.810
 blocks of textures or or simon where 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.340
 some some monsters some boss 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.200
 we can say the spawn of some bosses 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.150
 are buggy sags the past corif 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.870
 frankly it's deplorable one of their 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.450
 parent on the part of saying boxing that's who 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.500
 do I want to tell you else 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.180
 I clearly passed as I say 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.380
 never two without three the major scud 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.140
 is still passing through the hands 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.750
 here we say never two without three 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.770
 it's frustrating I thought 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.450
 will stop I'm going to stop now 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.480
 unfortunately I recommend bossi he 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.490
 must I do all his weapons 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.970
 this is where I am I tear myself away 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.850
 the hair 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.130
 that's it gold in the video there will be 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.810
 simon on the 200 attempt he knew 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.130
 that once again I managed to get it 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.050
 I think I 'm going to him yesterday since 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.300
 go there I'm going m 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.040
 I put this video there in the end I you 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.970
 put a little bonus where fell me loose 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.860
 deliverance this is what I 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.860
 wanted to say else I do not know if I 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.330
 am going to make a contest because 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.560
 I bought 10 space 3 against all the 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.750
 world knows that I said space 3 on 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.100
 origin and I had ordered the edition 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.750
 limited I had the right to weapons at 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.000
 very early men in addition that it's 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.650
 like the good one we do not care and I 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.060
 had the right said space one who does not know 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.580
 not added my library but hey I 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.860
 received by mail by origin code 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.500
 activation my activation key for 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.450
 say space 1 to find out if you 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.520
 interested everyone who is on pc 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.500
 unfortunately those who are on ps3 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.200
 xbox will have nothing if you have a pc 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.880
 which is quite powerful at least I 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.870
 think a configuration 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:27.500
 at least have a dual-core processor 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:32.840
 I think in 2007 giga hertz and a map 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.700
 graph gma 500 6 500 mo in memory 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.560
 on a graphics card that will suffice I do not 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.330
 do not know at all do you inquire when 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.380
 even before I participate here I do not 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.270
 do not know when do I do this 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.400
 video you're interested you 'll make a 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.930
 video contest to win 10 space a 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.610
 good it's true it's not it's a 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.230
 game that broke old I do not have 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.590
 insisted on my pc since I 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.540
 had it on xbox 360 the challenge it was 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:02.090
 for me a very good games ak and space 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:04.250
 leave pretty scary enough then 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.610
 simon it's a ranger it's relative 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.190
 at leicester drawbar edge and pumbaa there 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.900
 they are named Simon and Toumba Toumba 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.760
 has signed up for wading if it's a 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.420
 gold ranger it's an honor that's 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.040
 easy to kill or good when I put it in 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.720
 phase 1 it's pretty fast that's it 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.490
 quite fast especially as scherzinger who 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.430
 is a capture a rate of fire that 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.090
 is quite high sailing and sailing and sailing 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.820
 york 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.920
 I do that with the master spin 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.200
 I do not give up like that where I 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.070
 do not know every time I did my 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.840
 hulu videos pass through 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:44.200
 but hey I think I'll go 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.200
 leave there go ciao go over
