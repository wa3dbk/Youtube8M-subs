00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
versions of the speed and cadence

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.329 
versions of the speed and cadence
sensors<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.570> look<00:00:12.749> like<00:00:12.929> this<00:00:13.169> here<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.799> the

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:14.339 
sensors that look like this here is the

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.580 
sensors that look like this here is the
cadence<00:00:14.759> sensor<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.299> here<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.230> speed

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
cadence sensor and here is the speed

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.340

sensor over on the left before you begin
you<00:00:19.590> want<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.770> make<00:00:19.830> sure<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.220> your<00:00:20.370> firmware

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
you want to make sure that your firmware

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.850 
you want to make sure that your firmware
is<00:00:20.910> up-to-date<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.570> your<00:00:21.720> Phoenix<00:00:22.050> 2<00:00:22.290> and<00:00:22.530> you

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
is up-to-date on your Phoenix 2 and you

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.710 
is up-to-date on your Phoenix 2 and you

though you don't have to use both you
can<00:00:29.160> use<00:00:29.400> one<00:00:29.730> or<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.240> other<00:00:30.420> speed<00:00:30.960> or

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
can use one or the other speed or

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.650 
can use one or the other speed or
cadence<00:00:31.680> well<00:00:32.489> we'll<00:00:32.610> start<00:00:32.850> by<00:00:33.180> holding<00:00:33.450> down

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
cadence well we'll start by holding down

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.660 
cadence well we'll start by holding down
our<00:00:34.109> menu<00:00:34.469> button<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:34.859> a<00:00:34.920> second<00:00:35.339> we<00:00:35.429> need<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
our menu button for a second we need to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.630 
our menu button for a second we need to
get<00:00:35.820> into<00:00:36.269> our<00:00:36.570> settings<00:00:37.109> so<00:00:37.499> there<00:00:37.829> we<00:00:37.949> go<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
get into our settings so there we go and

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.520 
get into our settings so there we go and
now<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.269> list<00:00:39.539> we'll<00:00:39.749> scroll<00:00:40.019> down<00:00:40.079> and

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
now in this list we'll scroll down and

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.399 
now in this list we'll scroll down and
we<00:00:41.129> will<00:00:41.339> select<00:00:41.579> sensors<00:00:42.449> now<00:00:42.989> we<00:00:43.050> want<00:00:43.320> to

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:43.409 
we will select sensors now we want to

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:46.759 
we will select sensors now we want to
scroll<00:00:43.649> down<00:00:43.859> here<00:00:44.309> until<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:45.239> get<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.929> bike

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
scroll down here until we get to bike

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.579 
scroll down here until we get to bike
cadence<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.609> then<00:00:47.909> we<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.269> bike<00:00:48.659> speed<00:00:49.260> so

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
cadence and then we have bike speed so

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:51.559 
cadence and then we have bike speed so
like<00:00:49.769> I<00:00:49.890> said<00:00:49.949> you<00:00:50.249> can<00:00:50.399> pair<00:00:50.640> one<00:00:50.940> or<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:51.569 
like I said you can pair one or the

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:52.759 
like I said you can pair one or the
other<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.140> even<00:00:52.260> buy<00:00:52.530> them

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
other and you can even buy them

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.250 
other and you can even buy them
separately<00:00:53.280> or<00:00:53.489> together<00:00:53.819> if<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.359> choose<00:00:54.629> you

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
separately or together if you choose you

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.229 
separately or together if you choose you
might<00:00:55.440> notice<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.769> I<00:00:55.949> scrolled<00:00:56.399> right<00:00:56.879> past

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
might notice that I scrolled right past

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.020 
might notice that I scrolled right past
bike<00:00:57.960> speed<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.800> cadence<00:00:59.069> combined<00:00:59.819> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
bike speed and cadence combined and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.340 
bike speed and cadence combined and
that's<00:01:00.149> because<00:01:00.479> that's<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> older

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
that's because that's for the older

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.100 
that's because that's for the older
version<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.039> cadence<00:01:02.429> sensor<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.969> GSC<00:01:03.449> 10

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
version of the cadence sensor the GSC 10

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.170 
version of the cadence sensor the GSC 10
if<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> newer<00:01:05.220> version<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:06.000> I

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
if you have the newer version like I

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.940 
if you have the newer version like I
have<00:01:06.509> here<00:01:06.930> you're<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.500> want<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> pair

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
have here you're going to want to pair

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.969 
have here you're going to want to pair
them<00:01:08.100> individually<00:01:08.820> one<00:01:09.210> at<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.479> time<00:01:09.799> let's<00:01:10.799> go

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
them individually one at a time let's go

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.649 
them individually one at a time let's go
ahead<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.280> start<00:01:11.460> by<00:01:11.640> pairing<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.119> cadence

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
ahead and start by pairing the cadence

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.569 
ahead and start by pairing the cadence
sensor<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.560> can<00:01:13.710> select<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.189> from<00:01:14.430> our

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
sensor so we can select this from our

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.490 
sensor so we can select this from our
menu<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.659> our<00:01:15.780> status<00:01:16.229> screen

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
menu here we have our status screen

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.380 
menu here we have our status screen
right<00:01:16.710> now<00:01:16.860> showing<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.399> as<00:01:17.520> off<00:01:17.729> when<00:01:18.270> we

right now showing it as off when we

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.120 
right now showing it as off when we
select<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.899> we<00:01:19.079> have<00:01:19.170> three<00:01:19.469> options<00:01:19.649> on

select that we have three options on

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.310 
select that we have three options on
that's<00:01:20.969> if<00:01:21.149> you<00:01:21.270> are<00:01:21.390> reconnecting<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.200> a

that's if you are reconnecting to a

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.719 
that's if you are reconnecting to a
cadence<00:01:22.649> sensor<00:01:22.950> that's<00:01:23.280> already<00:01:23.520> been

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.980 
paired before off and down at the bottom
is<00:01:26.189> what<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.520> need<00:01:26.759> new<00:01:27.119> search<00:01:27.450> because<00:01:27.810> we're

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
is what we need new search because we're

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.139 
is what we need new search because we're
pairing<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.469> one<00:01:28.680> for<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> first<00:01:29.130> time<00:01:29.430> so

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
pairing this one for the first time so

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.149 
pairing this one for the first time so
we'll<00:01:30.299> go<00:01:30.390> ahead<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.869> select<00:01:31.140> new<00:01:31.829> search

we'll go ahead and select new search

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.770 
we'll go ahead and select new search
like<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.609> said<00:01:32.820> before<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.359> want<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.630> make<00:01:33.689> sure

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
like I said before you want to make sure

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.389 
like I said before you want to make sure
whatever<00:01:34.320> sensor<00:01:34.770> you're<00:01:34.890> pairing<00:01:35.280> is

it<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.000> pair<00:01:48.450> with<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.500> now<00:01:49.859> we<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.159> repeat

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
it and pair with it so now we can repeat

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.760 
it and pair with it so now we can repeat
the<00:01:50.880> same<00:01:51.179> thing<00:01:51.450> again<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.409> with
