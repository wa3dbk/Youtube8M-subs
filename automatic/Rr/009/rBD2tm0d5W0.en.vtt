00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.980
 we 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.230
 hello everyone i love you do 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:36.920
 today a little review on my 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:43.970
 sephora brushes so I have 7.4 for 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:46.040
 the complexion and 3 for the eyes so I 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.840
 uses an alternation with merial 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.790
 technical and mexico but I like them 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.780
 a lot it's really a good range 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:58.250
 it's in the id range pin with 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.260
 league man show colorful each brush 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.019
 and excuse me every brush to a 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.019
 small plastic protection 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.970
 so that's good guys its keeping theirs well 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.870
 form 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:19.270
 so here we have the powder brush 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:23.320
 number 120 I do not know if you will see 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:28.460
 so it's a big powder brush 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.710
 dust big brush powder that was 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.409
 super that's that's a bit similar or 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:41.600
 real technique 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:45.920
 here but still a little less 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.649
 a little less sweet then my 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.149
 second brush for the complexion is the 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:58.539
 natural blush 231 same with a kit 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:02.090
 protection so it's a brush to 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:05.479
 nails to apply the bluff that is 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.300
 very well so very sweet so who has nothing 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.980
 to see by cons with the real technical 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:19.960
 yes the difference one angle and the other 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:28.270
 plus + f so and very well 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:30.340
 I have a fiber duo so that's for the 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.620
 little cream blush or sometimes I do 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.160
 also use it to put my anti 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.730
 dark circles 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.490
 it is very well the little ones so here 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.940
 the duo fiber from real thermal is 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.670
 different but he's a little bigger 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:52.170
 more than that here is the difference between 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:56.740
 both so I like a lot and finally 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.560
 the 110 the bottom of your synthetic 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.670
 so that's to apply the funds 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.880
 creamy liquid complexion 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.880
 that's pretty big as you 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.250
 see so perfect too I like 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.350
 use otherwise to confuse the funds 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.180
 complexion gimont g that of the range 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.210
 bridge minerals you see that 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:31.990
 that 's it's similar to the level at 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:35.410
 size what i have the lowest 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.600
 for the bottom kg no brush background of 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.080
 rhythmic complexion 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.600
 I use this one month the buzz fine 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.080
 mouth yes it's not at all the same 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.300
 thing 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.650
 the application is slower with the one 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.720
 ci compared to this here after 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.880
 we are going to brush with them for 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:03.250
 eyes so I have three so I have the 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:05.080
 very badly the 235 or cream so that 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.150
 is perfect for applying shadows to 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.670
 creamy eyelids and then the shadows 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.670
 normal powder I used it as well 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.920
 for two years follows so I have a 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.150
 little beef a pin so to do 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.520
 the hollow of the eyelid is the 230 which 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:28.030
 is perfect too so that is getting closer 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:32.919
 peaks at olemps fluffy the 25 time and 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:35.140
 I pose is this one then a little more 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:40.419
 round this one compared to that one 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:44.290
 sails and sailboats wholesale this place because 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:46.090
 that's basically so sephora's is 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.840
 a little bit smaller than kara 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:53.770
 but it's similar to almost 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.570
 and to finish I have old it's a 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.870
 brush for tapas for the eyes but 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.240
 or 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.640
 I also use for sure it's 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.100
 the anti siena is the number 100 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.080
 ok so that's so perfect for 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.140
 the dark circles and I also use for 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:12.280
 to put eye shadows so that's it 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:24.270
 so in sim to this one with respect to 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:28.660
 cinema technical bar a look mlf 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:35.169
 here are my technical pilgrim brushes 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:37.690
 it's more the fish happened I see 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.910
 there a smaller so this one is the 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.580
 online chat 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:46.979
 you see a little co-op cooperative 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:50.200
 like that 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:52.900
 and that's all I have in myself 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:58.540
 range at the same time so that's it 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:06:00.550
 all I have in brush a brush 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.270

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.490
 very girly and more with the colors and 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:13.479

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:18.669
