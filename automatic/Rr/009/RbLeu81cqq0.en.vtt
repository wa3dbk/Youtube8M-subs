rotary<00:04:18.199> engine<00:04:18.350> I<00:04:18.829> guess<00:04:19.009> it's<00:04:19.160> a<00:04:19.250> named

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
rotary engine I guess it's a named

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.780 
rotary engine I guess it's a named
this<00:04:22.460> engine<00:04:23.210> has<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.509> change<00:04:24.400> change<00:04:25.400> with<00:04:25.639> on

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
this engine has to change change with on

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.150 
this engine has to change change with on
a<00:04:25.840> newer<00:04:27.160> engine<00:04:28.160> from<00:04:28.430> I<00:04:28.729> guess<00:04:29.650> 1986<00:04:30.650> from<00:04:31.009> a

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
a newer engine from I guess 1986 from a

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.499 
a newer engine from I guess 1986 from a
master<00:04:31.930> six<00:04:32.930> to<00:04:33.080> six<00:04:33.320> I<00:04:33.470> guess<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:34.370> now<00:04:35.150> it<00:04:35.360> has

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
master six to six I guess and now it has

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:40.840 
master six to six I guess and now it has
actually<00:04:37.300> a<00:04:38.300> chronic<00:04:39.070> brain<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:40.460> it<00:04:40.610> has

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
actually a chronic brain and it has

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.999 
actually a chronic brain and it has
injection<00:04:41.810> you<00:04:42.050> know<00:04:43.000> so<00:04:44.380> it<00:04:45.380> runs<00:04:45.650> quite

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
injection you know so it runs quite

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:55.839 
injection you know so it runs quite
smoothly

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849
