00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.180 
wide this is the most important one here
510<00:03:13.209> pixels<00:03:13.629> wide<00:03:13.810> that's<00:03:14.769> because<00:03:15.160> a

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
510 pixels wide that's because a

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.030 
510 pixels wide that's because a
Facebook<00:03:15.819> page<00:03:16.090> width<00:03:16.510> is<00:03:16.810> no<00:03:17.379> more<00:03:17.590> than<00:03:17.739> five

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
hundred and twenty pixels wide so we

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.830 
hundred and twenty pixels wide so we
want<00:03:21.069> to<00:03:21.099> make<00:03:21.280> sure<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.730> all<00:03:21.849> of<00:03:21.879> our<00:03:22.120> images

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840

and everything that we put in the page
is<00:03:24.519> less<00:03:25.180> than<00:03:25.690> five<00:03:26.260> hundred<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.769> twenty<00:03:27.160> so

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
is less than five hundred and twenty so

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.520 
is less than five hundred and twenty so
to<00:03:27.459> be<00:03:27.670> on<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.849> safe<00:03:28.060> side<00:03:28.169> we<00:03:29.169> just<00:03:29.380> make

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
everything 510 pixels wide and then we

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.250 
everything 510 pixels wide and then we
know<00:03:33.280> it's<00:03:33.459> going<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.609> fit<00:03:33.940> nicely<00:03:34.239> within<00:03:34.840> the
