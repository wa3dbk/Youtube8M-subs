once you've got your gauge you're ready
to<00:00:01.949> begin<00:00:02.100> your<00:00:02.250> hat<00:00:02.610> we're<00:00:03.240> going<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.419> do<00:00:03.480> the

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
to begin your hat we're going to do the

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.599 
to begin your hat we're going to do the
longtail<00:00:04.020> cast<00:00:04.350> on<00:00:04.620> so<00:00:04.920> for<00:00:05.130> starters<00:00:05.310> you're

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
longtail cast on so for starters you're

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.579 
longtail cast on so for starters you're
going<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.790> need<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.120> estimate<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:07.170> tail<00:00:07.379> you

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
going to need to estimate the tail you

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.860 
going to need to estimate the tail you
need<00:00:07.799> one<00:00:08.610> rule<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:08.970> thumb<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.540> use

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
need one rule of thumb is to use

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.410 
need one rule of thumb is to use
approximately<00:00:10.559> three<00:00:11.280> times<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.940> length<00:00:12.179> of

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
approximately three times the length of

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.089 
approximately three times the length of
what<00:00:12.599> you're<00:00:12.719> knitting<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.349> if<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:13.620> hat<00:00:13.889> has

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
what you're knitting so if this hat has

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.640 
what you're knitting so if this hat has
a<00:00:14.160> circumference<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.929> 15<00:00:15.929> inches<00:00:16.320> we're<00:00:16.529> going

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
a circumference of 15 inches we're going

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.220 
a circumference of 15 inches we're going
to<00:00:16.710> use<00:00:16.920> approximately<00:00:17.300> 45<00:00:18.300> inches

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
to use approximately 45 inches

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.380 
to use approximately 45 inches
I'm<00:00:19.470> guessing<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.160> that's<00:00:20.820> where<00:00:21.060> your<00:00:21.150> slip

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
I'm guessing and that's where your slip

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.240 
I'm guessing and that's where your slip
knot<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.869> going<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.140> be<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.470> that's<00:00:22.949> why<00:00:23.189> this

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
knot is going to be and that's why this

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.640 
knot is going to be and that's why this
is<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.550> longtail<00:00:23.970> cast<00:00:24.300> on<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:25.380> you're<00:00:25.500> going<00:00:25.619> to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
is a longtail cast on so you're going to

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.500 
is a longtail cast on so you're going to
make<00:00:25.830> your<00:00:26.010> slip<00:00:26.189> knot<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:27.119> way<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.359> did

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
make your slip knot the way we did

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.830 
make your slip knot the way we did
earlier<00:00:28.369> bring<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.519> through<00:00:29.760> that's<00:00:30.630> your

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
earlier bring that through that's your

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.450 
earlier bring that through that's your
first<00:00:31.050> stitch<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.619> take<00:00:31.830> your<00:00:32.009> circular

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
first stitch you take your circular

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.870 
first stitch you take your circular
needle<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.350> you<00:00:34.350> do<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.890> longtail<00:00:35.370> cast<00:00:35.670> on

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
needle and you do the longtail cast on

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.190 
needle and you do the longtail cast on
and<00:00:36.090> I'm<00:00:36.180> going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> do<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.630> really<00:00:36.809> quick

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
and I'm going to do it really quick

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.280 
and I'm going to do it really quick
because<00:00:37.680> we<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.129> about<00:00:38.309> 49<00:00:38.670> stitches<00:00:39.290> but

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
because we have about 49 stitches but

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.500 
because we have about 49 stitches but
just<00:00:40.590> as<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> reminder<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.550> would<00:00:42.120> take<00:00:42.360> the

just as a reminder you would take the
yarn<00:00:42.780> make<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> fist<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.160> part<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.239> like

yarn make a fist on it part it like

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.850 
yarn make a fist on it part it like
curtains<00:00:45.809> bring<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.350> down

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860

for starters and sometimes people put in

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.529 
for starters and sometimes people put in
markers<00:00:58.800> every<00:00:59.129> 25<00:00:59.579> stitches<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.180> know<00:01:00.329> where

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
markers every 25 stitches to know where

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.540 
markers every 25 stitches to know where
they<00:01:00.690> are<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:01.469> sometimes<00:01:02.039> they<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.340> keep

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
they are or sometimes they just keep

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.100 
they are or sometimes they just keep
going<00:01:02.850> till<00:01:03.030> their<00:01:03.210> tail<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.629> almost<00:01:03.809> done<00:01:04.229> I

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
going till their tail is almost done I

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.630 
going till their tail is almost done I
usually<00:01:07.110> go<00:01:07.439> until<00:01:07.680> my<00:01:07.830> tail<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.159> almost<00:01:08.430> done

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
usually go until my tail is almost done

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.240 
usually go until my tail is almost done
unless<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.270> lot<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.659> stitches<00:01:10.220> so<00:01:11.220> let's

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
unless it's a lot of stitches so let's

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.780 
unless it's a lot of stitches so let's
see<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:11.909> have<00:01:12.000> 2<00:01:12.180> 4<00:01:12.630> 6<00:01:12.659> 8<00:01:13.290> 10<00:01:16.400> 25<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.640> we're

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
see we have 2 4 6 8 10 25 so we're

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.110 
see we have 2 4 6 8 10 25 so we're
almost<00:01:17.909> halfway<00:01:18.270> there

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.340 

all<00:01:26.120> right<00:01:26.330> so<00:01:26.570> then<00:01:26.750> once<00:01:26.960> you've<00:01:27.140> got<00:01:27.320> your

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
all right so then once you've got your

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.920 
all right so then once you've got your
stitches<00:01:27.830> on<00:01:27.950> your<00:01:27.980> needle<00:01:28.840> you're<00:01:29.840> gonna

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
stitches on your needle you're gonna

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.380 
stitches on your needle you're gonna
need<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.290> join<00:01:30.500> it<00:01:30.710> in<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:30.920> round<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.430> what

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
need to join it in the round and what

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.290 
need to join it in the round and what
happens<00:01:32.780> there<00:01:33.110> is<00:01:33.370> you're<00:01:34.370> going<00:01:34.580> to<00:01:34.790> bring

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
happens there is you're going to bring

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.380 
happens there is you're going to bring
your<00:01:35.420> needles<00:01:35.780> together<00:01:36.140> I<00:01:36.970> actually<00:01:37.970> should

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
your needles together I actually should

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.820 
your needles together I actually should
have<00:01:38.420> put<00:01:38.630> on<00:01:38.660> a<00:01:38.780> few<00:01:38.990> more<00:01:39.050> extra<00:01:39.380> stitches

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
have put on a few more extra stitches

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.810 
have put on a few more extra stitches
because<00:01:39.890> I'm<00:01:40.130> almost<00:01:40.280> there

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
because I'm almost there

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.590 
because I'm almost there
so<00:01:41.150> we'll<00:01:41.300> just<00:01:41.450> slide<00:01:41.660> a<00:01:41.720> few<00:01:41.960> more<00:01:42.140> on<00:01:46.600> all

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600
