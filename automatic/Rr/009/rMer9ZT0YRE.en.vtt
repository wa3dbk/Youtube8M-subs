mistake they just relentlessly put a

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.210 
mistake they just relentlessly put a
pressure<00:01:39.150> mid<00:01:39.630> then<00:01:40.200> bought<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.770> then<00:01:40.950> top

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
pressure mid then bought and then top

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.039 
pressure mid then bought and then top
just<00:01:41.640> time<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.270> time<00:01:42.299> after<00:01:42.720> again

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
just time and that time after again

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.170 
just time and that time after again
despite<00:01:43.439> failing<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.009> push<00:01:44.220> mid<00:01:44.490> lane<00:01:44.670> they

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
despite failing to push mid lane they

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.170 
despite failing to push mid lane they
are<00:01:45.360> pushing<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.110> hardcore<00:01:46.860> non-stop<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.820> I

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
are pushing it hardcore non-stop and I

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.179 
are pushing it hardcore non-stop and I
think<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.720> was<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:48.899> kind<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.439> pressure<00:01:49.799> that

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
think it was that kind of pressure that
