00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.560
 and 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.150
 ah 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.389
 ah 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:23.500
 according to who saw it in the title date 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.210
 of exit of the new dlc of great future 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.560
 line the summer s that already the 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.689
 people have waited so long since it was 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.509
 announced by rockstar games in his 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.360
 official website rockstar newswire 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.710
 games for then one thing for which 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.720
 wonder what does not come out this is not a 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.330
 100% exact date but it is more or 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.129
 least one theory of mine and one thing that the 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.170
 truth can be very true apart from 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.809
 that we think about the part 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.789
 how would rockstargames think for this 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.160
 game then let's do let's go to 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.680
 make things clear not things like 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.719
 are the dlc is obviously spring 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.000
 because spring has already started because the 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.329
 spring more or less starts between the 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.710
 20 starts on March 21 to 23 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.720
 September but obviously they are not going to 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.550
 to take out so late is something that they take it out 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.830
 next month or are they going to take it out 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.479
 Now they're going to take it out for me right now 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.850
 I read in a comment that put rockstar 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.440
 just in fact put it yesterday I do not remember 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.810
 very good now but look say hello to 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.369
 all good for good to see so much is 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.380
 enthusiasm for the changes we have 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.119
 planned in big auto online and more 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.740
 there ok says for those who ask 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.200
 when 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.420
 can not wait to see these changes 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.430
 the first one will be the creator capture that 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.710
 will be available the other week so 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.840
 those who already want to create the missions of 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.759
 capture will already be the other week but 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.740
 the update of hank live and robberies 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.630
 to banks it will be later than spring and 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.210
 Stay tuned for more updates on 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.399
 newswires as your social network to put it 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.619
 as well as subtype facebook twitter where 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.220
 before they announce everything then why 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.659
 now let's see the other point its 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.179
 competition what is against the 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.530
 rock star say ok then the first thing that 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.850
 is against rock mange by 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.409
 tell it against it but that is a 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.560
 competition such as call of duty and 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.030
 battlefield is watch docs white sox by 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.130
 what we know is a type of games 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.160
 albox that the truth is a game that 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.619
 A lot of people are waiting who are fans of 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.299
 so to speak , sandbox type or 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.549
 of all that third-person everything 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.989
 this and this game is created by ruby 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.459
 sophie we already know that it is very expected 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.799
 for people and more for those who like 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.290
 the grand theft auto game or 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.760
 it is like sandbox type but in a 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.190
 sandbox with adventure and action 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.109
 then this Thursday to May 27 and 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.280
 as they notice the departure date of 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:32.490
 spring part d 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.200
 this game is a type of game that is 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.940
 unwraps in the city of chicago and is 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.770
 completely different from the saints 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.630
 because the saints is well increased in 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.160
 the angels then if we take in 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.470
 account the west box what we can know 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.090
 as a reference is that rockstar like 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.300
 that he has it in mind because that's how he thinks 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.459
 in getting what a new dlc is doing 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.950
 so to speak but for what it is 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.350
 being spring and if you notice it 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.540
 we agree the dates between the 27 of 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.370
 May the date out of what's going 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.650
 doing west box and here I think what 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.200
 they want to implement is like 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.030
 create a DLCI with what most await the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.070
 people of great factor to leave it 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.590
 hooked so to speak well leave it 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.540
 well tied leave him wanting to play 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.370
 bigger your car and more and more and more and 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.319
 more is what so main thing is 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.200
 makes a dlc to keep the audience 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.540
 because we know that by 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.340
 company if we know that the audience 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.200
 we will leave the same the same as 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.580
 the same thing is going to be true 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.080
 point where they will get bored and go to 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.000
 want more then here is when the 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.160
 people come to buy another game les them 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.530
 I put the case in the dlc those of leces 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.790
 they are the thing that the truth gives more life 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.709
 to the games because 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.930
 because it practically gives you as a 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.730
 more time they do not leave us for cut 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.260
 but they give us a little bit more then 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.670
 I really like the what's dogs and I'm going to 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.189
 buy what I'm going to buy for xbox one 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.989
 but obviously seeing it from my point 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.700
 of view if the watch docs 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.319
 obviously he would spend more time 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.209
 great fauto because I like his more 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.189
 style other than that watch docs is 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.200
 first obviously the company that 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:01.319
 then he creates the psuv and sophie we know that 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.139
 is ubisoft what are the 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.670
 third parties and the sandboxes are very 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.109
 good dice look with assassin's 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.239
 believe the truth that the assassins believe 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.159
 they are video games that I have left 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.959
 hooked but let's finish the 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.700
 history and up there and great self-employed 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.530
 in great pictures I can play it play 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.419
 play play and it does not bore you because it 's 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.609
 something repetitive but it is something that has 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.370
 your own style and that very good part 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.730
 then this new game by ubisoft of 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.310
 what are you doing as a guy 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.230
 the grand theft auto type iv with what 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.760
 we already know that he has a good reputation 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.860
 what they do or ubisoft to create those 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.970
 guys realizing that I believe what 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.010
 is doing 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.450
 assassin's creed we can know what it is 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.190
 be very good game then I think that 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.140
 here what the company did is that 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.000
 already considered this game then 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.650
 all this is my theory nothing else I see your 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.320
 type of marketing what will come out 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.240
 what's new your competition is like I say 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.040
 let's see I'm going to get a new shirt and 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.780
 I see that the competition takes a nice 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.720
 design then I have to implement 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.820
 another design to attract more people towards 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.980
 me and stay more with me then it's 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.170
 a simple thing that the truth I see it 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.820
 from this point of view seeing it from 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.600
 marketing mode apart from that 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.370
 great picture is a game very very was very 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.140
 good his game the truth that yes had 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.810
 a lot of success was very good then 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.580
 I hope you liked it and where else or 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.710
 least I think it's going to be by the end 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.180
 of May more or less this dlc and they are going to 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.950
 have people hooked up as well as 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.960
 say when will you leave when when 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.630
 because more or less can not take more than 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.400
 a month is what I can assure in this 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.380
 it's not safe at all I did not take it from any 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.670
 new page I started to see quartz dogs 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.600
 because it's a game that I since I 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.280
 I saw that they announced it 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.900
 and I'm waiting for it and more for 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.760
 new consoles that looks pretty father 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.490
 then I hope you liked the video 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.170
 leave me in the comments box what 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.880
 you think about it what they 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.740
 it seems you do not forget to follow me in 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.480
 twitter remember that there is a raffle of 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.970
 a hacked account of grand theft 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.730
 car 5 in case someone wants to know go 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.110
 to the channel and check it and then nothing 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.670
 It has been all I had to tell you 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.810
 today they return to give like favorites 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.730
 subscribe to the channel if they are not 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:03.340
 subscribed but they liked the video and 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.340
 no more to say I say goodbye goodbye
