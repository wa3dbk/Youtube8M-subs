00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hey friends and welcome back to 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.849
 a smaller chat tutorial here from 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.910
 euromaster extremely on all tv and 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.469
 today yes you see we are in the game 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.990
 a multiplayer server and on the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.420
 comma the server a little round 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.189
 energy mcr and as you probably do 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.080
 already taken in the title possible 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.789
 you hold the small speed tail 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.820
 imagine who also, of course, 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.260
 multiplayer one runs although there is 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.910
 some servers as well as for example 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.210
 Gomer has the servers against it 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.250
 are protected and you keep coming back 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.070
 but it will be dismantled here at the beginning in 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.590
 ender games to get that done there 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.809
 So that will work in time 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.239
 not returned and you can as 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.000
 first of all the other boxes 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.920
 invited that are crucial 2 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.739
 milliseconds ahead 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.590
 you will see five seconds now 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.440
 Let's go now we said to the hospital 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.420
 kneer now and I'm at the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.989
 crate has two direct someone everything from 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.989
 put the box 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.700
 Immediately we are now after the intro 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.580
 just hates to show me that too 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.640
 in the so in your normal 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.729
 vanilla world without problems I work 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.229
 Run into the back of the bed and you 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.170
 we can just see the whole here 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.770
 time jump fast and run this 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.780
 that yes and now I'll show you something 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:44.509
 you have to do it with you too 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:47.420
 clear now after the intro 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.560
 right video and now want to 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.700
 I only briefly show you that 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.410
 If I am here on the 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.119
 I will touch you 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.030
 will show again that I 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.710
 no speed so that 's it already here 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.289
 again on micro we catch again 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.060
 What we offer with the program 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.590
 Last time you had yourselves 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.409
 download the link below in the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.670
 description yes if you the previous one 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.080
 have not seen the video worth it 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.800
 In any case, I'll show you there 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.600
 how to level and items critical so when 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.760
 we'll have it opened promptly 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.670
 first on the button on windows 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.709
 lets and on minecraft 1.8 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.930
 we play that way when you see it now 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.239
 have 18 if you are in the other 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.040
 mission you can do it here anyway 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.390
 I do not guarantee you will try 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.590
 that it works but i think so 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.610
 already that it will work like that 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.230
 but if we did that now 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.360
 then up here too we go 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.220
 first drag an edit settings rhine 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.070
 Let's go in here and go 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.530
 Of course, xfx does not generally set 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.890
 generally settings in the skin case purely 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.850
 then we set the 100 first 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.739
 on the 5 and do not worry that I am here 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.510
 on speed 1, that's it everywhere 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.910
 It does not matter if you are just you 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.190
 the two in five sentences so as 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.510
 Next we go in the turbo speed day 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.879
 and give as hockey 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.549
 Just because I grab it well 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:15.189
 is so we can of course another 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:18.430
 button take this gate peters for that 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:21.280
 because that if activated in the speed 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.280
 have you to come back the odometer 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:30.909
 soxxx speed 1 we take 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:34.180
 according to casey or 70 that is if we 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:34.769
 run and +6 then the extra 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.750
 to press 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:46.239
 then he should give us speed 5 so then 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:49.030
 come back to the six satisfied 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.639
 with so then that is with some or with 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.609
 me something not that these 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:57.639
 cecchini in at enable speed and 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.859
 here also on five sentences or with the 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:04.389
 Tomorrow we wanted to go to five now 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:07.090
 done so for the now completed from 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:09.790
 then you go on or in yours now 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.480
 minecraft clicks w and then nothing else 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:17.440
 and you see, you just sprint 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:20.620
 and I would say that is definitely in 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.449
 speed I hope the video has you 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.419
 you like it has heard symptom 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.400
 that the device is off 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.840
 well in any case, I hope the video 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.960
 you liked, if so then let one 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.460
 trees up there then you come 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.250
 next time in any case 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.050
 little more kita video in which I 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.880
 Do you any other great thing 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.729

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.190
