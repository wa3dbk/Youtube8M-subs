comers<00:00:29.810> this<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.929> because<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.260> sensor<00:00:31.560> size

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
comers this is because the sensor size

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.459 
comers this is because the sensor size
is<00:00:32.210> somewhere<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.300> between<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.690> two<00:00:33.870> it's

one interesting diagram sensor yep
serving<00:00:43.829> Jenny<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.239> larger<00:00:45.570> sensor

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
serving Jenny so it's a larger sensor

it's 10 megapixel in size the reasons 10

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.380 
it's 10 megapixel in size the reasons 10
megapixel<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.800> due<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.430> fact<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.820> you

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
megapixel is due to the fact that you

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.970 
megapixel is due to the fact that you
get<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> fine<00:00:51.840> balance<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.379> get<00:00:52.530> good<00:00:52.739> image

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
get a fine balance you get good image

use<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.760> quick<00:02:31.940> demo<00:02:32.209> of<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.600> auto<00:02:32.810> focus

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
use the quick demo of the auto focus

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.110 
use the quick demo of the auto focus
because<00:02:33.590> understand<00:02:34.190> is<00:02:34.310> very<00:02:34.550> fast<00:02:34.790> can<00:02:35.090> we

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
because understand is very fast can we

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.240 
because understand is very fast can we
get<00:02:35.330> up<00:02:35.390> yes<00:02:35.750> we<00:02:36.110> can<00:02:36.320> yeah<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:37.430> again<00:02:38.390> no<00:02:39.320> not

the<00:02:40.340> best<00:02:40.550> of<00:02:42.280> subjects<00:02:43.280> because<00:02:43.430> with<00:02:43.610> white

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
the best of subjects because with white

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.500 
the best of subjects because with white
walls<00:02:44.030> or<00:02:44.360> things<00:02:44.510> like<00:02:44.600> that<00:02:44.750> but<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:45.830> is<00:02:46.010> just

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
walls or things like that but it is just

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.930 
walls or things like that but it is just
ultra-fast<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.720> 73<00:02:48.580> focusing<00:02:49.580> points<00:02:49.850> on

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
ultra-fast the 73 focusing points on

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.100 
ultra-fast the 73 focusing points on
this<00:02:50.030> camera<00:02:50.269> as<00:02:50.360> well<00:02:50.390> so<00:02:50.660> again<00:02:50.870> it's<00:02:51.050> the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
this camera as well so again it's the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.610 
this camera as well so again it's the
world's<00:02:51.410> most<00:02:51.650> focusing<00:02:52.190> points<00:02:52.430> camera

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.410 

should<00:02:57.620> ultra-quick<00:02:58.189> with<00:02:58.370> this<00:02:58.549> with<00:02:59.390> this

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
should ultra-quick with this with this

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.339 
should ultra-quick with this with this
new<00:02:59.689> sensor<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.349> new<00:03:00.890> processor<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:02.540> if<00:03:02.840> we<00:03:02.870> just

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
new sensor a new processor so if we just

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.410 
new sensor a new processor so if we just
switch<00:03:03.560> okay<00:03:03.950> so<00:03:04.010> focused<00:03:04.670> on<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.879> cameras

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
switch okay so focused on the cameras

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.539 
switch okay so focused on the cameras
right<00:03:05.810> in<00:03:05.930> front<00:03:06.079> was<00:03:06.230> here<00:03:06.409> and<00:03:07.010> now<00:03:07.400> if<00:03:07.489> we

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
right in front was here and now if we

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.580 
right in front was here and now if we
switch<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.819> do<00:03:08.060> this<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:08.480> shots<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.469> then

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
switch to do this and shots and then

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.959 
switch to do this and shots and then
capture<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.159> shot<00:03:11.739> gonna<00:03:12.739> get<00:03:12.889> captured<00:03:13.129> now

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:13.969 
capture a shot gonna get captured now

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:16.720 
capture a shot gonna get captured now
that's<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.420> still<00:03:14.659> on<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:15.250> right<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:16.459> we're

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
that's that still on the right so we're

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.039 
that's that still on the right so we're
still<00:03:16.879> doing<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.150> little<00:03:17.329> video<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.780> helped<00:03:17.989> me

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
still doing a little video it helped me

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.479 
still doing a little video it helped me
focusing<00:03:18.469> if<00:03:18.739> I<00:03:18.920> was<00:03:19.040> on<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.689> that<00:03:20.689> mother<00:03:21.489> it

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489

really is a quick as that well let's
couch<00:03:24.650> it<00:03:24.889> again<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:25.819> will<00:03:26.000> shoot<00:03:26.239> up<00:03:26.359> 60

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:26.719 
couch it again it will shoot up 60

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:31.149 
couch it again it will shoot up 60
frames<00:03:26.930> per<00:03:27.049> second<00:03:27.500> as<00:03:27.590> well<00:03:30.040> so<00:03:31.040> does

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159
