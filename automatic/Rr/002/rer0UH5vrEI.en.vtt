00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
thoughts on the Jordan 29 this isn't

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.150 
thoughts on the Jordan 29 this isn't
like<00:00:15.929> an<00:00:16.049> official<00:00:16.260> review<00:00:16.650> or<00:00:16.800> anything<00:00:16.980> like

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
like an official review or anything like

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.500 
like an official review or anything like
that<00:00:17.220> it's<00:00:17.520> just<00:00:17.699> simply<00:00:17.820> my<00:00:18.060> first<00:00:18.270> thoughts

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
that it's just simply my first thoughts

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.330 
that it's just simply my first thoughts
I<00:00:18.660> played<00:00:18.930> three<00:00:19.199> games<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:19.650> them<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:19.920> that's

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
I played three games in them so that's

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.650 
I played three games in them so that's
definitely<00:00:20.550> not<00:00:20.880> enough<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.210> give<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.480> an

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
definitely not enough to give you an

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.480 
definitely not enough to give you an
effective<00:00:21.900> performance<00:00:22.619> review<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.340> can

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
effective performance review but I can

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.009 
effective performance review but I can
just<00:00:23.580> give<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.760> honestly<00:00:24.119> my<00:00:24.330> first<00:00:24.510> my<00:00:24.869> first

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
just give you honestly my first my first

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.689 
just give you honestly my first my first
thought<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.560> most<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.250> guys<00:00:26.310> know<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
thought so most of you guys know the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.429 
thought so most of you guys know the
Jordan<00:00:27.029> 28<00:00:27.390> came<00:00:27.630> out<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.990> flight<00:00:28.199> plate

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
Jordan 28 came out with the flight plate

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.169 
Jordan 28 came out with the flight plate
so<00:00:28.560> they<00:00:28.680> have<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.980> same<00:00:29.250> thing<00:00:29.550> here<00:00:29.820> which

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
so they have the same thing here which

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.939 
so they have the same thing here which
you<00:00:30.269> guys<00:00:30.449> I'm<00:00:30.689> sure<00:00:30.990> you've<00:00:31.140> seen<00:00:31.170> before<00:00:31.529> but

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
you guys I'm sure you've seen before but

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.889 
you guys I'm sure you've seen before but
they<00:00:32.250> actually<00:00:32.550> reversed<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.239> way<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.630> sits

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
they actually reversed the way it sits

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.080 
they actually reversed the way it sits
in<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.380> shoe<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.800> first<00:00:35.730> thing<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.030> I

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
in the shoe and first thing that I

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.280 
in the shoe and first thing that I
noticed<00:00:36.360> when<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.510> played<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:36.989> shoe<00:00:37.170> is

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
noticed when I played in the shoe is

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.530 
noticed when I played in the shoe is
that<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.500> don't<00:00:37.680> feel<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.190> as<00:00:38.340> much<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
that you don't feel it as much on the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.330 
that you don't feel it as much on the
ball<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.989> your<00:00:40.140> foot<00:00:40.320> when<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.620> play<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:41.309> that

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
ball of your foot when you play not that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.619 
ball of your foot when you play not that
that's<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.700> bad<00:00:41.879> thing<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.270> just<00:00:42.300> something

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
that's a bad thing it's just something

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.660 
that's a bad thing it's just something
that<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.809> noticed<00:00:43.050> when<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.379> played<00:00:43.670> something

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.380 
else the tendril here I don't know
pretty<00:00:47.010> many<00:00:47.280> guys<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.489> played<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.059> 28

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
pretty many guys that played in the 28

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.299 
pretty many guys that played in the 28
but<00:00:48.539> when<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.960> when<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.289> step<00:00:49.590> down<00:00:49.620> it

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
but when you do when you step down it

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.400 
but when you do when you step down it
kind<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.579> had<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.180> guess<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.960> want<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.260> say

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
kind of had a I guess I want to say

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.560 
kind of had a I guess I want to say
slapping<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.219> kind<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.460> was<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> one-two

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
slapping but it kind of was a one-two

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.630 
slapping but it kind of was a one-two
kind<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.079> feeling<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.980> makes<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.489> more

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
kind of feeling and this makes it more

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.130 
kind of feeling and this makes it more
more<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.180> uniform<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.780> your<00:00:57.930> foot

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
more of a uniform like your foot

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.010 
more of a uniform like your foot
actually<00:00:58.379> rolling<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.879> shoe<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.719> I

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
actually rolling in the shoe so I

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.889 
actually rolling in the shoe so I
actually<00:01:01.980> prefer<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.969> sensitivity

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
actually prefer that that sensitivity

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.479 
actually prefer that that sensitivity
are<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.379> preferred<00:01:04.920> when<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.189> feels<00:01:05.309> like

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
are that I preferred when it feels like

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.190 
are that I preferred when it feels like
that<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:05.880> opposed<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> one<00:01:06.540> two<00:01:06.750> this

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
that as opposed to the one two this

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.539 
that as opposed to the one two this
feels<00:01:07.439> more<00:01:07.590> like<00:01:07.650> one<00:01:08.010> step<00:01:08.310> because<00:01:08.430> it

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
feels more like one step because it

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.070 
feels more like one step because it
feels<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:08.790> more<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.360> fluid<00:01:09.720> motion

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
feels like more one of a fluid motion

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.570 
feels like more one of a fluid motion
and<00:01:10.200> that's<00:01:10.710> because<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.310> which<00:01:11.549> is

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
and that's because of this which is

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.090 
and that's because of this which is
actually<00:01:11.970> called<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.510> tendril<00:01:13.260> something

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
actually called the tendril something

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.320 
actually called the tendril something
else<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.400> you'll<00:01:14.520> notice<00:01:14.729> when<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.030> first

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
else that you'll notice when you first

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.899 
else that you'll notice when you first

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
put on the shoe is how soft the upper is

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.789 
put on the shoe is how soft the upper is
Jordan<00:01:18.840> Brand<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.110> actually<00:01:19.380> calling<00:01:19.619> it

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
Jordan Brand is actually calling it

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.770 
Jordan Brand is actually calling it
performance<00:01:20.430> woven<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.180> from<00:01:21.600> what<00:01:21.750> I

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
performance woven and from what I

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.840 
performance woven and from what I
understand<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.710> takes<00:01:23.009> about<00:01:23.250> six<00:01:23.729> weeks

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
understand for it takes about six weeks

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.670 
understand for it takes about six weeks
to<00:01:24.119> actually<00:01:24.240> make<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> uppers<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> shoe

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.590 
thought I said I've only played three
games<00:01:52.280> something<00:01:53.280> else<00:01:53.430> for<00:01:53.640> me<00:01:53.790> personally<00:01:54.119> I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
games something else for me personally I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.959 
games something else for me personally I
wear<00:01:55.020> size<00:01:55.320> 11<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.159> size<00:01:56.369> 11<00:01:56.820> and

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
wear size 11 and this is the size 11 and

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.940 
wear size 11 and this is the size 11 and
it<00:01:57.420> felt<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.869> little<00:01:58.049> roomy<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.680> me<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.829> only

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
it felt a little roomy to me I only

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.410 
it felt a little roomy to me I only
played<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.399> one<00:01:59.549> pair<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.790> socks<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.240> maybe

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
played in one pair of socks so maybe

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.789 
played in one pair of socks so maybe
that<00:02:00.600> was<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.899> maybe<00:02:01.049> if<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.259> doubled<00:02:01.590> up<00:02:01.680> on<00:02:01.740> my

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
that was it maybe if I doubled up on my

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.069 
that was it maybe if I doubled up on my
socks<00:02:02.130> wouldn't<00:02:02.460> be<00:02:02.549> as

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
socks wouldn't be as

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.810 
socks wouldn't be as
but<00:02:03.500> if<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:03.860> are<00:02:04.040> going<00:02:04.250> to<00:02:04.340> get<00:02:04.549> it<00:02:04.670> I
