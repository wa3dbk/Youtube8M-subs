00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
with the right here which is the the u3

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.850 
with the right here which is the the u3
smart<00:01:20.590> system<00:01:21.250> which<00:01:22.240> is<00:01:22.420> basically<00:01:22.869> like<00:01:23.680> a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
smart system which is basically like a

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.710 
smart system which is basically like a
security<00:01:24.850> device<00:01:26.040> more<00:01:27.040> security<00:01:27.820> and<00:01:28.119> you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
security device more security and you

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.480 
security device more security and you
can<00:01:28.960> actually<00:01:30.630> install<00:01:31.630> programs<00:01:32.530> in<00:01:32.830> here<00:01:33.160> so

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
can actually install programs in here so

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.520 
can actually install programs in here so
you<00:01:34.090> could<00:01:34.210> take<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.690> program<00:01:35.050> anywhere<00:01:35.410> you

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
you could take the program anywhere you

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.620 
you could take the program anywhere you
go<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:35.979> you<00:01:36.070> can<00:01:36.130> just<00:01:36.400> use<00:01:36.670> it<00:01:36.910> so<00:01:37.180> let's<00:01:37.450> see

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
go and you can just use it so let's see
