here move the throttle open the throttle
a<00:01:49.890> little<00:01:49.920> bit<00:01:50.189> see<00:01:50.399> how<00:01:50.430> far<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.850> moves<00:01:51.270> and

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
a little bit see how far that moves and

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.060 
a little bit see how far that moves and
make<00:01:51.509> another<00:01:51.720> mark<00:01:51.899> then<00:01:52.110> measure<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.560> with

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
make another mark then measure that with

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.980 
make another mark then measure that with
a<00:01:53.100> ruler<00:01:53.220> but<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:54.240> kind<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.600> got<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> good

a ruler but I can kind of got a good
feel<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.920> don't<00:01:55.979> need<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.430> do<00:01:56.610> that

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
feel for it so I don't need to do that

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.840 
feel for it so I don't need to do that

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.190 
you turn in the bike
it<00:02:11.430> could<00:02:11.640> pull<00:02:11.880> on<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.030> throttle<00:02:12.420> cable<00:02:12.780> in<00:02:12.930> in

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
it could pull on a throttle cable in in

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.930 
it could pull on a throttle cable in in
other<00:02:13.380> words<00:02:13.650> pull<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.280> throttle<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.790> you

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
other words pull the throttle and you

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.480 
other words pull the throttle and you
might<00:02:15.150> find<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.660> not<00:02:16.590> quite<00:02:16.709> as<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.040> control<00:02:17.220> of

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
might find a not quite as in control of

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.640 
might find a not quite as in control of
the<00:02:17.550> white<00:02:17.700> as<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:17.910> should<00:02:17.970> be<00:02:18.380> so<00:02:19.380> don't<00:02:19.560> have

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
the white as you should be so don't have

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.710 
the white as you should be so don't have
it<00:02:19.740> too<00:02:19.890> tight<00:02:20.100> but<00:02:21.000> then<00:02:21.150> don't<00:02:21.300> have<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.540> too

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.970 
it too tight but then don't have it too
loose<00:02:21.959> because<00:02:22.380> there'll<00:02:22.709> be<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.830> lot<00:02:22.950> of

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
loose because there'll be a lot of

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.730 
loose because there'll be a lot of
lunging<00:02:23.400> at<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.580> bike<00:02:23.700> as<00:02:23.940> you're<00:02:24.030> using<00:02:24.240> it

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
lunging at the bike as you're using it

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.050 
lunging at the bike as you're using it

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
there we go

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.590 
there we go
spot-on<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:47.640> that's<00:02:47.820> just<00:02:48.030> about<00:02:48.270> perfect

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
spot-on and that's just about perfect

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.540

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
and that's just a very quick and simple

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.479 
and that's just a very quick and simple
way<00:02:51.170> of<00:02:52.170> adjusting<00:02:52.320> your<00:02:52.800> throttle<00:02:53.130> cable

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489
