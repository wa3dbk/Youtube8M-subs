this<00:01:21.900> process<00:01:22.170> three<00:01:22.770> or<00:01:23.490> four<00:01:23.640> times<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.240> say

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
this process three or four times I say

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.109 
this process three or four times I say
four<00:01:25.020> could<00:01:25.439> be<00:01:25.530> most<00:01:25.710> effective<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.430> then

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
four could be most effective and then

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.170 
four could be most effective and then
the<00:01:27.689> last<00:01:27.930> time<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:29.119> instead<00:01:30.119> of

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180

atomizer<00:02:07.710> alright<00:02:08.509> um<00:02:09.509> second<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.229> all<00:02:10.410> um<00:02:10.880> it

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
atomizer alright um second of all um it

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.050 
atomizer alright um second of all um it
will<00:02:12.209> go<00:02:12.569> bad<00:02:12.810> if<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.530> get<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.800> too<00:02:13.920> cold<00:02:14.220> they

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
will go bad if you get it too cold they

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.430 
will go bad if you get it too cold they
don't<00:02:15.090> want<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.720> go<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:18.170> that's<00:02:19.170> why<00:02:19.319> they

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
don't want it to go so that's why they

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.290 
don't want it to go so that's why they
tell<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.739> keep<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.160> cool<00:02:20.400> place<00:02:20.430> but<00:02:21.180> not

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
tell you keep it in a cool place but not

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.520 
tell you keep it in a cool place but not
too<00:02:21.510> cold<00:02:21.750> not<00:02:22.080> too<00:02:22.140> hot<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:24.390> heat<00:02:24.690> breaks

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
too cold not too hot the heat breaks

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.640 
too cold not too hot the heat breaks
down<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.980> VG<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.940> PG<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:28.110> breaks

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
down the VG in the in the PG and breaks

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.580 
down the VG in the in the PG and breaks
down<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.860> fluid<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:30.470> essentially<00:02:31.470> what

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
down the fluid and essentially what

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.759 
down the fluid and essentially what
you're<00:02:31.709> doing<00:02:32.010> when<00:02:32.160> you're<00:02:32.220> steeping<00:02:32.850> is

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
you're doing when you're steeping is

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.710 
you're doing when you're steeping is
evaporating<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:35.010> lot<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.610> Evoque<00:02:36.120> all<00:02:36.360> used

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
evaporating a lot of the Evoque all used

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.979 
evaporating a lot of the Evoque all used
for<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.470> flavoring<00:02:37.920> process<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:39.330> in<00:02:39.690> doing

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
for the flavoring process so in doing

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.199 
for the flavoring process so in doing
this<00:02:40.260> heating<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.769> up<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:41.190> activate<00:02:41.850> all<00:02:42.150> the

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
this heating it up you activate all the

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.009 
this heating it up you activate all the
vapors<00:02:42.780> from<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.290> alcohol<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:45.690> fluid

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
vapors from the alcohol and the fluid

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.530 
vapors from the alcohol and the fluid
and<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:48.290> essentially<00:02:49.400> speed<00:02:50.400> evaporate<00:02:51.269> them

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
and you essentially speed evaporate them

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.420 
and you essentially speed evaporate them
um<00:02:52.549> it<00:02:53.549> bonds<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.480> flavoring<00:02:55.110> if<00:02:55.739> you<00:02:55.950> if<00:02:56.220> you

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
um it bonds the flavoring if you if you

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.870 
um it bonds the flavoring if you if you
if<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.090> look<00:02:57.239> at<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.480> chemical<00:02:57.870> composition

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
if you look at the chemical composition

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.750 
if you look at the chemical composition
PG<00:02:59.880> VG<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.510> flavoring<00:03:01.230> are<00:03:01.440> all<00:03:01.920> different

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
PG VG and flavoring are all different

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.170 
PG VG and flavoring are all different
densities<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:04.410> when<00:03:04.739> you<00:03:04.829> heat<00:03:05.130> them<00:03:05.310> up<00:03:05.489> it

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
densities so when you heat them up it

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.140 
densities so when you heat them up it
melds<00:03:06.660> them<00:03:07.049> all<00:03:07.260> together<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.489> a<00:03:08.670> shaking

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
melds them all together so in a shaking

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.410 
melds them all together so in a shaking
it<00:03:09.299> obviously<00:03:10.049> started<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:11.100> try<00:03:11.880> this<00:03:11.940> out<00:03:12.150> let

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
it obviously started so try this out let

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.420 
it obviously started so try this out let
me<00:03:12.510> know<00:03:12.630> what<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.810> think<00:03:13.019> it's<00:03:13.920> Morgan<00:03:14.310> for

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
me know what you think it's Morgan for

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.500 
me know what you think it's Morgan for
me<00:03:14.579> forever<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:16.019> will<00:03:16.260> continue<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.799> do<00:03:16.950> it

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
me forever and I will continue to do it

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.869 
me forever and I will continue to do it
I'm<00:03:17.900> one<00:03:18.080> of<00:03:18.110> those<00:03:18.260> people<00:03:18.319> who<00:03:18.920> always<00:03:19.250> seems

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
I'm one of those people who always seems

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.339 
I'm one of those people who always seems
to<00:03:19.970> wait<00:03:20.180> till<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.420> last<00:03:20.450> minute<00:03:20.750> right<00:03:21.110> now<00:03:21.319> I

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
to wait till the last minute right now I

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.380 
to wait till the last minute right now I
have<00:03:21.620> about<00:03:22.239> 400<00:03:23.239> milliliters<00:03:23.540> fluid<00:03:25.030> but<00:03:26.030> I

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
have about 400 milliliters fluid but I

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.270 
have about 400 milliliters fluid but I
always<00:03:26.959> wait<00:03:27.260> till<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.530> get<00:03:27.709> down<00:03:27.739> to<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.069> last

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
always wait till I get down to the last

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.910 
always wait till I get down to the last
drop<00:03:28.579> before<00:03:29.239> I<00:03:29.269> order<00:03:29.540> again<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.290> pan<00:03:30.560> that's

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
drop before I order again the pan that's

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.089 
drop before I order again the pan that's
an<00:03:31.069> idiotic<00:03:31.310> move<00:03:32.230> check<00:03:33.230> it<00:03:33.319> out<00:03:33.409> let<00:03:33.680> me<00:03:33.739> know
