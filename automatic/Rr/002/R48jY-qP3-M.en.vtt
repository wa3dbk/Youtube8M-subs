00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 the engineer pedro de leÃ³n mojarro 

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.460
 presented his book we can achieve more the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.710
 facts define men the facts 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.570
 and the results in the plasma the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.890
 intention to seek discussion and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.260
 reflection to build a better future 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.920
 we need to convince ourselves among the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.619
 citizens that more can be achieved 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.810
 vision part of it poses the challenges 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.090
 that has zacatecas in the 21st century 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.809
 I always think about zacatecas 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.270
 zacatecas can and should take a leap and 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.059
 climb two or three steps to be at 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.290
 level of development of those in their 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.510
 neighboring states 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.240
 if it is not that we better have the condition 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.120
 to have clarity 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.160
 that there is a way to go from 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.040
 there is a future that there are possibilities of 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.310
 grow is a vision for development 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.770
 it is a provocation an invitation to 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.949
 constructive dialogue the approach 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.680
 central is that citizens 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.140
 appropriate the interest of which and of the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.560
 conviction that they can achieve more 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.700
 and once we have that proposal the 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.850
 we buy as a society and we take it to 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.659
 ground of the facts and the citizen of 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.990
 on foot will make you happier because it's going to 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.110
 have much easier access to 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.990
 the welfare minima so more 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.729
 comfortable less adventitious of how in these 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.430
 moments many families live 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.050
 zacatecanas and of course many 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.890
 Mexican families 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:48.160
 that's that is what I try to sell 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.250
 to bring in the book Ideas 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.320
 projects and opportunities for all in 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.719
 a zacatecas in which we can achieve 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.210
 plus 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:02:00.430
 buy it in the acropolis restaurant what 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.960
 The first thing you want is that we are 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:07.929
 convinced that in Zacatecas you can 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.200
 achieve more than zacatecas we can 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.769
 achieve more as long as we 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.769
 mentalize
