00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.050 
and you know with build materials that
is<00:04:52.970> one-tenth<00:04:53.630> the<00:04:53.990> size<00:04:54.230> of<00:04:54.680> a<00:04:54.740> regular<00:04:54.889> car<00:04:55.340> I

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
is one-tenth the size of a regular car I

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.000 
is one-tenth the size of a regular car I
think<00:04:56.570> that's<00:04:56.750> easy<00:04:57.139> to<00:04:57.320> accomplish<00:04:57.770> at<00:04:57.919> an

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
think that's easy to accomplish at an

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.400 
think that's easy to accomplish at an
affordable<00:04:58.220> price<00:04:58.550> point<00:04:59.000> and<00:04:59.660> yeah<00:05:00.260> you

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
affordable price point and yeah you

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.930 
affordable price point and yeah you
should<00:05:00.590> be<00:05:00.620> you<00:05:01.070> know<00:05:01.130> generally<00:05:01.610> all<00:05:01.790> over

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
should be you know generally all over

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.560 
should be you know generally all over
the<00:05:02.090> road<00:05:03.130> area<00:05:04.130> most<00:05:04.700> likely<00:05:04.790> in<00:05:05.389> like

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
the road area most likely in like

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:11.460 
the road area most likely in like
seoul-tokyo<00:05:06.610> Chin's<00:05:07.610> in<00:05:08.830> New<00:05:09.830> Delhi<00:05:10.210> Mumbai

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
seoul-tokyo Chin's in New Delhi Mumbai

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.270 
seoul-tokyo Chin's in New Delhi Mumbai
Paris<00:05:13.479> I<00:05:14.500> think<00:05:15.500> that's<00:05:15.680> really<00:05:15.919> kind<00:05:16.160> of

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
Paris I think that's really kind of

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.120 
Paris I think that's really kind of
where<00:05:16.460> we're<00:05:16.700> trying<00:05:16.820> to<00:05:16.970> hit
