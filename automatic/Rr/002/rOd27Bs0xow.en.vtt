over here and you have 12 volt chargers

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.940 
over here and you have 12 volt chargers
you<00:00:41.129> could<00:00:41.280> charge<00:00:41.550> your<00:00:41.670> battery<00:00:42.120> here<00:00:42.360> and

way without stopping camera and the same

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:05.660 
way without stopping camera and the same
just

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.280 

also<00:01:06.670> you<00:01:06.730> controlling<00:01:07.270> your<00:01:07.360> speed<00:01:07.570> so<00:01:08.230> you

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
also you controlling your speed so you

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.990 
also you controlling your speed so you
have<00:01:08.650> a<00:01:08.680> seat

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.190 

and<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.270> same<00:01:16.480> different<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.640> going<00:01:18.850> slow

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.420 

and<00:01:22.619> faster<00:01:24.740> this<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.920> what<00:01:27.650> real<00:01:28.650> filmmakers

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
and faster this is what real filmmakers

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.480 
and faster this is what real filmmakers
do<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:30.090> they<00:01:30.540> don't<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.899> a<00:01:30.930> budget<00:01:31.380> they<00:01:31.890> they

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
do if they don't have a budget they they

00:01:32.490 --> 00:02:43.830 
do if they don't have a budget they they
design<00:01:32.909> their<00:01:33.180> own<00:01:33.210> equipment

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.390 

so<00:02:44.840> now<00:02:45.050> we'll<00:02:45.230> be<00:02:45.410> testing<00:02:45.710> this<00:02:45.890> somewhere

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
so now we'll be testing this somewhere

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.960 
so now we'll be testing this somewhere
outside<00:02:47.270> somewhere<00:02:48.230> in<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.530> location<00:02:49.070> to<00:02:49.730> see

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
outside somewhere in the location to see

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.190 
outside somewhere in the location to see
how<00:02:50.660> it's<00:02:50.870> going

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
how it's going

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.090 
how it's going
