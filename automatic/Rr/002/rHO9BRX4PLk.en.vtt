the<00:01:26.520> story<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.000> first<00:01:27.150> game<00:01:27.450> was

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the story of the first game was

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.720 
the story of the first game was
interesting<00:01:28.080> enough<00:01:28.410> you<00:01:29.100> might<00:01:29.310> get<00:01:29.490> into

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
interesting enough you might get into

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.160 
interesting enough you might get into
the<00:01:29.760> creative<00:01:30.090> liberties<00:01:30.690> they've<00:01:30.930> taken

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170

here

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.700 

but<00:01:40.790> for<00:01:41.000> me<00:01:41.120> the<00:01:41.300> most<00:01:41.330> striking<00:01:41.960> improvement

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
but for me the most striking improvement

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.980 
but for me the most striking improvement
and<00:01:42.860> tides<00:01:43.100> of<00:01:43.280> time<00:01:43.490> is<00:01:43.730> the<00:01:43.850> graphics<00:01:44.360> the
