you've got the Y splitter which is also

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.070 
you've got the Y splitter which is also
pretty<00:01:03.140> much<00:01:03.230> exactly<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.769> same<00:01:04.930> that's<00:01:05.930> why

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
pretty much exactly the same that's why

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
somebody comes the remote this this is

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.150 
somebody comes the remote this this is
where<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.700> differences<00:01:14.240> start<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:15.050> appear<00:01:15.320> so

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
where the differences start to appear so

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.620 
where the differences start to appear so
when<00:01:16.310> you<00:01:16.400> look<00:01:16.520> at<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:16.730> remote<00:01:16.940> itself<00:01:17.390> on

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
when you look at the remote itself on

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.289 
when you look at the remote itself on
the<00:01:17.750> new<00:01:17.960> ones<00:01:18.200> it's<00:01:18.440> a<00:01:18.500> lot<00:01:18.680> bigger<00:01:19.180> then<00:01:20.180> on

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
the new ones it's a lot bigger then on

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.090 
the new ones it's a lot bigger then on
the<00:01:20.479> older<00:01:21.140> ones<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.560> old<00:01:21.680> ones<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:22.070> bit

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
the older ones the old ones a bit

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.609 
the older ones the old ones a bit
smaller<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:23.060> also<00:01:23.299> the<00:01:23.780> old<00:01:24.079> ones<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:24.439> can

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
smaller and also the old ones you can

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.830 
smaller and also the old ones you can
actually<00:01:24.920> see<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.520> little<00:01:25.759> port<00:01:26.600> with<00:01:26.810> a

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
actually see the little port with a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.109 
actually see the little port with a
microphone<00:01:27.380> is<00:01:27.829> so<00:01:28.430> you<00:01:28.520> can<00:01:28.700> sort<00:01:28.909> of<00:01:28.939> see<00:01:29.090> the

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
microphone is so you can sort of see the

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.389 
microphone is so you can sort of see the
whole<00:01:29.360> way<00:01:29.570> your<00:01:30.170> voice<00:01:30.320> would<00:01:30.530> go<00:01:30.740> where's

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
whole way your voice would go where's

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:32.859 
whole way your voice would go where's
the<00:01:31.579> new<00:01:31.729> one<00:01:31.939> is<00:01:32.060> sort<00:01:32.360> of<00:01:32.450> like<00:01:32.600> a<00:01:32.630> little

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
the new one is sort of like a little

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.010 
the new one is sort of like a little
microphone<00:01:33.320> logo<00:01:34.119> and<00:01:35.119> no<00:01:35.299> actual<00:01:35.750> sort<00:01:35.960> of

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
microphone logo and no actual sort of

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.740 
microphone logo and no actual sort of
microphone<00:01:36.380> port<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:36.979> it's<00:01:37.159> sort<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:37.750> the

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
microphone port so it's sort of the

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.940 
microphone port so it's sort of the
microphones<00:01:39.170> built<00:01:39.380> into<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:39.799> control

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
microphones built into the control

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.510 
microphones built into the control
talking<00:01:40.579> you<00:01:40.640> can<00:01:40.790> see<00:01:41.180> it

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
talking you can see it

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.429 
talking you can see it
and<00:01:43.390> then<00:01:43.509> obviously<00:01:43.659> you<00:01:43.900> got<00:01:44.079> into<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.290> ear

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
and then obviously you got into the ear

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.170 
and then obviously you got into the ear
boxes<00:01:44.829> and<00:01:44.979> this<00:01:45.130> is<00:01:45.220> where<00:01:45.369> obviously<00:01:46.030> all

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
boxes and this is where obviously all

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.690 
boxes and this is where obviously all
the<00:01:46.360> change<00:01:46.630> is<00:01:47.399> aesthetically<00:01:48.399> is<00:01:48.549> a

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
the change is aesthetically is a

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.440 
the change is aesthetically is a
complete<00:01:49.570> redesign<00:01:50.380> in<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:50.979> actual

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
complete redesign in the actual

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.600 
complete redesign in the actual

headphone that old ones are asserted the
circular<00:01:55.060> shape<00:01:55.240> of<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.570> new<00:01:55.720> ones<00:01:55.930> are<00:01:56.110> more

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
circular shape of the new ones are more

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.880 
circular shape of the new ones are more
of<00:01:56.470> an<00:01:56.560> oval<00:01:56.950> almond<00:01:57.880> sort<00:01:58.119> of<00:01:58.210> shape<00:01:58.890> you've

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
ones are only worth about five seconds

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.569

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
just a lot more secure is the less

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.349 
just a lot more secure is the less
likely<00:03:29.530> to<00:03:29.560> pop<00:03:29.799> out<00:03:29.980> especially<00:03:30.489> if<00:03:31.150> you

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
likely to pop out especially if you

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.240 
likely to pop out especially if you
