continuing our talk on let's get growing
and<00:00:09.100> we're<00:00:09.430> in<00:00:09.720> Jan's<00:00:10.720> fruit<00:00:11.050> orchard<00:00:11.500> that<00:00:11.530> if

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
and we're in Jan's fruit orchard that if

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.480 
and we're in Jan's fruit orchard that if
you<00:00:12.460> remember<00:00:12.850> from<00:00:13.240> last<00:00:13.570> month<00:00:13.870> that<00:00:14.490> didn't

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
you remember from last month that didn't

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.339 
you remember from last month that didn't
really<00:00:15.640> have<00:00:16.119> that<00:00:16.269> much<00:00:16.419> growth<00:00:16.779> on<00:00:17.050> it<00:00:17.230> and

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:17.349 
really have that much growth on it and

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.509 
really have that much growth on it and
we<00:00:17.439> weren't<00:00:17.650> you<00:00:17.980> know<00:00:18.070> there<00:00:18.279> were<00:00:18.339> some

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:18.519 
we weren't you know there were some

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.609 
we weren't you know there were some
blooms<00:00:18.789> and<00:00:19.210> things<00:00:20.109> kind<00:00:20.380> of<00:00:20.409> looked<00:00:20.560> a

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
blooms and things kind of looked a

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.810 
blooms and things kind of looked a
little<00:00:20.740> sparse<00:00:21.130> and<00:00:21.339> there's<00:00:21.490> quite<00:00:21.759> a

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
little sparse and there's quite a

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.040 
little sparse and there's quite a
difference<00:00:21.970> here<00:00:22.509> again

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
difference here again

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.689 
difference here again
yeah<00:00:23.409> Johnson's<00:00:23.890> last<00:00:24.039> month<00:00:24.400> we've

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
yeah Johnson's last month we've

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.640 
yeah Johnson's last month we've
fertilized<00:00:25.570> the<00:00:25.720> trees<00:00:25.989> and<00:00:26.230> done<00:00:26.409> quite<00:00:26.619> a

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
fertilized the trees and done quite a

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.470 
fertilized the trees and done quite a
bit<00:00:26.710> of<00:00:26.829> watering<00:00:27.369> we<00:00:27.519> also<00:00:27.699> sprayed<00:00:28.239> the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
bit of watering we also sprayed the

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.720 
bit of watering we also sprayed the
weeds<00:00:28.869> around<00:00:29.169> the<00:00:29.259> base<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:30.399> you<00:00:30.460> can<00:00:30.609> see

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
weeds around the base and you can see

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.910 
weeds around the base and you can see
there's<00:00:30.909> a<00:00:30.999> lot<00:00:31.149> of<00:00:31.239> new<00:00:31.390> growth<00:00:31.539> and<00:00:31.989> on<00:00:32.770> this

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
there's a lot of new growth and on this

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.650 
there's a lot of new growth and on this
tree<00:00:33.160> we're<00:00:33.370> getting<00:00:33.820> quite<00:00:34.270> a<00:00:34.330> few<00:00:34.420> little

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
tree we're getting quite a few little

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.560 
tree we're getting quite a few little
peaches<00:00:35.220> now<00:00:36.220> one<00:00:36.430> of<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.610> problems<00:00:37.030> and<00:00:37.270> I

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
peaches now one of the problems and I

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.730 
peaches now one of the problems and I
guess<00:00:37.780> one<00:00:37.960> of<00:00:37.990> the<00:00:38.110> big<00:00:38.230> things<00:00:38.440> with

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:38.740 
guess one of the big things with

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.800 
guess one of the big things with
homeowners<00:00:39.340> is<00:00:39.580> that<00:00:39.910> they<00:00:40.120> are<00:00:40.540> very

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810 
homeowners is that they are very

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.940 
homeowners is that they are very
reluctant<00:00:41.200> to<00:00:41.620> thin<00:00:41.860> a<00:00:41.890> tree<00:00:42.850> so<00:00:43.540> here's<00:00:43.840> a

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
reluctant to thin a tree so here's a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.010 
reluctant to thin a tree so here's a
tree<00:00:44.950> that's<00:00:45.280> not<00:00:45.880> real<00:00:46.120> big<00:00:46.330> and<00:00:46.600> yet<00:00:46.780> has<00:00:46.990> a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
tree that's not real big and yet has a

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.780 
tree that's not real big and yet has a
pretty<00:00:47.320> heavy<00:00:47.530> crop<00:00:47.860> on<00:00:48.130> it<00:00:48.340> and<00:00:48.460> as<00:00:48.580> these

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
pretty heavy crop on it and as these

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.220 
pretty heavy crop on it and as these
peaches<00:00:49.090> get<00:00:49.390> bigger<00:00:49.630> they're<00:00:50.020> going<00:00:50.170> to

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
peaches get bigger they're going to

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.890 
peaches get bigger they're going to
cause<00:00:50.980> these<00:00:51.220> limbs<00:00:51.520> to<00:00:51.850> droop<00:00:52.120> and<00:00:52.360> possibly

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
cause these limbs to droop and possibly

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.630 
cause these limbs to droop and possibly
break<00:00:53.200> so<00:00:53.500> what<00:00:53.680> we<00:00:53.830> want<00:00:54.010> to<00:00:54.100> do<00:00:54.190> is<00:00:54.310> come<00:00:54.490> in

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
break so what we want to do is come in

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.970 
break so what we want to do is come in
and<00:00:54.850> thin<00:00:55.060> the<00:00:55.240> fruit<00:00:55.450> off<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.840> tree<00:00:56.080> so<00:00:56.800> what

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
and thin the fruit off the tree so what

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.380 
and thin the fruit off the tree so what
we're<00:00:57.100> going<00:00:57.190> to<00:00:57.250> do<00:00:57.370> is<00:00:57.490> just<00:00:57.700> twist<00:00:57.880> some<00:00:58.240> of

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
we're going to do is just twist some of

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.690 
we're going to do is just twist some of
the<00:00:58.450> fruit<00:00:58.690> off<00:00:58.930> and<00:00:59.740> what<00:00:59.920> I<00:00:59.950> like<00:01:00.280> to<00:01:00.430> do<00:01:00.579> is

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
the fruit off and what I like to do is

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.760 
the fruit off and what I like to do is
keep<00:01:00.910> a<00:01:01.120> fruit<00:01:01.360> somewhere<00:01:01.810> about<00:01:02.020> every<00:01:02.470> four

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
keep a fruit somewhere about every four

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.649 
keep a fruit somewhere about every four
to<00:01:02.950> six<00:01:02.980> inches<00:01:03.610> so<00:01:03.910> we're<00:01:04.089> going<00:01:04.180> to<00:01:04.239> come<00:01:04.449> in

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
to six inches so we're going to come in

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.660 
to six inches so we're going to come in
and<00:01:05.100> then<00:01:06.100> pretty<00:01:06.460> heavy<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.640> we're<00:01:09.640> just

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
and then pretty heavy so we're just

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.250 
and then pretty heavy so we're just
going<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:10.000> drop<00:01:10.180> them<00:01:10.390> so<00:01:10.540> we<00:01:10.630> have<00:01:10.750> one<00:01:10.930> here

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
going to drop them so we have one here

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.370 
going to drop them so we have one here
one<00:01:11.440> here<00:01:11.500> kind<00:01:12.370> of<00:01:12.460> got<00:01:12.610> those<00:01:12.820> clear<00:01:13.150> down

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
one here kind of got those clear down

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.630 
one here kind of got those clear down
we're<00:01:14.380> down<00:01:14.590> to<00:01:14.860> a<00:01:14.890> group<00:01:15.700> here<00:01:16.150> that<00:01:16.330> will

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
we're down to a group here that will

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.890 
we're down to a group here that will
take<00:01:18.640> those<00:01:18.909> off<00:01:19.710> leave<00:01:20.710> one<00:01:20.950> there<00:01:21.690> we<00:01:22.690> want

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
take those off leave one there we want

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.410 
take those off leave one there we want
to<00:01:22.960> take<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.290> weight<00:01:23.530> off<00:01:23.800> of<00:01:23.830> them<00:01:24.280> off<00:01:25.060> of

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
to take the weight off of them off of

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.760 
to take the weight off of them off of
the<00:01:27.120> off<00:01:28.120> of<00:01:28.510> the<00:01:28.600> branches<00:01:29.140> that<00:01:29.380> they<00:01:29.590> don't

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
the off of the branches that they don't

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.219 
the off of the branches that they don't
have<00:01:29.950> so<00:01:30.130> much<00:01:30.310> weight<00:01:30.640> on<00:01:30.880> them<00:01:31.090> so<00:01:31.870> we<00:01:32.049> have

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
have so much weight on them so we have

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.930 
have so much weight on them so we have
them<00:01:32.350> kind<00:01:32.590> of<00:01:32.680> spaced<00:01:32.950> out<00:01:33.190> we<00:01:33.790> could

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
them kind of spaced out we could

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.780 
them kind of spaced out we could
probably<00:01:34.120> even<00:01:34.330> take<00:01:34.570> that<00:01:34.600> one<00:01:34.960> off<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.670> we

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
probably even take that one off so we

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.130 
probably even take that one off so we
want<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.060> leave<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.299> weight<00:01:37.479> a<00:01:37.510> little<00:01:37.720> bit<00:01:37.960> on

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
want to leave the weight a little bit on

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.500 
want to leave the weight a little bit on
the<00:01:38.409> stronger<00:01:38.950> branches<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:39.790> not<00:01:39.940> put<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.299> lot

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
the stronger branches and not put a lot

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.910 
the stronger branches and not put a lot
of<00:01:40.630> them<00:01:40.750> out<00:01:40.840> on<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.170> end<00:01:41.320> because<00:01:41.500> that<00:01:41.770> will

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
of them out on the end because that will

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.830 
of them out on the end because that will
cause<00:01:42.130> it<00:01:42.370> to<00:01:42.400> weight<00:01:43.000> down<00:01:43.270> so<00:01:43.299> we're<00:01:43.750> going

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
cause it to weight down so we're going

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.230 
cause it to weight down so we're going
to<00:01:43.900> go<00:01:44.049> through<00:01:44.290> here<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.650> kind<00:01:44.920> of<00:01:45.240> thin

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
to go through here and kind of thin

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.539 
to go through here and kind of thin
those<00:01:46.479> off<00:01:46.780> make<00:01:47.650> sure<00:01:47.830> that<00:01:48.040> they<00:01:48.190> are<00:01:48.340> going

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
those off make sure that they are going

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.230 
those off make sure that they are going
to<00:01:48.960> fruit<00:01:50.130> there's<00:01:51.130> another<00:01:51.430> group<00:01:51.790> that<00:01:51.820> has

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
to fruit there's another group that has

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.359 
to fruit there's another group that has
quite<00:01:52.570> a<00:01:52.600> quite<00:01:53.080> a<00:01:53.110> few<00:01:53.200> on<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:53.740> we'll<00:01:54.100> go<00:01:54.280> ahead

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
quite a quite a few on it we'll go ahead

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.359 
quite a quite a few on it we'll go ahead
and<00:01:55.290> take<00:01:56.290> two<00:01:56.530> of<00:01:56.560> these<00:01:56.770> off<00:01:56.979> we'll<00:01:57.220> leave

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
and take two of these off we'll leave

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.920 
and take two of these off we'll leave
these<00:01:57.580> two<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:58.000> just<00:01:58.030> kind<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.420> see<00:01:58.600> how<00:01:58.720> they

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
these two and just kind of see how they

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.109 
these two and just kind of see how they
progress<00:01:59.200> cuz<00:01:59.799> we<00:01:59.979> can<00:02:00.220> thin<00:02:00.490> them<00:02:00.700> even<00:02:00.970> one

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
progress cuz we can thin them even one

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.480 
progress cuz we can thin them even one
more<00:02:01.390> time<00:02:01.689> if<00:02:01.990> they're<00:02:02.229> look<00:02:03.130> like<00:02:03.310> they're

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
more time if they're look like they're

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.039 
more time if they're look like they're
putting<00:02:03.760> too<00:02:03.880> much<00:02:04.030> weight<00:02:04.090> on<00:02:04.330> so<00:02:04.720> you<00:02:04.869> can

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
putting too much weight on so you can

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.649 
putting too much weight on so you can
see<00:02:05.200> quite<00:02:05.409> a<00:02:05.470> bit<00:02:05.650> of<00:02:05.740> fruit<00:02:05.950> on<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.280> ground

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
see quite a bit of fruit on the ground

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.900 
see quite a bit of fruit on the ground
but<00:02:07.659> actually<00:02:08.560> what's<00:02:09.160> going<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.399> happen<00:02:09.759> is

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
but actually what's going to happen is

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.640 
but actually what's going to happen is
this<00:02:10.090> fruit<00:02:10.420> is<00:02:10.569> going<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.780> be<00:02:10.899> much<00:02:11.110> larger<00:02:11.380> in

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
this fruit is going to be much larger in

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.080 
this fruit is going to be much larger in
size<00:02:11.950> if<00:02:12.760> we<00:02:13.090> had<00:02:13.180> left<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.480> fruit<00:02:13.840> on

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
size if we had left that fruit on

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.339 
size if we had left that fruit on
the<00:02:14.150> tree<00:02:14.390> all<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.870> them<00:02:14.989> would<00:02:15.110> have<00:02:15.200> been

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
the tree all of them would have been

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.740 
the tree all of them would have been
kind<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.680> medium-sized<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:17.209> hopefully<00:02:17.599> we're

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
kind of medium-sized so hopefully we're

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.420 
kind of medium-sized so hopefully we're
gonna<00:02:17.840> have<00:02:18.110> some<00:02:18.260> large<00:02:18.500> size<00:02:18.769> fruits<00:02:19.160> here

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
gonna have some large size fruits here

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.550 
gonna have some large size fruits here
and<00:02:19.670> they'll<00:02:19.879> what<00:02:20.660> you've<00:02:20.810> taken<00:02:21.019> off<00:02:21.319> is

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
and they'll what you've taken off is

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.559 
and they'll what you've taken off is
going<00:02:21.739> to<00:02:21.800> be<00:02:21.920> made<00:02:22.129> up<00:02:22.340> in<00:02:22.580> in<00:02:22.910> larger<00:02:23.330> fruit

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
going to be made up in in larger fruit

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.390 
going to be made up in in larger fruit
and<00:02:23.870> yet<00:02:24.050> you've<00:02:24.230> helped<00:02:24.560> regulate<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.190> load

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
and yet you've helped regulate the load

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.119 
and yet you've helped regulate the load
on<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.760> tree<00:02:25.970> so<00:02:26.330> also<00:02:27.290> with<00:02:27.680> some<00:02:27.830> of<00:02:27.890> the

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
on the tree so also with some of the

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.400 
on the tree so also with some of the
growth<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:28.819> we've<00:02:29.180> had<00:02:29.390> on<00:02:29.599> the<00:02:29.720> tree<00:02:29.959> we<00:02:30.200> can

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
growth that we've had on the tree we can

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.860 
growth that we've had on the tree we can
come<00:02:30.650> in<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.209> thinned<00:02:32.209> some<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:32.690> growth

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
come in and thinned some of the growth

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.050 
come in and thinned some of the growth
out<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:33.560> if<00:02:33.620> we<00:02:33.799> want<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.129> open<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.580> tree<00:02:34.790> up<00:02:34.940> a

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
out so if we want to open the tree up a

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.369 
out so if we want to open the tree up a
little<00:02:35.209> bit<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.480> take<00:02:35.720> some<00:02:35.989> of<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.170> growth

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
little bit and take some of the growth

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.949 
little bit and take some of the growth
off<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:37.459> we're<00:02:37.640> getting<00:02:37.790> more<00:02:37.940> sunlight<00:02:38.360> into

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
off so we're getting more sunlight into

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.140 
off so we're getting more sunlight into
kind<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.260> help<00:02:41.709> help<00:02:42.709> get<00:02:42.920> sunlight<00:02:43.190> in<00:02:43.610> to

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
kind of help help get sunlight in to

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.000 
kind of help help get sunlight in to
ripen<00:02:44.330> some<00:02:44.780> of<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.930> fruit<00:02:45.140> we<00:02:45.349> can<00:02:45.560> take<00:02:45.769> some

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
ripen some of the fruit we can take some

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.740 
ripen some of the fruit we can take some
of<00:02:46.099> those<00:02:46.220> shoots<00:02:46.519> off<00:02:46.760> at<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.120> time<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.660> if

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
of those shoots off at the time and if

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.630 
of those shoots off at the time and if
they're<00:02:47.959> getting<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.319> little<00:02:48.500> too<00:02:48.739> lengthy

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
they're getting a little too lengthy

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.140 
they're getting a little too lengthy
like<00:02:50.630> out<00:02:50.840> on<00:02:50.989> some<00:02:51.230> of<00:02:51.349> the<00:02:51.440> ends<00:02:51.799> we<00:02:52.640> can<00:02:52.880> come

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
like out on some of the ends we can come

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.690 
like out on some of the ends we can come
in<00:02:53.329> and<00:02:53.510> clip<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:54.349> know<00:02:54.440> just<00:02:54.680> clip<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.160> the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
in and clip you know just clip the the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.440 
in and clip you know just clip the the
tip<00:02:55.940> out<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:57.590> that'll<00:02:58.579> stop<00:02:58.819> the<00:02:58.849> growth<00:02:59.209> on

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
tip out and that'll stop the growth on

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.420 
tip out and that'll stop the growth on
it<00:02:59.599> and<00:02:59.720> force<00:02:59.930> more<00:03:00.290> growth<00:03:00.560> down<00:03:00.829> here<00:03:01.190> so

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
it and force more growth down here so

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.600 
it and force more growth down here so
you<00:03:01.459> can<00:03:01.670> kind<00:03:01.849> of<00:03:02.000> thicken<00:03:02.239> it<00:03:02.480> up<00:03:03.400> again<00:03:04.400> the

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
you can kind of thicken it up again the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.150 
you can kind of thicken it up again the
foil<00:03:04.879> down<00:03:05.150> at<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.480> bottom<00:03:05.660> was<00:03:06.410> put<00:03:06.650> on<00:03:06.829> for<00:03:07.129> a

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
foil down at the bottom was put on for a

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.970 
foil down at the bottom was put on for a
couple<00:03:07.519> reasons<00:03:07.549> one<00:03:08.150> is<00:03:08.480> in<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:09.410> main<00:03:09.590> reason

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
couple reasons one is in the main reason

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.250 
couple reasons one is in the main reason
was<00:03:10.099> Jan<00:03:10.459> was<00:03:10.730> spraying<00:03:11.030> weeds<00:03:11.360> around<00:03:12.110> the

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
was Jan was spraying weeds around the

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.089 
was Jan was spraying weeds around the
base<00:03:12.440> here<00:03:12.769> and<00:03:13.129> so<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:15.470> know<00:03:15.530> that<00:03:15.739> helps<00:03:16.010> to

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
base here and so you know that helps to

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.619 
base here and so you know that helps to
keep<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.430> spray<00:03:16.700> off<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.120> trunk<00:03:17.329> of<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.599> tree

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
keep the spray off the trunk of the tree

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.349 
keep the spray off the trunk of the tree
also<00:03:18.049> if<00:03:18.350> you<00:03:18.470> have<00:03:18.590> any<00:03:19.000> rabbits<00:03:20.000> or<00:03:20.150> critters

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
also if you have any rabbits or critters

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.270 
also if you have any rabbits or critters
feeding<00:03:20.870> on<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:21.200> trunks<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.769> helps<00:03:22.100> protect

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
feeding on the trunks that helps protect

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.039 
feeding on the trunks that helps protect
that<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:23.000> it<00:03:23.120> also<00:03:23.239> gives<00:03:23.569> a<00:03:23.660> little<00:03:23.690> bit<00:03:23.930> of

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
that and it also gives a little bit of

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.009 
that and it also gives a little bit of
sun<00:03:24.230> protection<00:03:24.680> so<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:25.370> then<00:03:26.120> Jan<00:03:26.480> last

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
sun protection so and then Jan last

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.240 
sun protection so and then Jan last
thing<00:03:27.260> we<00:03:27.410> were<00:03:27.530> going<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.709> put<00:03:27.859> some<00:03:28.010> mulch

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
thing we were going to put some mulch

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.770 
thing we were going to put some mulch
around<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:28.880> help<00:03:29.060> keep<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.450> weeds<00:03:29.630> down

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
around it to help keep the weeds down

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.960 
around it to help keep the weeds down
and<00:03:30.079> also<00:03:30.319> keep<00:03:30.530> moisture<00:03:30.799> in<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.250> circles<00:03:31.730> so

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
and also keep moisture in the circles so

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.259 
and also keep moisture in the circles so
we've<00:03:32.930> got<00:03:33.079> some<00:03:33.400> flakes<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.609> hay<00:03:34.639> here<00:03:35.090> that

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
we've got some flakes of hay here that

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.360 
we've got some flakes of hay here that
will<00:03:35.480> break<00:03:35.870> up<00:03:36.139> and<00:03:36.380> again<00:03:36.620> this<00:03:36.799> mulch<00:03:37.099> we'd

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
will break up and again this mulch we'd

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.379 
will break up and again this mulch we'd
like<00:03:37.579> to<00:03:37.730> have<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:38.410> couple<00:03:39.410> inches<00:03:39.859> deep<00:03:40.389> at

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
like to have a couple inches deep at

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.470 
like to have a couple inches deep at
least<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:42.190> not<00:03:43.190> really<00:03:43.579> stacked<00:03:43.880> up<00:03:44.090> against

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
least and not really stacked up against

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.319 
least and not really stacked up against
the<00:03:44.569> tree<00:03:44.840> but<00:03:45.139> that<00:03:45.380> spread<00:03:45.889> out<00:03:46.099> so<00:03:46.400> we're

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
the tree but that spread out so we're

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.740 
the tree but that spread out so we're
blocking<00:03:47.599> sunlight<00:03:47.989> out<00:03:48.410> to<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:49.450> weed<00:03:50.450> growth

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
blocking sunlight out to the weed growth

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.309 
blocking sunlight out to the weed growth
and<00:03:51.730> we<00:03:52.730> can<00:03:52.819> get<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.269> moisture<00:03:53.989> in<00:03:54.079> there

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
and we can get the moisture in there

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.920 
and we can get the moisture in there
when<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:54.650> irrigate<00:03:55.010> that<00:03:55.480> way<00:03:56.480> we'll<00:03:56.720> have<00:03:56.750> oh

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
when you irrigate that way we'll have oh

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.750 
when you irrigate that way we'll have oh
I<00:03:59.139> have<00:04:00.139> a<00:04:00.169> nice<00:04:00.440> moist<00:04:00.739> soil<00:04:01.069> little<00:04:01.459> stake

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
I have a nice moist soil little stake

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.349 
I have a nice moist soil little stake
and<00:04:02.500> kind<00:04:03.500> of<00:04:03.560> for<00:04:03.739> water<00:04:03.950> conservation

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
and kind of for water conservation

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.900 
and kind of for water conservation
purposes<00:04:05.359> this<00:04:05.630> is<00:04:06.190> mulches<00:04:07.190> are<00:04:07.310> good<00:04:07.579> to<00:04:07.700> use

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
purposes this is mulches are good to use

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.039 
purposes this is mulches are good to use
so<00:04:08.889> we'll<00:04:09.889> kind<00:04:10.190> of<00:04:10.220> keep<00:04:10.400> that<00:04:10.609> away<00:04:11.450> from<00:04:11.870> the

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
so we'll kind of keep that away from the

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.690 
so we'll kind of keep that away from the
trunk<00:04:12.260> of<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.500> tree<00:04:12.530> but<00:04:12.950> keep<00:04:13.130> it<00:04:13.280> out<00:04:13.400> here

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
trunk of the tree but keep it out here

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.129 
trunk of the tree but keep it out here
just<00:04:14.200> break<00:04:15.200> it<00:04:15.380> up<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.829> that<00:04:16.070> way<00:04:16.250> it's

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
just break it up and that way it's

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.360 
just break it up and that way it's
hopefully<00:04:18.139> these<00:04:18.200> trees<00:04:18.500> will<00:04:18.739> respond<00:04:19.220> to

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
hopefully these trees will respond to

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.420 
hopefully these trees will respond to
all<00:04:19.519> that<00:04:19.820> extra<00:04:20.630> extra<00:04:21.320> moisture<00:04:21.769> and<00:04:22.010> and

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
all that extra extra moisture and and

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.420 
all that extra extra moisture and and
care<00:04:22.760> so<00:04:23.150> this<00:04:24.080> looks<00:04:24.260> good<00:04:24.469> John<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:25.099> then

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
care so this looks good John and then

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.709 
care so this looks good John and then
before<00:04:25.580> we<00:04:25.729> leave<00:04:25.969> here<00:04:26.150> I<00:04:26.180> want<00:04:26.419> to<00:04:26.479> show<00:04:26.659> you

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:26.719 
before we leave here I want to show you

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:27.550 
before we leave here I want to show you
all<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.080> new<00:04:27.110> growth

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
all the new growth

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.140 
all the new growth
that's<00:04:27.830> on<00:04:28.040> that<00:04:28.220> little<00:04:28.460> tree<00:04:28.670> that<00:04:28.850> we<00:04:28.940> cut

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
that's on that little tree that we cut

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.940 
that's on that little tree that we cut
back<00:04:29.330> last<00:04:29.600> time<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:30.139> then<00:04:30.320> I<00:04:30.500> want<00:04:30.800> to<00:04:30.860> show

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
back last time and then I want to show

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.070 
back last time and then I want to show
you<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.130> roses<00:04:31.460> okay<00:04:34.360> Don<00:04:35.360> last<00:04:35.660> time<00:04:35.900> this

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
you the roses okay Don last time this

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.780 
you the roses okay Don last time this
tree<00:04:36.350> was<00:04:36.500> about<00:04:36.740> this<00:04:36.919> tall<00:04:37.190> and<00:04:37.220> didn't<00:04:37.669> have

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
tree was about this tall and didn't have

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.820 
tree was about this tall and didn't have
any<00:04:37.970> growth<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.630> I<00:04:38.750> think<00:04:38.960> we<00:04:39.050> all<00:04:39.139> gasp<00:04:39.470> when

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
any growth and I think we all gasp when

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.620 
any growth and I think we all gasp when
you<00:04:39.919> cut<00:04:40.130> it<00:04:40.250> in<00:04:40.340> half<00:04:40.550> but<00:04:41.000> I<00:04:41.210> think<00:04:41.540> the

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
you cut it in half but I think the

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.330 
you cut it in half but I think the
results<00:04:41.990> have<00:04:42.110> paid<00:04:42.290> off<00:04:42.470> yeah<00:04:42.919> it<00:04:43.010> looks<00:04:43.190> like

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
results have paid off yeah it looks like

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.280 
results have paid off yeah it looks like
we<00:04:43.460> got<00:04:43.639> a<00:04:43.669> good<00:04:43.880> good<00:04:44.360> new<00:04:44.540> growth<00:04:44.780> coming<00:04:45.050> out

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
we got a good good new growth coming out

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.710 
we got a good good new growth coming out
hopefully<00:04:45.710> that'll<00:04:46.190> continue<00:04:47.150> might<00:04:47.540> even

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
hopefully that'll continue might even

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.810 
hopefully that'll continue might even
get<00:04:47.900> a<00:04:47.960> few<00:04:48.169> more<00:04:48.320> breaks<00:04:48.620> on<00:04:48.860> it<00:04:48.889> so<00:04:49.310> so<00:04:49.700> it's

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
get a few more breaks on it so so it's

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.450 
get a few more breaks on it so so it's
looking<00:04:50.120> good<00:04:50.300> keep<00:04:50.600> it<00:04:50.750> watered<00:04:51.110> and

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
looking good keep it watered and

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.830 
looking good keep it watered and
fertilizing<00:04:52.460> I<00:04:52.550> think<00:04:52.760> it'll<00:04:53.030> come<00:04:53.300> back<00:04:53.450> good

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
fertilizing I think it'll come back good

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.620 
fertilizing I think it'll come back good
great<00:04:54.350> let's<00:04:54.830> take<00:04:54.980> a<00:04:55.010> look<00:04:55.190> at<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.370> roses

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.790 

John<00:04:59.630> you<00:04:59.750> remember<00:05:00.110> last<00:05:00.290> month<00:05:00.470> we

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
John you remember last month we

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.340 
John you remember last month we
fertilized<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.460> roses<00:05:01.910> and<00:05:02.210> we've<00:05:02.780> had<00:05:02.990> a<00:05:03.020> lot

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
fertilized the roses and we've had a lot

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.970 
fertilized the roses and we've had a lot
of<00:05:03.380> new<00:05:03.680> growth<00:05:03.950> and<00:05:05.290> some<00:05:06.290> beautiful<00:05:06.530> blooms

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
of new growth and some beautiful blooms

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.550 
of new growth and some beautiful blooms
now<00:05:07.970> I'm<00:05:08.120> noticing<00:05:08.450> that<00:05:08.630> we<00:05:08.930> do<00:05:09.200> have<00:05:09.380> some

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
now I'm noticing that we do have some

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.610 
now I'm noticing that we do have some
insects<00:05:10.250> and<00:05:10.460> and<00:05:11.390> there's<00:05:11.660> possibly<00:05:12.350> some

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
insects and and there's possibly some

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.680 
insects and and there's possibly some
growth<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:13.040> we<00:05:13.130> don't<00:05:13.310> want<00:05:13.550> what<00:05:14.540> do<00:05:14.630> you

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
growth that we don't want what do you

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.659 
growth that we don't want what do you
think<00:05:14.900> yeah<00:05:15.590> I<00:05:15.620> think<00:05:15.860> you've<00:05:16.070> got<00:05:16.250> a<00:05:16.280> few

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
think yeah I think you've got a few

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.060 
think yeah I think you've got a few
shoots<00:05:17.090> that<00:05:17.419> are<00:05:17.710> starting<00:05:18.710> to<00:05:18.740> come<00:05:18.890> out

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
shoots that are starting to come out

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.250 
shoots that are starting to come out
from<00:05:19.370> probably<00:05:19.700> below<00:05:20.030> the<00:05:20.240> graph<00:05:20.419> Jeanie<00:05:20.840> you

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
from probably below the graph Jeanie you

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.780 
from probably below the graph Jeanie you
can<00:05:21.380> kind<00:05:21.620> of<00:05:21.680> see<00:05:21.860> how<00:05:22.010> there's<00:05:22.280> a<00:05:22.340> difference

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
can kind of see how there's a difference

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.409 
can kind of see how there's a difference
in<00:05:23.200> leaf<00:05:24.200> shape<00:05:24.470> and<00:05:24.770> foliage<00:05:25.190> and<00:05:25.520> these<00:05:26.240> are

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
in leaf shape and foliage and these are

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.510 
in leaf shape and foliage and these are
kind<00:05:26.750> of<00:05:26.900> putting<00:05:27.110> a<00:05:27.229> lot<00:05:27.380> of<00:05:27.530> real<00:05:27.710> rampant

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
kind of putting a lot of real rampant

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.540 
kind of putting a lot of real rampant
growth<00:05:28.729> on<00:05:29.000> so<00:05:29.300> these<00:05:29.510> are<00:05:29.660> probably

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
growth on so these are probably

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.100 
growth on so these are probably
rootstock<00:05:31.580> material<00:05:32.360> so<00:05:32.540> those<00:05:32.720> need<00:05:32.960> to<00:05:32.990> be

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
rootstock material so those need to be

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:41.260 
rootstock material so those need to be
cut<00:05:33.410> off<00:05:33.560> at<00:05:33.800> the<00:05:33.830> point<00:05:34.220> of<00:05:34.370> origin<00:05:40.060> clip<00:05:41.060> all

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
cut off at the point of origin clip all

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.240 
cut off at the point of origin clip all
those<00:05:41.450> off<00:05:41.720> because<00:05:41.930> they're<00:05:42.260> taking<00:05:42.890> a<00:05:43.130> lot

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
those off because they're taking a lot

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.820 
those off because they're taking a lot
of<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.550> energy<00:05:43.970> away<00:05:44.180> from<00:05:44.210> the<00:05:44.479> main<00:05:45.470> part<00:05:45.770> of

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
of the energy away from the main part of

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.159 
of the energy away from the main part of
the<00:05:45.950> plant<00:05:46.220> so<00:05:46.490> we<00:05:46.520> want<00:05:46.789> to<00:05:46.850> keep<00:05:47.000> those<00:05:47.210> those

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
the plant so we want to keep those those

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.380 
the plant so we want to keep those those
cut<00:05:48.440> down<00:05:48.680> and<00:05:49.039> not<00:05:49.520> let<00:05:49.729> them<00:05:49.850> get<00:05:49.970> too<00:05:50.210> much

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
cut down and not let them get too much

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.900 
cut down and not let them get too much
growth<00:05:50.630> on<00:05:50.900> them<00:05:51.050> okay<00:05:51.680> we<00:05:52.130> also<00:05:52.280> have<00:05:52.580> a<00:05:52.610> rose

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
growth on them okay we also have a rose

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.909 
growth on them okay we also have a rose
here<00:05:53.210> that's<00:05:53.510> kind<00:05:53.780> of<00:05:53.840> a<00:05:54.020> what<00:05:54.530> we<00:05:54.650> call<00:05:54.890> a

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
here that's kind of a what we call a

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.540 
here that's kind of a what we call a
spent<00:05:55.340> rose<00:05:55.610> where<00:05:56.000> it's<00:05:56.180> kind<00:05:56.720> of<00:05:57.250> beyond<00:05:58.250> its

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
spent rose where it's kind of beyond its

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.730 
spent rose where it's kind of beyond its
maturity<00:05:59.030> and<00:05:59.450> so<00:05:59.900> it<00:06:00.050> needs<00:06:00.229> to<00:06:00.350> be<00:06:00.410> clipped

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
maturity and so it needs to be clipped

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.590 
maturity and so it needs to be clipped
off<00:06:00.950> Rose<00:06:01.370> Ariens<00:06:01.760> kind<00:06:02.000> of<00:06:02.060> like<00:06:02.150> to<00:06:02.300> do<00:06:02.450> it

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
off Rose Ariens kind of like to do it

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.120 
off Rose Ariens kind of like to do it
about<00:06:02.840> with<00:06:03.260> the<00:06:03.440> first<00:06:03.680> five<00:06:04.640> leaflet<00:06:05.210> leaf

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
about with the first five leaflet leaf

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.340 
about with the first five leaflet leaf
so<00:06:07.130> we'll<00:06:07.280> cut<00:06:07.490> that<00:06:07.669> off<00:06:07.940> and<00:06:08.270> one<00:06:09.140> of<00:06:09.260> the

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
so we'll cut that off and one of the

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.930 
so we'll cut that off and one of the
things<00:06:09.530> that<00:06:09.860> you<00:06:10.039> can<00:06:10.190> kind<00:06:10.400> of<00:06:10.460> check<00:06:10.640> for

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
things that you can kind of check for

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.490 
things that you can kind of check for
when<00:06:11.120> you're<00:06:11.270> doing<00:06:11.539> it<00:06:11.720> is<00:06:11.900> to<00:06:12.110> see<00:06:12.289> whether

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
when you're doing it is to see whether

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.880 
when you're doing it is to see whether
you<00:06:12.650> have<00:06:13.300> trypsin<00:06:14.300> here<00:06:14.600> and<00:06:14.750> thrips<00:06:15.650> or<00:06:15.860> a

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
you have trypsin here and thrips or a

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.920 
you have trypsin here and thrips or a
little<00:06:16.130> teeny<00:06:16.370> tiny<00:06:16.460> insect<00:06:17.240> can<00:06:17.450> kind<00:06:17.720> of<00:06:17.750> see

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
little teeny tiny insect can kind of see

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.950 
little teeny tiny insect can kind of see
just<00:06:18.350> these<00:06:19.250> little<00:06:19.550> tiny<00:06:19.910> slivers<00:06:20.510> moving

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
just these little tiny slivers moving

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.920 
just these little tiny slivers moving
around<00:06:21.140> on<00:06:21.440> the<00:06:21.710> on<00:06:21.919> the<00:06:22.430> rose<00:06:22.610> petal<00:06:23.060> there's

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
around on the on the rose petal there's

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.900 
around on the on the rose petal there's
one<00:06:24.169> right<00:06:24.350> in<00:06:24.470> the<00:06:24.500> center<00:06:24.919> there<00:06:24.950> what<00:06:25.789> do<00:06:25.880> I

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
one right in the center there what do I

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.940 
one right in the center there what do I
need<00:06:26.120> to<00:06:26.270> do<00:06:26.390> to<00:06:26.510> control<00:06:26.780> this<00:06:27.050> those<00:06:27.919> are

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
need to do to control this those are

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.920 
need to do to control this those are
very<00:06:28.430> very<00:06:28.610> hard<00:06:28.850> to<00:06:28.940> control<00:06:29.120> usually<00:06:29.780> what

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
very very hard to control usually what

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.990 
very very hard to control usually what
we<00:06:30.020> do<00:06:30.200> is<00:06:30.229> take<00:06:30.590> the<00:06:30.650> spent<00:06:31.070> roses<00:06:31.490> off<00:06:31.700> and

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
we do is take the spent roses off and

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.740 
we do is take the spent roses off and
not<00:06:32.150> throw<00:06:32.479> them<00:06:32.539> back<00:06:32.780> down<00:06:32.990> on<00:06:33.229> the<00:06:33.350> ground

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
not throw them back down on the ground

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.500 
not throw them back down on the ground
like<00:06:33.840> a<00:06:33.870> lot<00:06:34.080> of<00:06:34.200> people<00:06:34.470> do<00:06:34.680> so<00:06:35.300> as<00:06:36.300> soon<00:06:36.360> as

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
like a lot of people do so as soon as

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.330 
like a lot of people do so as soon as
the<00:06:36.750> rose<00:06:36.930> is<00:06:37.230> becoming<00:06:37.650> a<00:06:37.800> little<00:06:37.890> bit<00:06:38.040> over

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
the rose is becoming a little bit over

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.640 
the rose is becoming a little bit over
mature<00:06:38.670> get<00:06:38.970> it<00:06:39.060> clipped<00:06:39.270> off<00:06:39.540> and<00:06:39.840> get<00:06:39.960> it<00:06:40.080> put

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
mature get it clipped off and get it put

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.620 
mature get it clipped off and get it put
in<00:06:40.680> the<00:06:40.920> trash<00:06:41.190> and<00:06:41.220> just<00:06:41.580> posed<00:06:41.970> of<00:06:42.240> because

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 
in the trash and just posed of because

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.380 
in the trash and just posed of because
you<00:06:42.810> can<00:06:43.020> reinvest<00:06:43.650> some<00:06:44.010> of<00:06:44.130> the<00:06:44.280> roses<00:06:45.180> by

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
you can reinvest some of the roses by

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.000 
you can reinvest some of the roses by
throwing<00:06:45.630> these<00:06:45.810> back<00:06:46.050> down<00:06:46.290> on<00:06:46.500> the<00:06:46.590> ground

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.010 
throwing these back down on the ground

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.520 
throwing these back down on the ground
there<00:06:47.700> are<00:06:47.850> insecticides<00:06:48.510> and<00:06:48.750> you<00:06:49.080> can<00:06:49.260> use

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.530 
there are insecticides and you can use

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.070 
there are insecticides and you can use
when<00:06:49.800> the<00:06:49.950> rose<00:06:50.130> is<00:06:50.430> in<00:06:50.670> more<00:06:51.330> of<00:06:51.360> a<00:06:51.540> tight<00:06:51.780> bud

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
when the rose is in more of a tight bud

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.570 
when the rose is in more of a tight bud
because<00:06:52.290> that's<00:06:52.590> when<00:06:52.800> the<00:06:52.980> thrip<00:06:53.250> will<00:06:53.400> get

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
because that's when the thrip will get

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.950 
because that's when the thrip will get
into<00:06:53.970> them<00:06:54.060> and<00:06:55.880> insecticide<00:06:56.880> sprays<00:06:57.240> can<00:06:57.270> can

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
into them and insecticide sprays can can

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.410 
into them and insecticide sprays can can
be<00:06:58.080> used<00:06:58.320> there<00:06:58.620> again<00:06:59.550> in<00:06:59.760> the<00:06:59.880> tight<00:07:00.090> form

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:00.420 
be used there again in the tight form

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.300 
be used there again in the tight form
once<00:07:00.660> it's<00:07:00.900> opened<00:07:01.230> up<00:07:01.320> like<00:07:01.500> this<00:07:01.800> then<00:07:02.160> the

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
once it's opened up like this then the

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.280 
once it's opened up like this then the
thrip<00:07:02.580> is<00:07:02.730> already<00:07:03.060> probably<00:07:03.780> already<00:07:04.020> done

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.290 
thrip is already probably already done

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.530 
thrip is already probably already done
its<00:07:04.470> damage<00:07:04.730> so<00:07:05.730> with<00:07:05.940> the<00:07:06.090> insecticide

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:06.540 
its damage so with the insecticide

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.550 
its damage so with the insecticide
sprays<00:07:07.020> would<00:07:07.200> that<00:07:07.290> be<00:07:07.380> like<00:07:07.500> mouth<00:07:07.710> ion<00:07:08.130> or

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.560 
sprays would that be like mouth ion or
