is<00:01:46.429> a<00:01:46.459> big<00:01:46.700> part<00:01:47.000> of<00:01:47.209> using<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.599> environment

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
is a big part of using the environment

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.260 
is a big part of using the environment
like<00:01:48.289> finding<00:01:48.979> intelligent<00:01:49.130> places<00:01:49.939> to<00:01:50.060> hide

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270

players<00:01:58.819> from<00:01:59.030> around<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.569> side<00:02:00.069> oh

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.430 

the<00:02:05.370> space<00:02:05.790> you're<00:02:06.090> playing<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.780> an<00:02:07.020> extra

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
the space you're playing it is an extra

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.320 
the space you're playing it is an extra
character<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.490> going<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.700> change<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
character and it's going to change the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.280 
character and it's going to change the
dynamic<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.259> every<00:02:10.649> comment

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.319 

get<00:02:15.769> down<00:02:15.950> then<00:02:16.340> when<00:02:16.459> an<00:02:16.579> encounter<00:02:16.819> happens

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
get down then when an encounter happens

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.539 
get down then when an encounter happens
we<00:02:17.450> want<00:02:17.659> things<00:02:18.079> to<00:02:18.230> slow<00:02:18.469> down<00:02:18.680> I'm<00:02:19.219> going<00:02:19.459> to

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
we want things to slow down I'm going to

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.429 
we want things to slow down I'm going to
use<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.299> thing<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.629> we<00:02:20.689> call<00:02:20.750> listen<00:02:21.260> mode

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:21.439 
use this thing that we call listen mode

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.530 
use this thing that we call listen mode
lets<00:02:21.769> Joe<00:02:21.980> kind<00:02:22.219> of<00:02:22.280> focus<00:02:22.700> his<00:02:22.849> attention<00:02:22.909> is

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
lets Joe kind of focus his attention is

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.740 
lets Joe kind of focus his attention is
