 benefit of drug cartels organized crime 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.480
 like the gulf

 detected this moment 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.790
 according to the results of research and intelligence by the mental 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.310
 Within the cartels, 30 to 40 people are destined to search 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.310
 contacts that provide terrible assault pistols 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.810
 grenade chargers if you look telescopic 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.340
 by its elected characteristics that state was tied 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:11.439
 for example the grenades

 throughout the Mexican territory 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.669
 more than 4 thousand six hundred and 67 weapons of this class 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.339
 Guanajuato is not exempt from this crime

 documents of the pgr and the national defense secretariat sedena 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:01.139
 reveal that this entity is of the national average the greatest

 puebla and tamaulipas themselves that account for 60% of the crimes that 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:20.399
 report every year 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.329
 b

 this is just an example of what happens with the body 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.690
 happened on June 23 when an armed commando confronted police 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.979

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.810
 the sicarios retreated in this house 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.379
 and another shootout began 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:21.459
 on the walls and windows and this metal gate 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.459
 only the vestiges of the fray remain 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:27.159
 deceased force 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:28.620
 same as they were 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.159
 some inside the house which started badly 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.039
 for police forces

 and he threw three fragmentation grenades 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:46.639
 saying 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.949
 they say they belong to the group of acts 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.419
 in confrontations like these the assassins seem to be more protected 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.249
 dictates of the authority to carry larger-capacity ballistic vests 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:01.889

 armament makes it almost impossible to stop the onslaught of crime 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.839
 in this chart the vulnerable areas are observed on the left side 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:11.120
 the bulletproof vests 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.120

 with all this panorama the government of united states

 seeks to apply an effective strategy to curb arms trafficking towards 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.860
 Mexico includes effective control
