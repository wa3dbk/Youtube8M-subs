dental imaging team and you ok I know
digital<00:00:22.590> imaging<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.369> only<00:00:23.670> brought<00:00:24.109> some

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
digital imaging the only brought some

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.170 
digital imaging the only brought some
point<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.859> shoot<00:00:26.039> cameras<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.849> yes

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
point and shoot cameras with you yes

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.599 
point and shoot cameras with you yes
this<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:28.140> one<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.859> models<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.279> our<00:00:29.369> lineup

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
this is one of the models in our lineup

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.150 
this is one of the models in our lineup
but<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.480> WX<00:00:30.900> 80<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.619> does<00:00:31.890> have

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
but this is the WX 80 and this does have

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.040 
but this is the WX 80 and this does have
you<00:00:32.460> know<00:00:32.669> X<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.210> model<00:00:33.450> number<00:00:33.690> tells<00:00:33.899> us

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
you know X and the model number tells us

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.020 
you know X and the model number tells us
x<00:00:34.260> more<00:00:34.440> our<00:00:34.590> sensor<00:00:35.040> ok<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.489> outstanding

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
x more our sensor ok so outstanding

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.180 
x more our sensor ok so outstanding
low-light<00:00:36.750> performance<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.649> know<00:00:37.739> it's<00:00:38.100> just

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
low-light performance you know it's just

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.490 
low-light performance you know it's just
a<00:00:38.430> big<00:00:38.760> improvement<00:00:39.540> not<00:00:39.930> only<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.230> low-light

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
a big improvement not only in low-light

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.139 
a big improvement not only in low-light
performance<00:00:40.550> but<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.700> cameras<00:00:42.000> use<00:00:42.120> a

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
performance but the cameras use a

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.119 
performance but the cameras use a
different<00:00:42.480> processor<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.379> faster<00:00:43.950> you

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
different processor so it's faster you

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.430 
different processor so it's faster you
can<00:00:44.160> shoot<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.120> one<00:00:45.329> full<00:00:45.629> 1920<00:00:46.200> x<00:00:46.320> 1080

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
can shoot with this one full 1920 x 1080

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.529 
can shoot with this one full 1920 x 1080
video<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.250> do<00:00:47.640> video<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.059> stills<00:00:48.270> at<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
video and do video and stills at the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.810 
video and do video and stills at the
same<00:00:48.719> time<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.559> shoot<00:00:49.739> 10<00:00:50.340> frames<00:00:50.610> per

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
same time you can shoot 10 frames per

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.790 
same time you can shoot 10 frames per
second<00:00:51.210> at<00:00:51.329> maximum<00:00:51.930> resolution<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.739> know

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
second at maximum resolution you know

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.380 
second at maximum resolution you know
believe<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.070> or<00:00:53.190> not<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.520> tiny<00:00:53.879> little<00:00:54.149> thing

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
believe it or not this tiny little thing

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.180 
believe it or not this tiny little thing
is<00:00:54.690> an<00:00:54.899> eight<00:00:55.020> times<00:00:55.260> optical<00:00:55.469> zoom<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:56.010> year

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
is an eight times optical zoom this year

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.479 
is an eight times optical zoom this year
Wow<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.820> with<00:00:57.859> enhancement<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.250> there's

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
Wow and with enhancement to that there's

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.639 
Wow and with enhancement to that there's
a<00:00:59.550> processing<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.449> here<00:01:00.600> called<00:01:00.780> by<00:01:01.230> pixel

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
a processing in here called by pixel

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.039 
a processing in here called by pixel
resolution<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.579> actually<00:01:03.090> gives<00:01:03.690> you

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
resolution that actually gives you

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.440 
resolution that actually gives you
double<00:01:04.769> back<00:01:05.129> oh<00:01:05.369> what<00:01:05.820> else<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.330> in

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
double back oh what else is going on in

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.600 
double back oh what else is going on in
this<00:01:06.479> guy<00:01:06.720> um<00:01:07.049> well<00:01:07.500> actually<00:01:07.710> something<00:01:08.369> you

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
this guy um well actually something you

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.700 
this guy um well actually something you
can't<00:01:08.970> see<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.840> has<00:01:09.960> Wi-Fi<00:01:10.140> built<00:01:10.350> in

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
can't see is that it has Wi-Fi built in

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.340 
can't see is that it has Wi-Fi built in
ok<00:01:11.250> now<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:12.060> actually<00:01:12.659> will<00:01:12.750> tie<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.170> with

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
ok now this actually will tie in with

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.190 
ok now this actually will tie in with
your<00:01:13.500> smartphone<00:01:13.850> because<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.360> allows<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.080> to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
your smartphone because it allows you to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.660 
your smartphone because it allows you to
use<00:01:16.320> your<00:01:16.350> smartphone<00:01:16.770> as<00:01:17.040> remote<00:01:17.340> control

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
use your smartphone as remote control

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.160 
use your smartphone as remote control
that's<00:01:17.939> that's<00:01:18.299> something<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.720> kind<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:18.990> seen

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
that's that's something we kind of seen

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.550 
that's that's something we kind of seen
before<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:19.619> never<00:01:20.030> never<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.210> kind<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.020> this

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
before but never never on kind of this

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.990 
before but never never on kind of this
sort<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.830> product<00:01:23.220> point<00:01:23.400> right<00:01:23.580> it's<00:01:23.700> usually

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
sort of product point right it's usually

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.580 
sort of product point right it's usually
on<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.150> higher<00:01:24.330> end<00:01:24.570> correct<00:01:25.020> yeah<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.470> is

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
on a higher end correct yeah this is

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.800 
on a higher end correct yeah this is
this<00:01:25.710> particular<00:01:26.159> camera<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.490> 199<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.659> you're

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
this particular camera is 199 so you're

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.270 
this particular camera is 199 so you're
you<00:01:28.080> know<00:01:28.170> we're<00:01:28.500> at<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> very<00:01:28.950> similar<00:01:29.250> to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
you know we're at a very similar to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.039 
you know we're at a very similar to
price<00:01:29.520> point<00:01:29.759> where<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.060> were<00:01:30.180> last<00:01:30.390> year<00:01:30.630> for

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
price point where we were last year for

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.140 
price point where we were last year for
no<00:01:31.590> Wi-Fi<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.250> five<00:01:32.430> times<00:01:32.670> optical<00:01:32.880> zoom

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
no Wi-Fi in a five times optical zoom

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.179 
no Wi-Fi in a five times optical zoom
and<00:01:33.479> now<00:01:33.930> it's<00:01:34.140> much<00:01:34.320> thinner<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.890> know<00:01:34.979> with

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
and now it's much thinner you know with

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.789 
and now it's much thinner you know with
the<00:01:35.340> Wi-Fi<00:01:35.670> built-in<00:01:36.060> it'll<00:01:36.869> also<00:01:37.079> let<00:01:37.560> you

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the Wi-Fi built-in it'll also let you

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.950 
the Wi-Fi built-in it'll also let you
wirelessly<00:01:38.610> transfer<00:01:39.210> content<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.900> your

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
wirelessly transfer content to your

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.539
