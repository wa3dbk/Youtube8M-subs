00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.560 
they come out of that and show a little
bit<00:01:29.220> resolving<00:01:29.700> character<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.240> almost<00:01:30.390> like

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
bit resolving character it's almost like

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.360 
bit resolving character it's almost like
learning<00:01:30.870> longer<00:01:31.410> yeah<00:01:31.740> they<00:01:31.890> learn<00:01:32.070> along

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
learning longer yeah they learn along

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.860 
learning longer yeah they learn along
the<00:01:32.400> way<00:01:32.520> exactly<00:01:32.880> how<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.300> handle<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
the way exactly how to handle the

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.930 
the way exactly how to handle the
Premiership<00:01:34.380> we're<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.580> just<00:01:35.760> been

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.470 
themselves in real trouble they serve me
well<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.580> nine<00:01:50.730> to<00:01:50.880> two<00:01:51.030> will<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.270> some

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
well that nine to two will have some

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.210 
well that nine to two will have some
takers<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.350> basis<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.740> Wiggins

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
takers just on the basis that Wiggins

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.950 
takers just on the basis that Wiggins
pricing<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.760> relegation<00:01:54.210> market<00:01:54.510> fluctuates

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
pricing the relegation market fluctuates

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.380 
pricing the relegation market fluctuates
so<00:01:55.080> much<00:01:55.409> well<00:01:56.370> our<00:01:56.460> first<00:01:56.640> bet<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.120> walls

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
so much well our first bet is on walls

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.810 
so much well our first bet is on walls
to<00:01:57.570> win<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.780> game<00:01:57.960> that's<00:01:58.800> at<00:01:59.010> 13<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.640> 10<00:01:59.760> I

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
to win the game that's at 13 to 10 I

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.490 
to win the game that's at 13 to 10 I
just<00:02:00.060> feel<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.240> price<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.810> slightly<00:02:01.020> too<00:02:01.470> big

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
just feel that price is slightly too big

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.100 
just feel that price is slightly too big
I<00:02:01.860> thought<00:02:01.980> it<00:02:02.040> might<00:02:02.250> be<00:02:02.340> 11<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.730> 10<00:02:02.940> or<00:02:02.970> 5<00:02:03.810> 24

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
I thought it might be 11 to 10 or 5 24

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.890 
I thought it might be 11 to 10 or 5 24
it's<00:02:04.260> only<00:02:04.440> a<00:02:04.470> touch<00:02:04.740> too<00:02:04.979> big<00:02:05.479> Wigan<00:02:06.479> have

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
it's only a touch too big Wigan have

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.139 
it's only a touch too big Wigan have
conceded<00:02:07.290> 31<00:02:08.009> goals<00:02:08.190> away<00:02:08.399> from<00:02:08.700> home<00:02:08.940> this

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
conceded 31 goals away from home this

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.910 
conceded 31 goals away from home this
season<00:02:09.360> which<00:02:09.690> also<00:02:09.929> gives<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> pointer

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
season which also gives you a pointer

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.920 
season which also gives you a pointer
towards<00:02:11.099> walls<00:02:11.580> there's<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.300> joint<00:02:12.599> worst

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
towards walls there's a joint worst

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.649 
towards walls there's a joint worst
defensive<00:02:13.530> record<00:02:13.680> away<00:02:14.610> from<00:02:14.819> home<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.540> that

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
defensive record away from home and that

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.209 
defensive record away from home and that
leaves<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:16.019> into<00:02:16.290> our<00:02:16.319> second<00:02:16.859> bet<00:02:16.950> on<00:02:17.129> the

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
leaves it into our second bet on the

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.789 
leaves it into our second bet on the
game<00:02:17.400> which<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.329> both<00:02:18.569> teams<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.109> score<00:02:19.139> at<00:02:19.650> a

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
game which is both teams to score at a

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.050 
game which is both teams to score at a
price<00:02:20.129> of<00:02:20.370> nine

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
price of nine

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:31.530
