any other the speech ended perhaps

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.570 
any other the speech ended perhaps
predictably<00:02:56.690> on<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.320> very<00:02:57.620> utopian<00:02:57.950> note<00:02:58.400> of

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
predictably on a very utopian note of

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.520 
predictably on a very utopian note of
being<00:02:59.150> one<00:02:59.330> nation<00:02:59.570> of<00:02:59.840> being<00:03:00.020> one<00:03:00.140> country

that<00:03:00.560> again<00:03:00.980> sounded<00:03:01.310> like<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.580> Obama<00:03:02.000> from

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150

that again sounded like the Obama from
2004<00:03:02.840> imagine<00:03:03.830> he<00:03:04.010> asked<00:03:04.370> if<00:03:04.459> we<00:03:04.490> did

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
2004 imagine he asked if we did

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.520 
2004 imagine he asked if we did
something<00:03:04.790> different<00:03:05.630> as<00:03:05.750> politicians<00:03:06.170> by

something different as politicians by

putting aside the trite bickering that

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.630 
putting aside the trite bickering that
seems<00:03:09.350> to<00:03:09.500> characterize<00:03:09.980> Congress<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.520> get

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
seems to characterize Congress and get
