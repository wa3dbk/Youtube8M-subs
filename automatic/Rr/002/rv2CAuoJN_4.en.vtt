00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
the thing about products that we learned

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.209 
the thing about products that we learned
in<00:01:55.689> this<00:01:55.780> research<00:01:56.140> when<00:01:56.409> we<00:01:56.530> began<00:01:56.799> this<00:01:56.860> is

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
in this research when we began this is

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.520 
in this research when we began this is
that<00:01:57.430> there's<00:01:57.700> no<00:01:57.759> regulation<00:01:58.149> and<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:59.200> assume

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
that there's no regulation and I assume

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.090 
that there's no regulation and I assume
that<00:01:59.799> either<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.369> FDA<00:02:00.670> or<00:02:01.060> some<00:02:02.020> agency<00:02:02.500> had<00:02:03.070> a

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
that either the FDA or some agency had a

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.130 
that either the FDA or some agency had a
regulatory<00:02:03.490> authority<00:02:04.450> over<00:02:04.750> skin<00:02:04.960> care
