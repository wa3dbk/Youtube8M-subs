00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.060 
and there we have it pretty funny right
okay<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.130> let's<00:02:02.460> take<00:02:02.730> a<00:02:02.790> closer<00:02:03.180> look<00:02:04.070> here's

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
okay so let's take a closer look here's

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.820 
okay so let's take a closer look here's
the<00:02:05.160> body<00:02:05.400> art<00:02:05.870> okay<00:02:06.870> pretty<00:02:07.170> standard<00:02:07.590> for<00:02:07.770> an

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
the body art okay pretty standard for an

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.230 
the body art okay pretty standard for an
alien<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:09.479> there's<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.259> back<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:11.240> guess

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
alien and there's the back I guess

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.550 
alien and there's the back I guess
they're<00:02:12.390> twins<00:02:12.630> because<00:02:12.840> they<00:02:13.080> have<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.350> same

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
they're twins because they have the same

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.590 
they're twins because they have the same
pants<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.670> same<00:02:14.940> shirt<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:16.200> same<00:02:16.410> gun<00:02:17.540> but<00:02:18.540> I

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
pants the same shirt the same gun but I

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.940 
pants the same shirt the same gun but I
think<00:02:18.780> they<00:02:18.840> go<00:02:18.930> overboard<00:02:19.260> when<00:02:19.680> they<00:02:19.770> start

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.500 
think they go overboard when they start

now<00:03:51.540> we<00:03:51.600> can<00:03:51.780> see<00:03:51.959> it<00:03:52.050> from<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.470> top<00:03:53.450> alright

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
now we can see it from the top alright

have a lot of guns - you have to - here
at<00:04:11.599> the<00:04:11.750> laser<00:04:11.930> beam<00:04:12.200> some<00:04:12.739> flick<00:04:12.980> missiles

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
at the laser beam some flick missiles

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.659 
at the laser beam some flick missiles
and<00:04:13.810> some<00:04:14.810> guns<00:04:14.989> on<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.230> side<00:04:15.469> so<00:04:16.190> he's<00:04:16.400> pretty

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
and some guns on the side so he's pretty

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.090 
and some guns on the side so he's pretty
well<00:04:16.759> armed<00:04:17.180> so<00:04:18.079> the<00:04:18.199> image<00:04:18.500> should<00:04:18.680> be<00:04:18.889> afraid

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
well armed so the image should be afraid

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.849 
well armed so the image should be afraid
of<00:04:19.190> him<00:04:19.810> okay<00:04:20.810> so<00:04:20.900> let<00:04:21.139> me<00:04:21.169> just<00:04:21.380> go<00:04:21.560> on<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.799> the

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
of him okay so let me just go on to the

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.060 
of him okay so let me just go on to the
playability<00:04:23.440> okay<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.590> first<00:04:24.770> thing<00:04:24.860> I<00:04:24.949> want

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
playability okay the first thing I want

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.290 
playability okay the first thing I want
to<00:04:25.100> point<00:04:25.280> out<00:04:25.460> is<00:04:25.580> that<00:04:25.699> I<00:04:25.729> took<00:04:25.970> off<00:04:26.240> the

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
to point out is that I took off the

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.820 
to point out is that I took off the
rotors<00:04:26.750> this<00:04:27.050> way<00:04:27.229> they<00:04:27.350> won't<00:04:27.470> get<00:04:27.650> in<00:04:27.740> the

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
rotors this way they won't get in the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.400 
rotors this way they won't get in the
way<00:04:27.979> and<00:04:28.250> it's<00:04:28.580> easier<00:04:28.820> to<00:04:28.880> see<00:04:28.970> everything<00:04:29.410> so

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
way and it's easier to see everything so

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.710 
way and it's easier to see everything so
let's<00:04:30.500> throw<00:04:30.650> out<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:30.860> canopy<00:04:31.419> okay<00:04:32.419> which<00:04:32.600> is

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
let's throw out the canopy okay which is

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.990 
let's throw out the canopy okay which is
pretty<00:04:32.960> easy<00:04:33.199> to<00:04:33.380> take<00:04:33.500> off<00:04:33.850> alright<00:04:34.850> it's

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
pretty easy to take off alright it's

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.820 
pretty easy to take off alright it's
only<00:04:35.120> attached<00:04:35.479> by<00:04:35.630> this<00:04:35.690> one<00:04:36.229> stud<00:04:36.470> here<00:04:36.680> and

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
four studs this way he could lean back

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.700 
four studs this way he could lean back
and<00:04:48.020> he<00:04:48.080> has<00:04:48.289> some<00:04:48.530> space<00:04:48.800> to<00:04:48.949> work<00:04:48.979> with<00:04:49.360> okay

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
and that goes there pretty neat these

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.740 
and that goes there pretty neat these
are<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.370> flick<00:04:55.610> fire<00:04:55.820> missiles<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:56.570> only

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
are the flick fire missiles the only

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.510 
are the flick fire missiles the only
thing<00:04:56.900> I<00:04:56.960> don't<00:04:57.020> like<00:04:57.169> about<00:04:57.380> this<00:04:57.860> setup<00:04:58.160> is

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
thing I don't like about this setup is

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.580 
thing I don't like about this setup is
that<00:04:58.669> this<00:04:59.360> parts<00:04:59.660> really<00:04:59.690> loose<00:05:00.080> it<00:05:00.289> goes<00:05:00.410> in

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
that this parts really loose it goes in

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.770 
that this parts really loose it goes in
and<00:05:00.710> out<00:05:00.770> like<00:05:00.830> that<00:05:01.190> whoa<00:05:01.789> ever<00:05:02.090> stop<00:05:02.419> that<00:05:02.599> I

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
and out like that whoa ever stop that I

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.469 
and out like that whoa ever stop that I
forget<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.139> wrong<00:05:03.259> idea<00:05:03.820> okay<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:05.090> you<00:05:05.330> just

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
forget the wrong idea okay and you just

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.850 
forget the wrong idea okay and you just
push<00:05:05.750> this<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.680> it'll<00:05:06.979> fire<00:05:07.840> and<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:09.680> reason

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
push this and it'll fire and the reason

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.460 
push this and it'll fire and the reason
why<00:05:09.919> is<00:05:10.010> loose<00:05:10.190> like<00:05:10.400> that<00:05:10.430> I'll<00:05:11.270> show<00:05:11.479> you<00:05:11.539> if

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
why is loose like that I'll show you if

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.920 
why is loose like that I'll show you if
you<00:05:12.560> look<00:05:12.710> inside<00:05:12.860> here<00:05:13.460> okay<00:05:14.449> there's<00:05:14.659> plenty

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
you look inside here okay there's plenty

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.089 
you look inside here okay there's plenty
of<00:05:14.990> space<00:05:15.229> and<00:05:15.500> that's<00:05:15.740> how<00:05:15.830> that<00:05:15.889> mechanism

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
of space and that's how that mechanism

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:22.360 
of space and that's how that mechanism
works<00:05:16.690> all<00:05:17.690> right<00:05:20.680> okay<00:05:21.680> before<00:05:21.889> I<00:05:22.099> talk<00:05:22.340> about

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
works all right okay before I talk about

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.370 
works all right okay before I talk about
the<00:05:22.699> engines<00:05:23.120> that<00:05:23.539> are<00:05:23.630> connected<00:05:23.990> over<00:05:24.169> here

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
the engines that are connected over here

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.870 
the engines that are connected over here
let's<00:05:25.039> take<00:05:25.159> a<00:05:25.190> look<00:05:25.340> at<00:05:25.430> the<00:05:25.490> instruction

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
let's take a look at the instruction

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.350 
let's take a look at the instruction
book<00:05:26.060> first<00:05:26.590> all<00:05:27.590> right

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
book first all right

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.320 
book first all right
that's<00:05:29.360> step<00:05:29.599> 33<00:05:30.139> you<00:05:30.830> see<00:05:31.010> that<00:05:31.159> as<00:05:31.310> flat<00:05:31.639> all

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
that's step 33 you see that as flat all

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.969 
that's step 33 you see that as flat all
right<00:05:32.510> and<00:05:32.630> then<00:05:32.720> when<00:05:32.840> you<00:05:32.900> move<00:05:33.080> to<00:05:33.110> step<00:05:33.349> 34

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
right and then when you move to step 34

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.860 
right and then when you move to step 34
they<00:05:34.699> tell<00:05:34.940> you<00:05:35.030> to<00:05:35.120> curve<00:05:35.360> it<00:05:35.479> down<00:05:35.659> like<00:05:35.840> that

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
they tell you to curve it down like that

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.500 
they tell you to curve it down like that
into<00:05:36.440> that<00:05:36.560> position<00:05:36.880> which<00:05:37.880> I<00:05:38.000> think<00:05:38.210> that<00:05:38.389> is

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
into that position which I think that is

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.290 
into that position which I think that is
the<00:05:38.599> position<00:05:38.990> that<00:05:39.020> they<00:05:39.229> intended<00:05:39.650> however

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
the position that they intended however

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.870 
the position that they intended however
you<00:05:41.300> go<00:05:41.449> towards<00:05:41.840> the<00:05:41.960> back<00:05:42.550> you'll<00:05:43.550> see<00:05:43.580> that

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
you go towards the back you'll see that

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.790 
you go towards the back you'll see that
it's<00:05:44.090> flat<00:05:44.300> again<00:05:44.599> probably<00:05:45.289> cause<00:05:45.560> it's<00:05:45.710> on

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
it's flat again probably cause it's on

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.520 
it's flat again probably cause it's on
the<00:05:45.889> ground<00:05:46.130> who<00:05:46.699> knows<00:05:47.110> all<00:05:48.110> right<00:05:48.260> and<00:05:48.440> then

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
the ground who knows all right and then

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.500 
the ground who knows all right and then
if<00:05:48.620> you<00:05:48.680> look<00:05:48.800> on<00:05:48.889> the<00:05:48.979> front<00:05:49.070> cover<00:05:49.510> you'll

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
if you look on the front cover you'll

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.649 
if you look on the front cover you'll
see<00:05:50.750> that<00:05:50.990> the<00:05:51.860> position<00:05:52.070> is<00:05:52.610> slightly<00:05:53.360> curved

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
see that the position is slightly curved

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:56.230 
see that the position is slightly curved
down<00:05:53.900> so<00:05:54.740> in<00:05:54.979> the<00:05:55.099> end<00:05:55.220> I<00:05:55.550> think<00:05:55.699> it's<00:05:56.030> really

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
down so in the end I think it's really

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.080 
down so in the end I think it's really
up<00:05:56.389> to<00:05:56.419> you<00:05:56.659> is<00:05:56.810> whatever<00:05:56.990> you<00:05:57.229> prefer<00:05:57.380> I

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
up to you is whatever you prefer I

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.249 
up to you is whatever you prefer I
happen<00:05:59.090> to<00:05:59.120> do<00:05:59.300> it<00:05:59.419> as<00:05:59.539> they<00:05:59.690> had<00:05:59.840> it<00:05:59.960> in<00:06:00.050> step

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:00.259 
happen to do it as they had it in step

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:02.620 
happen to do it as they had it in step
34<00:06:00.770> because<00:06:01.310> I<00:06:01.400> think<00:06:01.460> it<00:06:01.639> looks<00:06:01.669> cooler<00:06:02.030> here

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630
