00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 in my according to the situation of the deputy 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.020
 amendments are often used 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.909
 out training level 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:11.589
 because that is 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.219
 the staircase faces down so two very often 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.019
 crimes occur 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.150
 assault management 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.910
 right now I'll wait for the bully who 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.930
 dark thoughts 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.560
 and then there will be an ordinary citizen who 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.570
 older home is prohibited as 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.130
 says a little bit before that year 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.790
 there was a word supposed to say about 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.420
 buffer zone and football selection usually 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.660
 commoner understood 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.140
 when we talk about that chance 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.950
 will be minimal 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.600
 this is all public hearing station this 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.159
 vegetable 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:44.820
 from 50 meters runs 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.060
 in the hands of scratching a note 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.930
 probability turned around and ran 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.060
 in the same direction the control is lower yes how would 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.319
 Yes, and they have fun without coming closer 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:54.350
 buzakka 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.710
 before this agreement yes and 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.629
 show mutuzit Idzhis 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.589
 through the glass dial time 02 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.329
 and dallas and better sit one object but 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.720
 this is a new section 1 5 billion so that's why 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.560
 until the day we are that but as if we are not now 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.369
 we will show oao a number of moments and relatives 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.130
 say maybe something interesting myself 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.369
 simple reflex goals but with 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.899
 considering the same studio kampf happens but I 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.479
 I would like to surplus viewers so that they do not 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.810
 perceived what the guys will show 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.180
 as an educational film is not trying to repeat 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.180
 that came to them is no one 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.300
 now we are modeling 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.580
 the situation 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.380
 in personal space 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.240
 that is, there is an agrostar 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.670
 good character 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.560
 but specifically further well, let's say sheet 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.380
 but before you model 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.610
 situation and explain a number of points 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.720
 feature 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.699
 I want to say 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.149
 he says but 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.019
 all this beer politics think what is it 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.969
 is Putin's hand 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.359
 This is called the financial frontier 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:18.499
 checked 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:21.189
 zanussi is proven in spanish yes that 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.229
 if a 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:24.829
 opponents came closer 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.189
 chances of your survival 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.450
 after welcome 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.450
 even prepared man minimal 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:34.919
 usually 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.949
 danger 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:38.849
 do not speak without saying 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.299
 Ukrainian zone is named 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.629
 noticed 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.009
 the odds he says are quite high 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:46.539
 anything can be done 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:48.739
 so here we are now begin to market now 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.179
 a number of moments 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:53.149
 means show show you 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:56.089
 situational things 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:58.839
 We have a knife 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:01.689
 Ilya will say so hypothetically 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:03.779
 political 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:06.269
 as a person who sees himself 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.309
 according to my security model 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:10.299
 suspiciously regarded as 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.749
 enemy 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.539
 the difference immediately tell the transition from the enemy 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:15.879
 how to go 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.289
 about something 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:19.499
 while he 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.669
 I see him as a date for me too 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.209
 says a lot says there is a car in 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.639
 first they are like an adversary that is 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.239
 clearly who will hand over the residence why 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.919
 but only he will have 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.919
 car suspicions that he has 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:33.579
 knife 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.299
 probook friday every now and then three at all 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.459
 another level 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.989
 in the same level we will not tell you 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.449
 place of mercy 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:43.769
 and we are talking about less space 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.389
 this start increased danger 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.219
 here someone must know something 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.659
 But if he again passed in the hands of the enemy 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:53.869
 he is armed 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:56.869
 in principle, we are now begin 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:00.309
 what was fast before bedtime was like 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:02.689
 then methylparaben games 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:04.469
 I come in rubles 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:06.319
 I don't know who I am 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.439
 and I have 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.279
 with intent 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:12.279
 these property 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.509
 or simply 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:17.509
 to bow 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.739
 P 

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.830
 now when 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.139
 you say peace 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.750
 not base warsaw and in fact 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.809
 estimated 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:36.789
 the government does not allow 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.270
 she increase 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.270
 the intention of barnaul is concrete in general 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.819
 but when a man does not fit 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.110
 and especially 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.389
 nestles and first of all 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.580
 as they say, they gave themselves to children, but 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.620
 we are talking about what time and signs 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.730
 further the most important was the lighthouse 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.279
 what is 5 kopecks 

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:01.309
 Novikov 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:03.889
 not expecting as they say in action 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.999
 I'm crossing 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:09.509
 the ability to go out the knife we ​​know what 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:10.879
 here can 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:13.370
 and yes I went by 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.980
 we will all talk 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.199
 she is ambivalent but she is used 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.710
 This work is located here is a blow to the groin 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.839
 in order to 

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:25.379
 bent down 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:27.409
 hand control idea 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:30.300
 transit transition to interception panasyuk places 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.389
 and knee kick 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.460
 a man with a knee 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.610
 overlap because 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.949
 from the same place 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.189
 wouldn't move 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:44.680
 it goes on next to him including the head 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.330
 because in our opinion as they say in 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.309
 statement is napoleon 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:50.870
 on the back of the head 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.289
 this is when the options 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:53.840
 option two
