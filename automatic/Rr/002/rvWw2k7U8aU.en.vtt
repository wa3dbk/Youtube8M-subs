00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.030
 Hello today, I would like to 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.000
 tell you more about the devices 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.670

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.640
 This devices marker she has a lot 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.680
 questions you had on the device for 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.250
 hot manicure after we 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.180
 laid out a video on this topic and so I 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.740
 I will show you in more detail and tell you about 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.769
 hot manicure trays 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.820
 so I took it out of the packaging in 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.820
 set to this jar and here are 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.670
 replaceable spare slippers that you 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.100
 can in principle after the procedure 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.039
 hot manicure disinfect 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.160

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.129
 disinfectors 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.760
 Further, as usual, you rinse to dry. 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.399
 after we pass the time 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.020
 exposure for disinfection see 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.960
 necessarily instruction on your 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.270
 liquid disinfectants and further 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.990
 good and and wipe and can 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.320
 store further quickly purple 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.270
 the sterilizer device itself 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.750
 That's the way it looks from the back 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.520
 side he has a power cord and also 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.119
 on / off button this 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.420
 the only button on his body and 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.619
 so before work I install the device 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.710
 take one replaceable bath insert yon 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.930
 the device and in this interchangeable mural I 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:39.030
 pour lotion lotion i use 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.939
 necessarily with the addition of lanolin so 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.030
 as he allen does not give lotion at 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.360

 very cute pouring lotion points i 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:00.159
 approximately but probably two thirds 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:05.619
 put such a jar in the device and on 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:08.399

 roughly heated by time lotion 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.480
 up to a temperature of 35 degrees for 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.670

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.390
 only the client came to you prepare 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.220

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.310
 already said we told in our 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.989

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:40.690

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.940
 solder and they can fail 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.610
 creep press burst after a few 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.390

 about which we also told you in 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.960
 our previous previous photos and videos 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.670

 paraffin and protective grid which i 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.010
 told you meant to 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.760
 let customers lowering the handle in paraffin 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.740
 and burned one this bath let's 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.500
 let's see what we have 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.350
 paraffin trays on the front panel 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.650
 so we have three buttons a button 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.689
 turn on off experience off 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.330
 state 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:51.489
 the device when you turn on you immediately 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.149
 a certain temperature appears 

00:04:51.489 --> 00:04:58.360
 which you can regulate that 

00:04:55.149 --> 00:05:00.969
 which do you want to reach temperatures 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.979
 paraffin let's say so on average 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:06.029
 temperature carrying pro kia filter 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:10.860
 will be approximately 50 degrees 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:14.039
 so using the right button for 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.269
 burn down by choosing this 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.599
 the temperature 

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:21.699
 setting 50 degrees time 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:24.719
 warming up three and a half liters 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.439
 paraffin wax will be approximately 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:30.279
 an hour and a half 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:31.839
 in salons usually paraffin paraffin 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:35.019
 bath leaves included 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:39.179
 almost around the clock to 

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:44.829
 even the first customers could already do 

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:46.779
 This procedure in the morning and another very 

00:05:44.829 --> 00:05:49.899
 the right thing for any master 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:52.209

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.610
 to the table 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:06:00.219
 he has a kit like this 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:04.839
 holder we carefully fasten 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:08.679
 This holder is first pillar then 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:12.009
 insert lamp holder here is 

00:06:08.679 --> 00:06:13.199
 special little ponytail for her 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:16.749
 pinning 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:19.959
 further you open a lamp and that to me 

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:23.190
 really like she is very mobile she 

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:25.440
 may well enough on spots such 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:29.070
 at a distance you can move 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.790
 put her closer also you can her 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:35.760
 turn to turn in different 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:39.230
 sides and and lighting is enough 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.900
 convenient here the switch is on 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:46.370
 lamp housing itself and it is very 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:49.140
 sustained large illumination area 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.390
 I hope you will find our advice useful.
