00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
up in my neck area and hands so I'll be

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.219 
up in my neck area and hands so I'll be
with<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.740> monster<00:01:20.430> at<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> end<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.880> day

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
with like monster at the end of the day

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.649 
with like monster at the end of the day
and<00:01:22.430> that's<00:01:23.430> why<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.820> fake<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> force<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.630> I

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
and that's why I have fake a force so I

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.969 
and that's why I have fake a force so I
don't<00:01:24.930> look<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.229> monster

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
don't look like a monster

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.999 
don't look like a monster
at<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> end<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.580> day<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.829> maybe<00:01:28.829> it's

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
at the end of the day but maybe it's

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.950 
at the end of the day but maybe it's
just<00:01:29.130> me<00:01:29.340> made<00:01:29.549> us<00:01:29.670> because<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.090> sweat<00:01:30.509> all<00:01:30.689> day

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
just me made us because I sweat all day

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.890 
just me made us because I sweat all day
and<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.259> sweat<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.829> much<00:01:32.040> cuz<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.670> hot<00:01:32.909> and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
and I sweat so much cuz it's so hot and

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.800 
and I sweat so much cuz it's so hot and
that's<00:01:34.229> probably<00:01:34.560> why<00:01:34.799> but<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.060> work<00:01:36.600> like

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
that's probably why but if you work like

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.410 
that's probably why but if you work like
in<00:01:37.020> an<00:01:37.110> office<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.950> really<00:01:38.790> wouldn't<00:01:39.060> want<00:01:39.180> to

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
in an office I really wouldn't want to

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.030 
in an office I really wouldn't want to
but<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.200> no<00:01:40.470> offense

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
but if you do no offense

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.380 
but if you do no offense
that's<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.700> that's<00:01:41.880> my<00:01:41.970> personality

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
that's just you that's my personality

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.319 
that's just you that's my personality
it's<00:01:42.689> not<00:01:42.840> working<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.380> office<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.640> if

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
it's not working in the office and if

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.990 
it's not working in the office and if
you<00:01:45.450> do<00:01:45.600> work<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:46.200> an<00:01:46.380> office<00:01:46.500> then<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.670> might

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
you do work in an office then it might

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.630 
you do work in an office then it might
be<00:01:48.180> for<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.540> because<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:50.250> know<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.430> get<00:01:50.610> to

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
be for you because you know you get to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.219
