00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.730
 many toilet cleaning products 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.830
 They have the following on their label 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.410
 warning in case of ingestion 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.870
 accidentally contacting your 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.480
 doctor and inform of this 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.570
 label to the national service of 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.880
 toxicology 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.430
 this warning is too much for the product 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.410
 which we are going to talk about next is 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:30.250
 we recommend that you eat more 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.320
 welcome to the reef 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.720
 many cleaning products have 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.460
 toxic chemical components and others of 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.860
 personal hygiene they carry in their 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.610
 composition some as dangerous as 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.250
 the parabens but you imagine a 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.949
 cleaning product or a deodorant 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.270
 that was not only harmless but 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.110
 that also in case of ingestion outside 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.820
 beneficial 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.250
 well that product exists and it's called 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.650
 baking soda 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.090
 in previous videos we saw the 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.489
 innumerable benefits that the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.100
 sodium bicarbonate produced in our 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.229
 organism but it is also a 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.990
 good weapon against the threat of 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.689
 chemical products in our home 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.270
 the bicarbonate is a natural deodorant 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.549
 if we make a paste with baking soda and 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.220
 a little water and we apply it on the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.520
 underarms we have a natural deodorant 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.189
 ecological and without parabens that does not 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.560
 represents any kind of risk to 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.509
 our health 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.090
 also it can be applied in the form 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:38.990
 dry , not mixed with water on all 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.909
 Footwear type toothpaste all 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.920
 we know that fluoride is dangerous and that 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.409
 it is very complicated to find a paste of 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.710
 teeth that is not saturated with fluoride 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.070
 Well, if we mix bicarbonate with 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.100
 a pinch of salt and a little water 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.979
 we will obtain a natural toothpaste that 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.909
 also has bleaching effect on 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.859
 the teeth 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.469
 indeed some toothpastes 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:08.100
 whitening agents incorporate among their 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:11.790
 components to baking soda 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.640
 freshener the dishwashers and the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.880
 refrigerators are usually sites that accumulate 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.460
 smells of food but we do not like 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.340
 put chemical air fresheners in one place 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.440
 where our dishes usually go or 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.720
 our food a spoonful of 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.750
 baking soda in the fridge or in the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.920
 dishwasher and the smell will go away 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.550
 need for chemical air fresheners 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.290
 exfoliating to remove dead skin 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.380
 nothing how to massage the skin in circles 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.550
 with paste made from bicarbonate and 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.350
 of water 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.350
 one part water and three baking soda 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.300
 Fatty hair wash adds a 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.090
 teaspoon of baking soda to your shampoo 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.720
 usual and you'll see how the 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.010
 hair with great ease washing fruit and 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.060
 vegetable pesticides chemical fertilizers 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.690
 microorganisms the fruit and the vegetable 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.540
 you have to wash it thoroughly but of course it's not 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.720
 Bleach good and trust the 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.210
 water alone can kill these remains 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.880
 It's a lot to ask , however, enough 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.270
 submerge the fruit or vegetable in water with 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.350
 bicarbonate to solve this 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.390
 problem 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.480
 the proportion one tablespoon of 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.300
 bicarbonate for every liter of water 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.909
 antich when you do not need products 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.709
 abrasives simply with casting 4 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.230
 tablespoons of baking soda in the washing machine 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.349
 a couple of washings a month and we 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.730
 we will save anti-lime products 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.980
 commercial 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.709
 It is recommended that you take advantage of 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.540
 you have to put a cold wash for 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.850
 use this method since with water 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.180
 hot does not work too 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.880
 extinct the landlord throws the bicarbonate 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.580
 of sodium on frying pans or for 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.650
 lowering the fire the barbecues is a 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.660
 very useful method and this is because 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.390
 when the sodium bicarbonate is heated 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.080
 produces carbon dioxide that like 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.940
 you all know ends with the flames of 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.010
 made most of the extinguishers 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.350
 commercial are filled with 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.959
 baking soda mixed with other 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.000
 substances we could continue to count the 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.030
 uses bicarbonate as cleaning 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.560
 microwave ovens pots pans 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.510
 pots etc because there are few uses in 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.210
 those who do not intervene this fantastic 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.330
 ally and while we have a relegated to 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.120
 this product in a closet the industry 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.920
 as always engaged in selling us things 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.560
 that we do not need makes its August 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.150
 the bad thing is that in the end we always 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.520
 they convince that theirs is the best 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.670
 when installed the idea between us that 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.250
 the home does not work and that if it is so 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.580
 cheap good can not be 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.770
 and while we buy your products 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.380
 they comment among themselves playing golf what 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.960
 good that are their departments of 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.500
 marketing we hope this video has 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:18.750
 been useful and if you want to help us
