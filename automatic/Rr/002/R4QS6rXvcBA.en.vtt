00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.590
 the cd such talks beauty guys do not know 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.480
 but what to enter this time my people 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.240
 work that a special guest bruno 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.369
 clash and there that will explain to you 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.260
 which is happening then as some 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.670
 We have known for some time ago we 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.859
 had the first is the second decision 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.539
 paying for October and finally there 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.940
 committed people are bringing 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.360
 The third edition of the event 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.180
 little but how is it going to be? 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.840
 so it's going to be a china play zone 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.960
 It's going to be very feminine, it's the last time. 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.789
 in which we had of ones is mine 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.829
 I have enough ideas of the attacks on 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.820
 people are singing recording a lot 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.680
 good thing 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.930
 several failures might be able to speak the name 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.320
 of the channel 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:08.070
 this is it, this is the third edition already 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:10.830
 and I just slapped the back of my neck so that 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.790
 Okay, I hope they're pretty cool as 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.170
 were the other 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.290
 We are looking for a guest of 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.030
 MarÃ­lia is organizing and we had 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.610
 Here are some requirements 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.530
 to participate because surely now 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.490
 with a great knowledge of the carts 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.159
 of childhood 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.979
 We have to have to increase the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.259
 requirements for each participant 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.509
 That 's it. Actually, we have a 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.320
 guys who will be eligible to us already 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.090
 You know 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.619
 and then we want to open a galley 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.329
 new people are new and quality then 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.450
 we can not force everyone 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.270
 the demand is to have only 50 people, right? 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.299
 It's so we can not do several 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.909
 all then you could call everything 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.770
 world would suddenly deliver a plan 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.799
 from October to October of 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.610
 suddenly but who knows in the future who 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:06.960
 You know one outubro.no plan enrolled there 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.970
 and who I liked rafa is so obvious but 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.679
 will know if he falls to explain to 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.640
 people like you do not and the 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.470
 requirements 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.670
 Me and Bruno are over. 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.700
 forgetting to mention the video more 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.130
 war of eight berths and on the 17th of the 4 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.560
 then it will be declared eight hours from 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.600
 night we're going is to send information 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.850
 Straight to you, what's happening? 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.510
 What customer did you pick up then stay connected 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.100
 beauty 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.240
 Now I'll talk to the first video. 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.390
 doc about the minimum subscribers 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.020
 We thought and bitch is a bit difficult. 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.870
 will have a lot of guys and rolling but one 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.120
 minimum cut I think it would be a channels 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.010
 over one thousand subscribers 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.510
 to start anyway I'm sure 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.290
 You will have to make some 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.440
 others 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.230
 some other ports and in this case no 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.090
 great to open it to anyone who has it 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.380
 Of course we'll feel it in the 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.550
 the first time, then what the 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.040
 people will open to others exactly 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.110
 So we'll decide how it's going to be. 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.450
 but I think you're going to 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.980
 to enjoy and you will not be much 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.709
 people had already called us 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.570
 other times only participate but could not 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.370
 a little complicated at the time 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.959
 It was a longer time then I liked 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.030
 that's what we gave an insured to 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.580
 launch this new edition to be able to 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.200
 participate a new group also giving 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.340
 to organize better, too. 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.860
 this is it and about something else is just going 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.330
 one person per channel can participate 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.970
 because it has channels that have more 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.150
 of a person and dinÃ©lson is not there 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.330
 then one person per channel and 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.519
 basically this is this is whoever you want 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.720
 Participate send me a message there 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.489
 the problem did not make us go 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.670
 trying to control it is already in 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.590
 Reef also ufc this comment then the 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.430
 facebook team 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:00.390
 bruno is bruno clash and mine likes it 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.430
 very good time in the description is that there 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.320
 she sends a message not at all calm with 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.989
 people leave a message that goes 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.220
 answer is that 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.049
 and we will try to do what we can 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.870
 to be as fair as possible to call 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:17.280
 guys new guys got it then was 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:21.739
 staying here can do nothing worth 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.530
 thank you for the maximum audience 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.810
 So I said thank you and thanks then. 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.380
 said people I went sign up for the channel 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.380
