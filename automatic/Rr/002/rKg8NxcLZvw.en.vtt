00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.450
 namely with this tweet quite simple 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.800
 switch between conversations by 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.120
 we here with the finger over it 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.350
 We can just delete here

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.530
 changing between entertainments 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.149
 that is in my opinion a whole 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.399
 practical of course just kind of 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.460
 People often use the news app 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.530
 Use the service to help you 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.180
 use or even just one 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.420
 to write sms or 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.949
 lead to several entertainments and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.630
 yes in my opinion a practical one 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.540
 trick you can definitely times 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.850
 I would like to download you next 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.369
 like to introduce the fig grid switcher 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.320
 which you can already see here and 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.450
 Although we get with rigips witcher 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.570
 a new view for multitasking 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.409
 we have the whole thing here in a 2 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.680
 x 2 layout and yes we still have 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.909
 a kind of car design or cards 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.619
 be economical so i say now 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.299
 just something in my opinion very 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.880
 looks elegant and also pretty cool 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.670
 we can continue to use apps too 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.470
 just delete a blank so 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.140
 that there is no problem at all 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.060
 super easy and looks as I said mine 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.350
 opinion on just super from us 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.610
 You can still do that in the settings 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.750
 a few things set so to 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.850
 For example, here we can 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.590
 still scale and different icons 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.240
 again choose another layout for 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.840
 example on 4 x 4 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.329
 Of course, that looks a bit strange 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.310
 just say here but overall 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.659
 in my opinion a super sad 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.280
 which especially visually striking the 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.140
 Next week I will show you today 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.879
 wants to call itself in the match race and 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.590
 meter price in my opinion is one 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.120
 very very ingenious trick 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.190
 and this is especially helpful 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.650
 if you have to do with foreign languages 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.269
 as in this case in this 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.480
 wikipedia page is because that is here 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.069
 an English wikipedia article and 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.720
 we can do it very simply 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.370
 translate various texts 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.540
 everything really works with a lot 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.580
 very many texts 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.860
 no matter where you are now on the ice 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.099
 and I can just do it now 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.769
 Mark a text here and then here 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.989
 go translate if we do that 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.900
 really translated all the supporten 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.660
 So from English to German here 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.709
 then we have just the German 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.480
 translations in my opinion 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.680
 So it's pretty good 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.120
 I just say hit terms 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.819
 there will not be any garbage 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.500
 out and the whole thing we can what I 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.150
 also very awesome find in the 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.370
 just adjust settings 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.349
 so we need a first here 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.310
 Selection of the point mehtap race and 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.579
 Of course we have to do it all 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.220
 activate and then we can 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.549
 choose which languages translate 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.389
 we know what I know here too 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.019
 select Azerbaijani and then 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:23.730
 This text will be translated into Albanian 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.220
 translated that is my very ingenious 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.970
 and useful for school 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.920
 your profession or wherever you are 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.269
 foreign languages ​​has to do the next and 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.980
 in my opinion also very much 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.380
 awesome trick I show you today 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.329
 finally want to be effective and keyboard 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.760
 with adaptive keyboard could the us 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.280
 system a bit more varied 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.650
 and this concerns the 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.859
 keyboard we know that yes we have in 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.780
 normal ice system only the 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.919
 standard keyboard and 7.1 yet 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.139
 black keyboard 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.480
 what would be cool the color 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.430
 adapt and what i like about this app 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.769
 Cool is that the keyboard in 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.680
 every app different means that 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.319
 whole adjusts to the color of the icon 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.900
 I show that his times now at the 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.549
 fair cep a green icon we have 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.829
 see here we have one here too 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.880
 Green keyboard will show the whole thing 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.160
 times the notes 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.530
 we have them here so well he does 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.590
 beige orange somehow such a mixer 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.949
 kept out 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.440
 and the icons tor so there we have it 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.510
 a clear design and we just have 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.070
 also a leader of a keyboard 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.729
 that is pretty much in my opinion 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.169
 pretty cool and as I said very much 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.820
 varied and the last trick 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.590
 which I want to show you today 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.150
 whatsapp place you certainly have it 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.889
 All told was told by 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.960
 facebook on bought yet 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.389
 Nonetheless whatsapp can always be 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.910
 still huge number of users 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.699
 It just means very much 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.880
 Many people continue to use whatsapp 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:57.310
 but unfortunately a service is still 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.620
 not so mature huge of the 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.860
 one or the other introduces some cool 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.229
 features adds that in spite of space 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.540
 For example, a keyword means that 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.310
 us in the use of ours 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.280
 Eyes in the use of whatsapp 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.680
 be spared at night or we can 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.650
 now more than ten pictures respectively 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.780
 Sending videos at the same time and that 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.850
 In my opinion, I think the best 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.830
 is that we now also send music 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.260
 we can have people here as well 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.419
 then cher music and then 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.650
 we just forwarded to the music app 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.200
 and here we could theoretically 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.600
 select the titles which we will then simply 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.880
 I find that to someone else 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.139
 in my opinion very ingenious and 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.090
 especially on the iphone 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:43.450
 whatsapp is definitely one of them 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.160
 function is missing and therefore whatsapp 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.229
 that in my opinion a very 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.810
 Practical tweak I definitely 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.250
 can recommend so that it was also 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.419
 again from this video 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.099
 I hope you like this video 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.110
 Of course I hope so too 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:57.849
 that you liked these tricks 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.310
 if this is the case you can yes 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:01.990
 like a thumbs up or a 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.889
 would let me abo because in any case 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.229
 very pleased 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.910
 Of course I hope that too 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:09.250
 we'll talk again in the next videos 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.560
 See again and will be there 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.669
 see for and say bye and bye 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.330
 next time 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.330
 yesterday
