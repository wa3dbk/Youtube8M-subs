00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:12.830
 very good we are back in the 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.900
 four guts meetings that finally 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.220
 Well, people were already asking me 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.840
 so in the end he decided to do so 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.750
 that nothing then let's start if with the 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.470
 reviews you already know that I have the house is 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:30.050
 of decoration not for moral reviews 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.220
 to the house is worth the first thing they see 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.509
 go well on this topic is that the 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.580
 crystals itself is instead worth 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.600
 let's go here here crystal 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.160
 It will be as you see is changed to if 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.480
 translucent not to make it better to the 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.210
 time to do what is payment of what 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.649
 be next here because there is the sword 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:53.590
 let's copy the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:55.949
 and so the diamond one the gold one the 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.449
 stone the iron and the wood 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.339
 always attack and defend attack and 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.989
 defend defend and attack this sword 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.890
 is what removes lens and hilt 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.509
 vouchers of that is the one that has so long 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.700
 we go the wield itself of the 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.890
 sword and made an effect as well as that 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.310
 It starts from dark to clear it 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.300
 just like this a small detail for 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.490
 then over here because of the peaks I have 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.619
 nothing changed three peaks are what 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.150
 I have changed and I think he is also 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.220
 changing yes 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.070
 It's worth everything under stone 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.830
 Excited not to change it 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.220
 here is the iron diamond the 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.830
 wood 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.680
 of gold as I always put the 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.090
 wood a different tone the shovels are 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.480
 the same ones and that there are no problems the 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.880
 fishing rod and the blue simply does not 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.900
 I also wanted a lot of things around here 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.070
 the interpol that as you already know 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.380
 They are usually changing color so 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.840
 be and here is the arch worth the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.700
 particles I will not teach them yet 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.800
 so nothing else sees and so the arch that 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.900
 the forms and currents as always in 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.300
 the colors that I always put 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.460
 which are yellow and red green and 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.200
 is the ndl so let's never put me 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.899
 moves from zero without opening inventories like 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.950
 You see the experience bar 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.950
 hearts and the annoying 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:25.370
 this we leave it like this we put ourselves through 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.380
 of one and the armor is worth the only thing 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.780
 there are also cubes friend these 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.610
 the water is totally blue and the 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.080
 extraction does not change many things in 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.810
 change for the diamond assembler 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.239
 if what I change what they are elite is not 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.280
 ok I have changed in the item but 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.080
 I have not changed when putting it on 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.459
 around here and so it's worth it does not change it 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.459
 surely in the center to next 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:50.000
 if it has changed this same thing 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.069
 same as meals for meals 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.170
 just changed the apple 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.269
 if the the mushroom stew for the 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.459
 people who are engaged on bp and the 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.380
 golden apple for those who play those 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.900
 this type of pvp that is with apple 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.890
 golden and by team the positions we are going 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.890
 to take percent of generation 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.860
 of generation in so instantaneous and 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.780
 snapshot I already know we had 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.000
 a lot of people wanted me 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.130
 asking that the period of 30 opens 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.390
 people who upload the most beautiful text 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.840
 because I wanted so badly that 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:32.470
 I do not know if he's going to succeed from 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:32.470
 europe or not but at normal 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.769
 of the previous paper is in that it does not change 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.239
 a lot of potions particles because 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.680
 I like to talk about the previous pack 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.350
 Well, I'm going to leave them and I'm going to 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.080
 dedicate more we do what we always do 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.489
 easy so that it does not bother around here the 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.720
 water as well a super water 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.209
 transparent so I could do 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.480
 perfectly as you see inside so it looks 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.970
 Super good 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.780
 But there's no problem 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.910
 as you see here in my corner and butt and 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.330
 here you can spend what what comes 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.340
 being the least the ores I wanted to do 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.380
 a different thing but I'm sorry for 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.730
 this cut is worth pm this is a small 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.140
 cut but it was that they had called me the 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.820
 phone as not in my case always 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.650
 they call the phone so you can not 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.600
 do other things that cut the video 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.310
 ok I'm sorry it's worth as I was saying 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.750
 Well, we're still here in what's coming 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.190
 being the ores that I wanted to do the 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.140
 You are merely different to make it look 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.520
 we go from far not for example you 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.460
 also you come from here and 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.010
 differences each chain the one that does not and does not 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.720
 they confuse each other just that 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.060
 ok also let's see the particles 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.800
 already from 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.010
 I always have my block here 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.010
 commands with the iron golem let's see 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.010
 particular 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.819
 I will lower the water as always and now 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:49.220
 also took the opportunity to see if the 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:53.509
 beige has that green every time it passes 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:57.039
 above the squares they become 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:59.270
 green is already and flower trays 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.520
 flowers also that this is called 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.050
 mud and now it's called poppies and I do not know 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.449
 why is paul called that those of 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.979
 moya in that they give him so we're going to 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.229
 invoke here the iron golem as 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:13.099
 you know worth critical critic is critical 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.539
 critical and very critical as you see the 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:17.900
 normal particles of acuities because they are 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:21.320
 blue as always 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.880
 and the critical particles also in 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.889
 instead of the orange or another color has 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.270
 decided red to look like epics 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.270
 as if it were a critical hit 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:34.120
 I was very excited and the people who 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.680
 there would be the tropa test and then here what 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.020
 you have the text of peace guys but you 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.460
 I show my face like that and nothing more of this 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.560
 it was a little review I do not want either 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.229
 that lasts a long time the video that if it does not take 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.789
 more in reuse and it takes longer to get on 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.860
 so against smaller ones if it lasts 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:50.379
 less then faster will be faster 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.150
 will rise so good as always and as 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:55.270
 favorite that we're already 400 seriously 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.669
 thank you very much everyone for these 400 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.710
 so a greeting for everyone you know 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.409
 that I always greet people do not 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.180
 it gives equal saluting for now I wait 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:05.889
 that when you have two thousand subscribers if 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.810
 is that I'm still saying hello to the 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.219
 people because the truth is that I like that 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.520
 to say hello and take pictures with people 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:13.810
 Well, it's something I do like that 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.939
 how good as always choose favorite 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.939
 see you in the next video bye bye
