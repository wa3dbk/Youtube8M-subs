00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:22.190
 whom the king 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.560
 minecraft and today I bring you a new 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.920
 tutele in which I will explain how 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.160
 make a farm of seeds and flowers 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.200
 in 1.5 and guys I already did this tutorial 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.500
 a long time ago at some point 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.200
 2.5 but it stopped working because 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.600
 now we can not apply bowler in the 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.400
 darkness is worth and they were the basis of that 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.470
 orange the first thing you should know 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.199
 to be able to build an orange of this 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.860
 type is that we can apply volume in 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:56.030
 the grass and as you can see it comes out 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:59.030
 recites and leaves flowers which is what 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.350
 we want very well you can 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.200
 expand this farm that I have done 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.660
 of five by five if I'm not wrong in 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.490
 effect can be done seven by seven 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.020
 so if you want to make a tad more 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.580
 big because you can make it one more pri 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.790
 great although I'm already going 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.820
 sufficiently tilted so well 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.430
 Well here I have the model and nothing is going to 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.009
 see what around here it is 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.509
 this pointed and we give it here it's going 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.940
 to release everything very much but you are going to see 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.510
 how little seeds and flowers start to arrive 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.630
 let's give it 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.990
 very well, it starts to lengthen this 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.420
 pretty and over here we're going to see 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.250
 we already have two seeds we have 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.590
 how many more napkins out there we have 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.630
 a rose and as you can see this is 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.210
 working perfectly 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.820
 if I remove around here this is the vais to 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.590
 see that there's a hopper change and it's going 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.260
 happening the little things are happening van 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.840
 happening they are going very well how 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.330
 this works because we are going to pay it or 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.120
 well first I'm going to put it up here 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.330
 you have to see what is happening what 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.830
 you see guys we are going to go up here you see 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.140
 what is happening is being applied 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.979
 bowling with the new dispensers 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.979
 the 1.5 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.040
 the grass block grass and are 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:19.000
 coming out herbs and flowers we're going to 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.540
 remove this here perfect 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 we are going to see great things stand is that 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:30.880
 I have here a flower facelift worth when 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Applies to blooming to grass block 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.980
 what goes out in the girls and the 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.780
 flowers but as there is a shift influence 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.510
 what he is going to do is that they are going to 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.280
 fall but to pick them up I'm not 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.110
 using water or anything good as you see 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.510
 over here there is some rest is worth but 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.010
 nonsense and that's because the good 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:54.040
 because it has some little stick it is not worth 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.230
 100% profitable let's say you have a 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.090
 little bit of loss from nothing 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.280
 Well basically it 's these guys here 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.340
 I have the dispenser, I have this 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.450
 window here so if you want to come 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.519
 to refill the dispenser as spears 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.760
 ohlander prepa of here in after breaking 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.019
 this block you leave it again 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.239
 censers with render but bad in 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.890
 simple because I have not done it with a 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.549
 such door because then the items will 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.630
 I would stay here and not go down to 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.690
 where then to this system d 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:32.800
 dances with main karts that I have here 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.540
 below and the key is to put 4 main cats 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.430
 in each place except the one in 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.530
 dispenser that there is one in between then 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.810
 they would all be on one side and two on the other 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.910
 what happens is that if you put 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.650
 four are going to be moving 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.990
 continuously because they touch each other with 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.540
 others and the truth is that there is an effect 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.720
 pretty interesting good around here like 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.140
 you see there is no remainder and because they are 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.480
 posts like that I mean 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.070
 if I throw here something is going to fall it's going to fall 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.490
 and it's going to disappear as you see it has 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.630
 swallowed a main card but where does that 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.250
 item of that my cut 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.060
 Well, for these guys, we're going to have to 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:13.060
 down we're going to trade here great for 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.540
 here so that over here and we're going to see that 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.549
 below the main karts are these 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.989
 hoppers is worth how good is a little 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.480
 hoppers that goes around here around 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.240
 here he goes around here around here and he 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.700
 get into the things here inside vale 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.530
 basically you should know a little 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.610
 to be able to make that floor and it's the 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.599
 next we put you for a young 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.580
 we see here this and this great and 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:40.189
 we give shift we put this we put this 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.199
 we throw a little thing there hopper nothing 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:44.210
 it goes after it is as simple as doing 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:46.110
 a path of hoppers and that come by 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.820
 here very well 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.080
 and now I'm going to explain how the 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.400
 flower system although I already explain it 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.190
 witches orange 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.890
 It's as simple as making a little path 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.410
 come here a good repeater I'll 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.420
 I've put four tics and here the 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.370
 repeaters this can be extended to 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.960
 seven is valid, so if you want to do it 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.550
 big because you do seven 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.289
 then you could put here seven 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.910
 repeaters, well, I have here 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.870
 five pistons then down here the 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.030
 current 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.160
 I have put more repeaters here 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.289
 so that the current arrives and in addition to 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.270
 that the exit here is slower or 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.889
 First of all these pistons are made 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.020
 and after these others come out when 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.160
 these have already been collected and then 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.740
 then he's going to come here in the 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.810
 current and again it will activate 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.030
 because because this piston is going to be 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.289
 on it's worth and what is this 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.840
 well it's a watch that I think I have 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:38.900
 for here I'm going to give you is for me 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.849
 I commissioned this perfect better that is this 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.190
 The clock I have here is very simple 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:47.270
 to build, you see, I give it and it creates 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:49.840
 a pulse you see is a lever one of 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:53.210
 rest 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.350
 and then a piston vertically one 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.480
 piston horizontally 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.639
 then the current goes through here it's worth 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.440
 and this what it does is that it gives a micro 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.190
 pulse at the beginning of everything we are going to 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.860
 see him 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:07.130
 to fix here, you'll see how a 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.560
 you have seen it and this is how 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.990
 work shift clock and influence 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.570
 that I created here we are going to give him cane and 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.400
 you will see that they work perfectly 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:19.730
 As you can see, a mini pulse has come out 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.980
 now it is already continuously because this 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:25.310
 cycle over here you see they are coming out 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.830
 all the time and na boys this would be the 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.530
 model of seed farms and 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.510
 flowers that has occurred to me and what good 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.770
 I think it's pretty interesting already 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.010
 it occurred to me when it came out of the 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:39.800
 dispensers and I tried it if you could 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.360
 use dispensers on grass and in effect 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.880
 then I said I will when they are done to 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.919
 1.5 I will create this and here are guys 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.410
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:52.450
 to pay this because they go to me very serious and 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.450
 I do not hope you liked it very much 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:59.020
 and here more things come to us 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.460
 mecachis in love like this is worth worth 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.910
 they are arriving they are arriving guys that 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.910
 do not panic 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:24.090
