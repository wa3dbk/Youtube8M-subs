I've<00:00:01.650> got<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:01.949> request<00:00:02.870> to<00:00:03.870> make<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.230> ground

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
I've got a request to make a ground

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.330 
I've got a request to make a ground
effect<00:00:05.460> vehicle<00:00:07.250> using<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.280> powerup

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
effect vehicle using the powerup

00:00:10.340 --> 00:02:51.480 
effect vehicle using the powerup
so<00:00:11.340> I'll<00:00:11.460> make<00:00:11.610> out<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:12.030> styrofoam<00:00:12.330> plates

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:03:01.830 

you

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:13.839 

you

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.589 

few<00:03:14.849> modifications<00:03:16.910> I've<00:03:17.910> trimmed<00:03:18.270> the

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
few modifications I've trimmed the

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.190 
few modifications I've trimmed the
fuselage<00:03:19.380> away<00:03:19.739> as<00:03:19.890> much<00:03:20.130> side<00:03:20.459> air<00:03:21.050> to<00:03:22.050> make

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
fuselage away as much side air to make

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.410 
fuselage away as much side air to make
it<00:03:22.349> lighter<00:03:22.620> but<00:03:23.610> at<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.790> same<00:03:23.970> time<00:03:24.180> I've<00:03:24.330> had

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
it lighter but at the same time I've had

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.210 
it lighter but at the same time I've had
to<00:03:24.480> add<00:03:24.720> some<00:03:24.989> weight<00:03:25.200> at<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.410> very<00:03:25.680> front<00:03:25.920> to

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
to add some weight at the very front to

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.449 
to add some weight at the very front to
keep<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.550> nose<00:03:26.730> down<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:28.160> put<00:03:29.160> fresh<00:03:29.400> batteries

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
keep the nose down I put fresh batteries

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.840 
keep the nose down I put fresh batteries
in<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.239> charger<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.250> we've<00:03:32.250> come<00:03:32.459> into<00:03:32.640> the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
in the charger and we've come into the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.690 
in the charger and we've come into the
dining<00:03:33.270> room<00:03:33.510> which<00:03:33.720> has<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:34.160> fairly<00:03:35.160> shiny

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
dining room which has a fairly shiny

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.809 
dining room which has a fairly shiny
floor<00:03:36.769> because<00:03:37.769> it<00:03:37.860> was<00:03:37.980> struggling<00:03:38.489> on<00:03:38.610> my

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
floor because it was struggling on my

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.270 
floor because it was struggling on my
kitchen<00:03:39.060> floor<00:03:39.300> which<00:03:39.900> well<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.950> isn't<00:03:41.100> a

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
kitchen floor which well it isn't a

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.770 
kitchen floor which well it isn't a
shiniest<00:03:41.760> this<00:03:42.950> so<00:03:44.150> let's<00:03:45.150> see<00:03:45.360> what<00:03:45.510> we<00:03:45.630> can

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
shiniest this so let's see what we can

00:03:45.780 --> 00:04:06.210 
shiniest this so let's see what we can
do

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.540 

that<00:04:07.220> worked<00:04:07.490> I've<00:04:08.270> lifted<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.840> carpet<00:04:09.310> in<00:04:10.310> my

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
that worked I've lifted the carpet in my

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.880 
that worked I've lifted the carpet in my
dining<00:04:10.970> room<00:04:11.260> so<00:04:12.260> I've<00:04:12.350> got<00:04:12.500> a<00:04:12.530> little<00:04:12.680> bit

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
dining room so I've got a little bit

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.729 
dining room so I've got a little bit
more<00:04:12.920> distance<00:04:13.580> to<00:04:13.730> go<00:04:14.000> on<00:04:14.240> the<00:04:14.770> shiny<00:04:15.770> surface

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
more distance to go on the shiny surface

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.699 
more distance to go on the shiny surface
still<00:04:18.739> can't<00:04:18.980> go<00:04:19.130> very<00:04:19.370> far<00:04:19.700> but<00:04:20.590> might<00:04:21.590> be

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
still can't go very far but might be

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:42.720 
still can't go very far but might be
able<00:04:21.829> to<00:04:21.950> see<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.250> detail<00:04:22.640> anyway

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.790 

that<00:04:43.730> worked<00:04:43.970> let's<00:04:44.960> try<00:04:45.170> and<00:04:45.290> film<00:04:45.500> it<00:04:45.650> from

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
that worked let's try and film it from

00:04:45.800 --> 00:05:31.820 
that worked let's try and film it from
the<00:04:45.890> opposite<00:04:46.160> direction

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:38.700 

you

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.689 

summary<00:05:39.710> time<00:05:40.749> what<00:05:41.749> we<00:05:41.990> got<00:05:42.550> we've<00:05:43.550> got<00:05:43.580> a

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
summary time what we got we've got a

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.469 
summary time what we got we've got a
ground<00:05:44.059> effect<00:05:44.569> vehicle<00:05:45.279> or<00:05:46.279> any<00:05:47.059> chrono

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
ground effect vehicle or any chrono

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.689 
ground effect vehicle or any chrono
plane<00:05:47.960> not<00:05:48.740> quite<00:05:48.949> sure<00:05:48.979> how<00:05:49.189> you<00:05:49.219> pronounce

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
plane not quite sure how you pronounce

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.149 
plane not quite sure how you pronounce
it<00:05:49.909> ground<00:05:50.779> effect<00:05:51.110> vehicle<00:05:51.559> is<00:05:51.620> much<00:05:51.770> easier

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
it ground effect vehicle is much easier

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:58.450 
it ground effect vehicle is much easier
to<00:05:52.309> say<00:05:55.120> styrofoam<00:05:56.120> plate<00:05:56.770> it's<00:05:57.770> actually<00:05:58.189> I

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
to say styrofoam plate it's actually I

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.309 
to say styrofoam plate it's actually I
think<00:05:58.669> it<00:05:58.729> was<00:05:58.819> three<00:05:59.120> styrofoam<00:05:59.779> plates<00:06:00.139> I

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 
think it was three styrofoam plates I

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:04.390 
think it was three styrofoam plates I
use<00:06:00.559> they're<00:06:02.110> got<00:06:03.110> the<00:06:03.229> power<00:06:03.439> up<00:06:03.740> just<00:06:04.069> taped

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
use they're got the power up just taped

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.600 
use they're got the power up just taped
to<00:06:04.849> the<00:06:04.939> top<00:06:05.120> of<00:06:05.300> it<00:06:05.439> with<00:06:06.439> masking<00:06:07.279> tape<00:06:07.580> so

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
to the top of it with masking tape so

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.369 
to the top of it with masking tape so
it's<00:06:08.059> easy<00:06:08.240> to<00:06:08.360> take<00:06:08.569> apart<00:06:08.900> again<00:06:09.080> and

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:09.379 
it's easy to take apart again and

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:13.329 
it's easy to take apart again and
doesn't<00:06:09.680> damage<00:06:09.889> my<00:06:10.189> power<00:06:10.639> up<00:06:12.339> fresh

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:13.339 
doesn't damage my power up fresh

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:16.719 
doesn't damage my power up fresh
batteries<00:06:13.969> in<00:06:14.740> charger<00:06:15.740> so<00:06:16.159> we<00:06:16.310> get<00:06:16.430> the<00:06:16.550> best

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
batteries in charger so we get the best

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:22.600 
batteries in charger so we get the best
out<00:06:16.969> of<00:06:16.999> it<00:06:17.240> and<00:06:19.120> it<00:06:20.120> works<00:06:20.449> I<00:06:21.490> don't<00:06:22.490> have

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
out of it and it works I don't have

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.929 
out of it and it works I don't have
enough<00:06:22.819> room<00:06:23.060> to<00:06:23.419> demonstrate<00:06:24.199> it<00:06:24.349> properly

00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:24.939 
enough room to demonstrate it properly

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:28.420 
enough room to demonstrate it properly
and<00:06:25.939> you<00:06:26.210> need<00:06:26.389> a<00:06:26.419> very<00:06:26.509> shiny<00:06:27.199> floor<00:06:27.800> for<00:06:28.400> it

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
and you need a very shiny floor for it

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.029 
and you need a very shiny floor for it
to<00:06:28.669> go<00:06:29.439> otherwise<00:06:30.439> there's<00:06:30.710> too<00:06:30.889> much

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 
to go otherwise there's too much

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:32.860 
to go otherwise there's too much
friction<00:06:31.430> under<00:06:31.819> the<00:06:31.909> wing<00:06:32.060> tips<00:06:32.419> for<00:06:32.689> it<00:06:32.749> to

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
friction under the wing tips for it to

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.050 
friction under the wing tips for it to
get<00:06:32.990> moving<00:06:33.469> once<00:06:34.249> it's<00:06:34.460> moving<00:06:34.699> and<00:06:34.999> it

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
get moving once it's moving and it

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.719 
get moving once it's moving and it
builds<00:06:35.270> up<00:06:35.449> the<00:06:35.629> cushion<00:06:35.930> of<00:06:36.050> air<00:06:36.169> underneath

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
builds up the cushion of air underneath

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.439 
builds up the cushion of air underneath
then<00:06:37.729> it's<00:06:37.909> fine

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:38.449 
then it's fine

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:42.700 
then it's fine
and<00:06:38.949> as<00:06:39.949> you'll<00:06:40.129> see<00:06:40.159> in<00:06:40.399> that<00:06:40.520> last<00:06:40.849> clip<00:06:41.710> we

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
and as you'll see in that last clip we

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.040 
and as you'll see in that last clip we
actually<00:06:43.460> took<00:06:43.610> off<00:06:43.789> at<00:06:43.969> the<00:06:44.060> end<00:06:44.210> and<00:06:44.509> hit<00:06:44.930> the

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
actually took off at the end and hit the

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.800 
actually took off at the end and hit the
camera<00:06:45.610> so<00:06:46.610> a<00:06:47.409> success<00:06:49.029> but<00:06:50.029> please<00:06:50.479> don't<00:06:50.689> ask

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
camera so a success but please don't ask

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.450 
camera so a success but please don't ask
me<00:06:51.020> to<00:06:51.110> do<00:06:51.229> another<00:06:51.439> one<00:06:51.649> of<00:06:51.680> these<00:06:51.830> ground

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:52.460 
me to do another one of these ground

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.389 
me to do another one of these ground
effect<00:06:52.789> vehicles<00:06:53.240> I<00:06:53.389> don't<00:06:53.599> like<00:06:53.810> them<00:06:54.399> it's

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:55.399 
effect vehicles I don't like them it's
