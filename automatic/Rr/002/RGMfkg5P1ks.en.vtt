00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
like this top layer and then this is the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.309 
like this top layer and then this is the
beautiful<00:02:15.860> texture<00:02:16.610> side<00:02:16.910> which<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:18.049> more

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
beautiful texture side which is more

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.860 
beautiful texture side which is more
like<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:19.069> type<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.340> results<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.150> like<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.629> see

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
like the type of results I like to see

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.250 
like the type of results I like to see
in<00:02:21.049> my<00:02:21.079> hair<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:21.890> mean<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.910> is<00:02:23.060> frizzy<00:02:23.629> as<00:02:23.810> well

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
in my hair I mean it is frizzy as well

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.440 
in my hair I mean it is frizzy as well
but<00:02:24.709> I<00:02:24.769> don't<00:02:25.160> really<00:02:25.549> mind<00:02:25.940> freeze

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
but I don't really mind freeze

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.180 
but I don't really mind freeze
especially<00:02:27.140> since<00:02:27.379> I<00:02:27.500> haven't<00:02:27.680> been<00:02:27.890> deep

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
especially since I haven't been deep

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.330 
especially since I haven't been deep
conditioning<00:02:28.849> lately<00:02:29.329> and<00:02:30.049> from<00:02:30.470> what<00:02:31.129> I've

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
conditioning lately and from what I've

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.539 
conditioning lately and from what I've
experienced<00:02:32.239> when<00:02:32.599> my<00:02:33.500> hair<00:02:33.739> doesn't<00:02:33.980> contain

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
experienced when my hair doesn't contain

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.280 
experienced when my hair doesn't contain
the<00:02:34.610> proper<00:02:34.970> moisture<00:02:35.629> that's<00:02:35.870> when<00:02:36.140> it

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
the proper moisture that's when it

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.410 
the proper moisture that's when it
starts<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.680> freeze<00:02:36.980> out<00:02:37.220> which<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.579> why<00:02:37.849> my<00:02:38.150> own

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
starts to freeze out which is why my own

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.349 
starts to freeze out which is why my own
I<00:02:38.870> guess<00:02:39.859> my<00:02:40.100> straight<00:02:40.400> hair<00:02:40.430> lasts<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.329> really

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
I guess my straight hair lasts a really

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.080 
I guess my straight hair lasts a really
long<00:02:41.630> time<00:02:42.079> when<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.500> straighten<00:02:42.889> it<00:02:43.160> because<00:02:43.940> I

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
long time when I straighten it because I

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.780 
long time when I straighten it because I
make<00:02:44.299> sure<00:02:44.329> I<00:02:44.540> deep<00:02:44.870> conditioner<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.799> put<00:02:46.639> in

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
make sure I deep conditioner and put in

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.870 
make sure I deep conditioner and put in
all<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.329> necessary<00:02:47.630> moisture<00:02:48.530> for<00:02:48.709> it<00:02:48.889> hold

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
all the necessary moisture for it hold

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.559 
all the necessary moisture for it hold
another<00:02:51.069> hold<00:02:52.069> another<00:02:52.250> video<00:02:52.609> I'll<00:02:53.269> talk

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
another hold another video I'll talk

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.479

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190

didn't<00:06:30.820> feel<00:06:31.000> like<00:06:31.060> anything<00:06:31.420> it<00:06:32.020> just<00:06:32.200> felt

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
didn't feel like anything it just felt

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.550 
didn't feel like anything it just felt
really<00:06:32.770> sticky<00:06:33.450> and<00:06:34.450> that's<00:06:34.780> the<00:06:35.050> same<00:06:35.290> thing

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
really sticky and that's the same thing

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.590 
really sticky and that's the same thing
I<00:06:35.740> felt<00:06:35.950> what<00:06:36.460> the<00:06:36.580> beautiful<00:06:37.030> texture<00:06:37.480> is

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
I felt what the beautiful texture is

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.860 
I felt what the beautiful texture is
like<00:06:37.840> the<00:06:38.560> curling<00:06:38.920> pudding<00:06:39.340> I<00:06:39.870> wasn't

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
like the curling pudding I wasn't

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.090 
like the curling pudding I wasn't
satisfied<00:06:41.050> at<00:06:41.650> all<00:06:41.770> with<00:06:42.100> it<00:06:42.340> but<00:06:43.180> I<00:06:43.210> mean<00:06:44.100> the

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.100 
satisfied at all with it but I mean the

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.220 
satisfied at all with it but I mean the
beautiful<00:06:45.640> textures<00:06:46.090> line<00:06:46.390> is<00:06:46.660> really<00:06:46.900> cheap

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
beautiful textures line is really cheap

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.590 
beautiful textures line is really cheap
and<00:06:47.500> I<00:06:47.710> guess<00:06:47.980> so<00:06:48.220> is<00:06:48.400> the<00:06:48.580> curl<00:06:48.820> Maxx<00:06:49.120> and<00:06:49.420> um

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:49.600 
and I guess so is the curl Maxx and um

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.800 
and I guess so is the curl Maxx and um
the<00:06:50.350> creative<00:06:50.830> lady<00:06:51.130> she<00:06:52.000> did<00:06:52.210> a<00:06:52.240> review<00:06:52.630> on
