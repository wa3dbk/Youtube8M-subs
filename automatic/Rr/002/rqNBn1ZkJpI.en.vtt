00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
of the micro dimples so you know the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.160 
of the micro dimples so you know the
proof<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> pudding<00:01:54.240> as<00:01:54.630> they<00:01:54.659> say<00:01:54.810> he's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
proof of the pudding as they say he's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.280 
proof of the pudding as they say he's
not<00:01:55.200> sir<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:56.180> needed<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> hitting<00:01:57.810> you

or maybe give you guys some some numbers

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.309 
or maybe give you guys some some numbers
see<00:02:16.290> if<00:02:16.350> we<00:02:16.500> can<00:02:16.910> just<00:02:17.910> be<00:02:18.030> smashing<00:02:18.780> drivers

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.020 
see if we can just be smashing drivers
so<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.890> slow<00:02:20.160> down<00:02:20.400> here<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:20.819> just

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
so I like to slow down here and just

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:34.610 
so I like to slow down here and just
swing<00:02:21.330> smooth<00:02:31.700> can<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.730> say<00:02:33.319> she<00:02:34.319> should<00:02:34.350> be<00:02:34.590> on

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
that one let's have a look at that would

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.729 
that one let's have a look at that would
like<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:43.200> was<00:02:43.350> lovely

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
like that that was lovely

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.540 
like that that was lovely
how<00:02:44.430> did<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.700> feel<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:45.330> fells<00:02:45.980> nice<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.220> soft

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
how did it feel it fells nice and soft

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.750 
how did it feel it fells nice and soft
coming<00:02:47.760> off<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.880> clubface<00:02:48.830> more<00:02:49.830> general<00:02:50.220> 21

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
coming off the clubface more general 21

00:02:50.760 --> 00:03:00.949 
coming off the clubface more general 21
degrees<00:02:58.819> replay<00:02:59.819> of<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.000> just<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:00.840> can

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
degrees replay of that just so I can

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.720 
degrees replay of that just so I can
bask<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.769> glory<00:03:02.069> of<00:03:02.190> what<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.459> tremendous

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
bask in the glory of what a tremendous

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.660 
bask in the glory of what a tremendous
shot<00:03:03.269> it<00:03:03.420> was<00:03:04.760> nearly<00:03:05.760> wet<00:03:05.970> in<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.150> holder<00:03:06.530> so

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
shot it was nearly wet in the holder so

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.199 
shot it was nearly wet in the holder so
straight<00:03:08.670> at<00:03:08.819> it

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
straight at it

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.699 
straight at it
just<00:03:09.510> want<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.690> see<00:03:09.840> how<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.959> ball<00:03:10.230> reacts<00:03:10.530> on

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
just want to see how the ball reacts on

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.819 
just want to see how the ball reacts on
the<00:03:10.860> Greve<00:03:11.239> anyway<00:03:13.820> so<00:03:14.989> he<00:03:15.989> sat<00:03:16.320> down<00:03:16.350> pretty

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
the Greve anyway so he sat down pretty

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.740 
the Greve anyway so he sat down pretty
quickly<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.760> mean<00:03:18.030> there<00:03:18.180> are<00:03:18.299> highest

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
quickly that I mean there are highest

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.569 
quickly that I mean there are highest
spinning<00:03:19.110> balls<00:03:19.350> on<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.709> market<00:03:20.100> obviously

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
spinning balls on the market obviously

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:21.530 
spinning balls on the market obviously
if<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:20.730> want<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:20.970> take<00:03:21.120> something<00:03:21.450> which

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
if you want to take something which

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.690 
if you want to take something which
would<00:03:21.720> really<00:03:22.019> gonna<00:03:22.140> spin<00:03:22.590> up<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:23.400> would<00:03:23.549> be

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
would really gonna spin up you would be

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.430 
would really gonna spin up you would be
using<00:03:23.910> maybe<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.570> NPS<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.709> MPX<00:03:27.200> probably<00:03:28.200> one

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
using maybe the NPS the MPX probably one

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.330 
using maybe the NPS the MPX probably one
that<00:03:28.680> sort<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:28.950> thing

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
that sort of thing

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.949 
that sort of thing
but<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:29.880> I<00:03:30.180> don't<00:03:30.420> know<00:03:30.510> where<00:03:30.660> this<00:03:30.780> will

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
but this I don't know where this will

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.440 
but this I don't know where this will
pitch<00:03:31.230> price-wise<00:03:31.920> in<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.370> UK<00:03:32.790> market<00:03:33.030> but

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
pitch price-wise in the UK market but

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.729 
pitch price-wise in the UK market but
I've<00:03:33.540> got<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.690> feeling<00:03:33.959> it's<00:03:34.170> gonna<00:03:34.350> be<00:03:34.530> quite

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
I've got a feeling it's gonna be quite

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.289 
I've got a feeling it's gonna be quite
reasonable<00:03:35.070> I<00:03:35.489> think<00:03:35.519> this<00:03:35.850> is<00:03:36.000> going<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.180> be

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
reasonable I think this is going to be

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.349 
reasonable I think this is going to be
an<00:03:36.390> expensive<00:03:36.959> ball<00:03:37.850> so<00:03:38.850> it's<00:03:38.970> probably<00:03:39.239> going

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
an expensive ball so it's probably going

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:40.970 
an expensive ball so it's probably going
to<00:03:39.450> be<00:03:39.540> going<00:03:39.690> up<00:03:39.900> against<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.380> shrinks<00:03:40.799> own

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
to be going up against the shrinks own

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.300 
to be going up against the shrinks own
ad<00:03:41.609> three<00:03:42.390> three<00:03:42.840> three<00:03:42.870> three<00:03:43.410> three<00:03:43.829> you

ad three three three three three you

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.270 
ad three three three three three you
know<00:03:44.459> underneath<00:03:44.730> threes<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.420> is<00:03:46.250> what<00:03:47.250> I

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
know underneath threes it is what I

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.770 
know underneath threes it is what I
should've<00:03:47.609> got<00:03:47.760> against<00:03:48.030> something<00:03:48.359> like<00:03:48.480> the

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
should've got against something like the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.340 
should've got against something like the
mid-range

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
mid-range

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.920 
mid-range
tight<00:03:49.530> list<00:03:49.829> NXT<00:03:50.489> something<00:03:50.880> like<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.359> so

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
tight list NXT something like that so

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.190 
tight list NXT something like that so
