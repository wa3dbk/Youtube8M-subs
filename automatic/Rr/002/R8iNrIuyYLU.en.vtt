starts off like this

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.400 
starts off like this
we<00:01:08.770> have<00:01:08.950> a<00:01:08.979> bend<00:01:09.399> on<00:01:09.910> the<00:01:09.970> 15th<00:01:10.660> fret<00:01:10.810> of<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.140> B

we have a bend on the 15th fret of the B

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.719 
we have a bend on the 15th fret of the B
string<00:01:11.440> and<00:01:13.229> give<00:01:14.229> it<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.470> little<00:01:14.740> vibrato<00:01:15.460> at

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
string and give it a little vibrato at

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.330 
string and give it a little vibrato at
the<00:01:15.880> end<00:01:16.320> then<00:01:17.320> we<00:01:17.530> have<00:01:17.740> a<00:01:18.130> reverse<00:01:18.700> rake<00:01:19.360> and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the end then we have a reverse rake and

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.490 
the end then we have a reverse rake and
dampening<00:01:21.340> these<00:01:22.180> two<00:01:22.509> strings<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:23.050> high<00:01:23.259> in

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
dampening these two strings the high in

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.550 
dampening these two strings the high in
high<00:01:23.860> B<00:01:24.070> okay<00:01:24.580> so<00:01:25.270> they<00:01:25.420> don't<00:01:26.020> sound<00:01:26.229> and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
high B okay so they don't sound and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.109 
high B okay so they don't sound and
bending<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:31.000> 14th<00:01:31.780> fret<00:01:32.020> of<00:01:32.260> the<00:01:32.290> g<00:01:32.650> string

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.350 

we're<00:01:37.119> listening<00:01:37.510> to<00:01:37.659> 12<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.549> pull<00:01:39.549> off<00:01:39.729> from

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
we're listening to 12 and pull off from

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.450 
we're listening to 12 and pull off from
14<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:40.869> 12<00:01:41.290> on<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.799> D<00:01:42.070> string

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
14 to 12 on the D string

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.649 
14 to 12 on the D string
so<00:01:43.299> altogether<00:01:43.689> it's<00:01:44.140> like<00:01:44.320> this<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:48.630> now<00:01:49.630> we

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
so altogether it's like this and now we

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.690 
so altogether it's like this and now we
come<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.260> the<00:01:50.409> part<00:01:50.619> of<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.600> hybrid<00:01:52.600> picking

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
come to the part of the hybrid picking

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.460 
come to the part of the hybrid picking
if<00:01:54.700> in<00:01:55.240> case<00:01:55.299> you<00:01:55.659> don't<00:01:55.840> know<00:01:56.080> what<00:01:56.290> the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
if in case you don't know what the

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.580 
if in case you don't know what the
hybrid<00:01:56.890> picking<00:01:57.070> is<00:01:57.460> it's<00:01:58.350> playing<00:01:59.350> at<00:01:59.500> the

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
hybrid picking is it's playing at the

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.219 
hybrid picking is it's playing at the
same<00:01:59.830> time<00:02:00.100> with<00:02:00.340> your<00:02:00.369> pick<00:02:00.759> and<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.720> finger

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:12.120 

and<00:02:05.229> it<00:02:05.439> sounds<00:02:05.740> like<00:02:05.890> this

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.380 

now<00:02:13.130> I'm<00:02:13.250> going<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.460> break<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.820> down<00:02:13.850> into<00:02:14.270> two

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
now I'm going to break it down into two

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.280 
now I'm going to break it down into two
sections

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
sections

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.440 
sections
sort<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.580> would<00:02:16.850> be<00:02:16.880> easier<00:02:17.390> to

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
sort of so it would be easier to

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.560 
sort of so it would be easier to
understand<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.400> okay<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.670> first<00:02:19.820> part<00:02:20.240> and

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
understand it okay the first part and

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.980 
understand it okay the first part and
the<00:02:21.140> one<00:02:21.290> that<00:02:21.470> we<00:02:21.620> play<00:02:21.860> only<00:02:22.130> with<00:02:22.430> peak<00:02:22.990> goes

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
the one that we play only with peak goes

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.710 
the one that we play only with peak goes
like<00:02:24.230> this

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.820

strings with your index finger like that

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.550 
strings with your index finger like that
sort<00:03:55.790> of<00:03:55.880> like<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.410> barre<00:03:57.410> chord<00:03:58.720> so<00:03:59.720> when<00:04:00.410> we

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
sort of like a barre chord so when we

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.710 
sort of like a barre chord so when we
combine<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.220> two<00:04:01.690> parts<00:04:02.690> together<00:04:04.510> all<00:04:05.510> you

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
combine the two parts together all you

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.970 
combine the two parts together all you
do<00:04:05.930> with<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.970> with<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.150> pick<00:04:08.420> you<00:04:09.290> play<00:04:09.650> down

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
do with the with the pick you play down

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.780 
do with the with the pick you play down
strokes<00:04:10.459> and<00:04:11.209> at<00:04:12.050> the<00:04:12.200> same<00:04:12.410> time<00:04:12.790> plucking

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
strokes and at the same time plucking

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.740 
strokes and at the same time plucking
with<00:04:14.000> your<00:04:14.380> middle<00:04:15.380> finger<00:04:15.560> so<00:04:16.480> it<00:04:17.480> would

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
with your middle finger so it would

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:26.990 
with your middle finger so it would
sound<00:04:17.959> like<00:04:18.140> this<00:04:19.570> slowly

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:37.710 

once<00:04:28.000> again<00:04:33.450> and<00:04:34.530> that's<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.710> whole<00:04:36.419> thing

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
once again and that's the whole thing

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.210 
once again and that's the whole thing
theory<00:04:38.320> about<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:41.169> other<00:04:41.680> thing<00:04:41.800> to

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
theory about it the other thing to

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.140 
theory about it the other thing to
mention<00:04:42.400> is<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:44.530> part<00:04:45.040> the<00:04:45.550> hybrid<00:04:45.940> picking

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
mention is the part the hybrid picking

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.129 
mention is the part the hybrid picking
part<00:04:46.600> starts<00:04:47.050> off<00:04:47.290> on<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:48.160> offbeat<00:04:48.340> so<00:04:49.300> it's

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
part starts off on the offbeat so it's

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:57.330 
part starts off on the offbeat so it's
one<00:04:50.650> end<00:04:50.980> you<00:04:51.850> know<00:04:52.000> one<00:04:54.540> and<00:04:55.830> then<00:04:56.830> we<00:04:57.040> finish

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
one end you know one and then we finish

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:04.290 
one end you know one and then we finish
it<00:04:57.490> off<00:04:57.639> with<00:04:57.910> this<00:04:58.780> part<00:05:02.580> so<00:05:03.580> we<00:05:04.090> play

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
it off with this part so we play

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.500 
it off with this part so we play
fourteen<00:05:05.200> twelve<00:05:05.650> fourteen<00:05:06.340> twelve<00:05:06.730> fourteen

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
fourteen twelve fourteen twelve fourteen

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.159 
fourteen twelve fourteen twelve fourteen
on<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:08.020> D<00:05:08.230> string<00:05:08.260> and<00:05:09.780> give<00:05:10.780> it<00:05:10.870> a<00:05:10.990> little

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
on the D string and give it a little

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:17.070 
on the D string and give it a little
swing<00:05:11.650> you<00:05:12.070> know<00:05:12.190> it's<00:05:12.370> a<00:05:12.490> blues<00:05:12.730> so<00:05:15.930> then<00:05:16.930> we

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
swing you know it's a blues so then we

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.140 
swing you know it's a blues so then we
play<00:05:17.290> again<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:18.010> same<00:05:18.220> double<00:05:18.610> stop<00:05:18.850> on<00:05:19.030> the

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
play again the same double stop on the

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.659 
play again the same double stop on the
twelfth<00:05:19.479> fret<00:05:19.570> the<00:05:20.169> B<00:05:20.560> and<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:20.890> G<00:05:21.040> strings<00:05:23.669> so

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
twelfth fret the B and the G strings so

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.219 
twelfth fret the B and the G strings so
all<00:05:24.790> together<00:05:25.120> it<00:05:25.270> would<00:05:25.419> be<00:05:25.540> like<00:05:25.690> this<00:05:25.840> and

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:33.810 

then<00:05:29.229> we<00:05:29.470> play<00:05:29.940> pool<00:05:30.940> of<00:05:31.200> 14<00:05:32.200> to<00:05:32.770> 12<00:05:33.070> on<00:05:33.430> the<00:05:33.610> D
