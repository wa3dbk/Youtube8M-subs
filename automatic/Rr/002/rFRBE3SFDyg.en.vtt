00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.210
 we are here with Andrea and Thomas the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.130
 at the vegan ultra marathon season 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.780
 have participated from Lake Constance to 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.210
 the czech border is nearing you 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.619
 both it's vegan then be a problem 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.800
 to run ultra marathon 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.260
 ranking one on the contrary conducive sugar 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.990
 I actually vegan as a time 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.390
 I even more power more energy such 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.170
 make runs and ultra distances too 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.570
 deal with 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.529
 So I'm also still I say 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.420
 rohkost 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.149
 he could say yes is still 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.340
 harder but since I'm right 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.809
 Nutrition or vegan is the sporty one 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.030
 performance much better I have to 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.250
 train less for the same 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.600
 to achieve an agreement so I am too 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.059
 four weeks ago completely marathon 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.590
 It's actually in Hamburg 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.390
 only conducive and the greatest athlete 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.860
 all times actually carl lewis was 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.030
 his active time was nine 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.160
 won gold medals at olympia 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.789
 but also vegans know that 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.219
 fewest 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.780
 It promotes athletic performance 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.850
 as that somehow problems now 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.979
 if you are well balanced 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.290
 Of course you can not eat vegan 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.530
 eating fries with ketchup every day 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.180
 also vegan but not healthy as long 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.909
 the distances we had each run 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.890
 So each group is 50 kilometers 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.680
 So every single one of them went 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.950
 group our dome is then at the ends 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.110
 55 kilometer run because we the ways 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.970
 not so clearly found 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.970
 but the other groups of 50 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.659
 kilometers each around the clock so 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.090
 at night, too 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.430
 yes, we are at half past midnight , for example 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.460
 12 started until the other morning 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.650
 until the other tomorrow at just after 5 pm 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.270
 went around the clock how long are yours 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.579
 two groups each ran 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.450
 So we were about five and a half 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:51.140
 hours on the way exactly and yours unfortunately 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.150
 a bit longer than planned 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.300
 But he has just the circumstances to the 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.010
 A lot of people put their eyes to the situation 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.070
 kilometer directly on the highway 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.210
 run and the net was so pleasant 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.650
 which is all too 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.150
 that's just the challenge 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.490
 you have to orient yourself 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.929
 Nothing is closed off 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.050
 you have to be on the track 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.120
 constantly navigate with map and gps 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.230
 then we had to go on the road 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.080
 You can look for researchers from 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.270
 the highway the raging stop with 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.819
 Over 100 things past her we had 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.500
 with us in the cabin situation in 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.110
 kilometers 14 15 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.340
 as even this is sometimes to the left came to 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.209
 the left side ran on the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.550
 federal roads 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.790
 there were situations like that where 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.269
 people then stop right driver outdated 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.010
 to have 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.660
 you usually think on the left side 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.000
 is safe to run and then stop 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.860
 to distance my car past her with 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.680
 over 100 things was rushed 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.660
 and that is of course a thing where 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.970
 you already a bit wearily and so 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.290
 continue to only 500 meters at all 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.780
 was the main road running from us 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.250
 the rest, fortunately, falls away and 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.250
 parallel street and what else do you have for 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.220
 other plans so your personal 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.299
 goals in terms of sports 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.910
 has something in front of it 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.110
 next time , of course, at all 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.870
 big events veganism 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.790
 propagate 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.489
 My goal is marathon again in autumn 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:21.320

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.640

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.650

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.410

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.269
 and just try that out, too 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.690
 to carry as far as possible to everyone 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.060

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.800

 Baiersbronn to Baden-Baden had that 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:06.190
 theme, the planning for June 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:08.200
 That's 65 kilometers of runs 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.420
 bit cozier to lattice bed than 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.390
 But things are slowly oriented 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.420
 Training on there goes on so what 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:21.340
 I'm currently planning other vegan ones 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:24.040

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.220
 because the birthday both add up 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.470
 years of birth gives a 65 kilometer 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.290
 so to speak, and they want that together 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.060
 and some of us are still there 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.570
 probably want to participate 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.880
 if you go in august also the 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.160

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.950
 there is a vegan mountain lodge there 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.720
 maybe some before some star 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.060
 but it's all in again 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.610
 planning will come back very very many 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:16.240
 Vegan athlete on a heap together 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.590

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.390
 Add still falls to something 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.060

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.410
 so do not want to tell something funny 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.900
 but i can only recommend it to everyone 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.060
 maybe watch it now if you guys 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.680
 Sport makes you try vegan if 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.620
 It has not been encouraging for everyone yet 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.790
 fall the power and make fun and 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.510
 definitely helps the animals of the 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:39.669
 Environment and the people are for the 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.919
 ultra season here what interests 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:45.490
 went off and so on comes on the 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.510
 page run against suffering punkt.de 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.910
 by marc hoffmann 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.560
 there is all the information there can 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.200
 you also read the whole photos 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.090
 see and so on and yes who knows 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.250
 Maybe it will be next year 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.230
 continue with similar pattern 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.940
 the market hopes you are good things 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.249
 definitely want something in the 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.469
 to carry on and 

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:06.449
 to simply send the message to the world 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:13.079
 to carry out that one also as 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:14.579
 vegan is a lax tail then 

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:16.079
 I think for your time and wishes 

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:17.639
 Have a nice day with you too 

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:20.569
