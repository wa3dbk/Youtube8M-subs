 the right floor for every room 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.169
 Actually, this question seems crystal clear 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.750
 to be tiles in hallway kitchen and bathroom 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.869
 parquet in the living room and carpet floor 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.009
 in the remaining rooms 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.710
 so simple it is then not 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.250
 Every flooring has its strengths and 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.140
 weaknesses 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.259
 We would like to give you more details 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.939
 we want to start explaining where 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.300
 the strain is greatest 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.789
 in the hallway and in the kitchen here everyone has to 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.770
 in and out the robustness of the 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.590
 Flooring is your top priority 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.969
 to one or the other maneuvers should 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.780
 they also be prepared 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:49.059
 What does the professional say traditionally 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.890
 you can use tiles in this area 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.629
 the trend is clearly in 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.719
 direction wood optics therefore ours 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.789
 recommendation laminate floor because of it 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.620
 particularly scratch-resistant and resistant 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:03.100
 and therefore the stresses of everyday life 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.869
 very well suited is that the 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.060
 laying by the so-called click 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.670
 technology is child's play and through the 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.970
 low construction height of the laminate floor 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.640
 ingenious government 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.409
 Conclusion laminate flooring a classic if it 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.409
 for longevity of soils 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.290
 now to the vineyard the living room is considered 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.890
 popular retreat in which it is located 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.720
 Everything should be cozy and warm 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.990
 The floor is therefore claimed 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.479
 and should look good even after years 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.549
 our recommendation finished parquet but 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.140
 Let's hear the professional for this 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.149
 area is finished parquet very too 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.220
 We recommend walking warm and very nice 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.020
 Of course, even with only a few 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.420
 millimeters around layer you can use this 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.840
 grind the floor several times and thereby 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.000
 This floor holds for decades as well 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.509
 here the simple technique is a big one 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.970
 Help with the assembly conclusion 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:05.099
 finished parquet when it comes to naturalness 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.349
 and living comfort now goes to the bathroom and 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:08.179
 thus the biggest challenge for 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:10.679
 a floor 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.330
 the constantly changing humidity 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.519
 in this area provides 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.470
 wood materials for a swelling and 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.620
 dwindle which in turn cracks and 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.910
 can lead to joints 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.099
 This can dampen all in all 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.970
 calm penetrate and the material of 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.410
 damaging inside what the professional advises 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.090
 The classic tiles are natural 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.049
 still the safest thing about your bug 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.989
 can use 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.090
 a warm and soft alternative 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.430
 Cork and multi-layer parquet, however 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.680
 only if you are on site professionally 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.219
 be relocated and in addition to 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.959
 to be sealed 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:47.180
 vinyl flooring is in the trend 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.879
 Full plastic in five millimeters thickness 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.299
 This is absolutely waterproof and therefore 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:56.420
 fully compatible with vinyl 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.609
 similar to cork made up of three layers 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.099
 the back we have 1 mm corp 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:04.519
 coating the middle layer consists of 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.769
 6 mm hdf plate and the top layer 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.469
 consists of a 2 mm start vinyl 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.840
 Coated vinyl floor is very much 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:13.970
 hygienic and does not darken in 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.819
 in terms of abrasion and scratch resistance 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.609
 even laminate floors are superior 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.599
 vinyl soil optimal for very strong 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.599
 claimed space 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.360
 now off to the bedroom in this 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.260
 area of â€‹â€‹the ground relatively little 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.630
 bear 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.140
 the requirements here are clear

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.260
 expert 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.030
 The good old carpet is above all else 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.680
 when succumbing can no longer first choice 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.600
 Tiles on the other hand are too cold and too hard 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.960
 in this case, we would clearly corp 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.330
 This is extremely football whisper quiet 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.480
 and pleasant by its elasticity 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.610
 joint-friendly cork floor is very 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.860
 hygienic as no mild infestation possible 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.260
