00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.580
 so welcome back and today it works 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.099
 around the topic of fat burning 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.320
 or what can I do about it 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.510
 a fat burning even faster 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.470
 to stimulate a better combustion 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.859
 to guarantee 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.250
 in the end even faster the fat too 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.830
 burn and in the end is whole 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.869
 quite simply there is only one super 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.660
 great trick or the best trick 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.059
 Anyway, I'll say how to be decent 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.250
 his body can push fat burning 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:44.340
 and quite simply through muscles so 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.149
 In the end, muscles are like fuel rods 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.399
 which can put you in the body of the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.219
 then almost burn the fat and that 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.860
 especially if we do not do anything yes 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.980
 to kadi or something else yes 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.570
 is at is with muscles so we 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.680
 Just sitting on the couch 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.390
 and then the body burns fat 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.860
 actually consumed energy before you 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.510
 We misunderstand locally, of course 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.000
 he becomes energy and energy naturally 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.500
 At some point falls out before so 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.100
 he really fat to think about it now 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.250
 burn 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.799
 who needs these fuel rods 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:25.680
 Musculature of course you first 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:27.330
 Construction is the advantage of course for 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.220
 the beginner who just starts to 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.990
 train or say exercises i am 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.299
 overweight wants to lose weight 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.220
 of course I have no muscles now 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.049
 no problem because he needs beginners 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.869
 of course, at the same time musculature 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.100
 at the same time burn the fat 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.020
 and the advanced one 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.490
 I'll say it to someone like that 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.020
 advanced that means trained 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.060
 already longer and brighter should one already 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.619
 have constantly built muscles so 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.159
 There is no need to worry about it 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.189
 do 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.350
 So you have to be there already if so ever 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.689
 more muscles you have so much the better 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.219
 your fat burning come the better 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.780
 of course, then the muscles out now so 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.969
 The better you look the less 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.119
 Body fat yes that also applies to 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.190
 women not that someone would say 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.810
 I will also make my videos for women 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.640
 technically oriented yes 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.050
 of course also for women 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.610
 then I do not need to be afraid 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.200
 Of course , yes, it was not like that 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.940
 any masculine, otherwise, anyway 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.209
 could act so women can anyway 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.530
 do not muscles in the same dimension 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.150
 Build up as men do 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.390
 So do not worry about it 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.130
 no horror from the weights so 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.959
 muscle muscles had many muscles 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.480
 Muscle means good fat burning 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.739
 fast fat burning perfect 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.900
 result and do not forget less 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.200
 Addendum muscles are important for the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.030
 jojo effect yes because the more muscles I have 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.250
 have more or less muscles left in the end 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.410
 remained 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.660
 the more I can eat again and all the more 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.900
 less which will increase again in the end 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.850
 So muscle is important because without 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.959
 muscles there is a jojo effect because 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.790
 I have to stop sometime with the 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.260
 daily dieting and dieting a little 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.820
 eat no food 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.370
 sometime the whole again 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.239
 normalize it makes no sense max 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.769
 normalizing 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.300
 and then back to the exit cindy 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.150
 initial situation will come back or 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.120
 I even have five kilos more on it 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.660
 The whole thing has no sense 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.660
 made 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.519
 so if you have a decent good one 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.140
 fat burning then want to forget 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.329
 not that very important 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.959
 Muscles are needed and muscles are needed 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:34.980
 always weight training yes heavy 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.570
 training has to be done to the body 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.610
 challenge irritate and then not with 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.130
 any funny jumping jack 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.299
 Exercises or mehdi give it a go 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.519
 both for you and for women, so 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.660
 That's it , that's it from here until now 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.660
 to the next
