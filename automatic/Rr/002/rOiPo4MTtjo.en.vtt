00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.420
 and now it's time to talk about another type 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.100
 Peruvian sporting crystal that started its 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.189
 participation in the cup seen in 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.500
 liberators with a defeat that could 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:36.160
 see a tie does not exist is a 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.690
 victory but finally 2 to 1 was the 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.730
 final result before this team of 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.940
 palmeiras that many said is a team 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.060
 second division 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.460
 palmeiras that is to say a Brazilian team 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.590
 it is known that it will complicate your life 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.970
 energy starts and is complicated but 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.010
 however crystal also knew 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.440
 complicate the life of make now yo 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.140
 I think the crystals but maybe 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.110
 many not the operation team was 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.360
 over and in a defensive error of a 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.330
 I run in a stop ball of one not 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.509
 can leave the clubs costs a lot 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.560
 crystal see ball stop came from behind 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.119
 at the end and it was 1 to 0 then 1 to 0 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.150
 that is already had to leave already had to 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.070
 leave a little bit is that displacement 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.720
 a little bit of speculation that there was 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.400
 come on it was not because of necessary 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.470
 they could propose eyes that the defense 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:33.340
 It was also teetering a little bit 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:35.970
 he did penning figure is not and is not 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.970
 on the other hand in this case has 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.970
 finished 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.549
 then there I have a lot of chamba 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.510
 and had diego trap gear allows 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.180
 it also becomes one of the 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.890
 glass team figures for the 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.570
 second time because we were the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.810
 pieces take them out che tour that had them 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.860
 a happy night review perform then to 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.990
 horacio calcaterra that had some 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.240
 sparks and there just that you achieve the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.270
 tie after a penalty but look for it 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.030
 he voted and makes him 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:12.540
 renal lobatÃ³n does not forgive if you do another 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:15.989
 fire pretty good and see if it enters 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.370
 when patrick will see the second one 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.840
 pelotera and what kind of plays in the 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.620
 area that you never know what you can 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.750
 finish a little bit the brand gets complicated 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.220
 and more if it's a Brazilian team for more 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.080
 They wanted this second edition of the 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.430
 complicated do not forgive you are playing in 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.420
 our street until when with a 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.069
 stadium completely full 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.590
 impressive the amount of people that 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.540
 there was now brook an occasion that could 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.819
 see what operated on me that magnitude this 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.430
 hobby the savior fingers forward 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.319
 of the palmeiras suddenly prevented 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.150
 is that the draw will come but crystal 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.840
 he also had some chances out there 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.970
 they managed to fly 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.680
 advanced all of us in this one that does not 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.690
 played badly he is strong in crystals and 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.340
 bringing him bad either raises the 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.019
 match to palmeiras but could have 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.299
 had the achievements had a 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.519
 the best result no doubt comes the 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.959
 return match being 28 the good the 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.790
 return match but the match against 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.790
 tiger here in Lima on February 28
