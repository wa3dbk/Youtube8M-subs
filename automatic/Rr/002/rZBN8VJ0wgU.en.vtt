00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.280
 This fish eye lens this time 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.310
 this 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.180
 I removed it and stopped with a screw 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:18.430
 And I can say I can be my sister before this presentation Oita 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:24.250
 If you remove the 0.5x zoom lens with the lens for bird's eye iphone 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:28.780
 A lens that can also be used as a macro lens if used alone 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:32.419
 I wonder if what or attached to this 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:36.620
 But I know this I Well then Do is I'm different Nen'n 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:41.120
 Even if the macro lens is removed and only the wide lens is oriented 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:45.840
 The page doesn't fit, but I wonder if this can't be used somehow 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:49.800
 But this magnet ring originally we were unlucky this 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:55.230
 I I This lens is Atsuko Nante magnet 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:59.820
 This in I'm a type of lens that say can arrive in this way and snap here 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:05.309
 Put a sticker on the bottom part like this 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:10.350
 Followed by over there of if put if successful fish-eye lens is to the give us the children of purchase 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.500
 If you have a wide macro lens, use a magnet attached to this 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.090
 I wonder if it's 8 tsutsukun 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.840
 This Naa good Once you think you No successful would like to experiment with this today 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.560
 It entered a Kara' 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.159
 I was able to glue in the middle 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.670
 Here in the four macro lens 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.670

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:37.890
 It was done 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:43.350
 Oh I'd say I bought it country years is a do this 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:46.320
 I just put a cat's ring magnet ring on the iphone so that the back is not scratched 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.700
 I put a protective sheet on it 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.080
 It is good to put a patch after attaching a magnet link, but when removing it 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.220
 It is also protective sheet 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.210
 It's because it's peeled off 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.590
 I have not used it all the time but this clip 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.590
 By using this 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:10.399
 It Tare will be such that the lens can be used shears 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.510
 With screws doing fish-eye lens do this once you even put the clip in Well this say form 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.330
 It is fastened 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.600
 This wide macro lens is 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.750
 I 'm sticking in the magnet with one touch 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.970
 By the way, a wide lens of 0.5 times 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.620
 with this 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.670
 There Toka This 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:35.280
 This is the video mode of an ordinary camera app 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:38.090
 You spread far about the price I'd effect becomes angle narrow in video mode 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.090
 When I took the 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.130
 That's right 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.640

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.620

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.400

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.130

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.250
 It changes about new 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:03:00.910
 Of course I wanted to use the lens all the time 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:06.030
