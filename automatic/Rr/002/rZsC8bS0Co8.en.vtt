of the the mats and the waist legs will

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.380 
of the the mats and the waist legs will
clip<00:02:10.130> on<00:02:10.310> this<00:02:10.459> I<00:02:10.610> can<00:02:10.759> actually<00:02:10.819> clip<00:02:11.239> them

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
clip on this I can actually clip them

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.420 
clip on this I can actually clip them
all<00:02:11.540> together<00:02:11.720> so<00:02:12.080> it's<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.260> very<00:02:12.560> very<00:02:12.830> unique

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
all together so it's a very very unique

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.390 
all together so it's a very very unique
way<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:14.060> carrying<00:02:14.390> your<00:02:14.569> kit<00:02:15.100> this<00:02:16.100> is<00:02:16.220> one<00:02:16.370> I

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
way of carrying your kit this is one I

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.729 
way of carrying your kit this is one I
particularly<00:02:16.850> like<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:17.480> then<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.530> Box

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
particularly like and then the Box

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.910 
particularly like and then the Box
standard<00:02:19.190> form<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:20.750> is<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:20.989> rod<00:02:21.260> sling<00:02:21.650> so

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
standard form this is the rod sling so

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.050 
standard form this is the rod sling so
you<00:02:21.980> get<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.489> rod<00:02:22.819> tip<00:02:23.090> protector<00:02:23.770> elasticated

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
you get a rod tip protector elasticated

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.420 
you get a rod tip protector elasticated
real<00:02:26.060> protector<00:02:26.720> there<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.290> obviously<00:02:27.800> your

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
real protector there and obviously your

real protector there and obviously your
book<00:02:28.610> protector<00:02:29.269> which<00:02:29.450> all<00:02:29.660> straps<00:02:30.019> together

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
book protector which all straps together

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.100

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
with the arrow strap and that retails at

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.140 
with the arrow strap and that retails at
seventeen<00:02:33.769> quid<00:02:34.130> sixteen<00:02:34.580> ninety<00:02:34.880> nine<00:02:35.000> which

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
seventeen quid sixteen ninety nine which

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.270 
seventeen quid sixteen ninety nine which
is<00:02:35.180> incredible<00:02:35.900> value<00:02:35.930> for<00:02:36.230> money<00:02:36.500> but<00:02:37.220> I

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
is incredible value for money but I

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.470 
is incredible value for money but I
think<00:02:37.340> you'll<00:02:37.640> agree<00:02:37.760> there's<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:38.360> many

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
think you'll agree there's so many

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.270 
think you'll agree there's so many
innovations<00:02:39.170> in<00:02:39.350> this<00:02:39.530> range<00:02:39.830> in<00:02:40.160> the

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
innovations in this range in the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.550 
innovations in this range in the
organized<00:02:40.610> compact<00:02:41.090> design<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:42.110> products

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
organized compact design the products

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.530 
organized compact design the products
richard<00:02:43.040> griffiths<00:02:43.220> our<00:02:43.610> own<00:02:43.760> demons<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.420> a

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
richard griffiths our own demons and a

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.870 
richard griffiths our own demons and a
sterling<00:02:45.019> job<00:02:45.049> and<00:02:45.500> it's<00:02:46.130> created<00:02:46.549> a<00:02:46.640> lot<00:02:46.850> of

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
sterling job and it's created a lot of

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.300 
sterling job and it's created a lot of
interest<00:02:47.390> in<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.690> trade<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.620> at<00:02:48.769> consumer

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
interest in the trade and at consumer

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.650 
interest in the trade and at consumer
level<00:02:49.610> so<00:02:49.819> I<00:02:49.850> think<00:02:49.940> this<00:02:50.150> is<00:02:50.299> going<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.510> be<00:02:50.630> a

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
level so I think this is going to be a

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.620 
level so I think this is going to be a
hot<00:02:50.840> ticket<00:02:51.080> for<00:02:51.830> 2012<00:02:52.400> 2013<00:02:52.580> it's<00:02:53.360> already

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
hot ticket for 2012 2013 it's already

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.890 
hot ticket for 2012 2013 it's already

encouraging<00:02:56.989> that<00:02:57.440> we're<00:02:57.590> going<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.739> do

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
encouraging that we're going to do

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.160 
encouraging that we're going to do
really<00:02:58.130> well<00:02:58.370> but<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:58.970> colors<00:02:59.150> right<00:02:59.570> the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
really well but the colors right the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.710 
really well but the colors right the
ideas<00:03:00.620> right<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:02.120> fact<00:03:02.360> that<00:03:02.420> you<00:03:02.570> can

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
ideas right the fact that you can

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.360 
ideas right the fact that you can
actually<00:03:02.870> build<00:03:03.470> this<00:03:03.590> up<00:03:03.769> as<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:03.980> modular

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
actually build this up as a modular

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.800 
actually build this up as a modular
system<00:03:04.549> means<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:04.970> don't<00:03:05.150> have<00:03:05.299> to<00:03:05.480> invest

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
system means you don't have to invest

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.330 
system means you don't have to invest
heavily<00:03:05.959> initially<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.709> can<00:03:06.799> just<00:03:07.010> add<00:03:07.160> on

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
heavily initially you can just add on

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.400 
heavily initially you can just add on
little<00:03:08.150> by<00:03:08.269> little<00:03:08.570> and<00:03:08.750> that's<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.079> best<00:03:09.260> way

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
little by little and that's the best way

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.489 
little by little and that's the best way
to<00:03:09.440> do<00:03:09.680> things<00:03:09.890> or<00:03:10.040> in<00:03:10.100> transit
