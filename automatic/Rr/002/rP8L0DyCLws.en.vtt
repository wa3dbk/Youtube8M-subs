the<00:00:07.980> classic<00:00:08.700> definition<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.420> Epidemiology

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
the classic definition of Epidemiology

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.070 
the classic definition of Epidemiology
is<00:00:10.620> that<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.820> study<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.420> the

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
is that it is the study of the

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.680 
is that it is the study of the
distribution<00:00:13.230> as<00:00:14.040> well<00:00:14.730> as<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.059> determinants

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
distribution as well as the determinants

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.960 
distribution as well as the determinants
of<00:00:15.900> health<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:17.100> health<00:00:17.220> outcomes<00:00:17.730> in

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
of health and health outcomes in

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.630 
of health and health outcomes in
populations<00:00:18.680> some<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.859> key<00:00:20.100> elements

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
populations some of the key elements

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.330 
populations some of the key elements
that<00:00:20.699> are<00:00:21.210> really<00:00:21.480> critical<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:22.500> epidemiology

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
that are really critical to epidemiology

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.330 
that are really critical to epidemiology
are<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:24.210> focuses<00:00:24.750> on<00:00:24.930> populations<00:00:25.830> so

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
are that it focuses on populations so

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.120 
are that it focuses on populations so
we're<00:00:27.090> not<00:00:27.210> only<00:00:27.359> interested<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.109> why<00:00:28.320> certain

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
we're not only interested in why certain

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.659 
we're not only interested in why certain
individuals<00:00:29.960> have<00:00:30.960> an<00:00:31.349> extremely<00:00:32.070> high<00:00:32.189> risk

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
individuals have an extremely high risk

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.450 
individuals have an extremely high risk
of<00:00:32.850> disease<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:33.690> also<00:00:33.860> why<00:00:34.860> certain

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
of disease but also why certain

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.869 
of disease but also why certain
populations<00:00:36.239> have<00:00:36.690> more<00:00:37.500> disease<00:00:38.010> or<00:00:38.370> poor

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
populations have more disease or poor

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.330 
populations have more disease or poor
health<00:00:38.910> than<00:00:39.570> other<00:00:39.719> populations<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.739> second

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
health than other populations a second

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.770 
health than other populations a second
component<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.940> important<00:00:42.629> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
component that is important to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.889 
component that is important to
epidemiology<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.950> it's<00:00:44.100> very<00:00:44.309> tied<00:00:44.579> to

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
epidemiology is that it's very tied to

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.799 
epidemiology is that it's very tied to
public<00:00:45.899> health<00:00:46.110> practice<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.160> action<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.600> we

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
public health practice and action so we

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.930 
public health practice and action so we
use<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.289> results<00:00:49.680> from<00:00:49.800> epidemiology<00:00:50.700> to

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
use the results from epidemiology to

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.959 
use the results from epidemiology to
translate<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.660> into<00:00:52.610> interventions<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
translate that into interventions and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.700 
translate that into interventions and
these<00:00:54.120> could<00:00:54.390> be<00:00:54.510> interventions<00:00:55.140> at<00:00:55.410> an

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
these could be interventions at an

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.160 
these could be interventions at an
individual<00:00:56.550> level<00:00:56.760> or<00:00:57.090> more<00:00:57.690> broadly<00:00:57.899> to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
individual level or more broadly to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.380 
individual level or more broadly to
policies<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.340> are<00:00:59.489> really<00:00:59.850> aimed<00:01:00.059> at

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
policies that are really aimed at

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.150 
policies that are really aimed at
improving<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.109> public's<00:01:01.500> health<00:01:01.710> well<00:01:02.129> I

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
improving the public's health well I

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.299 
improving the public's health well I
think<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:03.260> epidemiologists<00:01:04.260> as<00:01:04.470> people<00:01:04.979> who

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
think of epidemiologists as people who

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.230 
think of epidemiologists as people who
are<00:01:05.760> seeking<00:01:06.510> answers<00:01:07.020> who<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:08.790> to

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
are seeking answers who really like to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.050 
are seeking answers who really like to
try<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> understand<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:11.010> details<00:01:11.490> behind

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
try to understand the details behind

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.050 
try to understand the details behind
what<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.990> happening<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.979> takes<00:01:14.369> sort<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.820> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
what is happening and it takes sort of a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.870 
what is happening and it takes sort of a
keen<00:01:15.479> observer<00:01:15.720> one<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.979> reasons<00:01:17.700> why<00:01:17.850> our

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
keen observer one of the reasons why our

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.390 
keen observer one of the reasons why our
Department<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.689> Epidemiology<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.619> unique<00:01:20.070> is

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
Department of Epidemiology is unique is

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.630 
Department of Epidemiology is unique is
that<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.780> very<00:01:22.020> diverse<00:01:22.470> faculty<00:01:23.009> and

that we have a very diverse faculty and
the<00:01:23.820> faculty<00:01:23.850> are<00:01:24.360> working<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.439> large

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the faculty are working on a large

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.149 
the faculty are working on a large
variety<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.840> topics<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:28.200> areas<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:28.890> are

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
variety of topics in areas that are

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.490 
variety of topics in areas that are
important<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.640> public<00:01:30.030> health<00:01:30.180> for<00:01:31.079> example

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
important to public health for example

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.410 
important to public health for example
we<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.770> faculty<00:01:32.070> who<00:01:32.340> work<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
we have faculty who work on the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.810 
we have faculty who work on the
application<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:34.350> laboratory<00:01:34.920> methods<00:01:35.340> to

population<00:01:36.630> health<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.710> faculty<00:01:37.920> who

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
population health we have faculty who

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.719 
population health we have faculty who
work<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.540> genetics<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.259> disease<00:01:40.619> we<00:01:41.610> also

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
work on the genetics of disease we also

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.929 
work on the genetics of disease we also
have<00:01:42.030> faculty<00:01:42.270> who<00:01:42.570> focus<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.939> international

and finally we have faculty working on a

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.170 
and finally we have faculty working on a
number<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.680> chronic<00:01:50.100> diseases<00:01:50.460> because<00:01:51.030> we

number of chronic diseases because we

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.260 
number of chronic diseases because we
have<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.990> many<00:01:52.259> active<00:01:53.220> research<00:01:53.610> projects

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
going on there are many opportunities

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.240 
going on there are many opportunities
for<00:01:56.759> students<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.659> get<00:01:57.810> engaged<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:59.009> work

research process the University and the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.370 
research process the University and the
school<00:02:08.910> both<00:02:09.239> have<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> very

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
school both have a very

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.490 
school both have a very
rich<00:02:11.010> history<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:12.030> focusing<00:02:12.990> on<00:02:13.170> very

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
rich history of focusing on very

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.800 
rich history of focusing on very
important<00:02:14.040> public<00:02:14.430> health<00:02:14.670> topics<00:02:15.060> for

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
important public health topics for

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.170 
important public health topics for
example<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.770> polio<00:02:17.160> vaccine<00:02:17.490> was<00:02:17.850> developed

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
example the polio vaccine was developed

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.810 
example the polio vaccine was developed
and<00:02:19.110> tested<00:02:19.470> here<00:02:20.280> within<00:02:20.520> our<00:02:20.790> own

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
and tested here within our own
