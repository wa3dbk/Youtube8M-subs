back<00:02:07.810> I<00:02:08.200> actually<00:02:08.770> pushed<00:02:09.190> it<00:02:09.340> in<00:02:09.490> in<00:02:09.610> the

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
back I actually pushed it in in the

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.030 
back I actually pushed it in in the
middle<00:02:10.030> there<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:10.869> just<00:02:11.230> popped<00:02:11.470> it<00:02:11.650> backward

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040
