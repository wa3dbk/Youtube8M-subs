00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
recently I've had a foot with my boxers

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.160 
recently I've had a foot with my boxers
of<00:00:04.680> Hira<00:00:05.270> 21.6<00:00:06.270> on<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.450> 52<00:00:06.990> plate<00:00:07.580> and<00:00:09.170> basically

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
of Hira 21.6 on a 52 plate and basically

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.240 
of Hira 21.6 on a 52 plate and basically
I<00:00:11.750> got<00:00:12.750> told<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.170> other<00:00:13.320> day<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.500> my<00:00:14.040> brake

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
I got told the other day that my brake

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.070 
I got told the other day that my brake
lights<00:00:14.490> were<00:00:14.700> on<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:15.540> course<00:00:15.599> when<00:00:15.990> you're

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
lights were on of course when you're

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.300 
lights were on of course when you're
driving<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.440> vehicle<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.859> don't<00:00:17.010> actually

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
driving a vehicle you don't actually

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.269 
driving a vehicle you don't actually
know<00:00:18.289> obviously<00:00:19.289> until<00:00:19.560> nighttime<00:00:19.800> when<00:00:20.250> you

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
know obviously until nighttime when you

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.950 
know obviously until nighttime when you
can<00:00:20.460> see<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.670> reflecting<00:00:21.119> off<00:00:21.270> signs<00:00:21.600> and

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
can see it reflecting off signs and

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.570 
can see it reflecting off signs and
obviously<00:00:22.320> when<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.830> know<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.220> can<00:00:23.460> really

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
obviously when you know you can really

I've<00:00:27.660> got<00:00:27.840> towed<00:00:28.019> my<00:00:28.140> brake<00:00:28.349> lights<00:00:28.380> were<00:00:28.800> on

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
I've got towed my brake lights were on

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.519 
I've got towed my brake lights were on
and<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.670> obviously<00:00:30.359> I'm<00:00:30.660> not<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> mechanic<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.500> I

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
and I obviously I'm not a mechanic so I

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.299 
and I obviously I'm not a mechanic so I
don't<00:00:31.830> know<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.610> ins<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.910> outs<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.420> all<00:00:34.309> so

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
don't know the ins and outs of it all so

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.650 
don't know the ins and outs of it all so
I<00:00:35.340> asked<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> lot<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.910> my<00:00:35.969> friends<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.540> they

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
I asked a lot of my friends and they

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.180 
I asked a lot of my friends and they
said<00:00:36.899> well<00:00:37.079> actually<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.680> could<00:00:37.829> be<00:00:37.890> one<00:00:38.100> of

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
said well actually it could be one of

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.619 
said well actually it could be one of
these<00:00:38.280> which<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.660> brake<00:00:40.530> light<00:00:40.680> sensor<00:00:41.629> and

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
these which is a brake light sensor and

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.889 
these which is a brake light sensor and
it's<00:00:43.350> an<00:00:43.440> easy<00:00:43.590> fix<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.190> quite<00:00:44.520> cheap<00:00:44.899> 20

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
it's an easy fix it's quite cheap 20

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.000 
it's an easy fix it's quite cheap 20
pound<00:00:46.140> from<00:00:46.350> GM<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.070> part<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:49.010> basically

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
pound from GM is that part and basically

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.229 
pound from GM is that part and basically
I<00:00:50.760> changed<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:52.219> but<00:00:53.219> while<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.430> was<00:00:53.579> changing<00:00:53.850> it

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
I changed it but while I was changing it

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.860 
I changed it but while I was changing it
I<00:00:54.989> noticed<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.280> part<00:00:56.640> which<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
I noticed that this part which is the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.279 
I noticed that this part which is the
new<00:00:58.079> part<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.590> my<00:00:59.190> old<00:00:59.489> part<00:01:00.020> looked<00:01:01.020> slightly

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
new part and my old part looked slightly

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.440 
new part and my old part looked slightly
different<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.780> basically<00:01:04.080> what<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.350> did<00:01:04.409> was

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
different so basically what I did was

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.260 
different so basically what I did was
I'll<00:01:06.450> show<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.890> old<00:01:08.220> part<00:01:08.580> looked

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
I'll show you that the old part looked

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.990 
I'll show you that the old part looked
like<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.689> with<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.619> short<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.820> was<00:01:11.939> short

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
like this with a short it was short

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.260 
like this with a short it was short
coming<00:01:12.600> out<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:14.250> obviously<00:01:14.580> been<00:01:14.729> pushed<00:01:15.060> in

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
coming out it obviously been pushed in

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.950 
coming out it obviously been pushed in
somehow<00:01:15.650> so<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:17.400> figured<00:01:18.000> I'd<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.509> know<00:01:18.630> try

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
somehow so I figured I'd you know try

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.270 
somehow so I figured I'd you know try
and<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.259> poor<00:01:19.470> I've<00:01:19.619> got<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> new<00:01:20.009> one<00:01:20.189> anyway

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
and do it poor I've got a new one anyway

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.850 
and do it poor I've got a new one anyway
so<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.729> pulled<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.180> out<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.600> then<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.439> pushed<00:01:22.710> it

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
so I pulled it out and then I pushed it

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.660 
so I pulled it out and then I pushed it
back<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.220> again<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.729> still<00:01:23.939> works<00:01:24.240> so

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
back in again and it still works so

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.460 
back in again and it still works so
basically<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:27.030> plugged<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.659> back<00:01:27.689> into<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> car

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
basically I plugged it back into the car

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.039 
basically I plugged it back into the car
and<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.490> brake<00:01:29.700> lights<00:01:29.939> weren't<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
and the brake lights weren't on and

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.020 
and the brake lights weren't on and
obviously<00:01:31.650> when<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.220> know<00:01:32.250> depress<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
obviously when you you know depress the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.740 
obviously when you you know depress the
brake<00:01:33.869> pedal<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:35.640> brake<00:01:35.850> lights<00:01:36.000> come<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.450> so

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
brake pedal the brake lights come on so

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.640 
brake pedal the brake lights come on so
it<00:01:36.840> was<00:01:36.960> working<00:01:37.350> fine<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:39.360> my<00:01:40.140> assumption

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
it was working fine so my assumption

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.520 
it was working fine so my assumption
with<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.390> is<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:43.850> it's<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.509> method<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
with this is that it's a method of the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.249 
with this is that it's a method of the
police<00:01:46.860> knowing<00:01:47.659> whether<00:01:48.659> you've<00:01:48.930> braked

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
police knowing whether you've braked

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.620 
police knowing whether you've braked
very<00:01:49.530> hard<00:01:49.829> into<00:01:50.399> an<00:01:50.490> accident<00:01:50.970> or<00:01:51.090> not<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.570> you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
very hard into an accident or not so you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.080 
very hard into an accident or not so you
knew<00:01:51.810> brake<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.950> your<00:01:53.280> normally<00:01:53.610> braking

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
knew brake this is your normally braking

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.330 
knew brake this is your normally braking
obviously<00:01:54.810> if<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> light<00:01:55.740> braking

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
obviously if you like a light braking

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.670 
obviously if you like a light braking
that's<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.850> heavy<00:01:57.060> brake<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:58.110> when<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.350> slam

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
that's a heavy brake but when you slam

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.179 
that's a heavy brake but when you slam
on<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.100> brakes<00:02:00.560> generally<00:02:01.560> due<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.070> an

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
on the brakes generally due to an

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.289 
on the brakes generally due to an
accident<00:02:03.259> this<00:02:04.259> tends<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.680> break<00:02:05.299> sometimes

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
accident this tends to break sometimes

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.729 
accident this tends to break sometimes
the<00:02:06.570> unit<00:02:07.439> can<00:02:07.560> go<00:02:07.710> 40<00:02:07.979> anyway<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.849> hear<00:02:09.739> but

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
the unit can go 40 anyway so I hear but

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.850 
the unit can go 40 anyway so I hear but
this<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.520> you

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
this this you

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.780 
this this you
it<00:02:12.040> itself<00:02:13.320> is<00:02:14.320> 20<00:02:14.680> pound<00:02:14.920> from<00:02:15.160> voxel<00:02:15.670> and
