00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hi there is a small review of the legs 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.580
 the antenna which is generally so copy copy 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.570
 bitches distant she still 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:16.699
 Forester's bone pop twix 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:21.230
 one-handed with a clip 6 interesting 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:29.380
 opens this miracle is very so tense 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:32.730
 Well, let's see what spirit shock what 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.730
 we are here opener 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:46.020
 so you had to drag here 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.990
 we are such 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.750
 can opener garbage dynamo tana so often 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:57.030
 flows in size seems to be blocked 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:10.040
 have a deslow on the frame on we have this 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:10.040
 and then here to the position then the knife itself 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.800
 so everything is also so relatively different 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.430
 saw on wood 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:38.320
 taco bella was not completely sharpened 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:42.300
 In principle, there were such teeth on her 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:48.010
 Well, there is the usual coal file 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:53.620
 Paska easy it is sharpened like this 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:58.860
 here here here by the way for a long time not as 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:02.550
 But on liners Rex'll show you in 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:07.200
 they are not so narrow to return well 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:10.530
 short she's such a proverb 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.530
 such a lock 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:30.800
 taught spanish to open it like this 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:38.090
 here it closes here this part here 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:40.810
 so inconvenient to pick up that time the same 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:46.120
 what is less 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.120
 how to talk there in thickness 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.549
 wrong bear compare so here 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:08.120
 you do not sharpened chips open 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.120
 difficult really had to drag him hanging 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.500
 such a thing 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.849
 our clip is soft enough 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.090
 let's say something on the only clip 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:23.459
 who did not want to immediately twist here 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.290
 that is, she is almost a nominee but 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.989
 same time she say so not much this 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.879
 helps 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.090
 let's try to show it here we have a shock 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:39.049
 There is such that principle should was 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:41.819
 would cling leave it created falls 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:45.840
 now if so a bit thicker to do 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:48.209
 a few here are basically the same 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.810
 only on and not at all clinging and blind as 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.700
 these facts keep the cult backpack still 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.160
 well I turned over 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.250
 the place is just a skill from there well so its 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.849
 Rather, all lose such bolts she 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.889
 attached not attached to the pad ok here 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.549
 this liner here but from the joke is that 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:13.169
 if just tighten that there inside they 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:19.530
 begin vylazit operations then elevators here 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:21.720
 such you have a little body like here 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.930
 So 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.930
 but so too are looking for there 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.080
 Here you have fallen asleep to say about such forces 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:38.319
 no one chamfering them 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:42.819
 I had to go all the sandpaper here because 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:44.620
 how is it all not bad cut fingers 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:51.849
 principle you can see how it all 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:53.830
 made cool very tasty but all 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:58.630
 is equal to this one 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:02.050
 clings here too in this part 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:06.009
 drying acute was clinging here they planted 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.759
 quality of the very example wing slime 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:14.110
 and never push it like this 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:20.949
 us gap nehily rises on the trail 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:24.430
 for example on the original push on us 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:26.280
 not for a star here but still such a nose 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.289
 same strength 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.169
 then we see that he seems to click no such 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:36.240
 terrible watch that is, it is a little bit 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.240
 there is a little not so what here 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:47.650
 let 's say the principle of such healthy 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:50.070
 jambs no well, too, so a little bit 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.860
 slightly available 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:58.330
 that's planning this one that's blocking 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:03.070
 nulled all drake throw if you take 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:05.530
 what is our high and here that is 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:13.810
 folding it like I 'm uncomfortable with it 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:19.660
 fold say to die last hatch on 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:22.480
 knife, in principle, not the worst sharpening 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.600
 more or less keeps her so slightly in 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.880
 lens so sleep 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:31.780
 principle not bad not the worst option 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:38.650
 no we have toothpicks here with these myself 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:41.220
 And from pintsetikom there is no But so here is such 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.220
 that's the thing 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.020
 you are all that wanted everything showed everyone 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.020
 until
