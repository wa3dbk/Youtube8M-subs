00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
them the glass really really flexible so

them the glass really really flexible so
it<00:01:29.200> doesn't<00:01:29.470> it<00:01:29.590> doesn't<00:01:29.619> shatter<00:01:30.130> like<00:01:30.490> you

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
it doesn't it doesn't shatter like you

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.850 
it doesn't it doesn't shatter like you
know<00:01:30.790> traditional<00:01:31.479> glass<00:01:31.720> like<00:01:31.990> a<00:01:32.020> window<00:01:32.830> of

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
know traditional glass like a window of

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.560 
know traditional glass like a window of
a<00:01:33.040> house<00:01:33.250> or<00:01:33.550> something<00:01:33.580> like<00:01:33.909> that<00:01:33.970> they

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
a house or something like that they

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.029 
a house or something like that they
actually<00:01:34.720> run<00:01:35.050> your<00:01:35.200> finger<00:01:35.530> over<00:01:35.560> this<00:01:35.860> and

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
actually run your finger over this and

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.430 
actually run your finger over this and
it's<00:01:36.190> not<00:01:36.399> that<00:01:36.880> course<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.780> smaller<00:01:38.110> like<00:01:38.289> to

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
it's not that course the smaller like to

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.190 
it's not that course the smaller like to
23<00:01:38.950> s<00:01:39.009> or<00:01:39.160> these<00:01:39.280> 4.6<00:01:40.030> are<00:01:40.240> really<00:01:40.780> really<00:01:41.020> high

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
23 s or these 4.6 are really really high

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.080 
23 s or these 4.6 are really really high
velocity<00:01:41.740> so<00:01:41.860> they're<00:01:41.979> like<00:01:42.160> truck<00:01:42.520> in<00:01:42.700> it<00:01:42.820> at

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
velocity so they're like truck in it at

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.120 
velocity so they're like truck in it at
the<00:01:43.570> at<00:01:44.050> the<00:01:44.110> target<00:01:44.560> I'm<00:01:44.680> always<00:01:44.830> impressed

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
the at the target I'm always impressed

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.919 
the at the target I'm always impressed
with<00:01:45.550> these<00:01:45.640> devices<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.360> how<00:01:46.450> they<00:01:46.600> hold<00:01:46.750> up

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
with these devices and how they hold up

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.630 
with these devices and how they hold up
to<00:01:47.140> these<00:01:47.259> rounds<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:48.280> higher<00:01:48.460> the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
to these rounds and the higher the

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.870 
to these rounds and the higher the
velocity<00:01:49.140> usually<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.259> less<00:01:50.880> visually

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
velocity usually the less visually

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.719 
velocity usually the less visually
appealing<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:53.380> destruction<00:01:53.679> is<00:01:54.130> if<00:01:54.550> there

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
appealing the destruction is if there

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.070 
appealing the destruction is if there
was<00:01:54.850> something<00:01:55.030> backing<00:01:55.539> it<00:01:55.660> more<00:01:55.840> than<00:01:55.990> these

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
was something backing it more than these

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.600 
was something backing it more than these
screws<00:01:56.350> here<00:01:56.530> there<00:01:56.679> might<00:01:56.770> be<00:01:56.830> more<00:01:57.130> visual

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
screws here there might be more visual

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.710 
screws here there might be more visual
damage<00:01:58.080> or<00:01:59.080> more<00:01:59.770> drastic<00:02:00.399> but<00:02:00.970> held<00:02:01.600> up

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
damage or more drastic but held up

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.100 
damage or more drastic but held up
really<00:02:01.869> nice<00:02:02.140> and<00:02:03.030> my<00:02:04.030> sim<00:02:04.240> card<00:02:04.270> still<00:02:04.750> intact

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
really nice and my sim card still intact

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.699 
really nice and my sim card still intact
so<00:02:05.380> it<00:02:05.950> keep<00:02:06.250> all<00:02:06.400> my<00:02:06.520> contacts<00:02:07.000> okay<00:02:07.990> thanks
