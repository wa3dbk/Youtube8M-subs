did a lot of research online and i came
it<00:01:12.420> came<00:01:12.600> down<00:01:12.840> basically<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.590> either<00:01:13.799> thee

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
it came down basically to either thee

Spencer Zelda replica or the the stl the
stl<00:01:22.080> Zelda<00:01:23.009> replica<00:01:23.460> they're<00:01:24.330> both<00:01:24.479> very

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
stl Zelda replica they're both very

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.050 
stl Zelda replica they're both very
similar<00:01:25.320> they're<00:01:25.590> both<00:01:25.740> blue<00:01:26.130> they<00:01:26.610> both<00:01:26.820> have

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
similar they're both blue they both have

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.170 
similar they're both blue they both have
a<00:01:27.090> triforce<00:01:28.020> here<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.009> they're<00:01:29.220> both<00:01:29.340> 12<00:01:29.909> volt

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
a triforce here and they're both 12 volt

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.230 
a triforce here and they're both 12 volt
sweet<00:01:30.479> potatoes<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.200> believe<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.310> alto<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
sweet potatoes I believe in the alto and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.160 
sweet potatoes I believe in the alto and
also<00:01:33.869> see<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:35.340> difference<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
also see the difference is that the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.499 
also see the difference is that the
Spencer<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.340> was<00:01:38.520> very<00:01:38.700> much<00:01:38.939> leaning<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.420> us

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
Spencer I was very much leaning to us

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.319 
Spencer I was very much leaning to us
because<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.840> think<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.200> got<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.909> either<00:01:41.909> got

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
because I think it got the either got

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.870 
because I think it got the either got
the<00:01:42.509> reward<00:01:42.720> for<00:01:43.310> nomination<00:01:44.310> or<00:01:44.490> something

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the reward for nomination or something

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.649 
the reward for nomination or something
for<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.420> ocarina<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.170> year<00:01:47.450> 2009<00:01:48.450> um

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
I ended up choosing the stl Zelda

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.390 
I ended up choosing the stl Zelda
replica<00:02:15.530> because<00:02:16.420> because<00:02:17.420> uh<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:18.349> know<00:02:18.980> stl

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
replica because because uh you know stl

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.309 
replica because because uh you know stl
really<00:02:19.819> puts<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.180> good<00:02:20.450> effort<00:02:20.660> forward<00:02:21.049> to

Heather put out as well as like Doc jazz
and<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.900> know<00:02:36.019> using<00:02:36.349> the<00:02:37.599> using<00:02:38.599> their

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
and you know using the using their

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.220 
and you know using the using their
Audrina's<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.400> videos<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:42.019> really

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
Audrina's in the videos so it really

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.930 
Audrina's in the videos so it really
gives<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.739> sense<00:02:42.980> that<00:02:43.099> you<00:02:43.400> know<00:02:43.489> well<00:02:43.670> these

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
gives a sense that you know well these

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.039 
gives a sense that you know well these
operators<00:02:44.359> are<00:02:44.510> out<00:02:44.599> there<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:44.870> they're

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
operators are out there and they're

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.099 
operators are out there and they're
