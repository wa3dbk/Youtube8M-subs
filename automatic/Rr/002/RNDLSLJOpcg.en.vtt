00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello, in this video I will show you how to apply the bling patches. 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.530
It is similar to previous mirror patches that you might have seen

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.900
But this time with small patterns in relief. 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.750
It is very easy to apply. 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.610
I hope that you will like it. So let’s have a look at the video. 	

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.500
Here are the cases of Bling patches. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.570
They contain 18 nails of different sizes. 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.740
First, choose the patch that will fit to your nail. 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.800
If the patch doesn't fit, use a bigger one. 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.780
Then simply cut the edges at both sides. 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:48.070
With the help of tweezers or your fingers, remove the patch cautiously since it is fragile. 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.070
Remove it slowly. 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.080
Then place it on your nail. Make sure your nail polish is dry before, it is very important. 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.430
Now remove the outer pieces with your fingers 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:07.540
Then file the edge of your nail with a nail buffer so as to glue the patch. 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.870
Do not your a big nail file, or else it will damage the design. 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.360
Here's the final result. 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.180
It is cool to touch. With some reliefs. 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.790
You can also apply the bling patch on a nail with no color. 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.160
It is less beautiful but if you don’t have much time, just apply the base coat and then the bling patch. 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.720
You need to apply it well all over your nail.  

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.910
It lasts for several days. I’ve kept it for five days without any problem. 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.280
I have not checked further than five days but it does last. 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.090
I will show you another patch now. 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.090
It's the one I prefer the most. It is very luminous and sorts out very well on rose color base. 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.970
As you see, you can remove it easily and re-apply it when the nail polish is dry. 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.640
The transparent plastic has some kind chemical reaction with the nail polish 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.710
It dissolves and this is why it glues itself so well. 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.050
Here's another idea. You are not compelled to place the whole patch on your nail. 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.330
You can cut it in V shape for make a V shape French manicure.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.770
You can cut in different shapes according to your choice. 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.630
We could have made a white or colored slantwise French manicure. 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.030
Here it is, you just have to apply it well in the center and it's over. 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.150
One last example: now I will cut a slice of the patch. 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.160
That I will apply on my nail. 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.460
I would like to advise you to apply a top coat on the patch slices to help them hold better. 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.000
However you apply the whole patch, it not necessary to use a top coat.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:41.730
To remove the patch, use tweezers like this but it takes rather much time. 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.060
As you can see, the nail polish remover is not much useful here. You need to scratch it before. 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.800
It takes much time to remove with tweezers. And it annoys me! 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.560
When you’ve removed almost all the residues, use a nail polish remover to remove the glue. 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.490
As you see, it has not caused any damage to my nail. It is very smooth. 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.230
It has nothing to do with stickers that could have damaged your nails if they were not correctly applied. 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.200
The quickest method according to me is the nail buffer. 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.190
All that you have to do, is to file the sticker. 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:25.090
Rub it until all the bubbles are gone. Then finally use a nail polish remover to remove the rest. 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.100
Once again, my nail is not damaged. Since I have only file the patch. 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.770
I hope that this video has pleased you, see you on next Friday!
