00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.340
 hello today we are going to learn how to make a 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.410
 homemade chewing gum machine that we're going to 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.540
 need a container of 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.629
 glass or plastic that is shaped like that 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.360
 rounded like a fish tank 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:20.220
 we will also need a pot that is 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.859
 of small size and the dishes that are 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.890
 they put under the ready ones also 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.570
 we will need red paint and 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.320
 plated the brush two plugs and 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.320
 glue 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:42.390
 we started painting with color paint 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.129
 red in the flowerpot surely we have 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.579
 than give it two layers because it's 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.180
 Plastic paint does not not grip 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.440
 same 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.440
 we painted everything 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.320
 we have already painted in the pot inside 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.240
 it is not necessary because you are not going to see 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.300
 we also have to paint one of the 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.330
 plugs and the plate also in the same 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.900
 color of which the flowerpot in this case the 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.940
 Red 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.360
 we paint it all the same 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.360
 musical 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.840
 the champion that we have left we are going to 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.840
 paint the metallic color 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.330
 maybe we'll have to give a 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.310
 Second layer 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.310
 we paint everything and let it dry 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.229
 when we have everything dry the last step 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:40.390
 take off the red cap will go on top of the 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:43.930
 plate the silver and here in the pot and 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.350
 you will lose it also put up we are going to 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.350
 stick it 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.070
 there was the glue can 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.580
 and we hit it like me 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.250
 once you've pasted everything and you're ready to 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.510
 fill it with our peppers if it has 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.370
