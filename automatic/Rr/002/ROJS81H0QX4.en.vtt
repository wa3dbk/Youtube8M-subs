00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.149
 good today I bring you a movie batman 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:07.549
 versus robin will be in quality 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:11.630
 bluray in 1080p 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:15.020
 with their respective 4 links ok that one 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.550
 it is the most used the most used server 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.550
 it will be mega s 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.070
 is that that server always erases 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.550
 the pages the truth that I do not understand 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.130
 why mega is doing this but the 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.829
 truth is doing mega blog 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.100
 I remember that you do not erase the movies 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:41.140
 so easily the truth but good that 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.140
 we are going to do it so 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.500
 in the movie me in the description of 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.310
 video I'll be leaving what 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.180
 would be 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.040
 well in detail the four links of 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.630
 each candidate that I will be uploading 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:03.490
 in two quality at 480 p and in 1080p with 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:06.540
 its 4 links ok if you do not fall mega can 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.980
 use the three servers that is 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.200
 very strange that they fall 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.070
 very strange the links will be 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.890
 shortened by atf light short ok and 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.090
 you can also go through my channel 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:26.289
 where are you going to find two more movies 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:29.770
 and 3/4 depends on how much you want to have 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.539
 record but well you know how to leave me in 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.000
 the comments that movies want 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.700
 that brought them was going to bring 50 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.770
 shadow and day but I do not know whether to bring him or not 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.370
 but good 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.820
 time will tell 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:48.270
 so nothing here is the movie batman 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.520
 versus robin the truth that is very 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.410
 they say it's very interesting and 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.520
 entertaining also according to the date of 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:04.100
 premiere premieres on 4 the 4 I say 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:08.119
 April 14 ok 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.649
 so you supposedly saw but that is 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.170
 we're going 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.980
 so they go up in the 4 links below 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.120
 in the description of the video 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.260
 in detail the quality and others ok well 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.260
 I'm listening 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.860
 So nothing 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.520
 nothing 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.390
 police not advertising not 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.390
 advertising 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.830
 it sounds national 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.830
 pretty good for the old man 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.080
 i 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.860
 [Music] 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.680
 and 7 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.450
 and 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.420
 and we leave the comments that movies 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.010
 they want me to bring them so nothing 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.010
 two goodbye
