00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
underneath the surface so we dug into

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.710 
underneath the surface so we dug into
the<00:01:16.080> concrete<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.920> into<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> floor<00:01:17.570> laid<00:01:18.570> out

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.160 
the rocks laid out the sand and then
covered<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.470> our<00:01:22.950> epoxy<00:01:23.430> product<00:01:24.170> these

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
covered it with our epoxy product these

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.929 
covered it with our epoxy product these
particular<00:01:25.680> slides<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.430> you're<00:01:26.580> seeing<00:01:26.820> now

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
particular slides that you're seeing now

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.170 
particular slides that you're seeing now
I<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.689> close-up<00:01:28.560> shots<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.909> rocks

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
I just close-up shots of the the rocks

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.050 
I just close-up shots of the the rocks
in<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> sand<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.110> then<00:01:31.829> you'll<00:01:31.979> see<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.460> really

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
in the sand and then you'll see a really

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.969 
in the sand and then you'll see a really
good<00:01:33.270> aerial<00:01:33.689> shot<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.020> what<00:01:34.500> we're<00:01:34.650> talking

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
good aerial shot of what we're talking

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.910 
good aerial shot of what we're talking
about<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:36.360> again<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:37.290> putting<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.650> rocks

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
about so again just putting the rocks

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.120 
about so again just putting the rocks
down<00:01:38.250> putting<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.329> epoxy<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.750> top<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.409> making

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
down putting the epoxy on top and making

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.719 
down putting the epoxy on top and making
sure<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.869> floor<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.079> level<00:01:43.439> from<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
sure that that floor is level from the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.850 
sure that that floor is level from the
top<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.930> bottom<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.470> when<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.740> walk

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
top to the bottom so when you walk

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.050 
top to the bottom so when you walk
across<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.790> all<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.270> same<00:01:48.479> so

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
across it it's all the same so

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.090 
across it it's all the same so
level<00:01:49.390> so<00:01:49.540> that's<00:01:49.689> the<00:01:50.200> aerial<00:01:50.590> view<00:01:50.860> of<00:01:50.890> the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
level so that's the aerial view of the

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.280 
level so that's the aerial view of the
floor<00:01:52.799> all<00:01:53.799> done<00:01:54.640> all<00:01:55.299> done<00:01:55.329> by<00:01:55.630> hand<00:01:55.659> all<00:01:56.110> done

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
floor all done all done by hand all done

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.889 
floor all done all done by hand all done
rough<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:57.180> that's<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.299> finished<00:01:58.479> product

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
rough and that's the finished product

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.139 
rough and that's the finished product
there<00:01:59.140> with<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.500> epoxy<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.280> around<00:02:01.030> that
