00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
house I probably didn't even need more

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.130 
house I probably didn't even need more
than<00:00:59.520> one<00:00:59.699> but<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.239> really<00:01:00.539> liked<00:01:00.750> these<00:01:00.989> two

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
than one but I really liked these two

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.900 
than one but I really liked these two
colors<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.590> couldn't<00:01:01.920> decide<00:01:02.309> these<00:01:02.699> are

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
colors that I couldn't decide these are

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.549 
colors that I couldn't decide these are
the<00:01:03.030> ones<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.390> felt<00:01:03.809> picked<00:01:04.049> up<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> most

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the ones that I felt picked up the most

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.859 
the ones that I felt picked up the most
light<00:01:04.890> with<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> crystals<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.210> that's<00:01:06.659> why<00:01:06.810> I

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
light with the crystals so that's why I

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.510 
light with the crystals so that's why I
got<00:01:07.049> these<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.500> got<00:01:07.710> these<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> other<00:01:08.070> day<00:01:08.250> at

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520

and the crystals on these are really

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.270 
and the crystals on these are really
nice<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> lot<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.869> times<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.350> get<00:01:16.590> things

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
nice a lot of times if you get things

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.190 
nice a lot of times if you get things
that<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.520> jeweled<00:01:18.210> or<00:01:18.479> crystals<00:01:18.900> from

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that are jeweled or crystals from

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.469 
that are jeweled or crystals from
cheaper<00:01:19.619> places<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.340> Charlotte<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.299> forever

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
cheaper places like Charlotte of forever

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.210 
cheaper places like Charlotte of forever
21<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.960> lot<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.380> times<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> crystals<00:01:22.979> aren't

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
21 a lot of times the crystals aren't

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.440 
21 a lot of times the crystals aren't
good<00:01:23.340> quality<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:23.909> don't<00:01:24.119> really<00:01:24.299> catch

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
good quality and they don't really catch

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.240 
good quality and they don't really catch
the<00:01:24.479> light<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:25.320> these<00:01:25.470> ones<00:01:25.590> catch<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.040> light

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the light but these ones catch the light

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.760 
the light but these ones catch the light
so<00:01:26.880> much<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:28.020> know<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.259> gonna<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.500> hard<00:01:28.530> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
so much and I know it's gonna be hard to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.310 
so much and I know it's gonna be hard to
tell<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.100> my<00:01:29.220> room<00:01:29.549> but<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> did<00:01:30.600> take<00:01:31.049> some

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
tell in my room but I did take some

do think they are really cute and I
think<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.549> would<00:01:47.640> be<00:01:47.670> cute<00:01:48.060> for<00:01:48.619> like

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
think that would be cute for like

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.200 
think that would be cute for like
younger<00:01:50.040> people<00:01:50.369> problems<00:01:50.759> like<00:01:50.909> probably

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
younger people problems like probably

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.330 
younger people problems like probably
younger<00:01:51.360> than<00:01:51.420> me<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.409> top<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.860> present

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
younger than me but on top of a present

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.620 
younger than me but on top of a present
like<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.610> top<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.909> package<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.360> think<00:01:54.390> it

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
like on top of a package I think it

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.590 
like on top of a package I think it
would<00:01:54.720> catch<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.530> light<00:01:56.009> stone<00:01:56.369> nicely<00:01:56.909> so

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
would catch the light stone nicely so

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.749 
would catch the light stone nicely so
anyway<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> will<00:01:58.350> show<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.979> footage<00:01:59.280> of

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.080

like<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.009> said<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.280> wanted<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.700> film<00:02:02.969> these

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
like I said I wanted to film these

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.270 
like I said I wanted to film these

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
outside so you can see how sparkly they

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.370 
outside so you can see how sparkly they
are<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.909> Sun<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.329> setting<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.200> gonna

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
are the Sun is setting so it's gonna

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.260 
are the Sun is setting so it's gonna
really<00:02:07.770> really<00:02:07.979> catch<00:02:08.310> those<00:02:08.580> crystals<00:02:09.060> and

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
really really catch those crystals and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.449 
really really catch those crystals and
also<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:09.869> like<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.349> they<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.979> crystals

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
also I like that they have the crystals

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.510 
also I like that they have the crystals
all<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.730> way<00:02:12.120> around<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.690> bear

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
all the way around the bear

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.460 
all the way around the bear
so<00:02:13.850> as<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.180> can<00:02:14.330> see<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.840> crystals<00:02:15.200> on<00:02:15.320> these

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
so as you can see the crystals on these

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.160 
so as you can see the crystals on these
beers<00:02:15.710> are<00:02:15.860> actually<00:02:16.190> pretty<00:02:16.370> nice<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:17.300> I

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
beers are actually pretty nice and I

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.930 
beers are actually pretty nice and I
guess<00:02:18.950> that's<00:02:19.070> really<00:02:19.370> all<00:02:19.460> I<00:02:19.490> have<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.790> say

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
guess that's really all I have to say

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.730 
guess that's really all I have to say
that's<00:02:20.210> awesome<00:02:20.780> but<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.320> just<00:02:21.470> think<00:02:21.620> they're

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
that's awesome but I just think they're

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.020 
that's awesome but I just think they're
cute<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.100> wanted<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.520> let<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:22.700> guys<00:02:22.850> know

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
where I got them and I figured it'd be

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.470 
where I got them and I figured it'd be
easier<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.590> do<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.710> video<00:02:24.950> than<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:26.150> reply<00:02:26.450> to

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
easier to do a video than to reply to

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.570 
easier to do a video than to reply to
like<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.840> million<00:02:27.260> Twitter<00:02:27.770> questions<00:02:28.280> about

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
where I got these from they also have

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.690 
where I got these from they also have

and this one was only 8:50 and it's

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.700 
and this one was only 8:50 and it's
pretty<00:02:46.100> big<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:47.270> don't<00:02:47.660> really<00:02:47.780> know<00:02:47.960> what<00:02:48.590> I'm

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
pretty big I don't really know what I'm

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.200 
pretty big I don't really know what I'm
gonna<00:02:48.830> use<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.220> for<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.400> just<00:02:49.610> think<00:02:49.760> it's<00:02:49.880> cute

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
gonna use it for I just think it's cute

mostly<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:50.810> had<00:02:50.960> to<00:02:51.080> get<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.350> but<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.280> think

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
mostly and I had to get it but I think

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.890 
mostly and I had to get it but I think
this<00:02:52.580> one<00:02:52.760> would<00:02:52.940> be<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.120> really<00:02:53.330> cute<00:02:53.510> present

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
this one would be a really cute present

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.320 
this one would be a really cute present
topper<00:02:54.140> as<00:02:54.290> well<00:02:54.670> so<00:02:55.670> that's<00:02:55.850> it<00:02:56.090> for<00:02:56.240> the

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
topper as well so that's it for the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.790 
topper as well so that's it for the
keychains<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:56.930> got<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.320> definitely

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
keychains that I got I definitely

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.500 
keychains that I got I definitely
suggest<00:02:58.040> checking<00:02:58.460> them<00:02:58.730> out<00:02:58.910> if<00:02:59.090> you're<00:02:59.240> into

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
suggest checking them out if you're into

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.570 
suggest checking them out if you're into
that<00:02:59.600> sort<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.930> thing<00:02:59.990> and<00:03:00.410> I<00:03:01.160> think<00:03:01.370> they<00:03:01.460> had

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
that sort of thing and I think they had

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.010 
that sort of thing and I think they had
just<00:03:01.910> come<00:03:02.120> into<00:03:02.270> Charlotte<00:03:02.660> Russe<00:03:02.810> when<00:03:02.990> I

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
just come into Charlotte Russe when I

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.900 
just come into Charlotte Russe when I
went<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:03.350> there<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.740> would<00:03:04.220> say<00:03:04.400> definitely<00:03:04.550> be

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
went in there I would say definitely be

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.850 
went in there I would say definitely be
careful<00:03:05.180> because<00:03:05.900> they<00:03:06.140> are<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.320> little<00:03:06.740> bit

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
careful because they are a little bit

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.410 
careful because they are a little bit
more<00:03:07.070> expensive<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.820> before<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.270> know

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
more expensive and before you know

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.510 
more expensive and before you know
you've<00:03:08.630> spent<00:03:08.930> $35<00:03:09.800> on<00:03:09.980> three<00:03:10.160> key<00:03:10.310> chains

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
you've spent $35 on three key chains

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.850 
you've spent $35 on three key chains
like<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:10.850> did<00:03:11.290> alright<00:03:12.290> so<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.500> hope<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.740> that

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
like I did alright so I hope that that

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.470 
like I did alright so I hope that that

I<00:03:21.980> just<00:03:22.340> think<00:03:22.430> these<00:03:22.580> would<00:03:22.700> be<00:03:22.820> soaked<00:03:23.030> to

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
I just think these would be soaked to

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.910 
I just think these would be soaked to
you<00:03:23.300> on<00:03:23.390> top<00:03:23.600> of<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.750> package<00:03:24.080> or<00:03:24.320> if<00:03:24.770> you're

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
you on top of a package or if you're

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.470 
you on top of a package or if you're
younger<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:25.370> get<00:03:25.520> your<00:03:25.700> friends<00:03:26.060> or<00:03:26.180> something

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
younger to get your friends or something

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.260 
younger to get your friends or something
like<00:03:26.570> that<00:03:26.630> so<00:03:27.530> anyway<00:03:27.740> that's<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:28.910> I<00:03:29.090> will

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
like that so anyway that's it and I will
