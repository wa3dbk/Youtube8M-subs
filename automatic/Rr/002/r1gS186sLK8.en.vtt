details<00:02:52.900> from<00:02:53.079> that<00:02:53.350> because<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:54.690> won't<00:02:55.690> put

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
details from that because I won't put

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.229 
details from that because I won't put
those<00:02:56.110> on<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.890> internet

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
those on the internet

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.890 
those on the internet
so<00:03:00.650> actually<00:03:01.650> here<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.610> had<00:03:03.200> two<00:03:04.200> more<00:03:04.680> paper

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
so actually here I had two more paper

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.780 
so actually here I had two more paper
like<00:03:07.099> contaminated<00:03:08.099> area<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:08.870> radioactive

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
like contaminated area and radioactive

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.009 
like contaminated area and radioactive
actually<00:03:11.790> kind<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.840> nice<00:03:13.019> setup<00:03:13.500> but<00:03:14.129> I<00:03:15.019> prefer

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
actually kind of nice setup but I prefer

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.229 
actually kind of nice setup but I prefer
to<00:03:16.079> use<00:03:16.349> it<00:03:16.590> because<00:03:16.829> it's<00:03:17.340> more<00:03:18.060> like<00:03:18.959> I

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
to use it because it's more like I

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.699 
to use it because it's more like I
translate<00:03:21.239> on<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.840> night<00:03:22.019> because<00:03:22.379> this

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
translate on the night because this

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.280 
translate on the night because this
screen<00:03:23.069> is<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.250> little<00:03:23.340> brighter<00:03:23.909> and<00:03:24.840> this<00:03:25.109> is

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
screen is a little brighter and this is

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.490 
screen is a little brighter and this is
the<00:03:25.440> little<00:03:25.590> darker<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.900> doesn't<00:03:28.349> really

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
the little darker so it doesn't really
