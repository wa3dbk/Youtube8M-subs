00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
now whenever you put a number in a spot

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.380 
now whenever you put a number in a spot
all<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.530> numbers<00:01:33.250> that<00:01:33.490> are<00:01:33.549> next<00:01:33.909> to<00:01:34.060> it<00:01:34.210> can

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
all the numbers that are next to it can

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.060 
all the numbers that are next to it can
be<00:01:34.479> next<00:01:34.689> to<00:01:34.750> blank<00:01:34.960> stuff<00:01:35.170> no<00:01:35.259> problem<00:01:35.290> but

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
be next to blank stuff no problem but

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.950 
be next to blank stuff no problem but
all<00:01:36.159> the<00:01:36.280> numbers<00:01:36.579> next<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:37.000> it<00:01:37.180> have<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.750> be

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
all the numbers next to it have to be

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.679 
all the numbers next to it have to be
either<00:01:38.649> the<00:01:38.799> same<00:01:38.950> number<00:01:39.490> or<00:01:39.640> one<00:01:40.119> higher<00:01:40.390> or

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
either the same number or one higher or

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.319 
either the same number or one higher or
one<00:01:41.049> lower<00:01:41.320> so<00:01:42.189> I<00:01:42.220> rolled<00:01:42.430> a<00:01:42.520> one<00:01:42.759> yellow<00:01:43.060> I

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
one lower so I rolled a one yellow I

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.870 
one lower so I rolled a one yellow I
could<00:01:43.899> put<00:01:44.079> that<00:01:44.229> one<00:01:44.500> here<00:01:44.530> it's<00:01:45.520> next<00:01:45.790> to

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
could put that one here it's next to

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.060 
could put that one here it's next to
that<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.299> green<00:01:46.689> so<00:01:46.930> that's<00:01:47.049> legitimate<00:01:47.500> of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
that to green so that's legitimate of

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.249 
that to green so that's legitimate of
course<00:01:48.310> that<00:01:48.520> means<00:01:48.640> this<00:01:49.210> has<00:01:49.479> to<00:01:49.600> be<00:01:49.719> a<00:01:49.750> 2<00:01:49.990> or

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
course that means this has to be a 2 or

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.850 
course that means this has to be a 2 or
1<00:01:50.680> a<00:01:50.860> 2<00:01:51.070> or<00:01:51.219> 1<00:01:51.430> or<00:01:51.640> 2<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:52.030> a<00:01:52.119> 1<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.960> black<00:01:53.229> 5<00:01:53.530> I

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
1 a 2 or 1 or 2 and a 1 the black 5 I

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.190 
1 a 2 or 1 or 2 and a 1 the black 5 I
cannot<00:01:54.340> put<00:01:54.579> it<00:01:54.700> there<00:01:55.000> because<00:01:55.659> that<00:01:56.110> would

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
cannot put it there because that would

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.590 
cannot put it there because that would
be<00:01:56.290> next<00:01:56.439> to<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.680> 3<00:01:57.040> but<00:01:57.850> I'm<00:01:58.030> thinking<00:01:58.329> I'll<00:01:58.450> put

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
be next to a 3 but I'm thinking I'll put

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.959 
be next to a 3 but I'm thinking I'll put
a<00:01:58.630> 4<00:01:58.869> next<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.380> 3<00:01:59.619> so<00:02:00.280> I'm<00:02:00.340> gonna<00:02:00.460> put<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.700> 5

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
a 4 next to the 3 so I'm gonna put the 5

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.050 
a 4 next to the 3 so I'm gonna put the 5
there<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.799> next<00:02:03.100> two<00:02:03.219> dice<00:02:03.430> are<00:02:03.610> rolled<00:02:03.820> and

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
there the next two dice are rolled and

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.649 
there the next two dice are rolled and
here<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.659> have<00:02:04.840> a<00:02:04.869> blue<00:02:05.140> 3<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:05.860> a<00:02:06.460> purple<00:02:06.909> 2<00:02:07.149> so

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
here I have a blue 3 and a purple 2 so

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.529 
here I have a blue 3 and a purple 2 so
I'll<00:02:07.810> put<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.049> blue<00:02:08.229> 3<00:02:08.619> here<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.940> purple<00:02:10.329> -

since 6 dice have been pulled from the
bag<00:02:23.650> then<00:02:24.609> that's<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.239> end<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.480> that<00:02:25.540> we're

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
bag then that's the end of that we're

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.930 
bag then that's the end of that we're
going<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.500> put<00:02:26.769> all<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.250> dice<00:02:27.400> back<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:27.790> we

going to put all the dice back in we
don't<00:02:28.060> use<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.540> seventh<00:02:28.870> dye

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
don't use the seventh dye

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.880 
don't use the seventh dye
and<00:02:29.700> what<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.360> one<00:02:30.510> round<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:30.930> over<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.470> we're

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
and what the one round is over and we're

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.020 
and what the one round is over and we're
going<00:02:32.070> to<00:02:32.160> do<00:02:32.280> this<00:02:32.400> again<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.730> we're<00:02:32.940> gonna

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
going to do this again and we're gonna

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:53.780 
going to do this again and we're gonna
do<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.210> eight<00:02:33.540> rounds<00:02:52.100> at<00:02:53.100> this<00:02:53.220> point<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.610> can

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
do it eight rounds at this point you can

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.450 
do it eight rounds at this point you can
see<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.450> six<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.170> Green<00:02:55.470> has<00:02:55.950> no<00:02:56.250> where

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
see that the six of Green has no where

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.270 
see that the six of Green has no where
where<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.790> can<00:02:56.940> go<00:02:57.120> because<00:02:57.960> everywhere<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.920> put

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
where it can go because everywhere I put

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.750 
where it can go because everywhere I put
it<00:02:59.400> it's<00:02:59.910> next<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.570> either<00:03:01.020> a<00:03:01.200> 2<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.830> 1<00:03:02.310> or<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.460> 4

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
it it's next to either a 2 a 1 or a 4

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.100 
it it's next to either a 2 a 1 or a 4
and<00:03:02.940> it's<00:03:03.060> not<00:03:03.210> one<00:03:03.450> away<00:03:03.600> from<00:03:03.780> any<00:03:03.900> of<00:03:04.020> those

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
and it's not one away from any of those

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.220 
and it's not one away from any of those
numbers<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:04.710> I<00:03:05.370> have<00:03:05.520> two<00:03:05.670> options<00:03:06.090> here<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.540> can

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
numbers so I have two options here I can

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.160 
numbers so I have two options here I can
use<00:03:07.260> one<00:03:07.860> of<00:03:07.890> my<00:03:08.100> three<00:03:08.430> color<00:03:08.730> changes<00:03:09.360> when<00:03:09.600> I

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
use one of my three color changes when I

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.290 
use one of my three color changes when I
do<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.830> did<00:03:11.310> say<00:03:11.430> this<00:03:11.580> is<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.730> six<00:03:12.120> of

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
do that I did say this is a six of

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.880 
do that I did say this is a six of
anything<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.840> could<00:03:12.990> say<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.260> six<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.650> white

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
anything so I could say the six of white

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.770 
anything so I could say the six of white
and<00:03:14.100> put<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.370> over<00:03:14.460> here<00:03:14.910> or<00:03:15.320> I<00:03:16.320> can<00:03:16.950> put<00:03:17.190> an<00:03:17.310> X

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
and put it over here or I can put an X

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.420 
and put it over here or I can put an X
anywhere<00:03:18.780> in<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.380> green<00:03:19.590> spot<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.100> take<00:03:20.250> its

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
anywhere in a green spot to take its

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.330 
anywhere in a green spot to take its
place<00:03:20.630> you<00:03:21.630> don't<00:03:21.750> really<00:03:21.990> want<00:03:22.350> X's<00:03:22.890> because

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
place you don't really want X's because

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.840 
place you don't really want X's because
X's<00:03:23.970> are<00:03:24.120> bad<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:25.710> will<00:03:25.830> continue<00:03:26.010> if

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
X's are bad and so this will continue if

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.480 
X's are bad and so this will continue if
you<00:03:27.180> have<00:03:27.600> all<00:03:27.810> your<00:03:27.840> spots<00:03:28.350> filled<00:03:28.650> up<00:03:28.800> with

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
you have all your spots filled up with

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.030 
you have all your spots filled up with
numbers<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.270> X's<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.380> roll<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.740> number

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
numbers and X's and you roll that number

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.830 
numbers and X's and you roll that number
then<00:03:32.220> you're<00:03:32.370> fine<00:03:32.640> but<00:03:33.330> you'll<00:03:33.480> continue

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
then you're fine but you'll continue

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.199 
then you're fine but you'll continue
going<00:03:34.020> until<00:03:34.440> everyone<00:03:35.160> has<00:03:35.310> crossed<00:03:35.700> off<00:03:35.970> all

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
going until everyone has crossed off all

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.130 
going until everyone has crossed off all
eight<00:03:36.930> rounds<00:03:37.530> at<00:03:37.709> that<00:03:38.490> point<00:03:39.110> you're<00:03:40.110> going

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
eight rounds at that point you're going

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.430 
eight rounds at that point you're going
to<00:03:40.410> score<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.340> game<00:03:41.550> so<00:03:42.240> players<00:03:43.050> are<00:03:43.260> going

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
to score the game so players are going

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.860 
to score the game so players are going
to<00:03:43.530> look<00:03:43.680> here<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:45.120> score<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.600> game<00:03:45.750> is

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
to look here and the score the game is

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.630 
to look here and the score the game is
very<00:03:45.900> easy<00:03:46.230> for<00:03:46.470> example<00:03:47.040> here's<00:03:47.190> a<00:03:47.250> final

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
very easy for example here's a final

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.699 
very easy for example here's a final

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
limited to Japan I've talked to the

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.310 
limited to Japan I've talked to the
company<00:04:15.030> they<00:04:15.209> show<00:04:15.450> me<00:04:15.600> maps<00:04:15.870> for<00:04:16.140> both

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
company they show me maps for both

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.159 
company they show me maps for both
Germany<00:04:16.980> and<00:04:17.280> France<00:04:17.700> and<00:04:18.090> so<00:04:18.330> there's<00:04:18.959> other

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
Germany and France and so there's other

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.539 
Germany and France and so there's other
maps<00:04:19.530> that<00:04:19.770> you<00:04:19.859> know<00:04:19.980> this<00:04:20.100> could<00:04:20.250> easily<00:04:20.370> be

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
maps that you know this could easily be

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.550 
maps that you know this could easily be
transposed<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.330> other<00:04:21.450> maps<00:04:21.750> this<00:04:22.380> is

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
transposed to other maps this is

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.890 
transposed to other maps this is
essentially<00:04:22.980> a<00:04:23.130> solitaire<00:04:24.000> game<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:24.690> that<00:04:24.840> I

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
essentially a solitaire game and that I

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.590 
essentially a solitaire game and that I
mean<00:04:25.230> you're<00:04:25.680> working<00:04:25.950> on<00:04:26.400> your<00:04:26.790> own<00:04:26.970> paper<00:04:27.330> or

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
mean you're working on your own paper or

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.550 
mean you're working on your own paper or
what<00:04:27.720> everyone<00:04:27.960> else<00:04:28.050> is<00:04:28.200> doing<00:04:28.290> their<00:04:28.530> own

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
what everyone else is doing their own

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.710 
what everyone else is doing their own
sure<00:04:29.220> one<00:04:29.490> person<00:04:29.880> is<00:04:30.000> rolling<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.330> dice<00:04:30.480> and

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
sure one person is rolling a dice and

how does it stack up well I enjoy it I

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.820 
how does it stack up well I enjoy it I
do<00:05:12.390> wish<00:05:12.780> maybe<00:05:13.050> there's<00:05:13.230> a<00:05:13.290> bit<00:05:13.440> more<00:05:13.470> player

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.110 
do wish maybe there's a bit more player
interaction<00:05:14.280> but<00:05:14.400> essentially<00:05:14.850> it's<00:05:15.000> a

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
interaction but essentially it's a

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.520 
interaction but essentially it's a
puzzle<00:05:15.510> it's<00:05:15.600> something<00:05:15.900> entertaining<00:05:16.350> to

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
puzzle it's something entertaining to

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.290 
puzzle it's something entertaining to
pass<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:16.860> time<00:05:17.070> as<00:05:17.280> I'm<00:05:17.880> sitting<00:05:18.180> there

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
pass the time as I'm sitting there

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.390 
pass the time as I'm sitting there
saying<00:05:18.510> okay<00:05:19.230> and<00:05:19.530> then<00:05:19.860> you're<00:05:20.040> trying<00:05:20.310> to

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
saying okay and then you're trying to

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.130 
saying okay and then you're trying to
put<00:05:20.550> numbers<00:05:20.880> and<00:05:21.120> the<00:05:21.390> way<00:05:21.510> the<00:05:21.660> map<00:05:21.930> is

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
put numbers and the way the map is

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.100 
put numbers and the way the map is
written<00:05:22.410> it<00:05:22.500> seems<00:05:22.770> like<00:05:22.890> it<00:05:22.980> always<00:05:23.190> always

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
written it seems like it always always

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.060 
written it seems like it always always
befuddled<00:05:25.110> you<00:05:25.290> you<00:05:25.500> know<00:05:25.620> where<00:05:25.890> you're

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
befuddled you you know where you're

gonna put stuff and when the purple dye

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.900 
gonna put stuff and when the purple dye
is<00:05:27.720> rolled<00:05:28.200> where<00:05:29.130> are<00:05:29.340> you<00:05:29.490> gonna<00:05:29.580> put<00:05:29.700> that

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
is rolled where are you gonna put that

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.000 
is rolled where are you gonna put that
wild<00:05:30.570> number<00:05:30.960> you<00:05:31.230> know<00:05:31.350> what<00:05:31.530> color<00:05:31.830> are<00:05:31.920> you

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
wild number you know what color are you

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.290 
wild number you know what color are you
gonna<00:05:32.070> put<00:05:32.340> it<00:05:32.430> in<00:05:32.550> because<00:05:32.700> that<00:05:32.880> can<00:05:33.180> really

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
gonna put it in because that can really

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.750 
gonna put it in because that can really
change<00:05:33.420> whether<00:05:34.320> you<00:05:34.530> win<00:05:34.740> or<00:05:34.770> not<00:05:35.010> and<00:05:35.250> those

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
change whether you win or not and those

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.370 
change whether you win or not and those
color<00:05:36.090> changes<00:05:36.600> when<00:05:36.630> are<00:05:36.870> you<00:05:36.930> going<00:05:37.080> to<00:05:37.170> use

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
color changes when are you going to use

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.650 
color changes when are you going to use
them<00:05:37.620> to<00:05:37.830> switch<00:05:38.130> a<00:05:38.280> color<00:05:38.520> so<00:05:39.030> it's<00:05:39.180> very

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
them to switch a color so it's very

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.790 
them to switch a color so it's very
interesting<00:05:40.230> I<00:05:41.630> actually<00:05:42.630> quite<00:05:43.140> enjoy<00:05:43.560> the

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
interesting I actually quite enjoy the

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.210 
interesting I actually quite enjoy the
game

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
game

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.220 
game
although<00:05:44.670> realizing<00:05:45.600> it's<00:05:45.720> more<00:05:45.960> of<00:05:46.050> like<00:05:46.080> a

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
although realizing it's more of like a
