 pretty basic information out there

 they will send several messages in which 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.660
 we will have to configure the application 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.600
 is in English however it is a 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.959
 very simple application with English 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.080
 once we give you restart the 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.120
 application will start loading our 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.400
 our contacts that we have in

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.550
 I get all the contacts here in 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.860
 chats networks receiving the 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.110

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.320
 Chatting or connected at that moment 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.090
 there are several options here there are four 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.400
 main that are being to cannes 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.170
 status settings and search here in the 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.690
 part of a camps because they are the 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.000
 accounts with which we have initiated the 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.640
 session I'm going to return here in the 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.410
 part of it seems like a stop 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.050
 recorder let's take a tap and we 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.390
 come several options eye when 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.610
 you close the application still to 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.410
 the other users will disappear online 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.450
 if you want to disconnect 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.480
 entirely on the social network that 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.760
 are registered here in aimme plus van 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.440
 to have to put it on offline and with 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.570
 that they will not receive nor 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.430
 notifications will not appear as 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.950
 connected in the social network if we 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.510
 we come back now here in the part of 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.329
 pse dings go to 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.940
 several very very basic things I what 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.090
 I recommend you deactivate stade 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.860
 of line group and here in notifications and 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.510
 here in Stalls settings 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.550
 good come some little things for the 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.850
 night file by messages 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.130
 we can also change the size of the 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.199
 from the source I'm going to have it on average 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.050
 because it is very small including type of 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.910
 the emoticons are telling us how the 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.090
 we want we want them square or 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.370
 monochrome and I mean in rounds and in 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.800
 work setting here is going to tell us 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.080
 will confirm if it is connected or 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.449
 disconnected either from the wifi or from 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.610
 our cellular network something very important 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.919
 is that within the configurations in 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.110
 the power section you should from 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.720
 select this one that says that ron on the 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.870
 block version that we are going to palomear for 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.910
 so keep running through that 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.610
 even if the application is blocked or not 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.280
 let's get out of it says that to grow 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.380
 or well , more battery is spent 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.570
 it does not really matter what you spend is very 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.479
 very little is not much the difference between 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.440
 have it or not have it and disable this 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.640
 which says confirm 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.200
 leaving for your mom is annoying that 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.760
 ask until here comes the video of 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.040
