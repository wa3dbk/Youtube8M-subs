00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.300
 minutes with four we will learn 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:09.110
 some what do you think 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.170
 slow of a masita 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.059
 and see if later in the summer we are in 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.059
 winter in buenos aires grows 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.850
 and not two 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.330
 14 how are they called originally we are going to 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.660
 learn some 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.660
 i 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.920
 you read some seeds 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.260
 to plant it we just choose one 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.410
 flowerpot 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:42.060
 we open the fruit and add it to the 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.160
 earth now let's cover the earth 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.270
 those to simply in another pot 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.270
 the seeds directly 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.760
 once here we have the fruit we open it 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.400
 on the plant and let the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.840
 seeds open and start to grow 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.030
 from inside the fruit as if they had 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.680
 dropped to ground because originally as 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.869
 is this falls to the ground and right there in 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.540
 its same fruits elaborating then 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.010
 we leave there I put more seeds than 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.050
 that are needed simply by the 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.320
 doubts that it does not grow and we give them 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.320
 land 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.690
 and youtube 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.320
 they say secret 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.110
 to plant quinotos what we are going to 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.810
 have to be patient because it is not 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.610
 a plant that requires months and times 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.490
 months apart we are in winter in 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:45.150
 buenos aires so until the summer 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:49.610
 I do not think that it even appears 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.610
 a good first flower 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.499
 If you want to eat Chinese 2 this is a 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.210
 way to raise it now we are going to 

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:59.030
 fix this we 're going to put it in the sun 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.140
 with a lot of sunshine 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.549
 and then as I say for science 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.549
 patience with the kumquats
