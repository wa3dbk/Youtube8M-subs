better<00:04:39.229> to<00:04:39.590> so<00:04:39.830> although<00:04:39.949> with<00:04:40.130> a<00:04:40.190> little

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
better to so although with a little

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.550 
better to so although with a little
uglier<00:04:40.699> definitely<00:04:41.300> fits<00:04:41.510> my<00:04:41.690> fingers<00:04:42.260> better

but<00:04:43.310> this<00:04:43.430> one<00:04:43.580> has<00:04:43.760> like<00:04:43.970> a<00:04:44.000> more<00:04:44.630> of<00:04:44.750> a

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
but this one has like a more of a

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.530 
but this one has like a more of a
rubbery<00:04:45.229> inside<00:04:45.860> on<00:04:46.070> the<00:04:46.190> whole<00:04:46.460> hand<00:04:47.120> and

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
rubbery inside on the whole hand and

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.719 
rubbery inside on the whole hand and
it's<00:04:48.320> just<00:04:48.500> a<00:04:48.560> different<00:04:48.770> texture<00:04:49.280> and<00:04:49.669> I

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
it's just a different texture and I

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.490 
it's just a different texture and I
didn't<00:04:50.060> know<00:04:50.180> sometimes<00:04:50.600> I<00:04:50.690> get<00:04:50.840> calluses<00:04:51.229> I

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
didn't know sometimes I get calluses I

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.719 
didn't know sometimes I get calluses I
don't<00:04:51.710> think<00:04:51.740> I<00:04:51.919> could<00:04:52.100> use<00:04:52.250> this<00:04:52.460> one<00:04:52.639> I'm

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
don't think I could use this one I'm

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.520 
don't think I could use this one I'm
breaking<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.330> other<00:04:53.720> one<00:04:53.900> would<00:04:54.080> probably<00:04:54.380> be

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
breaking the other one would probably be

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.900 
breaking the other one would probably be
better<00:04:54.710> while<00:04:54.949> I<00:04:54.979> was<00:04:55.220> breaking<00:04:55.430> I<00:04:55.639> picked<00:04:55.820> up

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
better while I was breaking I picked up

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.820
