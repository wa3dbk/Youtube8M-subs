how<00:04:27.720> it<00:04:27.900> compares<00:04:28.379> to<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.770> ipod<00:04:29.129> touch<00:04:30.440> here

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
how it compares to the ipod touch here

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.839 
how it compares to the ipod touch here
we<00:04:31.560> have<00:04:31.710> an<00:04:31.919> ipod<00:04:32.190> touch<00:04:32.370> of<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.639> fourth

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
we have an ipod touch of the fourth

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:37.279 
we have an ipod touch of the fourth
generation<00:04:33.539> and<00:04:33.889> it<00:04:34.889> has<00:04:35.039> 64<00:04:35.580> gigabytes<00:04:36.289> so

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
generation and it has 64 gigabytes so

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.499 
generation and it has 64 gigabytes so
how<00:04:37.470> does<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:37.680> compare<00:04:37.949> well<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.819> camera<00:04:39.060> is

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
how does it compare well the camera is

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.129 
how does it compare well the camera is
worse<00:04:40.080> on<00:04:40.319> the<00:04:40.379> ipod<00:04:41.360> it<00:04:42.360> does<00:04:42.599> have<00:04:42.810> a<00:04:42.840> higher

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
worse on the ipod it does have a higher

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.879 
worse on the ipod it does have a higher
res<00:04:43.470> screen<00:04:43.919> dough<00:04:44.280> but<00:04:45.000> it's<00:04:45.150> smaller<00:04:45.680> it<00:04:46.680> has

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
res screen dough but it's smaller it has

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.710 
res screen dough but it's smaller it has
half<00:04:47.159> less<00:04:47.520> ram<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:48.979> it<00:04:49.979> has<00:04:50.280> a<00:04:50.669> slower<00:04:51.150> graph

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
half less ram and it has a slower graph

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.719 
half less ram and it has a slower graph
a<00:04:51.930> bit<00:04:52.500> lower<00:04:52.740> graphics<00:04:53.190> are<00:04:53.280> i<00:04:53.340> don't<00:04:53.370> know<00:04:53.639> if

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
a bit lower graphics are i don't know if

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.790 
a bit lower graphics are i don't know if
there<00:04:54.000> is<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.120> big<00:04:54.330> of<00:04:54.449> difference<00:04:54.930> but<00:04:55.199> it

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
there is a big of difference but it

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.270 
there is a big of difference but it
could<00:04:56.129> be<00:04:56.340> also<00:04:57.180> it<00:04:57.659> runs<00:04:57.930> a<00:04:58.169> slower<00:04:58.530> processor

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
could be also it runs a slower processor

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.270 
could be also it runs a slower processor
with<00:04:59.550> 800<00:05:00.030> megahertz<00:05:00.270> a4a<00:05:00.930> for<00:05:01.259> yes<00:05:01.979> i<00:05:02.219> know

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
with 800 megahertz a4a for yes i know

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.640 
with 800 megahertz a4a for yes i know
people<00:05:02.940> say<00:05:03.120> it's<00:05:03.270> an<00:05:03.360> a<00:05:03.449> four<00:05:03.750> runs<00:05:03.990> ups<00:05:04.199> yeah

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
people say it's an a four runs ups yeah
