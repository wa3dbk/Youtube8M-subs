00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.570 
oil doesn't splatter everywhere now for
the<00:02:19.989> next<00:02:20.110> step<00:02:20.230> I'm<00:02:20.500> using<00:02:20.650> sanding<00:02:21.190> sugar<00:02:21.220> to

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
the next step I'm using sanding sugar to

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.240 
the next step I'm using sanding sugar to
replicate<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.239> flames<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:23.320> fire<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:24.040> I'm

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
replicate the flames the fire and I'm

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.300 
replicate the flames the fire and I'm
using<00:02:24.489> black<00:02:25.000> nope<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.540> day<00:02:25.750> for<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.320> coals<00:02:26.769> I

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
using black nope a day for the coals I

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.280 
using black nope a day for the coals I
figure<00:02:28.000> out<00:02:28.090> how<00:02:28.239> I<00:02:28.269> could<00:02:28.420> make<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:28.840> look<00:02:29.050> like

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
figure out how I could make it look like

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.220 
figure out how I could make it look like
coals<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.220> know<00:02:30.459> so<00:02:31.120> what<00:02:31.330> I'm<00:02:31.420> doing<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.989> with

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
coals you know so what I'm doing is with

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.180 
coals you know so what I'm doing is with
some<00:02:32.530> yellow<00:02:32.739> icing<00:02:33.550> I<00:02:34.860> think<00:02:35.860> it's<00:02:36.010> pretty

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
some yellow icing I think it's pretty

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.729 
some yellow icing I think it's pretty
good<00:02:36.550> I'm<00:02:36.730> just<00:02:37.239> flooding<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.900> center<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.500> my

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
good I'm just flooding the center of my

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:45.369 
good I'm just flooding the center of my
