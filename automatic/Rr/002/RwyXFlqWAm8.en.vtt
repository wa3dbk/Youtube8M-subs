00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
maybe between now and the end of this

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.520

piece<00:01:45.630> by<00:01:45.899> piece<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:47.100> does<00:01:47.250> not<00:01:47.399> necessarily

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
piece by piece that does not necessarily

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.249 
piece by piece that does not necessarily
mean<00:01:48.240> they're<00:01:48.540> going<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.840> bringing<00:01:48.990> back

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259

the<00:01:49.409> Welcome<00:01:49.710> Back<00:01:49.890> program<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.270> may

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the Welcome Back program but that may

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.460 
the Welcome Back program but that may
mean<00:01:51.689> they're<00:01:51.869> going<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.140> some<00:01:52.320> very

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
mean they're going to have some very

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.899 
mean they're going to have some very
simple<00:01:52.860> functions<00:01:53.399> where<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.790> download

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
simple functions where you can download

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.819

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
certain things they weren't very

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.219 
certain things they weren't very
specific<00:01:56.149> so<00:01:57.149> hopefully<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.869> will<00:01:58.020> come

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
