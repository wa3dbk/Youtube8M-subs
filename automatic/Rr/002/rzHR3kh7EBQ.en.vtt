00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 We're going to stay here like 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.919
 dresser to rob a box of 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:55.379
 Bank 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:01:23.840
 it may be that the first thing the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:23.840
 People are going to take the cover off so 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:55.340
 good now and we will mark the half and half 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.390
 even more I'll mark and cut cut 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:39.790
 in handing out the handle, I do not have as 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:03:04.780
 You're seeing me very important, I already 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:03:09.480
 I know starting because the bank can stay 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.480
 It is the smallest part because it is the place of 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.190
 other 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.530
 the smaller bank 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:04:01.320
 I recommend not leaving much of the same 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:04:01.320
 my size is good now it 's bigger 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:24.880
 we will get bigger and we will pick up and 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.100
 active 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.100
 Let's get a piece of the tam 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.990
 I'll stay one and get it all cut well. 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.820
 graphite 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.770
 so get sun 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:17.120
 because we will stick with the paper will 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:17.120
 stay glued with tape from school 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:06:02.000
 color to the bank to do something that 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.000
 I think I'll do it. 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:18.980
 you can pick it up and you can even 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:18.980
 catch him, he's fine 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:30.099
 just put the delegate here will stay 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:37.779
 the arrows of the doll, right? 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:41.110
 here sitting there internet is the internet 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:44.559
 how to make a dresser so that 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.749
 You liked the tip and it scarce. 

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:50.439
 I 'm not going to make my tent to 

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:54.129
 to overcome in my will is to advance 

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:56.199
 So I'll go and get it and I'll go get it. 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:58.059
 We'll stay here later. 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:01.899
 complicated in this story because 

00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:04.779
 Another tool for 

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:07.330
 color to paint will paste a paper 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:13.679
 and then I'm going to record how the 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:13.679
 each person's dressing table will be the match
