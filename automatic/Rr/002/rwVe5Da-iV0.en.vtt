00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:09.029
 Yeah Uu' UU UU 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.029
 Sound con 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:23.980
 Today is the railway version of the JNR era- this was taken on February 4, 1984 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:25.480
 What am I think you now watch you want to open the main line Mason Te peeled off running through the snow 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.470
 Went out at the same place 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:33.860
 It is Hokuriku Line of summer Eemaa Fuyuki Niño here in the same place 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:39.980
 Will it be a logical landscape 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:47.710
 This is the same place, but the gap is quite intense. 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:47.710
 I went to my house just this time because I had snow on my cat at this time 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.120
 Hokuriku Hane Currently Hane Anmari 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:01:00.420
 It is said already now 2014 already 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.750
 It's not so much snow, though, so I will say so much global warming 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.110
 became 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:13.050
 Well 2014 people got hot in Tokyo but Kanazawa's in the time of heavy snow in Tokyo 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:18.870
 Snow is like feeling like Kanazawa 0 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:20.220
 Well, I think that the train also runs with snow smoke in such a wind, which is rare in Hokuriku 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:26.280
 It is a thing 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:33.070
 The accumulated I already say I Well raise too much Yukikemuri Nde temperature is high Tteyuu Hokuriku of snow 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:35.730
 Immediately whether or nappe to Well pretty today say oh if not when it becomes low wind was 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.730
 It is a design 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:47.040
 The side of the train is also Hokkaido, so I can not see it anymore, so I can not see it anymore. 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:52.680
 The snow smoke of that body goes up behind me 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:57.560
 Well, I think it is unusual to say that it is rare in Hokuriku, though it only goes up that way 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:03.780
 In the old days before this global warming, so much like that 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:08.090
 The recently another real but I train there were running to raise the Yukikemuri 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.090
 It is rare so you can not see it 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.920
 This is Kaetsu 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:19.459
 Now that the name has changed , it has gone and it has become a white rabbit 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:24.130
 At that time too, the express from Yonehara was on the verge 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.130
 The express from Nagoya is said to be white 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.900
 It's a 7-car formation, and the present white birch is Yokoko Yonehara 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.650
 Though 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.650
 Although this it was not from across the other side of the line 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.100
 It is an ordinary train bound for Shiga 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:07.530
 Although this also is likewise did it not shell the other side of the line 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:12.100
 Will be over there is more of Kanazawa here on the front say Fukui 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:15.600
 ef 81 something strange but what is is is how attached the snow 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.600
 I ran to wear 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:24.680
 A slow speed car is attached with my brother 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.730
 In the old days, this green tea container is thick and it feels like no pump 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.959
 that 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.959
 It was a standard but now I have to say the ground of this color once and for all 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:41.310
 This is a swan from Aomori Ward. 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:43.200
 It is the organization of it is swan train 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.520
 The middle car ぇ 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:53.590
 This Kaiserslautern position of the door becomes from Osaka 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:53.590
 That is to say that the direction of the train is reversed with Lai Chu or Shirakaba 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:07.090
 Prince there is but I did not count a little said to Na car was thirteen Ling 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.090
 The following is the Nagoya bound for Egret 65 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:23.630
 At this time , I heard that I had probably been running in a 12-car train already. 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.950
 Green car linked to the dining car is two-car and day 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.270
 Say directly below 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.960
 And I still compared to Hokkaido but this it is quite do snow lucky behind 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.039
 Still not 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:41.340
 It's a better still good to get the Well Allegra snow Well Hokuriku 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:42.780
 And ran to the well when low dawn ran come that the Sea of Japan Toka from it before Well the morning of the biggest temperature 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.870
 If there were any trains 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:51.860
 It may well marked with quite go behind 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.860
 Well that doesn't mean that the temperature isn't too cold. 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.150
 Before I even here the cargo but are attached to Anne atmosphere 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:15.650
 It's cargo comes running from pretty far away 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:19.190
 Go towards the back of the container is full of snow I are lucky I Well Oh temperature of at microcomputer 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:25.460
 In low snow country it becomes aiff but in Hokuriku 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:28.060
 I think the kana not the cargo that came running from the northeast towards the quite rare I I Papa' child 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.060
 But 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:38.969
 You ride in here of the video last of the video 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.999
 It is the Shirakaba Yamado of Nagakan 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:46.159
 I would like to farewell here of the video last 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:46.159
