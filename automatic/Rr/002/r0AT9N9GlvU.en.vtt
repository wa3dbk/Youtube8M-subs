nicely with soap this is well marinated
but<00:02:07.290> one<00:02:07.500> thing<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.950> need<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:08.310> right

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
but one thing that you need to do right

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.369 
but one thing that you need to do right
now<00:02:08.550> after<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.509> mixed<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.929> well<00:02:10.200> is

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
now after you have mixed this well is

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.059 
now after you have mixed this well is
taste<00:02:10.770> salt<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:12.390> you

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
taste salt so you

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.890 
taste salt so you
you<00:02:13.159> do<00:02:13.459> this<00:02:13.609> and<00:02:16.030> salt<00:02:17.030> has<00:02:17.299> to<00:02:17.329> be<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.569> little

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
you do this and salt has to be a little

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.720 
you do this and salt has to be a little
on<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.290> higher<00:02:18.499> side<00:02:18.799> in<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.189> marination

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
on the higher side in this marination

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.759 
on the higher side in this marination
why<00:02:20.540> because<00:02:20.900> we<00:02:20.989> are<00:02:21.049> going<00:02:21.139> to<00:02:21.230> be<00:02:21.319> adding<00:02:21.680> in

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
why because we are going to be adding in

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.009 
why because we are going to be adding in
a<00:02:21.980> little<00:02:22.040> bit<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.430> cornstarch<00:02:22.810> little<00:02:23.810> bit<00:02:23.900> of

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
a little bit of cornstarch little bit of

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.069 
a little bit of cornstarch little bit of
refined<00:02:24.439> flour<00:02:24.530> so<00:02:25.569> automatically<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.780> salt

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
refined flour so automatically the salt

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.589 
refined flour so automatically the salt
will<00:02:27.349> get<00:02:27.530> diluted<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:28.849> leave<00:02:29.090> this<00:02:29.299> to

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
will get diluted and you leave this to

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.929 
will get diluted and you leave this to
marinate<00:02:30.049> for<00:02:30.230> about<00:02:30.290> an<00:02:30.620> hour<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.340> that<00:02:31.670> the

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:31.939 
marinate for about an hour so that the

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.449 
marinate for about an hour so that the
salt<00:02:32.299> and<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:32.870> remaining<00:02:33.379> spices<00:02:33.980> go<00:02:34.189> right

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
salt and the remaining spices go right

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.030 
salt and the remaining spices go right
into<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:35.120> chicken<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.629> when<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.290> fry<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.680> it

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
into the chicken and when you fry it it

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.539 
into the chicken and when you fry it it
is<00:02:37.159> crisp<00:02:37.579> and<00:02:37.870> tasty<00:02:38.919> okay<00:02:39.919> I<00:02:39.950> think<00:02:40.310> this<00:02:40.430> is

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
is crisp and tasty okay I think this is

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.089 
is crisp and tasty okay I think this is
now<00:02:40.700> very<00:02:40.969> well<00:02:41.060> marinated<00:02:41.900> let<00:02:42.469> us<00:02:42.590> go<00:02:42.769> ahead

have to pick it up and put it into not

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.590 
have to pick it up and put it into not
very<00:03:25.340> hot<00:03:25.580> oil<00:03:25.820> so<00:03:26.720> your<00:03:26.960> the<00:03:27.320> oil<00:03:27.500> is<00:03:27.710> hot<00:03:28.600> not

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
very hot oil so your the oil is hot not

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.150 
very hot oil so your the oil is hot not
very<00:03:29.930> hard<00:03:30.140> because<00:03:30.320> you<00:03:30.530> cannot<00:03:30.740> just<00:03:30.800> put

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
very hard because you cannot just put

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.770 
very hard because you cannot just put
this<00:03:31.250> in<00:03:31.400> very<00:03:31.670> hot<00:03:31.880> oil<00:03:31.910> because<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.450> chicken

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
this in very hot oil because the chicken

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.270 
this in very hot oil because the chicken
will<00:03:32.930> just<00:03:33.080> get<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.350> color<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.830> it<00:03:33.980> will<00:03:34.100> not

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
will just get the color and it will not

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.040 
will just get the color and it will not
cook<00:03:34.550> from<00:03:34.760> within<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:35.750> has<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:35.990> be

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
cook from within so it has to be

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.410 
cook from within so it has to be
moderately<00:03:36.530> hot<00:03:36.860> now<00:03:37.700> let's<00:03:37.940> add<00:03:38.150> this

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
moderately hot now let's add this

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.060 
moderately hot now let's add this
chicken<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.320> oil<00:03:39.470> when<00:03:39.740> you<00:03:39.800> are<00:03:39.860> adding

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
chicken to the oil when you are adding

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.210 
chicken to the oil when you are adding
make<00:03:40.760> sure<00:03:41.030> it<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.240> very<00:03:41.270> well<00:03:41.750> coated<00:03:42.220> with

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
make sure it is very well coated with

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.940 
make sure it is very well coated with
the<00:03:43.700> refined<00:03:44.030> flour<00:03:44.180> mixture<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:44.990> the<00:03:45.530> oil<00:03:45.710> as

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
the refined flour mixture and the oil as

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.170 
the refined flour mixture and the oil as
you<00:03:46.070> see<00:03:46.250> is<00:03:46.370> not<00:03:46.520> very<00:03:47.000> hot<00:03:48.040> so<00:03:49.040> here<00:03:49.730> it<00:03:49.880> goes

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.160 

okay<00:03:53.180> now<00:03:53.270> what<00:03:53.480> do<00:03:53.630> you<00:03:53.690> do<00:03:53.870> if<00:03:53.990> you<00:03:54.080> are<00:03:54.110> a

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
guests or one you still want to make

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.970 
guests or one you still want to make
this<00:03:58.600> simple<00:03:59.600> what<00:03:59.780> you<00:03:59.870> can<00:04:00.020> do<00:04:00.170> is<00:04:00.320> put

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
this simple what you can do is put

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.010 
this simple what you can do is put
paneer<00:04:01.340> pieces<00:04:01.520> in<00:04:01.760> this<00:04:01.880> marination<00:04:02.330> the

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
paneer pieces in this marination the

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.080 
paneer pieces in this marination the
only<00:04:03.320> difference<00:04:03.740> will<00:04:04.490> be<00:04:04.520> that<00:04:04.790> you<00:04:04.910> won't

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
only difference will be that you won't
