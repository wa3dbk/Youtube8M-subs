change

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.620 

the<00:01:27.100> Los<00:01:27.250> Angeles<00:01:27.670> could<00:01:27.820> have<00:01:27.910> easily<00:01:28.150> been

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
the Los Angeles could have easily been

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.290 
the Los Angeles could have easily been
Haiti<00:01:29.110> we<00:01:29.590> are<00:01:29.770> in<00:01:29.980> the<00:01:30.100> ring<00:01:30.280> of<00:01:30.430> fire<00:01:30.640> and<00:01:30.970> I

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
Haiti we are in the ring of fire and I

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.060 
Haiti we are in the ring of fire and I
think<00:01:31.570> that<00:01:31.750> you<00:01:31.870> know<00:01:31.990> if<00:01:32.470> we<00:01:32.620> don't<00:01:32.800> get

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
think that you know if we don't get

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.740 
think that you know if we don't get
involved<00:01:33.370> and<00:01:33.610> really<00:01:33.730> start<00:01:34.180> pulling

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
involved and really start pulling

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.380 
involved and really start pulling
together<00:01:34.900> and<00:01:35.230> helping<00:01:35.560> I<00:01:35.970> think<00:01:36.970> we<00:01:37.240> could

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
together and helping I think we could

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.440 
together and helping I think we could
just<00:01:37.720> as<00:01:37.840> easily<00:01:38.020> be<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:39.520> country<00:01:40.060> like

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
just as easily be that country like

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.330 
just as easily be that country like
Haiti<00:01:40.480> that<00:01:41.110> needs<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.500> help<00:01:41.650> everyone<00:01:42.040> needs

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
Haiti that needs to help everyone needs

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.800 
Haiti that needs to help everyone needs
to<00:01:42.400> get<00:01:42.550> involved<00:01:42.760> do<00:01:43.000> what<00:01:43.120> they<00:01:43.210> can<00:01:43.270> does

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810
