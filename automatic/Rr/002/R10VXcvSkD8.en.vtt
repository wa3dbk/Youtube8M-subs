going look at the rewards here so

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.560 
going look at the rewards here so
obviously<00:01:56.430> Dean<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.090> going<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.450> your

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
obviously Dean is going to be your

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.319 
obviously Dean is going to be your
WrestleMania<00:01:58.170> read<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.829> Randy<00:01:59.790> or<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.149> your

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
WrestleMania read and Randy or in your

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.149 
WrestleMania read and Randy or in your
other<00:02:00.600> WrestleMania<00:02:01.380> read<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.920> then<00:02:02.009> you

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
other WrestleMania read and then you

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.539 
other WrestleMania read and then you
have<00:02:02.340> Seth<00:02:02.670> Rollins<00:02:02.909> on<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.530> side<00:02:04.799> that's

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
have Seth Rollins on on one side that's

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.280 
have Seth Rollins on on one side that's
probably<00:02:06.000> wise<00:02:06.180> because<00:02:06.540> Seth<00:02:06.719> Rollins<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.170> on

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
probably wise because Seth Rollins is on

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.070 
probably wise because Seth Rollins is on
the<00:02:07.469> Randy<00:02:07.710> Orton<00:02:07.979> side<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.429> then<00:02:09.080> Roman

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
the Randy Orton side and then Roman

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.320 
the Randy Orton side and then Roman
reigns<00:02:10.110> on<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.770> other<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.489> that's<00:02:11.730> got<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.239> be

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
reigns on the other so that's got to be

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.790 
reigns on the other so that's got to be
the<00:02:12.480> deciding<00:02:12.840> factor<00:02:12.900> yeah

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the deciding factor yeah

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.250
