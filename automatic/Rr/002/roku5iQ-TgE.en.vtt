00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.729
 so in this video you will see four 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:07.149
 all different make-up proposals 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:09.610
 their 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:13.110
 the only part that remains common to all 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.360
 it's the part of the face 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.029
 as a basis I apply her once again 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.420
 lover's stage on the whole eyelid 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.420
 mobile 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.739
 to then obtain a look of the whole 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.089
 natural and very very simple fresh 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.720
 I'm going to take the blush I have 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:35.390
 used before then this rose 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.710
 very clear and very beautiful strawberry without 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.750
 for the sciences 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.230
 I take a normal tongue brush 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.649
 cat and I'm going to use the blush 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.399
 like a pink eyeshadow then it 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.399
 dab 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.800
 with any white pencil I go to 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:10.030
 mark the tear duct 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:12.520
 in this way I blur it well and go 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.330
 also to emphasize my arch 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.330
 eyebrow 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.439
 in this way the look already appears 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.590
 immediately at first sight much brighter 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.479
 and fresher more rested 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.969
 at this point I take any 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.579
 black pencil and I'm going to intensify the 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:45.210
 internal rhyme of the eye is superior 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:48.259
 that inferior once done this 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.259
 I take the eyelash curler 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.590
 once folded, the time of 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.590
 mascara I use the love theme of 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.570
 essence and I can abound with mascara 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.770
 for kicks we are already kept very light 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.770
 for the rest of the trick 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.120
 once applied the mascara ours 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.569
 the trick is over and then I leave you with 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.569
 fourth 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.300
 we got everyone's fourth look 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.190
 those we have created so far 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.590
 that's what takes the most time because it is 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.360
 however, it is slightly more elaborate 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.000
 very portable for the only school 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.250
 what I advise you to do it if 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.680
 you have a little more time so if you do 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.600
 you are waking up early or if 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.970
 precisely you have time to get ready first 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.280
 to go back to ascom to go to school 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.080
 also this time as a primer use 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.080
 essence live on stage 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.500
 once applied the primer I go to 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:10.060
 take this elf e of the 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.920
 normal line and is the number 10 glam e 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.530
 I go to pick up this 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:20.409
 lighter color than this rose is 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:22.680
 same on the entire upper eyelid 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:28.470
 mine also being in the arcade 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.470
 eyebrows a soft pale pink 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.500
 once this is done with this that is 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.569
 a pretty intense pink with gods 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.920
 purple reflections of a small brush made in 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:50.450
 this way 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.120
 I'll get pink and dedicate myself take 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.630
 a little rose and I dedicate myself to this area 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.930
 so I go to intensify the fold 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.930
 eye 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.690
 a gradient brush I'm going to fade 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.690
 colors 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.080
 to make this look a little bit more 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.460
 intense I'm going to take this black one 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.130
 it has micro glitter though 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.930
 practically not seen with a 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:36.360
 brush slightly pointed and go to 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.760
 mark only a small v in mine 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.360
 eye 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.360
 in this way 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.990
 this point I take the brush from 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:53.150
 fades 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:56.100
 I'm going to make the color less intense 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.270
 so the smoke is good but where it mixes 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.860
 along with the other colors 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.860
 previously applied 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.490
 under the eyebrow arch I use a 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.960
 illuminating I use this that 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.960
 illuminates the gip of the orÃ©al 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.540
 clo faded 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:40.720
 at this point I take the eyeliner in gel 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:43.270
 ds with an eyeliner brush and I go 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.080
 to draw a line to define the 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.080
 upper eyelid 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:58.870
 open comparisons eyeliner in gel also in the 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.870
 my lower rhyme 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.139
 since I don't want an effect too much 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:21.569
 strong gel eyeliner in the line 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.550
 lower I apply it with the brush 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:24.840
 dirt from the liner applied above 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.940
 so I'm not going to dip the 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.220
 I apply this little brush and try to 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.050
 don't make a line too sharp because 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.449
 we don't want the eyes to be too much 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.340
 strong and already a trick anyway a lot 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.500
 decided to be a school trick 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.930
 so you should never overdo it but there 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.910
 serves to give a little definition to the 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.419
 look it's time to bend them 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.419
 eyelashes 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.960
 and now let's move on to the mascara I use 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.500
 this here of maybelline which is the 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.500
 blockbuster 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.240
 once applied the mascara also 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:11.580
 this trick is over we have arrived 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.720
 to the fourth tip of makeup then 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.729
