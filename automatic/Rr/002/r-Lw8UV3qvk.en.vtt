questions<00:00:11.400> but<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:12.090> thought<00:00:12.870> if<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.170> name<00:00:13.349> was

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
questions but I thought if that name was

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.230 
questions but I thought if that name was
way<00:00:13.650> too<00:00:13.710> long<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.429> just<00:00:14.639> changed<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:15.120> to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
way too long so I just changed it to

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.540 
way too long so I just changed it to
getting<00:00:15.509> back<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.900> basics<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:17.400> is

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
getting back to the basics and this is

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.160 
getting back to the basics and this is
part<00:00:18.000> 8<00:00:18.380> server<00:00:19.380> outages<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:21.000> um<00:00:21.270> something

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
part 8 server outages so um something

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.720 
part 8 server outages so um something
that<00:00:22.289> was<00:00:22.380> really<00:00:22.500> annoying<00:00:22.769> for<00:00:23.070> me<00:00:23.100> like

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
that was really annoying for me like

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.950 
that was really annoying for me like
when<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:23.910> first<00:00:24.119> started<00:00:24.269> out<00:00:24.539> with<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> game

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
when I first started out with the game

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.310 
when I first started out with the game
was<00:00:25.920> um<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:27.269> would<00:00:27.660> usually<00:00:27.810> just<00:00:28.080> go<00:00:28.199> around

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
was um I would usually just go around

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.109 
was um I would usually just go around
click<00:00:28.740> all<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.890> houses<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.580> stuff<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:29.970> then

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
click all the houses and stuff and then

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.609 
click all the houses and stuff and then
just<00:00:30.359> keep<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.689> moving<00:00:31.050> on<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.410> didn't<00:00:31.590> have

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
just keep on moving on so I didn't have

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.959 
just keep on moving on so I didn't have
to<00:00:31.740> just<00:00:31.830> sit<00:00:32.099> there<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.430> keep<00:00:32.610> collecting

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
to just sit there and keep collecting

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.420 
to just sit there and keep collecting
all<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.390> money<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.230> just<00:00:34.440> like<00:00:34.620> click<00:00:35.190> and

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
all the money so I just like click and

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.880 
all the money so I just like click and
Ike<00:00:35.610> scroll<00:00:35.969> off<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.570> then<00:00:37.260> sometimes<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
Ike scroll off and then sometimes the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.490 
Ike scroll off and then sometimes the
server<00:00:38.129> would<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:38.550> out<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.629> always<00:00:40.290> used<00:00:40.440> to

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
server would go out so I always used to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.380 
server would go out so I always used to
think<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.860> was<00:00:40.950> losing<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.579> money<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.969> XP

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
think that I was losing that money in XP

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.010 
think that I was losing that money in XP
but<00:00:43.200> um<00:00:43.440> I've<00:00:43.950> actually<00:00:44.160> figured<00:00:44.610> out<00:00:44.730> that

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
but um I've actually figured out that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.250 
but um I've actually figured out that
once<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.680> once<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.309> click<00:00:47.340> on<00:00:47.670> money

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
once you like once you click on money

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.770 
once you like once you click on money
you<00:00:49.260> can't<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.829> can't<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.370> lose<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.870> so<00:00:53.780> see

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
you can't you can't like lose it so see

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.619 
you can't you can't like lose it so see
ya<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.739> um<00:00:55.920> see<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:56.940> wanted<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.329> tell<00:00:57.600> you
