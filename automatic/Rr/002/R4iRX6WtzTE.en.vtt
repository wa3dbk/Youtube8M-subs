00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.620
 piergiorgio caria the director who made a video that we'll see in 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.620
 few that we bring into our studio now 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.150
 this movie has brought us a video in which much has been discussed 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.869
 el sheik ii ​​believes it is an absolutely real movie there are those who say yes 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.410
 is a 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.430
 d art done very well 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.730
 He has made 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.240
 so now we see him together then I want to hear his opinion that 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.320
 teknos trieste beautiful cycling 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.650
 they were thirty of its kind 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.580
 what do you think I can already guess but above all how it is possible that these 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.070
 sightings 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.460
 if they have been found well accepted by one person I see again 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.190
 but within the UFO phenomenon it exists 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.190
 and the phenomenon in the antonio conspiracy desert 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.230
 it took about three years to study his case because obviously 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.300
 to establish the veracity of a case, a video is not sufficient for what 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.490
 can be instrumentally necessary analyzer also 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.220
 investigate his private life knowing his family find the 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.670
 witnesses here too unfortunately for 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.299
 question of time we have not heard - meet everyone then do an investigation 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.920
 all round at 360 degrees with - this specimen on lord has made itself 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.180
 examining is absolutely yes among other things all the love of themes has us 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.310
 absolutely free data did not ask for anything 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.360
 and among other things antonio machado point of view has not been able to manage perhaps well 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.580
 not even his media image, however, in my opinion 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.750
 is a point in favor of the genuineness of the case are in an artifact case between 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.750
 the other is one of the few cases of alternative routes. 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.600
 with other witnesses who saw the same 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.040
 so it is not valid 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.390
 hang yourself perplexity the same way for the bonino. the perspective 8 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.719
 slicer 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.500
 wtf a cake 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.519
 all the places where you move 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.780
 for signed estheticians signed for some time to have signed in the united states 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.410
 activated in argentina where you go or by the way this I have to say ask for 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.050
 chronicle I witnessed three times of sightings in the field 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.219
 duration survey. if trateaza 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.339
 that is, as if this gentleman of the 7 abc born 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:34.229
 I am the only one to whom this is the festival 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:35.999
 one day we were 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.999
 during the investigation evenings journalist monsanto we have 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.859

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.599
 we were eating sour restaurant. he stands up abruptly from the table runs 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.019
 out 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.680
 called us they came out running all around it was about 3am 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.860
 afternoon. clear sky perfectly clear and I said it was on 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.899
 vertical restaurant promessi sposi 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:02.679
 there is no second video chat 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:04.420
 those were always his place 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.270
 if one day this is one of the cases, other times there were other people 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.249
 who filmed on yahoo 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:11.879
 he obviously within dozens of films 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.819
 present the total material tuttalac how it works there are above Milan 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.809
 18 45 of the month of July 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:24.609
 he sees only an object of 7 8 meters but there are also other sky heads 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.969
 walter witnesses have made the photograph is already I have never heard 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.969
 who have photographed an object of this quality 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:36.389
 incredible routes you can tell how he made an invoice since not 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.629
 there are other films of this life is not true because the topological plague 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.999
 it is quite different from the 50s film but not the name of this type ie 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:49.829
 the situation under a cinchello balsam is seven to a quarter a ufo 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.780
 of 7 meters round metal that turns 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.250
 m eteo blog I saw him only Mr. burns seems to me a thing and if his 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.250
 camera varesenews is my friends list on 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:07.059
 if the nose is accessible, if there is one thing, for example in that 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:08.170
 situation said 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.359
 tomorrow at 3 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.759
 it will come maybe it was the case of affections and not only you who were people who 

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:16.759
 they were with him but also someone else sincerely there is not 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.180
 you have tickets, she had always believed smiling, she smiled 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.120
 also brought another action film another movie also discussed 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.419
 it is a story of alien men even the people who are 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.330
 you meet sipar even a base here in Italy yes 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.509
 and that has been documented by some shots made in the southern film 8 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.259
 millimeters should have it follow the original ribbons 1 our origins 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:48.229
 here you see it requires filming is done by mobile phones from 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.780
 pellets and electronic equipment is a speech but when 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.960
 everything stays on a film 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.240
 if the fakes become much more complex in any case 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.960
 there should be a job 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.940
 decidedly different from these, they are even weakened because they used to be 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.309
 turned in 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:08.150
 super 8 9 things like this then 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.150
 she brought us the movie now tells this story 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.839
 and shows us 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:20.639
 ardit radio things from you to this reel at the time yes i love you friendship case we see 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.639
 what is it? 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.300
 direct bachata 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.220
 exactly what could have happened we listened to the two computer scientists 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.240
 what they say is 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.240
 it can be absolutely image 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:50.939
 but the thing we want to know that someone may have had advantages 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:53.270
 economic from this affair 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.639
 but in the field of witnesses with whom autorobots 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:57.909
 way to speak 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:59.360
 absolutely not 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.669
 clearly it is a story that goes back many years 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.490
 completed more or less at the end of the 70s 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.360
 and many people have died or otherwise very old 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.669
 I was told by 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:12.300
 the engineer who was then 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.699
 all bets of 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:17.599
 1300 f was there 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:21.110
 but from the economic point of view of the problems due to the fact of having to 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.550
 buy these quantities of materials 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.949
 that is to say metals, other things too 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:30.189
 huge amounts of fruit so there was a financial commitment to that 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:34.089
 somehow a little disturbed some people who have turned away 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:36.849
 in 1970 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:38.860
 which closes this 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.969
 story but that year another opens while we thank her for it 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:43.550
 theory of being
