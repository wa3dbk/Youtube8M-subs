00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.950
 hello everyone with you fil and this is part 106 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.139
 meinkravt mechanism welcome to 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.470
 I will show you this part 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:18.660
 button that works via bluetooth 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.519
 In general, the button can be called so 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.160
 and I do not know what to call for a long time 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.980
 I thought the name of the button that works 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.039
 on the door and through a few blocks through 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.910
 one or more blocks and in several 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.480
 blocks 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.700
 blocks from the floor that is, it is completely here 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.620
 flat and push the button and here 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.460
 triggered we button the same with 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.150
 the other side 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.630
 let me go through the whole scheme for a second 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.490
 looks like this 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.530
 it is based on the update sensor 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:54.600
 blocks here is the first version of this mechanism 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.000
 that is somehow built don't know well in 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.500
 general here it works but only one 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.379
 One problem is that here instead 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.310
 the diet should be the level of the floor but here 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.440
 redstone here is a comparator here hopper 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.320
 so this option just fall away 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.920
 and based on this built this one 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.960
 schemes concept taken from crowns yes here 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.500
 also on the sensor update blocks and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.720
 Now I will teach you how to do it. 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.720
 first we build a couple of block 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.870
 up and sticky piston set and block 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:37.710
 i.e. block upon activation upon activation 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.870
 here's a sticky signal 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.200
 the piston will lower and ignite 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.420
 redstone that's what it means 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.110
 on the sensor update blocks here we have 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.950
 there is a button in in one block from it we 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.530
 click but nothing works 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.540
 why doesn't it work because 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.530
 here you need to put circular blocks 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.369
 so here put a comparator and to 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.170
 him two harper they should be 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.780
 aim at each other and put in there 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.849
 one now with a comparator 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.370
 reads it all it all goes here 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.440
 so here and there and here comparator 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.580
 it all reads it as if 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.790
 the clock generator is kind 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.980
 Now we put a redstone here and in general 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.810
 that will be the way yes 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.790
 what about the block here 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.910
 use the block here 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.620
 exactly not trying down such a thing 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.430
 write object because 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.590
 and I return the piston to her because he 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.020
 gives more signal and the diet comes 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.130
 more than you need and that's 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.070
 create such an update sensor 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.810
 blocks at which the piston is updated 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.990
 as soon as 1 st he changes his 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.110
 your signal from zero but 1 that is, well 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:02.100
 Here is a block update sensor 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:10.800
 Now you can build a floor here it will be 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:16.200
 floor yes and here's the floor and in short our door she 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:18.720
 will be well in two blocks from the button 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.550
 why are we 2 and not in one, let's say too 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.230
 I think everything should work now 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:28.110
 will explain 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:32.489
 now we take the door put here 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.060
 and in general, lay me a little bit like 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.540
 usually 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:41.940
 stone we put here right here with us 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:47.310
 there is even something wrong 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:50.280
 we put and here so here that is here 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.000
 so our door is activated and it immediately 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.950
 well-powered, well off 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.830
 torch and as soon as this is served 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.170
 the signal is now as soon as the signal is given 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.959
 this torch turns off this turns on 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.620
 the signal is activated but why 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.170
 after all in two blocks in one it is impossible 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.450
 I'll show you if you put the door to 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:18.750
 one block, then two kilos will have to put 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:21.359
 here we put a second put damn 4 dumb 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:26.010
 put here a torch here a block here 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:28.320
 torch here we press the button all activates 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.340
 but as you see the door closes why 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.810
 it happens 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.570
 when the door opens this torch 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.900
 ignites and he activates the hopper he 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.330
 stops feeding the subject back and forth and 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.430
 the comparator stops and in general 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.530
 sensor update block turns off here 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.320
 such a problem occurs this problem 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.479
 You can decide but now I will show you how 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.840
 solve this problem but how would such 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:54.900
 the way our scheme gets wider 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.350
 a little bit you can put a hopper 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:02.940
 here and then the whole scheme will be completely 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:08.100
 work here so now show 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:11.340
 show sang show now show so 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.620
 we take here a bucket of lava we lay down well 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.740
 with water what is not trying it 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.500
 maybe a plate it may not be 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.870
 I know the bucket stacks well , something in 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.060
 general now everything works for us but how 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.220
 you see the scheme increased slightly in 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.370
 width because hopper here but in 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.160
 In general, this is not a problem. 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.889
 you have a choice either to make yourself 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.560
 door which will be in one block from 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.220
 buttons if you have a small one 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:45.690
 the width of the wall through which you have to go 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:47.970
 either but in this case you have 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:51.720
 there will be more mechanism under the floor 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.639
 hidden but how would you if after you have 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.180
 there are no steps down that door 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.919
 you can use this circuit and safely 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.080
 If you have then some stairs there 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.750
 you don't want the scheme to be wider than new 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.970
 wide wide wall so you can 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.580
 insert two blocks here is such a mechanism 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.010
 as if immediately with this mechanism 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:14.550
 know learn a few so 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:18.979
 Minecraft tricks in the first place well this is me 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.700
 already long ago knew this standard 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:25.200
 clock generator 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:27.479
 he gives the signal to as you see but here 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.550
 on one block but you can put 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:32.030
 repeater and then it will serve 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:36.840
 normal signal and principle 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:39.860
 signal that's how you see it works here 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:44.850
 that is, the clock generator is good 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:46.580
 now you can still know such 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:50.720
 the truth 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:53.520
 truth in what i expire i tell truth 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.199
 about sensor update blocks but this is you 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:00.449
 and so you know in general on this all 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:03.330
 such a small small 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:05.150
 mechanism but it is very useful to call her 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.610
 can bluetooth or 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:13.590
 radio button or button on 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:16.050
 I don't know the radio control in general 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:20.210
 magic button in general and on this 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.210
 all everyone thanks for watching all bye
