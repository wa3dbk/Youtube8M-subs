cable which is nice very high quality
cables<00:00:54.030> by<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.660> way<00:00:54.980> you<00:00:55.980> get<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> little

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
cables by the way you get a little

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.450 
cables by the way you get a little
instruction<00:00:56.879> manual<00:00:57.690> here<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> speaker

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
instruction manual here and the speaker

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.020 
instruction manual here and the speaker
itself<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:01.020> supposed<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> be<00:01:01.800> designed<00:01:02.030> after

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
itself is supposed to be designed after

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.579 
itself is supposed to be designed after
an<00:01:03.120> elephant's<00:01:03.660> trunk<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:04.170> was<00:01:04.379> what

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
an elephant's trunk that was what

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.289 
an elephant's trunk that was what
inspired<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.460> design<00:01:05.640> here<00:01:06.180> and

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
inspired the design here and

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.890 
inspired the design here and
consequently<00:01:07.670> this<00:01:08.670> really<00:01:09.090> does<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.600> some

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
consequently this really does have some

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.359 
consequently this really does have some
acoustic<00:01:09.990> properties<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:11.070> are<00:01:11.159> pretty

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
acoustic properties that are pretty

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.310 
acoustic properties that are pretty
pretty<00:01:11.939> amazing<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:12.659> such<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> small<00:01:13.290> little

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
pretty amazing for such a small little

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.429 
pretty amazing for such a small little
speaker<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:14.909> speaker<00:01:14.939> measures<00:01:15.330> about<00:01:16.049> two

about three and a half inches tall it's
actually<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.890> steel<00:01:23.340> construction<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.479> has

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659
