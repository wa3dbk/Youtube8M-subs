00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.529
 one of Latin America in this video les 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.690
 I'm going to talk about the third part of 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.830
 cellular respiration called chain 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.259
 respiratory 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.080
 the respiratory chain where 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.529
 develops in the membrane 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.300
 internal obviously of the mitochondria 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.059
 because because in this inner membrane 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.289
 there are anchored proteins that contain 

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:32.289
 some molecules called 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.289
 transporters 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:40.149
 transporters whose specific name 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.149
 they are cited chromos 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.780
 these chromos sites are formed by 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.000
 iron atoms well what are they for? 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.430
 these cards have been these 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.170
 iron atoms remember the 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.589
 electrons that come from the cycle of 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:01.119
 krebs we can do this cycle of krebs 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:05.409
 electrons and your electrons were released 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:07.090
 they were accepted as much by nothing as by 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.270
 by the fap 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.569
 yes what happened are given or driven 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.670
 just this group of 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:17.920
 transporters that constitute this 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.080
 respiratory chain because the greater 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.479
 part of the glucose energy resides 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.049
 now in these transporters or in 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:29.120
 these electron sectors which is what 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:32.110
 which makes iron iron 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.170
 by accepting and releasing alternately 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.030
 electrons until they are transferred to a 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.110
 next cytochrome that is in 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.420
 a lower level then they will get 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.650
 in the end 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:52.700
 that are going to allow them to join with 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:56.299
 hydrogen to oxygen to form water 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.049
 which is a product of respiration 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.570
 cellular well and obviously it's going to 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.159
 generate a lot of atp like 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.649
 this respiratory chain is formed and 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.039
 How is this process happening? 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.470
 I'm going to show in one in a scheme that 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.209
 I got notice easy to interpret 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.750
 we have the inner membrane of the 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.310
 mitochondria at this point with the 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.590
 proteins and transporters the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.739
 outer membrane and in the middle we have 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.489
 the space will intervene look we have 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.230
 four complexes because the chain 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.540
 respiratory is how it is formed by 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.459
 four complexes that go on giving 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.049
 they go let's say in a linear way 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:42.319
 in the inner membrane then look 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:47.239
 the electrons enter 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:51.290
 to complex 1 and then this complex 1 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.340
 that it's going to release electrons that go 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.670
 to pass 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.250
 say the complex 2 through 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.680
 coenzyme which is what is here 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.680
 then 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.769
 what happens is that the electrons go 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.140
 to go through complex 3 does the 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.530
 cytochrome c 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.330
 and the cytochrome tea are going to move to another 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.300
 chrome site that is in complex 4 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:23.810
 that this writing chrome to then 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.690
 through two protons that 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.850
 find in this place in the matrix it 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.520
 they're going to bind those electrons to oxygen 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.120
 more those two protons to form what 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.010
 is one of the products that is water 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.800
 that is to say that these electrons go 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.530
 going through all the quoted trading cards 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.270
 all the complexes until you reach 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.750
 join oxygen and gates to 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.240
 form the water but look for a detail 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.180
 also each of these complexes 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.060
 acts as a proton pump that 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.550
 means a proton pump that are 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.570
 proton transporters forming a 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:06.080
 gradient a gradient let's say but 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:09.230
 tonic and notice that in the complex one 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.150
 they move from the matrix to the 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.490
 space will intervene and always 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.860
 will happen in this sense note that 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.590
 this transport four protons in the 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:22.070
 complex 3 are also transported 4 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.010
 protons and in complex 4 also 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:29.660
 but so I hope this case 2 until in 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.250
 total for a sequence let's say to pass 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.570
 the electrons with the four complexes 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:38.120
 about 10 protons are transported 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.370
 we are going to see what will happen with these 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.440
 protons that accumulate in the 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.670
 summer internet space but what 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.600
 I want you to be clear on this 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.910
 video is that those electrons that were 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.130
 accepted by the fad and by nothing are going to 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.720
 go through all this series of 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.790
 conveyors for this series of 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.280
 cytochrome located in the complexes of 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:02.060
 the inner mitochondrial membrane for 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.580
 than to transfer this energy to 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.370
 that the oxygen that is incorporated 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.910
 obviously to the cell to join two 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:14.030
 protons and form water and also by 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.910
 this electronic movement are going to go 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.340
 passing protons from the matrix towards 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.380
 the internal space to form a 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.510
 proton accumulation that in the 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.410
 next video let's see what happens with 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.410
 these protons 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.390
 educational I recommend the following 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.390
 videos so you can keep learning
