00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
bothered to use it and so I'm having to

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.000 
bothered to use it and so I'm having to
narrate<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.880> over<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.390> though<00:00:22.380> i'm<00:00:22.769> not

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
narrate to over this though i'm not

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.590 
narrate to over this though i'm not
using<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.430> script<00:00:23.670> or<00:00:23.850> anything<00:00:24.240> i'm<00:00:24.390> just

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
using a script or anything i'm just

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.290 
using a script or anything i'm just
talking<00:00:25.470> off<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.619> cuff<00:00:25.830> anyway<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:26.550> I'm<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.240> I

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
talking off the cuff anyway so I'm so I

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.820 
talking off the cuff anyway so I'm so I
guess<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.599> won't<00:00:27.720> be<00:00:27.840> too<00:00:28.199> much<00:00:28.349> different

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
that's ever going to make it enjoyable

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.210 
that's ever going to make it enjoyable
is<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.120> Luke<00:01:03.570> share<00:01:03.840> points<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.719 
effort whereas right now I mean it'sit's
reward<00:01:12.479> less<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.470> pointless<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.310> me

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729

from
gained<00:02:13.830> from<00:02:14.220> as<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.489> result<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:16.670> don't<00:02:17.670> want<00:02:17.790> to

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
gained from as a result I don't want to

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.570 
gained from as a result I don't want to
spoil<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.569> so<00:02:19.050> what<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.470> will<00:02:19.590> say<00:02:19.739> is<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.190> I

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
spoil it so what I will say is that I

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.940 
spoil it so what I will say is that I
have<00:02:21.209> spent<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.660> rest<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.140> day<00:02:22.349> at<00:02:22.590> necks

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
have spent the rest of the day at necks

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.940 
have spent the rest of the day at necks
I<00:02:23.569> have<00:02:24.569> been<00:02:24.840> getting<00:02:25.080> drops<00:02:25.560> pretty

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
I have been getting drops pretty

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.270 
I have been getting drops pretty
frequently<00:02:26.840> about<00:02:27.840> fifty<00:02:28.260> percent<00:02:28.290> seemed<00:02:29.069> to

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
frequently about fifty percent seemed to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.000 
frequently about fifty percent seemed to
go<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.640> me<00:02:30.000> which<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.720> bit<00:02:31.080> which<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.830> bit

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
go to me which is a bit which is a bit

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.030 
go to me which is a bit which is a bit
annoying<00:02:32.130> i<00:02:32.550> guess<00:02:32.790> because<00:02:33.319> obviously<00:02:34.319> that

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
annoying i guess because obviously that

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.070 
annoying i guess because obviously that
means<00:02:35.310> I've<00:02:35.700> got<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.880> fifty<00:02:36.269> percent<00:02:36.540> chance<00:02:36.810> of

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
means I've got a fifty percent chance of

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.979 
means I've got a fifty percent chance of
losing<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:38.130> drop<00:02:38.780> unfortunately<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:39.810> just

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
losing the drop unfortunately I just

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.050 
losing the drop unfortunately I just
don't<00:02:40.230> think<00:02:40.470> positively<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.310> have<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.940> think

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
don't think positively I have to think

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.539 
don't think positively I have to think
negatively<00:02:42.599> and<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.110> is<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.769> is<00:02:43.950> really<00:02:44.370> it

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
negatively and that is that is really it

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.420 
negatively and that is that is really it
because<00:02:44.849> obviously<00:02:45.720> if<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.560> miss<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:46.799> drop<00:02:47.069> or

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
because obviously if I miss a drop or

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.130 
because obviously if I miss a drop or
then<00:02:47.670> that's<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:49.819> also<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:51.030> horrible<00:02:51.959> thing

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
then that's it also the horrible thing

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.380 
then that's it also the horrible thing
about<00:02:52.319> next<00:02:52.799> is<00:02:52.950> some<00:02:53.579> of<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.760> drops<00:02:54.000> are<00:02:54.180> just

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
about next is some of the drops are just

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.960 
about next is some of the drops are just
worth<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:54.930> much<00:02:54.989> that<00:02:55.530> can<00:02:55.709> drain<00:02:56.040> your<00:02:56.069> LSP<00:02:56.760> so

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
worth so much that can drain your LSP so

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.509 
worth so much that can drain your LSP so
quickly<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:58.440> are<00:02:58.590> drops<00:02:58.799> I've<00:02:59.010> been<00:02:59.220> getting

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
quickly so are drops I've been getting
