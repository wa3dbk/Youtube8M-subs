name colors in transformers fall of

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.139 
name colors in transformers fall of
Cybertron<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.160> that's<00:00:47.399> actually<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.850> pretty

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
Cybertron so that's actually a pretty

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.540 
Cybertron so that's actually a pretty
easy<00:00:48.270> thing<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.500> would<00:00:50.219> not<00:00:50.430> have

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
easy thing to do I would not have

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.310

immediately have known about it if it

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.170 
immediately have known about it if it
wasn't<00:00:52.620> for<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:52.949> mungry<00:00:53.309> actually<00:00:53.730> telling<00:00:54.059> me

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
teammates will have blue lights if you

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.420 
teammates will have blue lights if you
boost<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:16.110> get<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> bluish<00:01:17.070> greenish

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
so that can be a little bit confusing if

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.740 
so that can be a little bit confusing if
you<00:02:16.830> are<00:02:17.310> getting<00:02:18.090> used<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.510> know<00:02:18.600> the

you are getting used to you know the
default<00:02:19.050> setting<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.590> change<00:02:19.890> over

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
default setting and you change over

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.400 
default setting and you change over
because<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.420> know<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.600> see<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.050> guy<00:02:22.380> run

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
because you know you see a guy run

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.110 
because you know you see a guy run
around<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.920> corner<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.280> he<00:02:23.459> has<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.580> red<00:02:23.880> name

around a corner and he has a red name

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.760 
around a corner and he has a red name
you<00:02:24.390> want<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.630> shoot<00:02:24.810> at<00:02:24.959> him<00:02:25.080> but<00:02:25.319> if<00:02:25.590> you're

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
you want to shoot at him but if you're

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.949 
you want to shoot at him but if you're
going<00:02:26.040> with<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.400> color<00:02:26.640> scheme<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:27.750> might

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
going with this color scheme that might

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.750 
going with this color scheme that might
be<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.140> friendly<00:02:28.620> if<00:02:28.890> you're<00:02:29.130> on<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.400> Autobot

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
be a friendly if you're on the Autobot

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.310 
be a friendly if you're on the Autobot
team<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.120> know<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.360> purple<00:02:30.780> ones<00:02:30.990> would<00:02:31.290> be

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
team you know the purple ones would be

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.140 
team you know the purple ones would be
the<00:02:31.470> one<00:02:31.709> used<00:02:31.950> you'd<00:02:32.400> have<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.790> watch<00:02:32.940> out<00:02:33.120> for

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
the one used you'd have to watch out for

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.870 
the one used you'd have to watch out for
so<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.320> was<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.500> little<00:02:34.770> bit<00:02:35.010> confusing<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.580> me

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
so that was a little bit confusing to me

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.120 
so that was a little bit confusing to me
but<00:02:36.209> luckily<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.690> made<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.290> change<00:02:37.590> way<00:02:37.920> back

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
but luckily I made this change way back

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.710 
but luckily I made this change way back
when<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.400> first<00:02:38.700> started<00:02:38.880> playing<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.450> demo

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
when I first started playing the demo

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.720 
when I first started playing the demo
you<00:02:40.020> know<00:02:40.380> like<00:02:40.590> my<00:02:40.739> third<00:02:41.040> or<00:02:41.190> fourth<00:02:41.459> match

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
you know like my third or fourth match

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.550 
you know like my third or fourth match
in<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.330> I've<00:02:42.510> actually<00:02:42.720> grown<00:02:43.170> more

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
in so I've actually grown more

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.590 
in so I've actually grown more
accustomed<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.280> setting<00:02:44.670> than<00:02:45.420> the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
accustomed to this setting than the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.900 
accustomed to this setting than the
default<00:02:45.989> one<00:02:46.170> I'll<00:02:46.530> switch<00:02:46.830> over<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.489> the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
default one I'll switch over to the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.570 
default one I'll switch over to the
Decepticons<00:02:48.840> here<00:02:49.200> real<00:02:49.410> quick<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.400> can

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
see the the purple lights and if we will

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.250
