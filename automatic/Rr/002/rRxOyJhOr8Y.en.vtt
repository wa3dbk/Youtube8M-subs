00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
Children's Hospital in Oakland and then

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.730 
Children's Hospital in Oakland and then
he<00:02:23.730> was<00:02:23.850> not<00:02:24.000> allowed<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.270> go<00:02:24.630> back<00:02:25.200> because

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
he was not allowed to go back because

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.580 
he was not allowed to go back because
his<00:02:26.670> father<00:02:27.030> was<00:02:27.540> getting<00:02:27.690> threats<00:02:28.260> from

his father was getting threats from
Iraqi<00:02:29.040> insurgents<00:02:29.900> they<00:02:30.900> figured<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.350> he

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
Iraqi insurgents they figured that he

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.310 
Iraqi insurgents they figured that he
must<00:02:31.590> be<00:02:31.800> an<00:02:31.890> American<00:02:32.280> spy<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:33.090> they<00:02:33.900> were<00:02:33.959> not

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
must be an American spy so they were not

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.560 
must be an American spy so they were not
able<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.650> return<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.190> Iraq<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.760> they<00:02:36.270> ended<00:02:36.450> up

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
able to return to Iraq and they ended up

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.540 
able to return to Iraq and they ended up
staying<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:36.990> America<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:37.980> continued<00:02:38.520> to

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
staying in America so I continued to

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.490 
staying in America so I continued to
follow<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:39.209> journey<00:02:39.540> as<00:02:41.209> Salah<00:02:42.500> learned

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500
