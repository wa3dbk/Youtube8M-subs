up<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.850> speculation<00:01:30.570> I'm<00:01:30.750> gonna<00:01:30.869> say<00:01:31.020> two

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
up to speculation I'm gonna say two

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.140 
up to speculation I'm gonna say two
ninety-eight<00:01:31.470> percent<00:01:31.619> confirmed<00:01:32.159> as<00:01:32.880> many

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
ninety-eight percent confirmed as many

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.670

people<00:01:33.360> do<00:01:33.509> love<00:01:33.630> zombies<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.079> really<00:01:34.409> do<00:01:34.530> think

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
people do love zombies I really do think

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.960 
people do love zombies I really do think
this<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.979> good<00:01:35.100> way<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.250> activation<00:01:35.700> make

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
this is a good way for activation make

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.969 
this is a good way for activation make
money<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:37.049> does<00:01:37.170> make<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.350> lot<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.530> sense<00:01:37.650> but

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
money so it does make a lot of sense but

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.800
