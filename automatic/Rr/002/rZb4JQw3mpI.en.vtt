00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.490 

once<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.270> vehicle<00:01:34.450> is<00:01:34.689> structurally<00:01:35.170> sound

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
once the vehicle is structurally sound

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.179 
once the vehicle is structurally sound
and<00:01:35.890> moves<00:01:36.280> forward<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:38.259> next<00:01:38.439> age<00:01:38.710> this

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
and moves forward to the next age this

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.460 
and moves forward to the next age this
is<00:01:39.250> an<00:01:39.490> all-aluminum<00:01:40.180> side<00:01:40.390> panel<00:01:40.810> that<00:01:41.259> means

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
is an all-aluminum side panel that means

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.400 
is an all-aluminum side panel that means
OA<00:01:41.680> or<00:01:42.220> corrosion

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
OA or corrosion

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.200 
OA or corrosion
in<00:01:44.680> addition<00:01:45.070> to<00:01:45.190> that<00:01:45.340> you<00:01:45.610> see<00:01:45.820> here<00:01:46.000> with

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
in addition to that you see here with

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.730 
in addition to that you see here with
framing<00:01:46.420> out<00:01:46.690> for<00:01:46.930> a<00:01:46.960> window<00:01:47.320> that<00:01:47.440> will<00:01:47.560> go

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
framing out for a window that will go

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:58.399 
framing out for a window that will go
into<00:01:47.920> this<00:01:48.160> vehicle

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.280 

so<00:01:59.409> at<00:01:59.560> this<00:01:59.710> point<00:01:59.950> here<00:02:00.369> you<00:02:00.580> can<00:02:01.390> see<00:02:01.689> that

as<00:05:48.350> we<00:05:48.560> make<00:05:48.740> our<00:05:48.890> way<00:05:48.950> forward<00:05:49.370> you'll<00:05:50.150> see

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
as we make our way forward you'll see

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.560 
as we make our way forward you'll see
here<00:05:50.840> that<00:05:51.020> electrical<00:05:51.800> harness

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
here that electrical harness

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.720 
here that electrical harness
so<00:05:54.050> at<00:05:54.170> this<00:05:54.320> stage<00:05:54.380> you<00:05:55.130> can<00:05:55.190> see<00:05:55.460> that<00:05:55.610> the

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
so at this stage you can see that the

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.300 
so at this stage you can see that the
braces<00:05:55.970> are<00:05:56.300> put<00:05:56.480> in<00:05:56.830> you<00:05:57.830> can<00:05:57.860> see<00:05:58.160> that

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
braces are put in you can see that

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.070 
braces are put in you can see that
there's<00:05:58.490> a<00:05:58.550> brace<00:05:58.730> for<00:05:58.910> them<00:05:59.030> on<00:05:59.150> this<00:05:59.300> side<00:05:59.540> it

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
there's a brace for them on this side it

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.480 
there's a brace for them on this side it
also<00:06:00.230> see<00:06:00.500> that<00:06:00.620> the<00:06:00.740> electrical<00:06:01.190> harness

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
also see that the electrical harness

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.030 
also see that the electrical harness
here<00:06:01.700> has<00:06:02.360> been<00:06:02.480> put<00:06:02.690> into<00:06:02.840> place<00:06:03.110> again<00:06:03.590> all

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
here has been put into place again all

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.270 
here has been put into place again all
color-coordinated<00:06:05.710> the<00:06:06.710> part<00:06:06.980> that's<00:06:07.160> been

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
color-coordinated the part that's been

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.860 
color-coordinated the part that's been
put<00:06:07.520> in<00:06:07.670> so<00:06:08.000> we<00:06:08.060> have<00:06:08.180> new<00:06:08.330> carpet<00:06:08.750> to<00:06:08.840> the
