sure existed sure thanks Roy the hard
system<00:00:38.370> was<00:00:38.520> really<00:00:38.730> developed<00:00:38.879> many<00:00:39.360> years

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
system was really developed many years

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.930 
system was really developed many years
ago<00:00:39.750> because<00:00:40.500> when<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:41.010> would<00:00:41.309> run<00:00:41.579> rare

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
ago because when I would run rare

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.639 
ago because when I would run rare
detectors<00:00:42.420> on<00:00:42.600> my<00:00:42.750> bikes<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.260> really<00:00:43.500> had<00:00:43.620> a

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
detectors on my bikes I really had a

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.830 
detectors on my bikes I really had a
hard<00:00:43.860> time<00:00:43.980> seeing<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.000> hearing<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.450> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
hard time seeing it and hearing it and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.510 
hard time seeing it and hearing it and
it's<00:00:46.020> nice<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> ray<00:00:46.890> detector<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.370> your

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
it's nice to have a ray detector on your

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.340 
it's nice to have a ray detector on your
bike<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:47.969> can't<00:00:48.360> don't<00:00:48.870> know<00:00:48.960> what's<00:00:49.140> going

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
bike but can't don't know what's going

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.619 
bike but can't don't know what's going
off<00:00:49.500> its<00:00:49.800> really<00:00:50.039> kind<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.280> useless<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:51.420> after

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
off its really kind of useless so after

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.900 
off its really kind of useless so after
running<00:00:52.140> wires<00:00:52.500> up<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.829> my<00:00:52.949> helmet<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.340> using

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
running wires up to my helmet and using

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.540 
running wires up to my helmet and using
you<00:00:54.360> know<00:00:54.420> earplugs<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.890> really<00:00:56.070> got<00:00:56.160> sore

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
you know earplugs that really got sore

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.580 
you know earplugs that really got sore
after<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> lot<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.510> time<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.020> many<00:00:58.199> times<00:00:58.410> at

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
after a lot of time and many times at

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.229 
after a lot of time and many times at
higher<00:00:58.770> speed<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.520> really<00:00:59.789> couldn't<00:00:59.910> hear

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
higher speed just really couldn't hear

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.360 
higher speed just really couldn't hear
it<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.840> developed<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.410> wireless<00:01:01.890> system<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
it we developed a wireless system and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.429 
it we developed a wireless system and
the<00:01:02.430> wireless<00:01:02.670> system<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.390> really<00:01:03.600> made<00:01:04.229> up<00:01:04.320> of

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the wireless system is really made up of

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.770 
the wireless system is really made up of
just<00:01:04.470> two<00:01:05.010> components<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.299> miniature

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
just two components it's a miniature

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.050 
just two components it's a miniature
transmitter<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.920> simply<00:01:08.250> plugs<00:01:08.610> into<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
transmitter that simply plugs into a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.390 
transmitter that simply plugs into a
radar<00:01:09.450> detector<00:01:09.479> then<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> miniature

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
radar detector then you have a miniature

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.460 
radar detector then you have a miniature
battery<00:01:11.850> operated<00:01:12.210> receiver<00:01:12.600> that's<00:01:13.110> inside

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
battery operated receiver that's inside

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.310 
battery operated receiver that's inside
the<00:01:13.619> helmet<00:01:13.799> once<00:01:14.790> installed<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:16.020> very

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
the helmet once installed it's very

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.890 
the helmet once installed it's very
inconspicuous<00:01:16.939> it's<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.180> just<00:01:18.270> right<00:01:18.600> there

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
inconspicuous it's it's just right there

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.320 
inconspicuous it's it's just right there
in<00:01:19.020> your<00:01:19.049> peripheral<00:01:19.560> vision<00:01:19.700> you<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:21.119> have

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
in your peripheral vision you can have

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.880 
in your peripheral vision you can have
it<00:01:21.450> off<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.780> side<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.500> put<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.830> in

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
transmitter also you're a little setup

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.850 
transmitter also you're a little setup
here<00:03:26.630> because<00:03:26.989> it's<00:03:27.140> kind<00:03:27.320> of<00:03:27.350> very<00:03:27.410> unique

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
here because it's kind of very unique

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.330 
here because it's kind of very unique
yeah<00:03:28.340> yeah<00:03:28.790> this<00:03:29.180> is<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.450> this<00:03:30.260> is<00:03:30.320> a<00:03:30.530> system

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
yeah yeah this is a this is a system

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.120 
yeah yeah this is a this is a system
that<00:03:31.640> i<00:03:31.700> use<00:03:31.940> as<00:03:32.600> some<00:03:33.350> people<00:03:33.590> like<00:03:33.709> a<00:03:33.860> little

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
that i use as some people like a little

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.620 
that i use as some people like a little
bit<00:03:34.220> of<00:03:34.310> overkill<00:03:34.610> but<00:03:35.060> i<00:03:35.150> kind<00:03:35.390> of<00:03:35.450> have<00:03:35.600> a

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
bit of overkill but i kind of have a
