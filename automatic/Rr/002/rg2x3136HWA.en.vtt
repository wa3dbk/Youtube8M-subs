00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 Hi everyone guys are welcome ara 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.480
 in this new video 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.429
 today we will see a new custom of mine 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.150
 cassin money from the animated series of 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.730
 batman 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.650
 this time we have a villa the enemy 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.440
 which is not on the list of enemies 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.680
 created by the kenner or cio from the caen 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.660
 the ninja one of the most dangerous enemies 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.240
 of batman coming from the series 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.920
 animated the bets where this was 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.449
 ninja really impressed me a 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.279
 lot when I was little because 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.619
 they could really make it a 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.870
 dangerous character with this katana 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.730
 ninja weapons was also one of the few 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.860
 who could beat Bruce Wayne from 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.690
 young then we go to see a little 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.790
 how I made this custom 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.129
 first of all let's start from the base you can 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.260
 see very well that the base is one of the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.539
 classic batman than ruined ones 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.680
 simini when I was little, of course 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.760
 to make the ninja has filed 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.850
 sanded to the ears of batman 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.489
 also all these tips the belt 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.410
 also and I tried to animate also of the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.960
 relief of the boots the relief of the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.060
 collar as best as I could anyway 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.490
 without ruining the feature let's go to 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.729
 see the ninja now let's see a little bit in the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.430
 detail here is the face is realized 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.080
 with a few scat above the head of 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.299
 batman with filed ears 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.610
 of course and so I created the 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.890
 hood of the ninja to the best that they are 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.229
 managed to do based on images 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.119
 found on the internet of course are 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.150
 managed to give pretty well let's say 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.670
 the shape of the ninja's head that was 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.409
 practically very round on the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.509
 upper part then one more post 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.100
 squared on the lower part 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.950
 then of course I made the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.570
 interior painting of rose and eyes 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.090
 I'm 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.450
 designed practically in style 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.130
 kenner who often left me 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.500
 I remember Bruce Wayne going 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.170
 these eyes in fact only with a sign 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.790
 black with no white part and i am 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.520
 quite satisfied with the effect 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.860
 very reminiscent of the Kenner style for the 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.390
 body let's say I adopted the painting 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.700
 matt black 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.100
 if you see some shiny parts why not 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.709
 I saw them when I covered with 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.350
 all matt gloss so I am 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.180
 let it escape then I'll fix it now 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.150
 that I know nothing about it then the body is 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.100
 all black the mimed parts see you see 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.900
 some more the presence of the reliefs 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.660
 but I did my best without it 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.510
 go too deep into the belt 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.580
 as you see made of own fabric 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.140
 in pure style that I managed to 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.880
 I could make it in cloth 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.860
 fabricate on purpose 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.080
 just to give the effect 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.850
 Kenner say so because as you know 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.220
 some parts were of fabric like i 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.790
 cloak for example jackets etc. 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.800
 etc 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.989
 the peculiarity of this belt and that 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.810
 obviously the katana sword and I have 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.610
 always realized me and removable see 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.530
 therefore in ninja it can also be laid 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.030
 without the Catania I don't know what pro though 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.530
 however it can be done 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.690
 let's go see the accessory that has me 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.750
 created more problems for this custom 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.900
 or the katana the katana itself is 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.000
 made by an old katana of itself 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.940
 he will not be mistaken for ariel of the five 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.250
 samurai or rio with white armor 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.049
 obviously I cut it both here and here 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.570
 now all the pieces of that pillon 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.880
 the katana were then lost or recycled 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.180
 at least I use it for something anyway 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.489
 I said the katana to give this color 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.380
 metallic just like it was one 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.200
 real blade used a plastic 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.060
 adhesive metal and adheres 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.190
 quite well however there are some 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.140
 of sally but boys owe me 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.519
 however, it is always a pleasure to satisfy a bit 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.709
 plastic that has joined on one 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.780
 surface is not really painting I do not have 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.610
 wanted to give the painting because it was 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.980
 almost impossible to give this effect 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.880
 you see its metallic maximum 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.770
 both because putting and taking away 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.750
 the blade from the sheath certainly is 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.120
 it would ruin the painting too 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.500
 making it adhere perfectly to some 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.270
 painting always goes away 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.340
 and this is why these 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.870
 accessories are usually made 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.000
 directly with the color of 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.180
 plastic without giving any painting 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.090
 however we continue here the hilt it 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.740
 carved a little bit was a little smaller 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.410
 let's say I managed to make it become 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.360
 a little bigger and moreover the handle 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.790
 I did this painting of this 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.830
 let's say so yellowish color is the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.410
 particularity that I wanted to give that is 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.750
 which has been by necessity more than anything else 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.360
 I covered the handle with tape 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.030
 sticker the very common scotch we say 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.100
 so to prevent damage here too 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.340
 pinti in when I took off and put the 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.130
 sword in the hand of the ninja with you see 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.100
 here around you know there is also one 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.900
 small adhesive plastic strip 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.480
 you have silver in fact lose 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.700
 the silver effect also to the hilt 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.860
 unfortunately I could not make the 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.840
 plastic also around everything else 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.270
 of the hilt I wanted to give the same 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.200
 metallic effect as you can see 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.880
 in the episodes 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.060
 unfortunately it was almost impossible 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.250
 so I gave the silver painting the 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.650
 sheath the future was hard enough 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.290
 to create as I did to create it 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.780
 naturally I put some paper 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.480
 around the sword of the card 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.880
 plasticized and then I carved on it 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.400
 cult pops school then sees inside 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.410
 of the farm still present the card not 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.300
 you can see almost impossible 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.150
 however happy I carved it on with the 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.760
 pop sisca making the best shape 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.740
 of its true and I also had to render it 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.530
 as thin as possible to not make a 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.120
 awkward sheath let's say it made the most 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.370
 a lot has been possible 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.020
 difficult to make it because give the 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.850
 perfect shape was almost impossible 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.220
 in fact it is not that I succeeded 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.510
 just right for wherever I am 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.580
 settle 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.430
 moreover it is a layer of apo 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.290
 xvi very but very thin so it was 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.290
 very difficult to sand from 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.900
 work without it sitting splits 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.240
 so I had to be very careful 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.550
 in fact I made two sheaths the 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.210
 first it was split because it was 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.699
 the first 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.740
 and I was not very careful instead 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.750
 second he managed to make it happen 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.639
 anyway i'm quite satisfied with 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.530
 how this katana came out the 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:10.300
 color quite similar to that of 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.669
 animated series I had to mix a little 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.650
 of colors however it is removed it is put e 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:17.740
 of course the katana can be 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:20.169
 positioned in the hands of the ninja without 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.180
 no problem of course painting 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.979
 which will go away will be on the work of the 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.900
 hand if it will go away and not that of 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:28.509
 katana and this is important though 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.970
 and deco followed in the extremely dangerous ninja 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:33.940
 close icann with his fantastic qatar 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.680
 he is holding the scabbard I put it in 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.509
 this horizontal position because it is 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.639
 just like that keeps him in the series 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:40.720
 animated so I managed to keep it 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:43.000
 in that position 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.130
