so<00:00:00.750> I<00:00:00.780> haven't<00:00:00.960> added<00:00:01.560> any<00:00:01.949> solder<00:00:02.250> I'm<00:00:02.760> just

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
so I haven't added any solder I'm just

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.710 
so I haven't added any solder I'm just
going<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.650> gently<00:00:04.650> warm<00:00:05.069> this<00:00:05.279> up<00:00:05.580> dry<00:00:06.420> out<00:00:06.540> the

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
going to gently warm this up dry out the

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.150 
going to gently warm this up dry out the
flux<00:00:06.990> push<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.589> pieces<00:00:08.010> where<00:00:08.280> they<00:00:08.309> go<00:00:10.160> and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
flux push the pieces where they go and

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
flux push the pieces where they go and
then<00:00:11.550> we'll<00:00:11.759> see<00:00:12.090> if<00:00:12.300> we<00:00:12.480> have<00:00:12.630> enough<00:00:12.929> solder

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.830 

this<00:00:18.180> time<00:00:18.480> I'm<00:00:18.690> just<00:00:18.720> going<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.529> circle<00:00:20.840> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
this time I'm just going to circle the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.290 
this time I'm just going to circle the
granules<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.769> I'm<00:00:23.250> interested<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:23.910> then

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
granules that I'm interested in then

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:34.709 
granules that I'm interested in then
I'll<00:00:24.449> switch<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> other<00:00:25.199> side

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:46.960 

we<00:00:35.260> just<00:00:35.500> watch<00:00:35.739> our<00:00:35.980> flux<00:00:37.350> as<00:00:38.350> usual

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:01:01.170 

flexo<00:00:47.720> go<00:00:47.900> clear<00:00:48.380> and<00:00:49.420> the<00:00:50.420> solder<00:00:50.840> will<00:00:50.870> flow

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:12.820 

switch<00:01:02.180> to<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.450> other<00:01:02.570> side

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.390 

okay<00:01:13.520> we<00:01:13.700> need<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:13.880> quench<00:01:14.390> it<00:01:15.130> pickle<00:01:16.130> it<00:01:16.250> and

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
okay we need to quench it pickle it and

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.300 
okay we need to quench it pickle it and
make<00:01:16.970> sure<00:01:17.180> that<00:01:17.420> all<00:01:17.690> of<00:01:17.990> these<00:01:18.200> are<00:01:18.590> firmly

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
make sure that all of these are firmly

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.600 
make sure that all of these are firmly
attached<00:01:19.910> I<00:01:20.800> wasn't<00:01:21.800> too<00:01:21.920> happy<00:01:21.950> with<00:01:22.460> these

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
attached I wasn't too happy with these

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.930 
attached I wasn't too happy with these
on<00:01:22.850> this<00:01:23.030> end<00:01:23.300> so<00:01:23.600> I<00:01:27.190> put<00:01:28.190> a<00:01:28.400> little<00:01:28.610> piece<00:01:28.910> of

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
on this end so I put a little piece of

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.940 
on this end so I put a little piece of
solder<00:01:29.890> beside<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.100> two<00:01:31.310> balls<00:01:31.550> spacing<00:01:32.270> you

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.060 

just<00:01:36.950> heat<00:01:37.220> it<00:01:37.250> up

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
so now we'll quench it in pickle it take

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.709 
so now we'll quench it in pickle it take
your<00:01:56.560> setting<00:01:56.920> out<00:01:57.039> of<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.250> pickle<00:01:57.689> have<00:01:58.689> a

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
your setting out of the pickle have a

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.109 
your setting out of the pickle have a
look<00:01:58.990> make<00:01:59.679> sure<00:01:59.920> all<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.369> granules<00:02:00.909> are

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
look make sure all of the granules are

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:08.490 
look make sure all of the granules are
attached<00:02:01.509> and<00:02:02.729> we're<00:02:03.729> going<00:02:03.939> to<00:02:04.530> saw<00:02:07.500> around

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
attached and we're going to saw around

00:02:08.500 --> 00:03:02.190 
attached and we're going to saw around
the<00:02:08.739> outside<00:02:09.190> of<00:02:09.220> it<00:02:59.700> so<00:03:00.700> just<00:03:01.269> to<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.599> outside

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
the outside of it so just to the outside

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.039 
the outside of it so just to the outside
of<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.500> granules<00:03:03.160> don't<00:03:03.730> don't<00:03:04.359> nudge<00:03:04.690> the

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
of the granules don't don't nudge the

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.059 
of the granules don't don't nudge the
granules<00:03:06.180> now<00:03:07.180> use<00:03:07.540> your<00:03:07.750> file<00:03:08.049> to<00:03:08.650> tidy<00:03:08.950> up

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
granules now use your file to tidy up

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.089 
granules now use your file to tidy up
the<00:03:09.370> edges<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:10.569> don't<00:03:10.810> have<00:03:11.049> to<00:03:11.290> file<00:03:11.769> in

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
the edges you don't have to file in

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.690 
the edges you don't have to file in
between<00:03:12.609> the<00:03:13.209> little<00:03:13.419> balls<00:03:14.160> it's<00:03:15.160> up<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.519> you

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
between the little balls it's up to you

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.190 
between the little balls it's up to you
how<00:03:16.180> precise<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.959> want<00:03:17.169> it<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.410> look<00:03:19.200> so

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
how precise you want it to look so

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.150 
how precise you want it to look so
there's<00:03:20.440> our<00:03:20.650> setting

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
there's our setting

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.920 
there's our setting
if<00:03:21.389> you<00:03:22.650> want<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:24.579> assaulter<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.090> bail<00:03:25.419> on<00:03:25.690> there

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
if you want to assaulter a bail on there

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.099 
if you want to assaulter a bail on there
and<00:03:26.079> make<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.319> dependent<00:03:27.030> use<00:03:28.030> easy<00:03:28.329> solder<00:03:28.959> if

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
and make a dependent use easy solder if

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.770 
and make a dependent use easy solder if
you<00:03:29.980> want<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.370> solder<00:03:30.760> a<00:03:30.790> ring<00:03:31.060> shank<00:03:31.359> on<00:03:31.599> to

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
you want to solder a ring shank on to

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.009 
you want to solder a ring shank on to
the<00:03:31.900> back<00:03:32.109> use<00:03:32.980> easy<00:03:33.280> solder<00:03:33.910> we<00:03:34.480> don't<00:03:34.720> we

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
the back use easy solder we don't we

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.400 
the back use easy solder we don't we
don't<00:03:35.169> want<00:03:35.319> these<00:03:35.799> to<00:03:36.190> come<00:03:36.760> off<00:03:37.000> yeah<00:03:37.660> so

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
don't want these to come off yeah so

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.610 
don't want these to come off yeah so
this<00:03:38.560> is<00:03:38.739> all<00:03:38.919> hard<00:03:39.190> solder<00:03:39.700> here<00:03:40.620> easy

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
this is all hard solder here easy

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.400 
this is all hard solder here easy
soldier<00:03:42.220> on<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.519> back<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:43.090> then<00:03:44.049> you<00:03:44.230> have<00:03:44.379> a

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
soldier on the back and then you have a

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:51.899 
soldier on the back and then you have a
nice<00:03:44.709> little<00:03:45.099> decorative<00:03:45.760> setting

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.880 

okay<00:03:52.909> I've<00:03:53.030> soldered<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.599> ring<00:03:53.780> shank<00:03:54.109> on<00:03:54.409> and

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
okay I've soldered a ring shank on and

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.390 
okay I've soldered a ring shank on and
I'm<00:03:55.099> going<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.459> use<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:55.700> little<00:03:56.060> punch<00:03:56.569> and<00:03:57.400> I'm

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
I'm going to use a little punch and I'm

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.589 
I'm going to use a little punch and I'm
going<00:03:58.609> to<00:03:58.670> hammer<00:03:58.939> set<00:03:59.329> this<00:04:03.969> we<00:04:04.969> just<00:04:05.239> gently

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
going to hammer set this we just gently

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.629 
going to hammer set this we just gently
work<00:04:05.900> our<00:04:06.079> way<00:04:06.230> around<00:04:06.969> until<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:09.709> bezel<00:04:10.489> is

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
work our way around until the bezel is

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:16.659 
work our way around until the bezel is
completely<00:04:11.389> against<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.870> stone<00:04:15.250> so<00:04:16.250> a<00:04:16.280> little

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
completely against the stone so a little

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.129 
completely against the stone so a little
bit<00:04:16.789> on<00:04:17.440> either<00:04:18.440> side<00:04:18.979> just<00:04:19.370> to<00:04:19.549> hold<00:04:19.759> it<00:04:20.139> make

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
bit on either side just to hold it make

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.140 
bit on either side just to hold it make
sure<00:04:21.350> it<00:04:21.470> doesn't<00:04:21.680> wiggle<00:04:21.979> and<00:04:22.340> then<00:04:22.789> we<00:04:22.970> just

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
sure it doesn't wiggle and then we just

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.830 
sure it doesn't wiggle and then we just
work<00:04:23.389> our<00:04:23.599> way<00:04:23.750> all<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:24.020> way<00:04:24.050> around<00:04:28.840> trying

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
work our way all the way around trying

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:43.480 
work our way all the way around trying
to<00:04:29.960> shift<00:04:30.169> hands<00:04:30.470> so<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:30.830> can<00:04:30.889> see<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:43.280> when

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
to shift hands so you can see and when

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.680 
to shift hands so you can see and when
you<00:04:43.610> get<00:04:43.789> it<00:04:43.940> so<00:04:44.120> that<00:04:44.150> it's<00:04:44.449> completely

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
you get it so that it's completely

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.249 
you get it so that it's completely
against<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:45.500> stone<00:04:46.120> small<00:04:47.120> taps<00:04:47.509> just<00:04:47.900> to

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
against the stone small taps just to

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:54.540 
against the stone small taps just to
make<00:04:48.470> sure<00:04:48.710> that<00:04:49.009> it's<00:04:51.669> nice<00:04:52.669> and<00:04:52.970> smooth<00:04:53.330> and

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
make sure that it's nice and smooth and

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.629 
make sure that it's nice and smooth and
then<00:04:55.550> we'll<00:04:55.760> polish<00:04:56.120> it<00:04:57.070> this<00:04:58.070> is<00:04:58.280> what<00:04:58.460> we're

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
then we'll polish it this is what we're

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.330 
then we'll polish it this is what we're
making<00:04:58.820> a<00:04:59.530> setting<00:05:00.530> that<00:05:00.800> looks<00:05:01.099> like

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
making a setting that looks like

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.039 
making a setting that looks like
granulation<00:05:02.349> only<00:05:03.349> it's<00:05:03.560> soldered
