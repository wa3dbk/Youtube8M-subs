00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.010 
evenly as possible okay I completed the
first<00:01:44.280> coat<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.820> waited<00:01:45.030> about<00:01:45.210> 30<00:01:45.659> minutes

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
first coat and I waited about 30 minutes

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.270 
first coat and I waited about 30 minutes
now<00:01:46.320> I'm<00:01:46.380> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.560> start<00:01:46.680> with<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> second

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
now I'm going to start with the second

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.520 
now I'm going to start with the second
coat<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.729> then<00:01:48.570> I'll<00:01:48.689> start<00:01:48.930> really<00:01:49.290> seeing

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
coat and then I'll start really seeing

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.109 
coat and then I'll start really seeing
the<00:01:49.740> desired<00:01:50.100> effect<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.520> I'm<00:01:50.610> going<00:01:50.909> for

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
the desired effect that I'm going for

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.270 
the desired effect that I'm going for
remember<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.540> mentioned<00:01:51.780> each<00:01:52.350> coat<00:01:52.770> adds<00:01:53.040> a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
remember I mentioned each coat adds a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.530 
remember I mentioned each coat adds a
darker<00:01:53.640> appearance<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> be

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
darker appearance so you have to be

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.880 
darker appearance so you have to be
careful<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.930> how<00:01:55.079> many<00:01:55.259> coats<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.680> really

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890
