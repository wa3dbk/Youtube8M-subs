stretched<00:02:08.679> you<00:02:09.679> might<00:02:09.860> have<00:02:10.009> be<00:02:10.130> as<00:02:10.220> flexible

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
stretched you might have be as flexible

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.370 
stretched you might have be as flexible
in<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.060> beginning<00:02:11.450> so<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:11.930> might<00:02:12.140> be<00:02:12.260> out

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
in the beginning so you might be out

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.229 
in the beginning so you might be out
here<00:02:12.680> just<00:02:13.280> pull<00:02:13.489> it<00:02:13.550> as<00:02:13.670> hard<00:02:13.850> as<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:14.000> can

whatever<00:02:14.600> your<00:02:14.780> flexibility<00:02:15.290> amount<00:02:15.530> is

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
whatever your flexibility amount is

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.290 
whatever your flexibility amount is
that's<00:02:15.980> where<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.280> want<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.489> go<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:16.850> then

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
that's where you want to go and then

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.150 
that's where you want to go and then
every<00:02:17.570> week<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:18.140> want<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.320> try<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.560> get<00:02:18.739> Parker

little bit of a bend the ones being
stretched<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:27.890> then<00:02:28.550> really<00:02:28.760> just<00:02:28.790> crank<00:02:29.239> it

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
yourself boy obviously you should play

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.569 
yourself boy obviously you should play
around<00:02:34.910> with<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.630> angle<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.380> what<00:02:36.950> not<00:02:37.130> till

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
around with the angle and what not till

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.410 
around with the angle and what not till
you<00:02:37.880> feel<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:38.390> stretch<00:02:38.690> in<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.989> right<00:02:39.019> place

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
you feel that stretch in the right place

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.420 
you feel that stretch in the right place
okay<00:02:41.420> so<00:02:41.989> that's<00:02:42.530> how<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:42.769> stretch<00:02:43.100> all

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
okay so that's how you stretch all

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.340 
okay so that's how you stretch all
portions<00:02:43.820> of<00:02:44.120> your<00:02:44.269> deltoid<00:02:44.660> head<00:02:44.840> make<00:02:45.320> sure

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
portions of your deltoid head make sure

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.600 
portions of your deltoid head make sure
that<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:45.739> do<00:02:45.890> this<00:02:46.070> because<00:02:46.280> when<00:02:46.519> you

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
that you do this because when you

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.360 
that you do this because when you
stretch<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.239> makes<00:02:47.720> room<00:02:48.079> for<00:02:48.110> your<00:02:48.890> muscle<00:02:49.220> to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
stretch it makes room for your muscle to

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.140 
stretch it makes room for your muscle to
grow<00:02:49.610> further

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
grow further

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.390 
grow further
so<00:02:50.420> you'll<00:02:50.570> gain<00:02:50.750> more<00:02:51.019> size<00:02:51.320> you<00:02:51.890> also<00:02:52.010> get

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
so you'll gain more size you also get

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.900 
so you'll gain more size you also get
more<00:02:52.610> definition<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:54.519> it's<00:02:55.519> just<00:02:55.760> good<00:02:55.880> for

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
more definition and it's just good for

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.100 
more definition and it's just good for
you<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.239> mean<00:02:56.360> if<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:56.600> don't<00:02:56.780> stretch<00:02:56.959> your
