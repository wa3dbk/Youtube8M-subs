convert word to PowerPoint this is a
very<00:00:05.910> very<00:00:06.210> good<00:00:06.480> tool<00:00:06.690> so<00:00:07.259> firstly<00:00:08.150> basically

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
very very good tool so firstly basically

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.120 
very very good tool so firstly basically
we<00:00:09.300> need<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.570> use<00:00:09.750> these<00:00:10.019> few<00:00:10.230> things<00:00:10.290> which<00:00:10.860> is

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
we need to use these few things which is

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.660 
we need to use these few things which is
this<00:00:11.460> new<00:00:11.790> slide<00:00:12.320> inside<00:00:13.320> slide<00:00:13.769> from<00:00:14.070> outline

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
this new slide inside slide from outline

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.160 
this new slide inside slide from outline
this<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.240> main<00:00:15.480> function<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:16.049> we're

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
this is the main function that we're

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.260 
this is the main function that we're
going<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.350> use<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:16.949> remember<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.699> here<00:00:18.029> and

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
going to use so remember it is here and

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.720 
going to use so remember it is here and
then<00:00:18.930> we're<00:00:19.590> going<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.859> use<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.340> power<00:00:20.550> of

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
then we're going to use the power of

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.300 
then we're going to use the power of
master<00:00:21.510> slide<00:00:21.779> which<00:00:22.380> will<00:00:22.619> change<00:00:22.859> all<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
master slide which will change all the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.730 
master slide which will change all the
layout<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.789> what<00:00:24.000> we<00:00:24.210> want<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:25.050> let's<00:00:25.500> see

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
layout to what we want so let's see

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.740 
layout to what we want so let's see
let's<00:00:26.039> start<00:00:26.250> from<00:00:26.369> scratch<00:00:26.750> new

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
let's start from scratch new

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.900 
let's start from scratch new
