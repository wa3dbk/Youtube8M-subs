our priorities for the diagnosis of

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.350 
our priorities for the diagnosis of
infections<00:02:50.920> I<00:02:51.130> think<00:02:51.459> on<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.640> top<00:02:51.880> for<00:02:52.239> the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
infections I think on the top for the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.470 
infections I think on the top for the
list<00:02:52.540> is<00:02:53.459> CNS<00:02:54.459> infections<00:02:54.489> or<00:02:55.120> central

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
list is CNS infections or central

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.180 
list is CNS infections or central
nervous<00:02:55.690> system<00:02:56.079> infections<00:02:56.590> or<00:02:56.859> otherwise

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
nervous system infections or otherwise

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.309 
nervous system infections or otherwise
you<00:02:57.370> can<00:02:57.489> call<00:02:57.670> them<00:02:57.850> brain<00:02:58.030> infections<00:02:58.600> why

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
you can call them brain infections why

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.979 
you can call them brain infections why
so<00:02:59.590> if<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:00.670> don't<00:03:00.880> diagnose<00:03:01.329> it<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:01.660> properly

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
so if you don't diagnose it and properly

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.400 
so if you don't diagnose it and properly
treat<00:03:02.319> it<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:03.010> can<00:03:03.609> lead<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.880> paralysis

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
treat it it can lead to paralysis
