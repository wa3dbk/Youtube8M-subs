but<00:00:39.820> he<00:00:40.720> got<00:00:40.750> me<00:00:41.110> and<00:00:41.440> then<00:00:42.160> the<00:00:42.280> main<00:00:42.430> I<00:00:42.460> edged

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
but he got me and then the main I edged

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.210 
but he got me and then the main I edged
him<00:00:43.390> out<00:00:43.510> on<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:43.690> start<00:00:44.079> and<00:00:44.320> and<00:00:44.860> he<00:00:45.070> never

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
him out on the start and and he never

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.680 
him out on the start and and he never
really<00:00:45.489> got<00:00:45.520> too<00:00:45.940> close<00:00:46.149> to<00:00:46.300> me<00:00:46.390> in<00:00:46.449> the<00:00:46.510> main<00:00:46.660> I

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
really got too close to me in the main I

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.910 
really got too close to me in the main I
could<00:00:47.019> crash<00:00:47.260> before<00:00:47.500> that<00:00:47.830> happened<00:00:48.190> so

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.509 

I<00:00:53.719> all<00:00:54.719> by<00:00:54.929> myself<00:00:55.109> really<00:00:55.589> just<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.160> they

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
I all by myself really just that they

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.520 
I all by myself really just that they
had<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> gnarly<00:00:57.329> set<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.690> whoops<00:00:57.899> today<00:00:58.170> into<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
had a gnarly set of whoops today into a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.020 
had a gnarly set of whoops today into a
dragon's<00:00:58.980> back<00:00:59.159> the<00:00:59.399> dragon's<00:00:59.730> back<00:00:59.879> was

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
dragon's back the dragon's back was

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.180 
dragon's back the dragon's back was
gnarly<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> whole<00:01:01.559> section<00:01:02.039> was

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
gnarly and just the whole section was

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.920 
gnarly and just the whole section was
probably<00:01:02.489> one<00:01:03.089> of<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.269> hardest<00:01:03.539> sections

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
probably one of the hardest sections

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.800 
probably one of the hardest sections
I've<00:01:04.080> had<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.530> year<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.540> just<00:01:06.540> got<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> little

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
I've had this year and just got a little

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.389 
I've had this year and just got a little
sideways<00:01:07.080> off<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.740> guess<00:01:07.979> they<00:01:08.009> showed

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
sideways off of it I guess they showed

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.940 
sideways off of it I guess they showed
it<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> slow<00:01:08.940> mo<00:01:09.149> on<00:01:09.420> TV<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.440> I<00:01:10.470> can't<00:01:10.830> wait

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
it on the slow mo on TV so I can't wait

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.460 
it on the slow mo on TV so I can't wait
to<00:01:11.070> go<00:01:11.190> back<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.580> check<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.850> out<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:13.350> know

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
to go back and check that out you know

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
to go back and check that out you know
but<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> think<00:01:13.979> I've<00:01:14.430> been<00:01:14.549> ok<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.060> Vince

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
but I think I've been ok but Vince

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.899 
but I think I've been ok but Vince
freeze<00:01:16.409> kind<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.950> landed<00:01:17.220> on<00:01:17.369> me<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.759> he

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
freeze kind of landed on me and he

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.490 
freeze kind of landed on me and he
crashed<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.539> then<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.720> made<00:01:18.869> my<00:01:18.960> brother<00:01:19.200> crash

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
crashed and then I made my brother crash

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.880 
crashed and then I made my brother crash
it<00:01:19.860> was<00:01:19.950> just<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.220> chaos

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.940 

oh<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:25.240> dirt<00:01:25.390> was<00:01:25.570> amazing<00:01:26.200> it<00:01:26.350> was<00:01:26.380> probably

oh the dirt was amazing it was probably

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.310 
oh the dirt was amazing it was probably
the<00:01:27.070> best<00:01:27.310> dirt<00:01:27.460> we've<00:01:27.490> had<00:01:27.790> all<00:01:27.909> year<00:01:27.940> I<00:01:28.630> said

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
the best dirt we've had all year I said

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.350 
the best dirt we've had all year I said
that<00:01:29.470> at<00:01:29.590> any<00:01:29.710> but<00:01:30.010> then<00:01:30.880> it<00:01:31.000> brought<00:01:31.150> it<00:01:31.270> up

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
that at any but then it brought it up

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.210 
that at any but then it brought it up
really<00:01:31.540> bad<00:01:31.780> like<00:01:32.050> tonight<00:01:32.350> it<00:01:32.530> was<00:01:32.680> car

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
really bad like tonight it was car

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.580 
really bad like tonight it was car

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
packed but it was really tacky so I

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.610 
packed but it was really tacky so I
loved<00:01:36.280> it

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.650 

um<00:01:41.620> I<00:01:42.220> guess<00:01:42.580> that's<00:01:42.760> tough<00:01:42.970> i<00:01:43.120> really<00:01:43.390> enjoyed

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
um I guess that's tough i really enjoyed

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.360 
um I guess that's tough i really enjoyed
the<00:01:43.810> track<00:01:44.050> everything<00:01:44.590> was<00:01:44.740> good<00:01:44.890> except<00:01:45.190> for

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
the track everything was good except for

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.370 
the track everything was good except for
the<00:01:45.490> whoops<00:01:46.150> in<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.360> dragon's<00:01:46.690> back<00:01:46.870> and<00:01:47.080> that

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
the whoops in the dragon's back and that

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.750 
the whoops in the dragon's back and that
wasn't<00:01:47.560> even<00:01:47.740> bad<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.100> was<00:01:48.190> just<00:01:48.340> hard<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:48.700> was

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
wasn't even bad it was just hard it was

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.510 
wasn't even bad it was just hard it was
technical<00:01:49.240> but<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.410> they<00:01:50.890> really<00:01:51.190> peaked<00:01:51.400> out

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
technical but the they really peaked out

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.370 
technical but the they really peaked out
