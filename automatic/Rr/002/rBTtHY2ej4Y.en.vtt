00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
have taken out the whole light assembly

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.790 
have taken out the whole light assembly
just<00:00:19.720> to<00:00:19.810> change<00:00:20.020> the<00:00:20.199> bulb<00:00:20.410> and<00:00:20.619> that's

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
just to change the bulb and that's

just to change the bulb and that's
really<00:00:21.750> now<00:00:22.750> that<00:00:22.900> it's<00:00:23.019> a<00:00:23.080> wrong<00:00:23.260> way<00:00:23.500> but

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
really now that it's a wrong way but

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.650 
really now that it's a wrong way but
it's<00:00:23.980> just<00:00:24.160> a<00:00:24.250> lot<00:00:24.430> of<00:00:24.460> unnecessary<00:00:24.820> work<00:00:25.359> for

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
it's just a lot of unnecessary work for

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.210 
it's just a lot of unnecessary work for
no<00:00:26.199> reason

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.349

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
really the only tool that I use is this

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.000 
really the only tool that I use is this
stubby<00:00:36.250> flat-head<00:00:36.640> screwdriver<00:00:37.379> some<00:00:38.379> gloves

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
stubby flat-head screwdriver some gloves

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.590 
stubby flat-head screwdriver some gloves
because<00:00:39.399> you<00:00:39.489> don't<00:00:39.640> wanna<00:00:39.760> make<00:00:39.850> any<00:00:39.910> contact

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
because you don't wanna make any contact

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.840 
because you don't wanna make any contact
with<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:40.899> glass<00:00:41.020> it'll<00:00:41.700> shorten<00:00:42.700> their

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
with the glass it'll shorten their

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.660 
with the glass it'll shorten their
lifespan<00:00:43.329> significantly<00:00:44.070> I'm<00:00:45.070> using<00:00:45.370> these

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
lifespan significantly I'm using these

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.639 
lifespan significantly I'm using these
h13<00:00:47.579> hid<00:00:48.579> attitude<00:00:49.200> go-faster<00:00:50.200> lights<00:00:50.440> I'm

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
h13 hid attitude go-faster lights I'm

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.400 
h13 hid attitude go-faster lights I'm
hoping<00:00:50.950> they<00:00:51.100> get<00:00:51.910> a<00:00:51.969> lot<00:00:52.180> better<00:00:52.410> performance

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
hoping they get a lot better performance

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.619 
hoping they get a lot better performance
having<00:00:53.860> these<00:00:53.949> lights<00:00:54.190> in<00:00:54.370> my<00:00:54.399> truck<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:57.629> think

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
having these lights in my truck I think

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.330 
having these lights in my truck I think
the<00:00:58.870> blue<00:00:59.020> is<00:00:59.050> gonna<00:00:59.260> look<00:00:59.379> good<00:00:59.530> on<00:00:59.590> the<00:00:59.800> blue

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
the blue is gonna look good on the blue

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.549 
the blue is gonna look good on the blue

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
look inside here you'll see there's the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.950 
look inside here you'll see there's the
old<00:01:41.740> light<00:01:42.040> right<00:01:42.280> there<00:01:42.579> no<00:01:43.479> need<00:01:43.659> to<00:01:43.780> take

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
old light right there no need to take

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.700 
old light right there no need to take
out<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.259> housing<00:01:45.869> over<00:01:46.869> here<00:01:47.229> there's<00:01:47.439> a<00:01:47.500> bit

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
out the housing over here there's a bit

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.490 
out the housing over here there's a bit
more<00:01:47.740> over<00:01:48.100> but<00:01:48.369> not<00:01:48.520> much<00:01:49.140> I've<00:01:50.140> already

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
more over but not much I've already

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.980 
more over but not much I've already
taken<00:01:51.250> this<00:01:51.460> apart<00:01:51.759> quickly<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:52.509> it's<00:01:52.689> not<00:01:52.810> all

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
taken this apart quickly so it's not all

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.359 
taken this apart quickly so it's not all
put<00:01:53.290> together<00:01:53.439> as<00:01:53.680> it<00:01:53.829> normally<00:01:54.009> would<00:01:54.220> be

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
put together as it normally would be

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.289 
put together as it normally would be
normally<00:01:54.850> all<00:01:55.750> these<00:01:56.020> clips<00:01:56.790> air<00:01:57.790> filter<00:01:58.149> box

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
normally all these clips air filter box

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.620 
normally all these clips air filter box
assembly<00:01:58.750> would<00:01:58.869> be<00:01:58.960> done<00:01:59.140> up<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.909> just<00:02:01.060> clip

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
assembly would be done up you just clip

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.929 
assembly would be done up you just clip
those<00:02:01.840> off<00:02:03.509> up<00:02:04.509> and<00:02:05.520> then<00:02:06.520> this<00:02:06.640> whole

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
those off up and then this whole

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:13.380 
those off up and then this whole
assembly<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:08.950> lifts<00:02:09.369> right<00:02:09.849> out

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.550 

of<00:02:14.390> course<00:02:14.630> it's<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.840> little<00:02:14.930> more<00:02:15.050> interesting

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
of course it's a little more interesting

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:32.680 
of course it's a little more interesting
to<00:02:15.650> do<00:02:15.800> with<00:02:15.950> one<00:02:16.130> hand<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.210> just<00:02:32.510> comes

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
to do with one hand so that just comes

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.110 
to do with one hand so that just comes
out<00:02:32.900> right<00:02:33.080> there<00:02:33.290> after<00:02:33.650> I'm<00:02:34.070> doing<00:02:34.460> a<00:02:34.700> series

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
out right there after I'm doing a series

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.080 
out right there after I'm doing a series
of<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.810> don't<00:02:36.740> know<00:02:36.920> probably<00:02:37.700> five<00:02:37.880> or<00:02:37.910> six

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
of I don't know probably five or six

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.960 
of I don't know probably five or six
clips<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.890> then<00:02:40.010> it<00:02:40.100> leaves<00:02:40.250> everything<00:02:40.580> wide

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
clips so then it leaves everything wide

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.520 
clips so then it leaves everything wide
open<00:02:41.360> I<00:02:42.940> like<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.060> use<00:02:44.240> this<00:02:45.340> blanket<00:02:46.340> here

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
open I like to use this blanket here

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.930 
open I like to use this blanket here
just<00:02:48.530> because<00:02:48.830> it's<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.100> little<00:02:49.310> easier<00:02:49.640> on<00:02:49.730> the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
just because it's a little easier on the
