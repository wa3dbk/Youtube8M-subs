dystonia<00:00:04.970> today<00:00:05.970> I<00:00:06.029> want<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.359> demonstrate<00:00:06.960> the

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
dystonia today I want to demonstrate the

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.759 
dystonia today I want to demonstrate the
effect<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.670> lighting<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.840> lighting<00:00:10.110> systems

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
effect of lighting and lighting systems

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.480 
effect of lighting and lighting systems
on<00:00:11.070> my<00:00:11.250> condition<00:00:11.610> I'm<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.360> my<00:00:12.830> kitchen<00:00:13.830> here

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
on my condition I'm in my kitchen here

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.480 
on my condition I'm in my kitchen here
and<00:00:14.759> not<00:00:15.660> having<00:00:16.020> any<00:00:16.139> problems<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.890> I'm<00:00:17.160> aware

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
and not having any problems of I'm aware

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.410 
and not having any problems of I'm aware
of<00:00:18.260> I've<00:00:19.260> got<00:00:19.439> an<00:00:19.590> incandescent<00:00:20.090> floor<00:00:21.090> lamp

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
of I've got an incandescent floor lamp

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.410 
of I've got an incandescent floor lamp
here<00:00:22.020> or<00:00:22.320> dusting<00:00:23.220> up<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.460> guess<00:00:23.640> you'd<00:00:23.820> say<00:00:23.850> and

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
here or dusting up I guess you'd say and

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.660 
here or dusting up I guess you'd say and
incandescent<00:00:25.289> lights<00:00:25.710> don't<00:00:26.039> seem<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.550> have

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
incandescent lights don't seem to have

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.599 
incandescent lights don't seem to have
any<00:00:26.910> impact<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.720> me<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:28.980> can<00:00:29.250> turn<00:00:29.429> that

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
any impact on me so so I can turn that

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.730 
any impact on me so so I can turn that
on<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:29.880> I'm<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.840> use<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.410> maybe

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
on and I'm going to use it to maybe

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.799 
on and I'm going to use it to maybe
improve<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.090> lighting<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.960> video<00:00:34.260> but

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
improve the lighting of the video but

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.209 
improve the lighting of the video but
according<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.020> polling<00:00:37.380> I've<00:00:37.559> done<00:00:37.800> over<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
according the polling I've done over the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.069 
according the polling I've done over the
years<00:00:38.309> about<00:00:38.879> forty<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.239> fifty<00:00:39.629> percent<00:00:39.930> of

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
years about forty to fifty percent of

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.869 
years about forty to fifty percent of
what<00:00:40.110> 4,000<00:00:40.920> patients<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.430> figured<00:00:41.730> out

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
what 4,000 patients have figured out

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.170 
what 4,000 patients have figured out
that<00:00:41.960> fluorescent<00:00:42.960> lighting<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:44.030> causes<00:00:45.030> them

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
that fluorescent lighting is causes them

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.840 
that fluorescent lighting is causes them
to<00:00:45.210> have<00:00:45.390> more<00:00:45.480> spasms<00:00:46.350> I'm<00:00:46.620> no<00:00:46.829> exception<00:00:47.010> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
to have more spasms I'm no exception to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.000 
to have more spasms I'm no exception to
that<00:00:47.879> rule<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.989> I'm<00:00:49.110> going<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.350> turn<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.559> wool

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
that rule so I'm going to turn on wool

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.720 
that rule so I'm going to turn on wool
for<00:00:50.280> us<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.670> right<00:00:50.879> here<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:52.280> you<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.460> see

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
for us and right here and you can see

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.420 
for us and right here and you can see
that<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.930> pretty<00:00:55.260> much<00:00:55.469> immediately<00:00:55.770> shuts

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
that that pretty much immediately shuts

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.660 
that that pretty much immediately shuts
my<00:00:56.670> right<00:00:56.910> eye<00:00:56.940> down<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.170> feel<00:00:58.410> my

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
my right eye down and I can feel my

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.360 
my right eye down and I can feel my
feels<00:00:59.670> like<00:00:59.879> my<00:01:00.030> left<00:01:00.329> eyebrow<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:01.289> pulling<00:01:02.160> up

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
feels like my left eyebrow is pulling up

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.780 
feels like my left eyebrow is pulling up
so<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.149> fluorescent<00:01:04.140> light<00:01:04.290> has<00:01:04.650> a

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
so the fluorescent light has a

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.000 
so the fluorescent light has a
significant<00:01:05.790> impact<00:01:06.119> now<00:01:06.810> most<00:01:07.680> people<00:01:07.830> think

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
significant impact now most people think

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.980 
significant impact now most people think
that<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.700> visible<00:01:09.119> light<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.390> creates

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
that it's the visible light that creates

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.460 
that it's the visible light that creates
the<00:01:10.229> problem<00:01:10.580> but<00:01:11.990> I'm<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.200> put<00:01:13.320> that

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
the problem but I'm going to put that

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.499 
the problem but I'm going to put that
towel<00:01:13.770> over<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.430> light<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.939> can't<00:01:15.330> really

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
towel over the light so I can't really

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.289 
towel over the light so I can't really
see<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.020> but<00:01:16.290> my<00:01:16.920> right<00:01:17.220> eye<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.490> still<00:01:17.970> shut

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
see it but my right eye is still shut

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
see it but my right eye is still shut
down<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.200> not<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> visible<00:01:19.920> light

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
down so it's not the visible light

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.090 
down so it's not the visible light
coming<00:01:21.060> through<00:01:21.090> my<00:01:22.080> eyeballs<00:01:22.680> that's

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
coming through my eyeballs that's

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.910 
coming through my eyeballs that's
creating<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> problem<00:01:24.180> now<00:01:24.930> another<00:01:25.590> type<00:01:25.860> of

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
creating the problem now another type of

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.510 
creating the problem now another type of
light<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.310> creates<00:01:26.970> problems<00:01:27.659> is

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
light that creates problems is

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.520 
light that creates problems is
ultraviolet<00:01:29.520> lights<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> blacklight

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
ultraviolet lights this is a blacklight

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.910 
ultraviolet lights this is a blacklight
and<00:01:32.150> I'll<00:01:33.150> go<00:01:33.390> ahead<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.780> turn<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
and I'll go ahead and turn that on and

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.929 
and I'll go ahead and turn that on and
we'll<00:01:35.610> see<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:36.290> takes<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.439> second<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.100> come<00:01:38.700> on

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
we'll see that takes a second to come on

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.170 
we'll see that takes a second to come on
but<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:40.259> pretty<00:01:40.439> much<00:01:40.590> does<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.040> same<00:01:41.220> same

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
but it pretty much does the same same

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.420 
but it pretty much does the same same
exact<00:01:42.630> thing<00:01:42.960> shuts<00:01:43.380> my<00:01:43.560> right<00:01:43.799> eye<00:01:43.829> down

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
exact thing shuts my right eye down

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.200 
exact thing shuts my right eye down
don't<00:01:45.420> feel<00:01:45.720> quite<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.170> much<00:01:46.729> on<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.000> left

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
don't feel quite as much on the left

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.530 
don't feel quite as much on the left
side<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:49.549> definitely<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> problem<00:01:51.119> with<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
side but definitely a problem with the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.020 
side but definitely a problem with the
with<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> right<00:01:52.320> side<00:01:52.619> now<00:01:53.490> let's<00:01:53.759> see<00:01:53.909> what

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
with the right side now let's see what

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.940 
with the right side now let's see what
happens<00:01:54.360> when<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.509> turn<00:01:54.630> both<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.350> these<00:01:55.439> on<00:01:55.740> at

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
happens when I turn both of these on at

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.450 
happens when I turn both of these on at
the<00:01:56.070> same<00:01:56.280> time<00:01:57.380> whew<00:01:59.630> that's<00:02:00.630> very

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
the same time whew that's very

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.920 
the same time whew that's very
significantly<00:02:02.460> different<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.299> brings<00:02:03.689> my

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
significantly different that brings my

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.300 
significantly different that brings my
mouth<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.469> jaw<00:02:04.710> into<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:06.619> situation<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.829> all

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
mouth and jaw into the situation and all

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.059 
mouth and jaw into the situation and all
shuts<00:02:08.670> both<00:02:08.970> my<00:02:09.270> eyes<00:02:09.300> down<00:02:09.959> trying<00:02:10.800> pretty

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
shuts both my eyes down trying pretty

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.320 
shuts both my eyes down trying pretty
hard<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.610> see<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.180> camera<00:02:12.600> here<00:02:12.870> but<00:02:14.330> having

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
hard to see the camera here but having

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.720 
hard to see the camera here but having
both<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.540> those<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:16.020> at<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.290> same<00:02:16.470> time

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
both of those on at the same time

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.760 
both of those on at the same time
definitely<00:02:17.730> creates<00:02:18.510> major<00:02:18.870> problems<00:02:19.560> and

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
definitely creates major problems and

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.660 
definitely creates major problems and
the<00:02:20.760> same<00:02:21.380> situation<00:02:22.380> is<00:02:22.530> true<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.890> can<00:02:23.430> put<00:02:23.640> a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
the same situation is true I can put a

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.330 
the same situation is true I can put a
towel<00:02:24.540> over<00:02:24.900> those<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.830> really<00:02:26.040> doesn't

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
towel over those and it really doesn't

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.670 
towel over those and it really doesn't
have<00:02:27.209> any<00:02:27.480> impact<00:02:28.080> on<00:02:28.830> what<00:02:29.760> it's<00:02:29.940> doing<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.600> me

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
have any impact on what it's doing to me

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.650 
have any impact on what it's doing to me
so<00:02:31.680> I'll<00:02:32.580> turn<00:02:32.819> this<00:02:34.940> ultraviolet<00:02:35.940> off<00:02:36.120> and

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
so I'll turn this ultraviolet off and

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.350 
so I'll turn this ultraviolet off and
now<00:02:37.200> I'm<00:02:37.440> back<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.970> having<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.330> eye

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
now I'm back to just having the eye

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.280 
now I'm back to just having the eye
problems<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.709> if<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:41.670> think<00:02:41.880> that

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
problems so if you think that

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.110 
problems so if you think that
fluorescent<00:02:43.290> lights<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.950> black<00:02:44.370> lights<00:02:44.760> are

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
fluorescent lights and black lights are

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.690 
fluorescent lights and black lights are
affecting<00:02:45.660> your<00:02:45.780> dystonia<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:47.100> may<00:02:47.280> well<00:02:47.489> be

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
affecting your dystonia you may well be

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.910 
affecting your dystonia you may well be
correct<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.810> doubt<00:02:49.080> seriously<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.800> it's

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
correct and I doubt seriously that it's

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.770 
correct and I doubt seriously that it's
the<00:02:50.040> visible<00:02:50.430> light<00:02:50.610> it's<00:02:50.940> probably<00:02:51.510> other

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
the visible light it's probably other

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.720 
the visible light it's probably other
energy<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.590> those<00:02:52.800> systems<00:02:53.310> are<00:02:53.459> throwing

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
energy that those systems are throwing

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.120 
energy that those systems are throwing
off
