match it has to be supply raid there has

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.980 
match it has to be supply raid there has
to<00:02:01.259> be<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.409> finite<00:02:01.740> number<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.130> lines<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:03.600> also

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
to be a finite number of lines and also

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.459 
to be a finite number of lines and also
it<00:02:04.740> has<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.100> be<00:02:05.219> during<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.610> mission<00:02:05.820> like<00:02:06.469> with

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
it has to be during a mission like with

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.010 
it has to be during a mission like with
the<00:02:07.979> counter<00:02:08.369> running<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.060> let's<00:02:09.660> say<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.810> was

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
the counter running so let's say I was

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.050 
the counter running so let's say I was
on<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.379> headshot<00:02:10.739> downs<00:02:10.920> mission<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.520> would

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
on the headshot downs mission I would

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.580 
on the headshot downs mission I would
have<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.450> pick<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.840> heads

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
have to pick the heads

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.950 
have to pick the heads
if<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.460> was<00:02:14.580> going<00:02:14.730> for<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.030> head<00:02:15.120> shot<00:02:15.180> record

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
if I was going for the head shot record

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.550 
if I was going for the head shot record
I<00:02:16.280> would<00:02:17.280> have<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.460> pick<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.700> head<00:02:17.820> shot<00:02:18.000> downs

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
I would have to pick the head shot downs

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.470 
I would have to pick the head shot downs
mission<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.740> so<00:02:20.010> then<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.310> way<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:21.270> game<00:02:21.450> is

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
mission and so then that way the game is

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.170 
mission and so then that way the game is
keeping<00:02:21.960> an<00:02:22.050> actual<00:02:22.500> count<00:02:22.740> of<00:02:23.160> how<00:02:23.820> many<00:02:23.880> head

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
keeping an actual count of how many head

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.290 
keeping an actual count of how many head
shots<00:02:24.420> here<00:02:25.160> so<00:02:26.160> have<00:02:26.310> your<00:02:26.490> camera<00:02:27.060> or<00:02:27.180> your

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
shots here so have your camera or your

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.210 
shots here so have your camera or your
camera<00:02:27.690> phone<00:02:27.960> ready<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.530> just<00:02:29.040> take<00:02:29.190> a

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
camera phone ready and just take a

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.680 
camera phone ready and just take a
picture<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.910> staff<00:02:30.360> entire<00:02:31.010> board<00:02:32.690> and

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
picture of the staff entire board and

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.440 
picture of the staff entire board and
you<00:02:34.590> can<00:02:34.740> get<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.160> if<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.640> missed<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.030> you

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
you can get that if you missed it you

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.210 
you can get that if you missed it you
can<00:02:36.480> always<00:02:36.750> press<00:02:36.930> select<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.680> lobby<00:02:37.920> to

can always press select in the lobby to
bring<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.520> back<00:02:38.670> up<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:39.060> picture<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.810> and

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
bring that back up a picture of that and

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.580 
bring that back up a picture of that and
also<00:02:41.490> on<00:02:41.970> your<00:02:42.300> last<00:02:42.450> day<00:02:42.630> make<00:02:43.020> sure<00:02:43.050> that<00:02:43.440> you

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.750 
head shot on day three that's gonna be
the<00:02:51.990> truth<00:02:52.650> like<00:02:52.830> for<00:02:52.920> example<00:02:52.980> right<00:02:53.370> here<00:02:53.400> a

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
the truth like for example right here a

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.940 
the truth like for example right here a
head<00:02:54.390> shot<00:02:54.600> right<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.590> want<00:02:55.740> to<00:02:55.800> take<00:02:55.920> a

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
the end of the round that that way it's

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.320 
the end of the round that that way it's
proof<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.780> actually<00:03:00.960> got<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.530> record

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
proof that you actually got that record
