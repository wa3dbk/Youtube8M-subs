was<00:00:12.950> the<00:00:13.220> vertical<00:00:14.150> farm

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
was the vertical farm

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.800 
was the vertical farm
it<00:00:15.460> was<00:00:15.580> a<00:00:15.610> thesis<00:00:15.849> project<00:00:16.119> that<00:00:16.449> I<00:00:16.510> had<00:00:16.630> done

urbana-champaign the basic form of the
building<00:00:21.400> comes<00:00:22.090> from<00:00:22.510> the<00:00:23.230> idea<00:00:23.410> of

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
building comes from the idea of

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.540 
building comes from the idea of
verticality<00:00:25.660> so<00:00:26.380> it<00:00:26.470> needed<00:00:26.650> to<00:00:26.680> be<00:00:26.740> tall<00:00:27.070> and

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
verticality so it needed to be tall and

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.230 
verticality so it needed to be tall and
it<00:00:28.090> set<00:00:28.300> out<00:00:28.390> in<00:00:28.570> Lake<00:00:28.720> Michigan<00:00:28.930> because

idea was to use a structural system that

idea was to use a structural system that
was<00:01:11.380> beneficial<00:01:11.650> to<00:01:12.310> vertical<00:01:13.030> farming<00:01:13.390> which

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
was beneficial to vertical farming which

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.230 
was beneficial to vertical farming which
is<00:01:13.990> not<00:01:14.979> put<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.369> structure<00:01:15.700> system<00:01:16.030> on<00:01:16.150> the

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
because it looks like a normal

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.300 
because it looks like a normal
skyscraper<00:04:23.229> but<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:25.150> includes<00:04:25.660> some<00:04:26.320> farm

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
skyscraper but it includes some farm

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.689 
skyscraper but it includes some farm
inside<00:04:27.880> it<00:04:28.630> is<00:04:28.750> a<00:04:28.780> really<00:04:29.080> architecture<00:04:29.770> the

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
inside it is a really architecture the

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:36.000 
inside it is a really architecture the
goal<00:04:30.970> is<00:04:31.419> to<00:04:31.750> say<00:04:32.530> can<00:04:33.460> we<00:04:33.669> invent<00:04:34.510> a<00:04:35.010> real

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
goal is to say can we invent a real

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
goal is to say can we invent a real
architecture<00:04:36.820> or<00:04:37.060> is<00:04:37.960> it<00:04:38.260> only<00:04:38.470> a<00:04:39.039> technical

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
architecture or is it only a technical

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.469 
architecture or is it only a technical
question<00:04:40.630> we<00:04:41.260> are<00:04:41.289> working<00:04:41.590> on<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.699> case<00:04:43.240> of

question we are working on the case of
Paris<00:04:44.169> city<00:04:44.650> because<00:04:45.250> Paris<00:04:46.180> is<00:04:46.830> one<00:04:47.830> of<00:04:48.039> the

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
Paris city because Paris is one of the

facility that we designed for them at

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.140 
facility that we designed for them at
sort<00:05:48.980> of<00:05:49.010> a<00:05:49.070> visioning<00:05:49.460> level<00:05:49.850> at<00:05:50.120> a

sort of a visioning level at a
feasibility<00:05:50.570> level<00:05:51.040> was<00:05:52.040> three<00:05:52.580> stories<00:05:52.940> of

feasibility level was three stories of

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.940 
feasibility level was three stories of
stacked<00:05:53.930> greenhouse<00:05:54.820> research<00:05:55.900> wing<00:05:56.900> and<00:05:57.230> an

stacked greenhouse research wing and an

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.410 
stacked greenhouse research wing and an
atrium<00:05:58.340> that<00:05:58.520> separates<00:05:58.940> the<00:05:59.060> two<00:05:59.090> of<00:05:59.300> them

winter garden

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.170

we<00:06:03.230> believe<00:06:03.500> that<00:06:03.530> a<00:06:03.800> vertical<00:06:04.640> farm<00:06:04.790> does

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
we believe that a vertical farm does

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.880 
we believe that a vertical farm does
have<00:06:05.360> to<00:06:05.480> start<00:06:05.690> small<00:06:05.930> starting<00:06:06.650> small<00:06:06.830> is

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
have to start small starting small is

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.520 
have to start small starting small is
our<00:06:07.160> way<00:06:07.310> of<00:06:07.520> managing<00:06:08.330> risk<00:06:08.480> and<00:06:09.020> really

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
our way of managing risk and really

our way of managing risk and really
digging<00:06:10.520> into<00:06:10.850> the<00:06:11.540> problem<00:06:11.900> of<00:06:12.140> how<00:06:12.410> do<00:06:12.470> you

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
digging into the problem of how do you

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.980 
digging into the problem of how do you
make<00:06:13.280> a<00:06:13.670> vertical<00:06:13.910> farm<00:06:14.180> work<00:06:14.420> and<00:06:14.630> how<00:06:14.870> do<00:06:14.930> you

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
make a vertical farm work and how do you

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.080 
make a vertical farm work and how do you
make<00:06:15.200> it<00:06:15.350> commercially<00:06:15.740> viable<00:06:15.890> I<00:06:16.280> think<00:06:16.970> we

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
make it commercially viable I think we

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.080 
make it commercially viable I think we
have<00:06:17.210> to<00:06:17.390> be<00:06:17.540> somewhat<00:06:18.500> humble<00:06:19.130> when<00:06:19.550> we<00:06:19.700> when

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
have to be somewhat humble when we when

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.820 
have to be somewhat humble when we when
we<00:06:20.120> move<00:06:20.360> forward<00:06:20.630> realizing<00:06:21.320> that<00:06:21.470> we're<00:06:21.710> not

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
we move forward realizing that we're not

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.110 
we move forward realizing that we're not
going<00:06:22.010> to<00:06:22.100> get<00:06:22.250> it<00:06:22.340> right<00:06:22.520> the<00:06:22.790> first<00:06:22.820> time

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
going to get it right the first time

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.900 
going to get it right the first time
it's<00:06:24.110> my<00:06:24.260> personal<00:06:24.650> belief<00:06:24.740> that<00:06:25.100> when<00:06:25.790> you

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
it's my personal belief that when you

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.270 
it's my personal belief that when you
bring<00:06:26.120> food<00:06:26.540> production<00:06:27.050> closer<00:06:27.470> to<00:06:28.100> where

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
bring food production closer to where

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.100 
bring food production closer to where
people<00:06:28.430> are<00:06:28.610> living<00:06:28.760> and<00:06:29.120> working<00:06:29.270> and<00:06:29.570> they

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
people are living and working and they

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.310 
people are living and working and they
can<00:06:30.320> see<00:06:31.070> it<00:06:31.220> and<00:06:31.430> touch<00:06:32.120> it<00:06:32.180> and<00:06:32.480> smell<00:06:33.080> it<00:06:33.230> and

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
can see it and touch it and smell it and

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.280 
can see it and touch it and smell it and
taste<00:06:33.440> it<00:06:33.800> I<00:06:34.010> think<00:06:35.000> sort<00:06:35.450> to<00:06:35.570> challenge<00:06:35.990> that

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.290 
taste it I think sort to challenge that

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.590 
taste it I think sort to challenge that
narrative<00:06:36.680> right<00:06:36.920> now<00:06:37.040> that<00:06:37.220> says<00:06:37.430> that<00:06:37.670> food

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
narrative right now that says that food

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.760 
narrative right now that says that food
is<00:06:38.900> is<00:06:39.380> cheap<00:06:39.710> and<00:06:40.640> I<00:06:40.850> think<00:06:41.230> that<00:06:42.230> paradigm

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770 
is is cheap and I think that paradigm

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.830 
is is cheap and I think that paradigm
shift<00:06:43.070> alone<00:06:43.520> could<00:06:43.940> be<00:06:44.060> enough<00:06:44.330> to<00:06:44.810> change

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
shift alone could be enough to change

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:55.690 
shift alone could be enough to change
the<00:06:45.260> way<00:06:45.500> that<00:06:45.800> agriculture<00:06:46.520> works<00:06:47.360> right<00:06:47.630> now

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:55.700 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.760
