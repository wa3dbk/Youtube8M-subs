00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.980
 hi to all and welcome to a project 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.300
 which has unconventional since we are going 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.250
 talk today about dark souls from 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.960
 scholars the first in the reissue of 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.430
 game released last year that lands 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.680
 on xbox one playstation 4 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.939
 and also on pc in the program an update to 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.670
 graphic level and especially a quest 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:34.690
 principal totally redesigned for this 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.190
 which is technical promises the 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.630
 transition to 60 frames per second is 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.220
 rather successful on playstation 4 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.930
 a little less on xbox one that accuses 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.370
 a few jolts without this being 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.780
 truly dramatic one can 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.399
 now visit English than in full 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.140
 hd and somehow benefit from a 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.880
 made close to the original pc version 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.410
 but it's really the management of 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.610
 the light we will remember the sources 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.050
 of light are more realistic the 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.520
 shadows too and you go 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.140
 by the way finally be able to get out your 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.580
 torch the areas supposed to be plunged 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.940
 in the darkness lesson finally actually 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.290
 enough to rediscover a lot of areas 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.059
 if on a strictly technical plane the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.530
 bet seems held the content of this 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.909
 edition is likely to make the 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.530
 eyebrows one can enjoy a 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.570
 alternative conclusion thanks to a new 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.070
 end boss with very little inspired design 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.329
 but especially if you are a veteran 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.890
 you will feel like you're playing 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.360
 a new game all areas of the 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.860
 main quest have seen the placement of 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.659
 monsters altered but it's especially their 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.080
 number in very sharp increase that the 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.080
 notice 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.690
 from the first zone we are led to 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.860
 now cross a troll and up 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.180
 a dozen zombies that you 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.750
 will continue even further 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.610
 before 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.020
 galvanized probably by the effect of 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.370
 group if you used to 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.840
 to survey the tower of flames two aids 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.250
 to start the adventure you go 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.020
 now meet a whole bunch of 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.460
 new enemies whose drake remains 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.990
 from a very low level so not really 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.640
 of threats for the experienced player 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.020
 to note besides that the boss of this 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.080
 zone always falls like an idiot in 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.220
 emptiness and in the same way a certain 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.750
 buzz will become a meeting 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.730
 recurring even though it's often in 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.810
 places unsuited to its proportions 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.250
 one in the other this outbid 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.570
 allows developers to fix 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.260
 some consistency concerns of the 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.300
 original version 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.190
 and if finally unfortunately tang 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.540
 the impression that all this has been decided 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.710
 to go quickly without thinking too much about 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.750
 consequences on the curve of 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.399
 progression persists largely once 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.630
 the finished game to us it happens well 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.370
 often an area is transformed 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.420
 just in tribute to benny hill and this 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.160
 Adding enemies to consequences 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.710
 serious about the progression but not that 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.880
 as a neophyte this difficulty 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.140
 artificial will hinder your progress 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.460
 as a veteran you go 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.990
 simply gain levels at a 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.730
 crazy speed complete the quest 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.410
 principal as well as the three dlc which 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.300
 have also strangely suffered no 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.950
 change will propel you around 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.910
 level 170 and beyond 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.910
 much faster than before 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.540
 the other big problem comes from a bug or 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.370
 then of a feature that makes that the 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.690
 transition to 60 frames per second double 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.400
 the speed of wear of the weapons of the same 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.720
 typed in a corpse will always spoil 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.150
 as much your weapon with increased risk 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.290
 to break it often happens that 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.030
 your broken weapon is pushing you to 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.380
 run to the next kankan fire come back 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.890
 to the previous one would cause the same 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.210
 result 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.680
 and even though the game pushes to have 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.120
 many weapons we have trouble understanding 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.120
 that such bugs still persist 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.440
 exploration has also been modified 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.880
 we will get objects that is a lot 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.170
 earlier in the adventure but we cross 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.670
 also new statues that 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.260
 block your progress without too much 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.850
 reason the beginning of the adventurer becomes a 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.730
 little more dirigiste to open 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.290
 even more afterwards to conclude 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.550
 if you have never played dark souls 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.110
 we will have a hard time advising you 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.700
 this version of course it includes 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.470
 all the dlc but it will have to wait 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.180
 hypothetical patch to correct these 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.290
 bugs that was once trivial and who 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.270
 become completely blocking 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.560
 today the timing of the release of this 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.370
 kolarov to do if they do not play no 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.930
 more in his favor 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.100
 and even with all the good will of the 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.990
 world it is still quite difficult 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.250
 not to compare it at least on the 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.620
 artistic plan or even level design 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.209
 with his little cousin blood terminals and 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.550
 as for the pc version the passage of 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.930
 directx 9 and directx 11 does not bring 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.160
 great thing visually and seeing that he 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.300
 must go back to the cashier to be able to 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.720
 play with his friends on the last 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.489
 version 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.489
 not sure that the pill easily passes 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.140
 and even if knee was not 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.940
 the perfect game it's still a pity 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.260
 to see how little care has been taken 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.030
 surrender that just puts in 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.590
 before the qualities of the original title that 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.390
 had for him his balancing his 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.980
 difficulty much better dose and especially 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.980
 according to the rules of the series
