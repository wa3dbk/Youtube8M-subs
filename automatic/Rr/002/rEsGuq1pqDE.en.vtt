00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.639
 hello everyone beats i hope that 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.859
 you have come back to us for the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.810
 triathlon number two this time - 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.630
 who will remain a soldier so this will be the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.949
 last will be the final after the ultimate 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.289
 triathlon so that's the penultimate 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.670
 so look good so here I register 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.449
 for the last time the penultimate 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.710
 times earlier so it happens in full 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.140
 night on the island to because it's not 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.070
 unless he's really chosen except that 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.440
 I was chaining 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.210
 triathlons and saw that day 1 beats 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.500
 very quickly so I find myself in 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.250
 nocture so it's not too bad like that 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.980
 it shows you a little too 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.719
 how does it happen at night so so there 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.340
 it's gone we're all ready so the 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.070
 real life I have my shock team the cac 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.270
 and with me there a little effect it's not 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.129
 true and he and his glasses had to be 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.420
 laugh 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.710
 3 2 1 it's gone 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.190
 anglet in progress so as always 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.390
 saved you before I had sprinted they 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.380
 are super strong against alain a 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.400
 pretty awesome player no I 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.020
 still find that the triathlon is 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.549
 this enough to still push hard enough 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.780
 in the meantime we only where I saw 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.409
 role would have to be against camera 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.970
 how she does not at all it's great 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.500
 fun so already I'm afraid of losing the 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.939
 trajectory and I'm still 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.439
 pay attention for a moment during this 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.390
 because I do not know if he's really 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.520
 stable or portable ops knows that you 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.570
 have the view of the locals ma you see on 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.799
 will say all the teammates but he 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.689
 just that's what I had done that 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.479
 trevor lolo i'm forced to leave 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.990
 and there she went to hand begins 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.740
 disoriented it made me lose a place 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.880
 so I told you the view of 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.810
 the helicopter is really not obvious 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.579
 because at the same time you do not have 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.130
 necessarily the abilities of your 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.570
 endurance at your fingertips right so 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.909
 you killed we'll tell the camera that 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.680
 film and he commented more who mouth 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.570
 like at pac huawei this is it 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.310
 arrived it's not that way here and there 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.810
 and you are like saint tudy but shit 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.570
 do I still have stamina or 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.130
 not so there I'm not too far from there 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.280
 what is teasing predict a not too much 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.710
 too far so it's going for now 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.869
 remains minimal so it's the 2nd triathlon 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.640
 and after I had the last woes on 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.629
 last fucking I say it again 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.899
 once I saw it in the first 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.700
 episode that records 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.989
 but really still you'll see by 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.640
 you yourself already have a yeah that's 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.689
 not too bad I could not see the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.579
 compile of the three triathlons you 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.110
 understand why I wanted to 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.159
 start sticking the three are one 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.900
 video like that you'll have everything 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.920
 show but eventually I can not you 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.439
 will understand a little bit about 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.989
 3 the last triathlon 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.189
 you will tell me some news of course 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.720
 for those who have not done what they 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.620
 did you already know but this 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.480
 that they did not do well you're going 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.579
 have a super surprise to say no 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.129
 it's true it exists and I'll tell you and 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.049
 yeah they have a little exaggerated the 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:45.430
 thing but that's a little bit my 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:48.780
 Not my personal opinion that sees it 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.430
 the shi which is peculiar to me 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.840
 go I continue to draw a little bit 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.489
 in a straight line to be able to 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.170
 exceed 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.909
 my age to I confess frankly he did 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.290
 not too much stamina at franklin so 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.819
 after i do not know if michael has 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.099
 much more stamina I think 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.409
 yes but on the other hand at the level of the 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:09.120
 run michael the ivorian that franklin he 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.120
 is at maximum of its capacity to 100% 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.060
 so the bike is really 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.109
 something that is not easy to 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.519
 so take the press I will not make you 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.810
 bad little videos there so you have the 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.730
 bike I do not know if to uninterested 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.780
 I was told yes, but I was not sure 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.489
 understood what you told me in fact 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.530
 take a bike and get off the 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.480
 a few you are how to explain the 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.530
 mountain or valley by bike so I 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.730
 do not know if it's already feasible 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.030
 technically if it's feasible 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.139
 I will try to inform myself I will do it 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.760
 after I think you waggle war 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.019
 bike to put 40 minutes to 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.220
 climb dying like a trunk 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.159
 mercher see what I mean 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.949
 would be really stupid so here I take 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.260
 in tight curves the little ones 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:45.669
 turns pretty narrow so that's not it 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.739
 too much too bad for the moment I 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.060
 rather'm doing rather well has not 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.260
 well that tells as experiencing 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.239
 time there I leave rather pamir 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.430
 in vain I really had to wear the 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.750
 bad luck in what I said to yahia he 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.549
 start with me over and you no no 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.449
 no and I do not have to see here no we're going 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:03.400
 wait for the thank you we're almost there 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.920
 arrived we are pro the olp to light his 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.240
 faults of eating it 1 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.580
 go there we are almost there is almost 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.220
 years progresses I progress from the line 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.840
 arrival or not yet no when is 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.480
 even there I find one you already have 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.380
 it's a little more than a tiny 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.310
 little longer than the first triathlon 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.620
 was waiting for me in front of the third 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.060
 so there is not worse there really is 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.710
 no worse to heavy the bike frankly 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.910
 they dropped a little cat or 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.790
 so do a lot of cycling as it is 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:38.320
 good of content so it happened quickly 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.840
 we descend from the cast fast short court 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.540
 short now forest course for short 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.770
 short runs short so I know that 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.970
 I have a considerable advantage now 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.139
 I can catch up without problem 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.660
 take a lot of advanced I know that 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.350
 franklin he loves sprinting and here we are 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.910
 really gone 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.200
 however, did not run anywhere 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.520
 do of course touch the yellow thing 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.260
 because I've already made cuts 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.710
 as schumacher it is to act cut the 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.660
 straight lines 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.370
 I passed at the level of zigzags and 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.780
 put penalties that is to say 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.090
 penalties if I had to go back on 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.290
 the checkpoint to validate and more keep 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.729
 the finish line the next ones so 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.590
 it would be stupid to be able to get around 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.180
 cheat knowing you are everything 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.229
 simply arrived so for those who are 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.360
 ask the question the cheat codes 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.169
 do not walk on the marathons the 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.539
 triathlons etc 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.400
 here are the friends I will arrive first 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:20.470
 again so 2nd triathlon 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.580
 succeeds so we'll see what will be 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.880
 on the third I tell you to very 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.410
 soon 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.380
 wear well and take care of yourself 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.800
 and the third remains careful he arrives 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.800
 very soon
