I think maybe would be killing out of
them<00:02:40.720> we<00:02:41.560> could<00:02:41.680> start<00:02:41.800> working<00:02:42.100> on<00:02:42.220> what's<00:02:42.430> a

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
them we could start working on what's a

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.070 
them we could start working on what's a
Buccaneer<00:02:42.970> ripcoo<00:02:43.360> long<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.630> go<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.900> route

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
Buccaneer ripcoo long to go that route

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.010 
Buccaneer ripcoo long to go that route
which<00:02:44.800> might<00:02:45.040> be<00:02:45.070> kind<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.400> too<00:02:45.520> hard<00:02:45.550> if<00:02:46.020> not

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
which might be kind of too hard if not

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.330 
which might be kind of too hard if not
I'm<00:02:47.320> thinking<00:02:47.560> maybe<00:02:47.650> tonight<00:02:47.860> would<00:02:48.130> use<00:02:48.250> the

I'm thinking maybe tonight would use the
pvp<00:02:48.900> starting<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:49.990> like<00:02:50.110> stranglethorn<00:02:50.590> we'll

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
and then maybe we'll heart back

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.790
