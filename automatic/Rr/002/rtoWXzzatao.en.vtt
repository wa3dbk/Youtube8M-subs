00:00:01.499 --> 00:00:04.589
 is the worst enemy posting side 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.350
 second season of glee 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.579
 in charge 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:11.030
 the information I 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.719
 created the heat was what? 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:14.930
 just in season 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.930
 I do not know when to make the collections in Portuguese. 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.400
 how is it 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.460
 season has not 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.529
 still in the states 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.579
 so I believe that 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.590
 in the second collection also 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.060
 in assembly in search of debris 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.060
 it was the season 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.940
 I liked 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.940
 basically the first episodes of this season 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.480
 mainly what it refers to 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.580
 to pm 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.120
 copy a bodice a game 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.120
 for me considered one of the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.250
 the best in the year so far what? 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.030
 Quigley 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.030
 So let's go inside. 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.300
 part of the risks 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.680
 whatever you want 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.850
 in this dam 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.850
 Our people, I get the actress. 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.310
 just it 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.950
 locke too 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.950
 click here 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.340
 is definitely not able to open 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.320
 I think he's so dumb just like that 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.950
 few 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:51.970
 a letter 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.790
 I got 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.790
 complete the great 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.030
 the particles 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.399
 of these creatures are very cool are August fine little less 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.159
 almost sounds like a little coffin 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.400
 tactically acid prospects of the season 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.389
 for those who have never felt the weather is a show 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.549
 one series suffices that the teenager more than this 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.579
 they mix a lot of musical 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.609
 here is just speaking played 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.609
 the weather the moment the name 2 forbids 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.049
 the karaoke 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.209
 last season I had a buyer 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.209
 the first part of the first season on DVD 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.099
 in he was 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.649
 the shipment 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:54.419
 credits so 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.989
 it is put that it is the first disc containing the first 6 episodes 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:04.789
 these options 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:08.289
 the one that particularly this will be mine because it flows cori because we have 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:11.289
 first of people who are legal issues 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:18.009
 here the second disc in reference to the parlamente hall the episode what they 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:19.449
 cool 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.449
 umbrella music 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.399
 prisc three points next to the thirteen and st auto 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.089
 and disk 4 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:35.209
 18 22 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.779
 reference new york that is the last episode rome 2 new york 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.049
 Nawata you have 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.299
 the episodes listed by risk 

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:53.089
 this 4 with 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:55.959
 most of you are forgotten 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.109
 this season 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.269
 first disc I have 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.100
 the episode any time with the garbage that is 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.179
 the staff saw 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:09.469
 kenton 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:11.479
 here is the favorite for me 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.419
 until now 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.819
 the crime 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.269
 the case 4 discs 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.269
 but the carp 

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:24.999
 on sales in english brazil 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:28.909
 but not immune 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.909
 formats 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.689
 so second season of glee 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:40.639
 remembered him 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.030
 that's the way 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.030
 It will not be released in Brazil for now. 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:49.779
 in Brazil to receive only the interest must have 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.580
 so I fell to the next
