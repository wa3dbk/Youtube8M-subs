lock bar stabilizer and that just makes
it<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.469> when<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.489> close<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.940> knife<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.300> don't

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
it so when you close the knife you don't

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.380 
it so when you close the knife you don't
overextend<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:41.040> frame<00:00:41.370> there<00:00:41.670> does<00:00:42.120> require

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
overextend the frame there does require

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.360 
overextend the frame there does require
a<00:00:42.480> little<00:00:42.930> pressure<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.469> bring<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.980> fully

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
a little pressure to bring it fully

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.369 
a little pressure to bring it fully
closed<00:00:44.760> but<00:00:45.450> that's<00:00:45.600> what<00:00:45.780> gives<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.140> that

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
closed but that's what gives it that

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.299 
closed but that's what gives it that
sweet<00:00:47.250> action<00:00:48.530> kind<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.649> an<00:00:49.739> elegant<00:00:50.070> swedge

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
sweet action kind of an elegant swedge

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.360 
sweet action kind of an elegant swedge
for<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.640> drop<00:00:50.850> point<00:00:51.120> blade<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:52.039> that<00:00:53.039> gray

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
for the drop point blade and that gray

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.660 
for the drop point blade and that gray
color<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.440> titanium<00:00:55.440> Carbonite<00:00:56.399> raid

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
color is a titanium Carbonite raid

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.400 
color is a titanium Carbonite raid
coating<00:00:58.039> so<00:00:59.449> you<00:01:00.449> might<00:01:00.629> be<00:01:00.660> wondering<00:01:00.780> what

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
coating so you might be wondering what

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.410 
coating so you might be wondering what
is<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.829> difference<00:01:01.859> between<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.760> cryo<00:01:03.090> one

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
is the difference between the cryo one

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.810 
is the difference between the cryo one
and<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.840> cryo<00:01:04.110> -<00:01:04.260> well<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.519> best

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
and the cryo - well that can be best

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.090 
and the cryo - well that can be best
illustrated<00:01:06.479> by<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.110> boxes<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.650> they<00:01:07.799> come

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
illustrated by the boxes that they come

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.219 
illustrated by the boxes that they come
in<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> box<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> cryo<00:01:09.930> one

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
in this is the box that the cryo one

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.960 
in this is the box that the cryo one
comes<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.950> that's<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.430> box<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
comes in and that's the box that the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.850 
comes in and that's the box that the
cryo<00:01:12.210> two<00:01:12.479> comes<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.470> as<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:13.799> see

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
cryo two comes in so as you can see

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.120 
cryo two comes in so as you can see
you're<00:01:14.520> basically<00:01:14.970> getting<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.630> larger<00:01:16.590> knife

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
you're basically getting a larger knife

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.350 
you're basically getting a larger knife
so<00:01:17.939> let's<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> little<00:01:18.450> comparison<00:01:18.900> here

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.440 

give<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.570> visual<00:01:24.900> their<00:01:26.180> overall<00:01:27.180> length

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
give you a visual their overall length

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.920 
give you a visual their overall length
on<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.229> cryo<00:01:28.710> two<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.720> seven<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.900> half

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
on the cryo two is seven and a half

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.880 
on the cryo two is seven and a half
inches<00:01:31.850> compared<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.150> six<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.200> half<00:01:34.229> inches

inches compared to six and a half inches

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.300 
inches compared to six and a half inches

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
and as far as the blade goes right where

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.580 
and as far as the blade goes right where
the<00:01:38.400> grind<00:01:38.670> starts<00:01:39.150> you're<00:01:39.780> looking<00:01:40.110> at<00:01:40.259> three

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
the grind starts you're looking at three

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.080 
the grind starts you're looking at three
and<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.740> quarter<00:01:41.130> inch<00:01:41.960> versus<00:01:43.100> 2<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.430> 3/4<00:01:45.240> inch

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
and a quarter inch versus 2 and 3/4 inch

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.490 
and a quarter inch versus 2 and 3/4 inch
weight-wise<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.899> feel<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> little<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
weight-wise you can feel a little a

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.819 
weight-wise you can feel a little a
little<00:01:49.649> bit<00:01:49.799> heavier<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.880> five<00:01:51.390> point<00:01:51.659> five

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
little bit heavier it's five point five

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.539 
little bit heavier it's five point five
ounces<00:01:52.829> compared<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> four<00:01:54.299> point<00:01:54.570> one<00:01:55.549> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
ounces compared to a four point one the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.429 
ounces compared to a four point one the
thickness<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:58.040> super<00:01:59.040> close<00:01:59.310> so<00:02:00.439> unless

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
thickness is super close so unless

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.830 
thickness is super close so unless
you're<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:01.799> accurate<00:02:02.430> as<00:02:02.689> these<00:02:03.689> calipers

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
you're as accurate as these calipers

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.539 
you're as accurate as these calipers
doubt<00:02:06.500> you're<00:02:06.680> going<00:02:06.799> to<00:02:06.860> be<00:02:06.950> able<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.159> tell<00:02:07.340> so

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
doubt you're going to be able to tell so

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.970 
doubt you're going to be able to tell so
3.9<00:02:08.690> compared<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:10.510> 3.7<00:02:11.530> now<00:02:12.530> where<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:12.860> do

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
3.9 compared to 3.7 now where you do

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.980 
3.9 compared to 3.7 now where you do
feel<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.280> difference<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:13.880> in<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.660> thickness

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
feel the difference is in the thickness

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:22.080 
feel the difference is in the thickness
of<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:16.400> width<00:02:16.610> excuse<00:02:17.090> me<00:02:17.209> of<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.420> handle

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:31.110 

1.09<00:02:23.090> compared<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:28.690> 0.92

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
1.09 compared to 0.92

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.699 
1.09 compared to 0.92
so<00:02:32.120> I<00:02:32.420> definitely<00:02:32.780> feel<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.560> can

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
so I definitely feel that and you can

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.570 
so I definitely feel that and you can
see<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.880> cryo<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:36.170> length<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.980> little<00:02:37.489> bit

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
see the cryo to the length a little bit

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.370 
see the cryo to the length a little bit
past<00:02:37.760> my<00:02:37.910> pinkie<00:02:38.300> there<00:02:38.540> where<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.959> palm<00:02:39.200> mold

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
past my pinkie there where the palm mold

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.430 
past my pinkie there where the palm mold
is<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.830> on<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.760> cryo<00:02:41.000> one<00:02:41.330> a<00:02:41.540> little<00:02:42.260> bit

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
is and on the cryo one a little bit

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.040 
is and on the cryo one a little bit
thinner<00:02:42.760> but<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.850> still<00:02:44.090> feels<00:02:44.239> excellent<00:02:44.870> and

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
thinner but it still feels excellent and

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.290 
thinner but it still feels excellent and
so<00:02:45.920> it's<00:02:46.070> pretty<00:02:46.220> much<00:02:46.340> flush<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:47.030> where<00:02:47.150> my

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
so it's pretty much flush to where my

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.140 
so it's pretty much flush to where my
pinkie<00:02:47.720> is<00:02:47.980> now<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.340> other<00:02:49.489> minor

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
pinkie is now the other minor

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.900 
pinkie is now the other minor
differences<00:02:50.870> in<00:02:50.930> these<00:02:51.290> two<00:02:51.350> knives<00:02:51.739> is<00:02:52.130> on

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
differences in these two knives is on

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.790 
differences in these two knives is on
the<00:02:53.239> pocket<00:02:53.600> clip<00:02:53.690> on<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.050> cryo<00:02:54.319> one<00:02:54.530> you<00:02:54.680> can

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
the pocket clip on the cryo one you can

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.530 
the pocket clip on the cryo one you can
see<00:02:54.950> it's<00:02:55.100> white<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.640> that's<00:02:56.150> actually<00:02:56.510> a

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
see it's white and that's actually a

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.040 
see it's white and that's actually a
print<00:02:56.900> whereas<00:02:57.350> on<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:58.040> cryo<00:02:58.760> -<00:02:58.910> that<00:02:59.660> is<00:02:59.900> an

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
print whereas on the cryo - that is an

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.420 
print whereas on the cryo - that is an
etched<00:03:00.260> Kershaw<00:03:01.130> logo<00:03:02.000> there<00:03:03.340> there's<00:03:04.340> a

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
etched Kershaw logo there there's a

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.390 
etched Kershaw logo there there's a
little<00:03:04.700> divot<00:03:05.569> on<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.620> frame<00:03:06.920> there<00:03:07.130> that

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
little divot on the frame there that

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.610 
little divot on the frame there that
allows<00:03:07.610> it<00:03:07.850> to<00:03:07.880> flex<00:03:08.180> that's<00:03:08.900> on<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.230> exterior

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
allows it to flex that's on the exterior

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.590 
allows it to flex that's on the exterior
on<00:03:09.799> the<00:03:09.860> cryo<00:03:10.100> one<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.610> it<00:03:11.120> is<00:03:11.299> on<00:03:11.480> the

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
on the cryo one and it is on the

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.759 
on the cryo one and it is on the
interior<00:03:12.260> on<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:13.040> cryo<00:03:13.310> too<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:14.680> there's<00:03:15.680> a

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
interior on the cryo too and there's a

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.759 
interior on the cryo too and there's a
little<00:03:15.980> bit<00:03:16.100> more<00:03:16.130> jimping<00:03:16.730> on<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:18.110> cryo<00:03:18.410> one

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
little bit more jimping on the cryo one

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.970 
little bit more jimping on the cryo one
and<00:03:19.100> on<00:03:19.579> the<00:03:19.610> cryo<00:03:19.970> too<00:03:20.410> but<00:03:21.410> those<00:03:21.650> are<00:03:21.950> the

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
and on the cryo too but those are the

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.699 
and on the cryo too but those are the
big<00:03:22.370> differences<00:03:22.780> as<00:03:23.780> far<00:03:24.049> as<00:03:24.170> pocket<00:03:24.560> clip

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
big differences as far as pocket clip

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.330 
big differences as far as pocket clip
close<00:03:25.070> it<00:03:25.430> is<00:03:25.940> tip<00:03:26.870> up<00:03:27.110> tip<00:03:27.410> down<00:03:27.650> right<00:03:28.130> or

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
close it is tip up tip down right or

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.949 
close it is tip up tip down right or
left<00:03:28.640> however<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.209> want<00:03:29.450> it<00:03:29.510> let<00:03:29.690> me<00:03:29.720> show<00:03:29.810> you

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
left however you want it let me show you

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.880 
left however you want it let me show you
what<00:03:30.110> that<00:03:30.680> looks<00:03:30.920> like<00:03:31.010> in<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.459> pocket<00:03:32.590> so<00:03:33.590> I

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
what that looks like in the pocket so I

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.080 
what that looks like in the pocket so I
put<00:03:34.220> in<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.640> cryo<00:03:35.200> -<00:03:36.200> the<00:03:36.590> larger<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.160> the

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
put in the cryo - the larger and the

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.710 
put in the cryo - the larger and the
cryo<00:03:38.329> one<00:03:38.600> right<00:03:38.810> next<00:03:38.989> to<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:39.700> so<00:03:40.700> if<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.690> have

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
cryo one right next to it so if you have

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.660 
cryo one right next to it so if you have
slightly<00:03:42.200> larger<00:03:42.560> hands<00:03:42.920> or<00:03:43.070> maybe<00:03:43.400> you<00:03:43.549> just

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
slightly larger hands or maybe you just

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.490 
slightly larger hands or maybe you just
like<00:03:43.850> a<00:03:43.910> larger<00:03:44.269> blade<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:44.989> go<00:03:45.260> with<00:03:45.470> that

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
like a larger blade and go with that

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.130 
like a larger blade and go with that
cryo<00:03:45.950> -<00:03:46.150> otherwise<00:03:47.150> you<00:03:47.420> can<00:03:47.570> get<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.840> cryo

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
cryo - otherwise you can get the cryo

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.390 
cryo - otherwise you can get the cryo
one<00:03:48.380> you<00:03:48.560> know<00:03:48.650> probably<00:03:49.040> suits<00:03:49.250> you<00:03:49.370> just

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400
