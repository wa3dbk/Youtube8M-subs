00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880 

so<00:00:00.450> imagine<00:00:00.659> now<00:00:00.930> we<00:00:00.989> wanted<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.380> have<00:00:01.500> a<00:00:01.530> power

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
so imagine now we wanted to have a power

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.730 
so imagine now we wanted to have a power
up<00:00:02.190> mode<00:00:02.490> of<00:00:02.850> our<00:00:03.060> princess<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.410> do<00:00:04.529> that<00:00:04.680> i

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
up mode of our princess and to do that i

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.940 
up mode of our princess and to do that i
would<00:00:04.950> just<00:00:05.100> duplicate<00:00:05.759> our<00:00:06.680> princess<00:00:07.680> and

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
would just duplicate our princess and

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.910 
would just duplicate our princess and
call<00:00:08.069> this<00:00:08.189> princess<00:00:08.750> power<00:00:09.750> up<00:00:10.050> go<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.769> edit

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
call this princess power up go to edit

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.850 
call this princess power up go to edit
sprite<00:00:11.370> she's<00:00:11.969> got<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.150> nice<00:00:12.360> slow<00:00:12.840> jog<00:00:13.349> there

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
sprite she's got a nice slow jog there

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.310 
sprite she's got a nice slow jog there
and<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.759> quickest<00:00:15.089> way<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.330> would<00:00:15.750> be<00:00:15.870> just<00:00:16.139> go

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
and the quickest way to would be just go

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.109 
and the quickest way to would be just go
to<00:00:16.379> animation<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.190> colorize<00:00:17.490> but<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:17.880> want<00:00:18.090> to

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
to animation and colorize but I want to

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.029 
to animation and colorize but I want to
speed<00:00:18.420> her<00:00:18.510> up<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.720> little<00:00:18.750> too<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:19.980> I'm

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
speed her up a little too and so I'm

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.370 
speed her up a little too and so I'm
going<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.250> go<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.430> animation<00:00:21.060> stretch<00:00:21.600> which

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
going to go to animation stretch which

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.779 
going to go to animation stretch which
is<00:00:22.500> not<00:00:22.650> going<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.800> stretch<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.279> image<00:00:23.609> it's

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
is not going to stretch the image it's

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.279 
is not going to stretch the image it's
going<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.970> stretch<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.689> length<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
going to stretch the length of the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.640 
going to stretch the length of the
animation<00:00:26.090> to<00:00:27.090> be<00:00:27.330> longer<00:00:27.689> or<00:00:27.720> shorter<00:00:27.930> not

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
animation to be longer or shorter not

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.919 
animation to be longer or shorter not
always<00:00:28.890> longer<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.179> I'm<00:00:30.300> going<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.449> cut<00:00:30.750> that

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
always longer so I'm going to cut that

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.010 
always longer so I'm going to cut that
in<00:00:31.140> half<00:00:31.640> which<00:00:32.640> will<00:00:32.790> effectively<00:00:33.239> speed<00:00:33.840> her

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
in half which will effectively speed her

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.130 
in half which will effectively speed her
up<00:00:34.050> by<00:00:34.440> two<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.790> now<00:00:36.570> i'm<00:00:36.780> going<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.930> go<00:00:37.079> to

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
up by two and now i'm going to go to

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.319 
up by two and now i'm going to go to
animation<00:00:37.800> color<00:00:38.129> eyes<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.059> could<00:00:39.239> have

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
animation color eyes and I could have

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.080 
animation color eyes and I could have
gone<00:00:39.450> here<00:00:39.780> from<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> beginning<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.090> let's

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
gone here from the beginning and let's

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.180 
gone here from the beginning and let's
say<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.300> want<00:00:42.600> her<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.780> jump<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.530> yeah<00:00:43.890> that's<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
say I want her to jump to yeah that's a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.340 
say I want her to jump to yeah that's a
nice<00:00:44.309> bright<00:00:44.730> color<00:00:44.760> I'm<00:00:45.690> colorblind<00:00:46.020> I

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
nice bright color I'm colorblind I

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.529 
nice bright color I'm colorblind I
really<00:00:46.559> don't<00:00:46.739> know<00:00:46.800> now<00:00:47.700> how<00:00:47.879> many<00:00:47.940> frames<00:00:48.300> is

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
really don't know now how many frames is

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.260 
really don't know now how many frames is
that<00:00:48.690> going<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.899> happen<00:00:49.050> over<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:50.610> higher<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
that going to happen over the higher the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.430 
that going to happen over the higher the
number<00:00:51.390> here<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> longer<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.230> going<00:00:52.350> to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
number here the longer it's going to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.130 
number here the longer it's going to
take<00:00:52.530> for<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> animation<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.399> happen<00:00:53.820> and

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
take for the animation to happen and

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.240 
take for the animation to happen and
there<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.289> see<00:00:55.410> are<00:00:55.649> going<00:00:55.920> from<00:00:56.070> this

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
there you can see are going from this

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.549 
there you can see are going from this
color<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.449> then<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.660> jumps<00:00:58.140> back<00:00:58.379> to

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
color to this and then it jumps back to

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.840 
color to this and then it jumps back to
the<00:00:58.680> beginning<00:00:58.800> which<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> little<00:00:59.699> awkward

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the beginning which is a little awkward

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.849 
the beginning which is a little awkward
and<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.989> if<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.199> want<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> little

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
and so if you want it to be a little

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.920 
and so if you want it to be a little
smoother<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.699> add<00:01:02.940> reverse<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> end

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
smoother you can add reverse to the end

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.920 
smoother you can add reverse to the end
which<00:01:04.710> will<00:01:04.890> then<00:01:05.070> make<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.610> go<00:01:05.760> back<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
which will then make it go back to the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.859 
which will then make it go back to the
original<00:01:07.320> color<00:01:07.560> which<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> nice<00:01:08.250> smooth

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
original color which is a nice smooth

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.260 
original color which is a nice smooth
transitioning<00:01:09.869> color<00:01:10.140> there<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.970> it's

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
transitioning color there and it's

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.940 
transitioning color there and it's
actually<00:01:12.420> now<00:01:12.750> back<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.110> its<00:01:13.260> original<00:01:13.380> speed

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
actually now back to its original speed

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.590 
actually now back to its original speed
since<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.310> cut<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.700> half<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.210> then<00:01:15.270> doubled

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
since I cut it in half and then doubled

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.940 
since I cut it in half and then doubled
it<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:18.030> that's<00:01:18.210> an<00:01:18.360> easy<00:01:18.509> way<00:01:18.720> excuse<00:01:19.560> me<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.799> do

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
it so that's an easy way excuse me to do

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.070 
it so that's an easy way excuse me to do
that<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:21.090> course<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.420> could<00:01:21.540> always<00:01:21.659> paint

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
that of course you could always paint

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.609 
that of course you could always paint
your<00:01:22.259> own<00:01:22.290> sprites<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:22.979> such<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.759> like

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
your own sprites and such but I like

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.789 
your own sprites and such but I like
editing<00:01:25.619> existing<00:01:26.130> sprites<00:01:27.530> because<00:01:28.530> I'm<00:01:28.680> not

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
editing existing sprites because I'm not

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.679 
editing existing sprites because I'm not
that<00:01:28.950> good<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.250> drawer<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.549> 8-bit<00:01:30.030> for

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
that good of a drawer in 8-bit for

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.499 
that good of a drawer in 8-bit for
making<00:01:30.960> backgrounds<00:01:31.829> similarly<00:01:32.820> let's<00:01:33.299> call

this<00:01:57.719> way<00:01:57.960> down<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:59.130> going<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.729> get<00:02:00.299> darker

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
this way down it's going to get darker

this way down it's going to get darker
the<00:02:00.930> more<00:02:01.110> times<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.530> go<00:02:01.590> over<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:02.939> a

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
the more times you go over it so it's a

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.150 
the more times you go over it so it's a
little<00:02:03.060> more<00:02:03.360> natural-looking<00:02:04.340> look<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:06.270> oops

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.040 
over there and if we tell it to stretch
it<00:02:54.280> will<00:02:54.489> take<00:02:54.970> that<00:02:55.120> one<00:02:55.360> piece<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.900> just
