 and where everyone prides themselves on being 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.960
 find today for a new 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.640
 episode of weekly fashion and for this 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.710
 episode I chose a mode a little bit 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.910
 special since he's not going to party 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.560
 directly rolls to the long island in 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.720
 dragon who attack me who will not wear 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.239
 directly on the world minecraft in 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.120
 himself but on the lnder that sometimes beats 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.710
 well then you get bored somewhat apart bah 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.239
 here you are helander dragon is a little 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.340
 thunder hunt announces me a little shit 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.039
 in this world which is a little city and 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.489
 him and so so here is this mode he 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.079
 this is under gold allows him ball 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.000
 as the name indicated to add 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.760
 various minerals and other things too 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.100
 in the aisne of hours so well I'm going 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.780
 explain immediately what has 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.979
 add in this mode and then we will see 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.300
 a fight so that knew so bah the 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.160
 leman and of course obviously the most 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.599
 added the most important in the mode 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.950
 it is the ore of aid that is 

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:14.940
 present like that in the violated form a 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.890
 little bit like the diamond 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.869
 it is findable everywhere there 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.090
 you see I put it here but there is 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.200
 was there we had it there too 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.940
 have added a little more for you see 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.149
 but the color but from everywhere a 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.069
 ca ca not find so all that's going to you 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.500
 allow to create various tools and 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.630
 hangs so you see we can create 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.000
 all this this your opinion which all the blocks 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.869
 to stop it thujone it's one of his 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.060
 friends 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.099
 So here we go with this one 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.039
 can harvest it with a pickaxe 

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:46.289
 diamonds and then melt it 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:50.400
 in an oven at its basics and we're going 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:52.440
 recover the ingot of bender what 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.090
 and with that we will be able to create 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.640
 tools as you see different 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.680
 tools then you have to know that the tools 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.040
 lasts three times longer than those 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.020
 in diamonds and 175 percent more times 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.930
 fast so it's really not so smart 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.729
 you like or something else 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.080
 well it's really really cool because 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.030
 that it lasts a long time and then are very 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.260
 very fast it's almost lower 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.360
 it's the speed of diamonds so it's 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.300
 no it's faster than the diamond 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.730
 so it's almost instantaneous 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.870
 we can also create launder blocks so 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.750
 it's the same, it's like a block of 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.270
 diamonds oven m you m nine small 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.030
 bullion in the craft that is otherwise bah 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.560
 all the others what they're going all the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.120
 other tools normally crashes in 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.970
 the exception that also you can see 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.709
 the mode adds a wood of India 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.209
 you see it's a little bit of wood 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.220
 green with a little green filter 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.450
 disgusting by the way and I do not know if 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.560
 it is the step of the book which I believe 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.750
 it's like that gives in those like 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.390
 that and so see it is in the 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.000
 NPC villages since yes the villages 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.440
 of pnj spawn now with this mode 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.600
 in the aisne the eure saw the animal 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.800
 as there are three small three small 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.440
 buildings it's a little lonely and even 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.510
 by the way with a weird little clue 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.790
 and so down were able to recover the wood a 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.550
 little radio abscissa so we can say that 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.440
 like that and who will give you my voice 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.000
 like that and with this wood it works like 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.130
 the normal wood you can do some 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.080
 boards of stairs and sticks and 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.830
 so to make the tools there are going to have to 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.150
 obviously a dance ingot and a stick 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.220
 radioactive one month around her here it is 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.620
 we also want to make the string that will 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.200
 also serve for the art clark of india 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.930
 who is he he is much more 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.940
 powerful it is more powerful there is a 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.170
 better reach per donation is a lot 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.730
 faster to shoot you see we can 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.630
 to shoot that is it's me anyway even 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.580
 spammant amsif pull them 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.010
 I let sink down long it's going 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.050
 follow am not far we will not kill 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.860
 that you have entered sierre and so is 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.440
 here we also have the armor 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.150
 hand who she cladding her like the 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.090
 armor diamonds but are three times 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.490
 more resistant so I really sahel 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.590
 these little diamond jumpers that becomes the 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.930
 priority ore in the game of which 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.100
 mike hart is now it's the 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.650
 ore of the aisne this is simply 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.540
 like that it will add a little more a 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.360
 little more interest in visiting them wool 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.430
 because frankly low it serves a little 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.670
 nothing frankly not much to 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.790
 make 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.920
 so here we also have the coal the 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.350
 aid charcoal that looks like 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.239
 Coal coal along like normal 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.640
 neck him we recover with a pickaxe and 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.860
 he can cook sixteen items 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.690
 unlike normal coal which can 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.960
 to cook only 8 so the 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.910
 double what's so great it's 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.110
 much more practical also at 90 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.120
 much less because good if you 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.470
 remember you want to cook a 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.800
 large number 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:44.450
 so here we must also know that the 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:48.140
 block dender this one can serve also 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:50.480
 for the beacon so that's you in 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.800
 also serve to create it but hey 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.430
 it's not very much it's not very 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.070
 very useful here so that's all that 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.360
 I had to say about this mode which I hope 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:04.670
 will you be pleased then you will find a 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.300
 forgiveness excuse to make you visit 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.680
 this little place that is lÃ¤nder if you 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.660
 find the portal because it's a 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.710
 little bitch find and bah I hope that 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.530
 you will have liked it 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.810
 do not hesitate where the bubble that goes 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.370
 pardon do not hesitate to propose wii 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.070
 in the comments of the art modes to 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.660
 test because it's also you too 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.610
 you want special modes if you 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.320
 have good fashion I will not get them 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.419
 forward I would finally hate this 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.550
 would be a video on it without a problem and 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.550
 jamoye on this plague and at the next 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.360
 Javaux
