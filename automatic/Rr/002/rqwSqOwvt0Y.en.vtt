how's that side right there but we've

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.860 
how's that side right there but we've
pretty<00:03:09.709> much<00:03:10.010> completed<00:03:10.579> the<00:03:11.090> areas<00:03:11.540> that

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
pretty much completed the areas that

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.559 
pretty much completed the areas that
were<00:03:12.620> problematic<00:03:14.200> we<00:03:15.200> put<00:03:15.409> the<00:03:15.530> strips<00:03:15.890> down

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
were problematic we put the strips down

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.030 
were problematic we put the strips down
the<00:03:17.569> mesh<00:03:17.780> strips<00:03:18.079> with<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.379> adhesive<00:03:18.680> and

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
the mesh strips with the adhesive and

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.819 
the mesh strips with the adhesive and
went<00:03:19.220> over<00:03:19.459> them<00:03:19.610> again<00:03:19.750> with<00:03:20.750> adhesives<00:03:21.439> we

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
went over them again with adhesives we

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.289 
went over them again with adhesives we
have<00:03:22.010> just<00:03:22.310> this<00:03:22.489> one<00:03:22.790> we<00:03:23.599> just<00:03:23.900> have<00:03:24.109> this<00:03:24.349> one

have just this one we just have this one

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.899 
have just this one we just have this one
side<00:03:26.299> to<00:03:26.569> finish<00:03:26.900> up<00:03:27.310> then<00:03:28.310> we'll<00:03:28.579> come<00:03:28.730> back

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
side to finish up then we'll come back

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.580

don't<00:03:57.049> want<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.379> be<00:03:57.530> slow<00:03:57.889> or<00:03:58.370> stop<00:03:58.790> lag<00:03:59.720> behind

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
don't want to be slow or stop lag behind

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.509 
don't want to be slow or stop lag behind
because<00:04:00.700> this<00:04:02.049> adhesive<00:04:03.049> cement<00:04:03.920> dries

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
because this adhesive cement dries

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.729 
because this adhesive cement dries
pretty<00:04:05.030> quickly<00:04:05.150> especially<00:04:05.689> in<00:04:06.139> the<00:04:06.260> Texas

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
pretty quickly especially in the Texas

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.680 
pretty quickly especially in the Texas
heat<00:04:09.129> okay<00:04:10.129> we<00:04:10.310> put<00:04:10.549> the<00:04:10.760> white<00:04:10.940> column<00:04:11.510> here

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
heat okay we put the white column here

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.770 
heat okay we put the white column here
down<00:04:12.049> on<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:13.040> plywood<00:04:13.430> roofing<00:04:14.329> and<00:04:14.540> now

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
down on the plywood roofing and now

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.349 
down on the plywood roofing and now
we're<00:04:15.199> rolling<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.680> membrane<00:04:16.220> down<00:04:16.459> over<00:04:17.150> top

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
we're rolling the membrane down over top

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.689 
we're rolling the membrane down over top
of<00:04:17.389> that<00:04:17.829> then<00:04:18.829> we'll<00:04:19.130> coat<00:04:19.370> it<00:04:19.519> with<00:04:19.669> a

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
of that then we'll coat it with a

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.680 
of that then we'll coat it with a
polymer<00:04:20.180> again<00:04:20.750> on<00:04:21.019> top

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
polymer again on top

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.500 
polymer again on top
we<00:04:23.690> cut<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.050> fabric<00:04:24.320> to<00:04:24.740> go<00:04:24.919> around<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.669> vent

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
we cut the fabric to go around the vent

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.909 
we cut the fabric to go around the vent
and<00:04:26.900> then<00:04:27.620> applied<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.639> polymer<00:04:29.389> then<00:04:30.199> the

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
and then applied the polymer then the

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.820 
and then applied the polymer then the
membrane<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.699> more<00:04:32.300> palling<00:04:32.750> there<00:04:32.930> you<00:04:33.680> can

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
membrane and more palling there you can

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:43.329 
membrane and more palling there you can
see<00:04:34.099> it<00:04:34.190> worked<00:04:34.370> out<00:04:34.520> really<00:04:34.789> well

00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:43.339 

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:46.519 

it's<00:04:44.339> been<00:04:44.519> several<00:04:44.879> days<00:04:45.059> later<00:04:45.289> the<00:04:46.289> weather

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:46.529 
it's been several days later the weather
