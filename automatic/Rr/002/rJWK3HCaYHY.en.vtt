00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
have it was run an SLI it just felt like

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.140 
have it was run an SLI it just felt like
a<00:01:04.470> quick<00:01:04.710> size<00:01:04.949> comparison<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.729> see<00:01:06.000> this

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
a quick size comparison you can see this

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.090 
a quick size comparison you can see this
is<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.540> little<00:01:06.810> bit<00:01:06.900> longer<00:01:07.140> but

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
is just a little bit longer but

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.200 
is just a little bit longer but
definitely<00:01:08.460> make<00:01:08.549> sure<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:08.970> room<00:01:09.150> in

your case for these big cards this card
does<00:01:11.460> feature<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.850> three<00:01:12.180> PCI<00:01:12.570> slot<00:01:12.990> design<00:01:13.380> so

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
does feature a three PCI slot design so

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
does feature a three PCI slot design so
keep<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.340> mind<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:14.700> you're<00:01:14.820> thinking

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
keep that in mind if you're thinking

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.330 
keep that in mind if you're thinking
about<00:01:15.180> SLI<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.200> comes<00:01:16.470> standard<00:01:16.860> with<00:01:17.009> two

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
BVI's display for an HDMI output so keep

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.969 
BVI's display for an HDMI output so keep
that<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.460> mind<00:01:23.549> if<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.390> are<00:01:24.860> interested<00:01:25.860> in

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that in mind if you are interested in

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.649 
that in mind if you are interested in
running<00:01:26.189> SLI<00:01:26.790> you're<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.360> need<00:01:27.479> more

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
running SLI you're going to need more

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.899 
running SLI you're going to need more
room<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.020> your<00:01:28.049> case<00:01:28.700> you're<00:01:29.700> enough<00:01:29.820> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
room in your case you're enough to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.700 
room in your case you're enough to
double<00:01:30.180> space<00:01:30.299> because<00:01:31.110> these<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.439> take<00:01:31.619> up

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
double space because these do take up

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.370 
double space because these do take up
three<00:01:31.950> PCI<00:01:32.369> slot<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.850> eat<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
three PCI slot to eat as you can see the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.870 
three PCI slot to eat as you can see the
fans<00:01:34.590> don't<00:01:34.860> necessarily<00:01:35.369> stick<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.700> high

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
fans don't necessarily stick up high

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.090 
fans don't necessarily stick up high
enough<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.329> take<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.990> room<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.500> three<00:01:37.740> PCI

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
enough to take up the room of three PCI

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.490 
enough to take up the room of three PCI
slots<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> bracket<00:01:39.299> does<00:01:39.869> take<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.259> three

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
slots but the bracket does take up three

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.530 
slots but the bracket does take up three
PCI<00:01:40.890> slots<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.520> keep<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.880> mind<00:01:41.970> perhaps

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
PCI slots so keep that in mind perhaps

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.749 
PCI slots so keep that in mind perhaps
it's<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:43.079> support<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.189> side<00:01:44.460> view<00:01:44.729> here

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
it's just for support the side view here

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.580 
it's just for support the side view here
you<00:01:45.000> can<00:01:45.240> get<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> nice<00:01:45.570> view<00:01:45.630> all<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.380> very

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
you can get a nice view all the very

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.740 
you can get a nice view all the very
large<00:01:46.890> copper<00:01:47.670> heat<00:01:47.850> pipes<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.299> are<00:01:48.360> running

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
large copper heat pipes that are running

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.679 
large copper heat pipes that are running
through<00:01:48.960> for<00:01:49.320> cooling<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:51.030> see<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.509> is

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
through for cooling as you can see it is

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.679 
through for cooling as you can see it is
a<00:01:52.439> three<00:01:52.890> slot<00:01:53.159> design<00:01:53.549> but<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> fan<00:01:54.299> does<00:01:54.479> not

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
a three slot design but the fan does not

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.910 
a three slot design but the fan does not
stick<00:01:54.930> up<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.259> high<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.740> may<00:01:55.860> be

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
stick up that high so it may be

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.570 
stick up that high so it may be
unnecessary<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:56.880> they

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
unnecessary and they

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.900 
unnecessary and they
-<00:01:58.150> into<00:01:58.390> a<00:01:58.420> two<00:01:58.630> slot<00:01:58.900> design<00:01:59.290> but<00:02:00.160> I<00:02:00.190> wouldn't

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
- into a two slot design but I wouldn't

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.850 
- into a two slot design but I wouldn't
buy<00:02:01.150> it<00:02:01.210> thinking<00:02:01.720> that<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:01.990> could<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:02.500> quick

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
buy it thinking that you could a quick

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.230 
buy it thinking that you could a quick
look<00:02:03.010> at<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.190> top<00:02:03.370> of<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.580> card<00:02:03.790> here<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.090> can

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
look at the top of the card here you can

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.270 
look at the top of the card here you can
see<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.480> does<00:02:04.660> support<00:02:04.870> -<00:02:05.290> in<00:02:05.470> three-way<00:02:05.950> and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
see it does support - in three-way and

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.450 
see it does support - in three-way and
four-way<00:02:06.340> SLI<00:02:07.120> I<00:02:07.950> don't<00:02:08.950> know<00:02:09.040> how<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:09.220> can<00:02:09.369> do

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
four-way SLI I don't know how you can do

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
but it does support full that's a lie

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.980 
but it does support full that's a lie
you<00:02:15.400> can<00:02:15.550> see<00:02:15.910> another<00:02:16.090> V<00:02:16.300> low<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.540> heat<00:02:16.720> pipes

here the three fans how it goes across

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.880 
here the three fans how it goes across
and<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:20.200> card<00:02:20.980> does<00:02:21.250> require<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:22.530> an<00:02:23.530> eight

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
and this card does require a an eight

quick<00:02:28.270> look<00:02:28.420> at<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.600> backside<00:02:29.020> here<00:02:29.080> there<00:02:29.680> is

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
quick look at the backside here there is

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.500 
quick look at the backside here there is
no<00:02:29.950> heat<00:02:30.190> sinks<00:02:30.520> on<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.730> RAM<00:02:30.910> chips<00:02:31.240> on<00:02:31.420> the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
no heat sinks on the RAM chips on the

so this is just exposed and you can see

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.730 
so this is just exposed and you can see
the<00:02:36.430> cooling<00:02:36.790> solution<00:02:37.180> does<00:02:37.360> stick<00:02:37.600> out<00:02:37.750> past

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
fans to keep things cool so this should

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.740 
fans to keep things cool so this should
be<00:03:17.140> more<00:03:17.350> than<00:03:17.530> enough<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:18.550> keep<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.540> card

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
be more than enough to keep the card

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.479

plus<00:03:21.730> with<00:03:21.910> this<00:03:21.970> case<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:22.630> don't<00:03:23.080> think<00:03:23.290> we'll

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
plus with this case I don't think we'll

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:33.300 
plus with this case I don't think we'll
have<00:03:23.470> any<00:03:24.040> problems<00:03:27.420> install<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.600> here

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.860 

one<00:03:34.310> thing<00:03:34.489> I<00:03:34.580> do<00:03:34.640> like<00:03:34.879> about<00:03:34.940> this<00:03:35.300> case<00:03:35.569> is

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
one thing I do like about this case is

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.690 
one thing I do like about this case is
it<00:03:35.989> does<00:03:36.200> have<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:37.190> tool<00:03:38.150> list<00:03:38.420> PCI<00:03:39.700> slot

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
it does have the tool list PCI slot

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.330 
it does have the tool list PCI slot
holders<00:03:41.150> which<00:03:42.110> is<00:03:42.290> great<00:03:42.590> as<00:03:42.800> you<00:03:42.920> can<00:03:43.069> see<00:03:43.220> we

holders which is great as you can see we

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.670 
holders which is great as you can see we
got<00:03:43.459> more<00:03:43.760> than<00:03:43.879> ample<00:03:44.300> room<00:03:44.540> here<00:03:44.930> for<00:03:45.140> the

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
got more than ample room here for the

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.660 
got more than ample room here for the
card<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.459> now<00:03:47.060> we<00:03:47.120> just<00:03:47.360> have<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:47.780> connect
