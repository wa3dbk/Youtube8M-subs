violently with Ike meetings here I got

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.560 
violently with Ike meetings here I got
the<00:04:36.600> I<00:04:37.460> showed<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:38.580> guys<00:04:38.640> this<00:04:39.030> in<00:04:39.090> my<00:04:39.450> other

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
the I showed you guys this in my other

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.320 
the I showed you guys this in my other
video<00:04:39.870> when<00:04:40.080> I<00:04:40.110> thought<00:04:40.350> I<00:04:40.410> was<00:04:40.560> getting<00:04:40.860> the

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
video when I thought I was getting the

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.150 
video when I thought I was getting the
Phenom<00:04:42.330> -<00:04:42.600> but<00:04:42.990> my<00:04:43.050> motherboard<00:04:43.350> sucks<00:04:43.890> for

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
Phenom - but my motherboard sucks for

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.520 
Phenom - but my motherboard sucks for
the<00:04:44.610> Phenom<00:04:44.880> 2<00:04:45.120> x6<00:04:45.540> processor<00:04:46.170> I<00:04:46.200> should<00:04:46.380> say

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
the Phenom 2 x6 processor I should say

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.790 
the Phenom 2 x6 processor I should say
the<00:04:46.650> six<00:04:46.860> core<00:04:47.180> 1100<00:04:48.180> T<00:04:48.360> I<00:04:48.630> was<00:04:49.320> getting<00:04:49.650> this

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
the six core 1100 T I was getting this

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.350 
the six core 1100 T I was getting this
because<00:04:50.040> I<00:04:50.070> wanted<00:04:50.340> to<00:04:50.400> state<00:04:50.700> do<00:04:51.000> a<00:04:51.030> state

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
because I wanted to state do a state

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.040 
because I wanted to state do a state
will<00:04:51.480> overclock<00:04:51.840> on<00:04:51.960> it<00:04:52.320> my<00:04:52.860> motherboard

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
will overclock on it my motherboard

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.360 
will overclock on it my motherboard
wouldn't<00:04:55.050> overclock<00:04:55.560> at<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:55.830> wage<00:04:56.010> should<00:04:56.310> be

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
wouldn't overclock at the wage should be

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.960 
wouldn't overclock at the wage should be
overclocked<00:04:56.940> so<00:04:57.440> yeah<00:04:58.440> I<00:04:58.800> mean<00:04:59.610> I'm<00:04:59.730> getting<00:04:59.850> a

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
overclocked so yeah I mean I'm getting a

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.950 
overclocked so yeah I mean I'm getting a
refund<00:05:00.300> on<00:05:00.510> that<00:05:00.690> processor<00:05:01.230> but<00:05:01.440> here<00:05:01.740> is<00:05:01.890> the

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
refund on that processor but here is the

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.450 
refund on that processor but here is the
CPU<00:05:03.960> cooler<00:05:04.790> the<00:05:05.790> hyper<00:05:06.030> 212<00:05:06.419> Evo<00:05:07.280> I'm<00:05:08.280> not

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
CPU cooler the hyper 212 Evo I'm not

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.159 
CPU cooler the hyper 212 Evo I'm not
gonna<00:05:08.610> take<00:05:08.880> it<00:05:08.910> out<00:05:09.150> I<00:05:09.180> was<00:05:09.360> gonna<00:05:09.480> return<00:05:09.990> it

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
gonna take it out I was gonna return it

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.610 
gonna take it out I was gonna return it
when<00:05:10.380> I<00:05:10.440> returned<00:05:10.950> the<00:05:11.990> processor<00:05:12.990> like<00:05:13.500> I

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
when I returned the processor like I

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.690 
when I returned the processor like I
said<00:05:13.800> when<00:05:13.919> I<00:05:13.950> found<00:05:14.190> out<00:05:14.310> it<00:05:14.370> wouldn't<00:05:14.580> work

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
said when I found out it wouldn't work

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.980 
said when I found out it wouldn't work
right<00:05:14.760> with<00:05:15.030> my<00:05:15.180> motherboard<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.840> way<00:05:15.960> I

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
right with my motherboard the way I

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.780 
right with my motherboard the way I
wanted<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.560> when<00:05:16.680> it<00:05:16.770> came<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:17.010> overclocking<00:05:17.640> I

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
wanted to when it came to overclocking I

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.210 
wanted to when it came to overclocking I
was<00:05:18.300> gonna<00:05:18.419> turn<00:05:18.720> this<00:05:19.440> when<00:05:19.710> I<00:05:19.740> returned<00:05:20.100> the

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
was gonna turn this when I returned the

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.940 
was gonna turn this when I returned the
six<00:05:20.430> core<00:05:20.610> processor<00:05:21.240> but<00:05:21.620> if<00:05:22.620> I'm<00:05:22.770> getting

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
six core processor but if I'm getting

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.520 
six core processor but if I'm getting
another<00:05:23.280> rig<00:05:23.580> this<00:05:24.240> this<00:05:24.630> thing<00:05:24.840> is<00:05:24.960> beast<00:05:25.230> man

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
another rig this this thing is beast man

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.120 
another rig this this thing is beast man
it's<00:05:25.680> only<00:05:25.830> 33<00:05:26.460> bucks<00:05:26.700> and<00:05:27.320> you<00:05:28.320> can<00:05:28.350> this<00:05:28.950> is

cooling like I do really sweet has 120

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.340 
cooling like I do really sweet has 120
millimeter<00:05:35.130> fan<00:05:35.460> on<00:05:35.700> it<00:05:35.960> you<00:05:36.960> have<00:05:37.050> the<00:05:37.169> heat

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
millimeter fan on it you have the heat

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.530 
millimeter fan on it you have the heat
pipes<00:05:37.590> make<00:05:37.830> direct<00:05:38.190> contact<00:05:38.370> with<00:05:38.820> the<00:05:39.000> CPU

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
pipes make direct contact with the CPU

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.630 
pipes make direct contact with the CPU
and<00:05:39.780> they<00:05:40.290> had<00:05:40.440> an<00:05:40.590> older<00:05:40.979> model<00:05:41.220> of<00:05:41.520> this

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
and they had an older model of this

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.290 
and they had an older model of this
where<00:05:42.330> the<00:05:42.450> pipes<00:05:42.950> weren't<00:05:43.950> flat<00:05:44.580> where<00:05:45.180> the

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
where the pipes weren't flat where the

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.240 
where the pipes weren't flat where the
word<00:05:45.450> touched<00:05:45.780> the<00:05:46.020> pipes<00:05:46.290> touched<00:05:46.620> the<00:05:46.740> CPU

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
word touched the pipes touched the CPU

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.430 
word touched the pipes touched the CPU
there<00:05:47.880> were<00:05:48.000> gaps<00:05:48.330> in<00:05:48.570> between<00:05:48.930> so<00:05:49.200> it

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
there were gaps in between so it

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.030 
there were gaps in between so it
wouldn't<00:05:49.710> actually<00:05:51.140> cool<00:05:52.140> it<00:05:52.290> the<00:05:52.620> best<00:05:52.830> it

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
wouldn't actually cool it the best it

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.800 
wouldn't actually cool it the best it
could<00:05:53.220> because<00:05:53.610> it<00:05:53.760> wasn't<00:05:54.060> it<00:05:54.330> wasn't<00:05:54.540> the

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
could because it wasn't it wasn't the

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.260 
could because it wasn't it wasn't the
heat<00:05:55.800> pipes<00:05:56.040> were<00:05:56.220> evenly<00:05:56.640> distributed

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
heat pipes were evenly distributed

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.990 
heat pipes were evenly distributed
across<00:05:57.780> the<00:05:58.169> CPU<00:05:58.650> now<00:05:58.830> they<00:05:59.070> remedied<00:05:59.520> that<00:05:59.700> so

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
across the CPU now they remedied that so

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.460 
across the CPU now they remedied that so
this<00:06:00.120> thing<00:06:00.419> is<00:06:00.690> just<00:06:02.150> for<00:06:03.150> air<00:06:03.540> cooling<00:06:04.020> it's

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
this thing is just for air cooling it's

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.830 
this thing is just for air cooling it's
delicious<00:06:05.130> so<00:06:05.160> it's<00:06:06.120> the<00:06:06.210> best<00:06:06.419> way<00:06:06.600> I<00:06:06.630> could

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840
