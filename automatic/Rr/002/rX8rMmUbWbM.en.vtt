00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.549 
the simple syrup so first I'm going to
measure<00:00:56.440> out<00:00:56.590> 1<00:00:56.949> cup<00:00:57.219> of<00:00:57.370> sugar<00:00:57.550> and<00:00:58.140> then<00:00:59.140> 1

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
measure out 1 cup of sugar and then 1

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.229

cup<00:00:59.590> of<00:00:59.920> water

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.030 

and<00:01:04.239> now<00:01:05.080> it's<00:01:05.260> time<00:01:05.440> to<00:01:05.560> go<00:01:05.650> over<00:01:05.770> to<00:01:05.920> the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
and now it's time to go over to the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.510 
and now it's time to go over to the
stove<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.590> we<00:01:11.710> have<00:01:11.860> our<00:01:11.890> mixture<00:01:12.220> of<00:01:12.490> sugar

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
stove so we have our mixture of sugar

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.359 
stove so we have our mixture of sugar
and<00:01:13.090> water<00:01:13.450> on<00:01:13.780> medium-high<00:01:14.290> heat<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:14.860> the

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
and water on medium-high heat and the

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:16.950 
and water on medium-high heat and the
point<00:01:15.610> here<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:15.850> just<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.270> get<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.540> sugar<00:01:16.690> to

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
point here is just to get the sugar to

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.570 
point here is just to get the sugar to
dissolve<00:01:17.050> completely<00:01:17.470> in<00:01:17.979> the<00:01:18.010> water<00:01:18.280> I'm

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
dissolve completely in the water I'm

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.670 
dissolve completely in the water I'm
also<00:01:18.970> going<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:19.270> add<00:01:19.390> my<00:01:19.630> ginger<00:01:20.050> after<00:01:20.500> it

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
also going to add my ginger after it

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.620 
also going to add my ginger after it
boils<00:01:20.890> and<00:01:21.310> then<00:01:21.520> I'm<00:01:21.640> going<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:22.090> steep<00:01:22.390> this

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
boils and then I'm going to steep this

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.600 
boils and then I'm going to steep this
all<00:01:22.810> together<00:01:23.020> so<00:01:23.440> that<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:24.009> ginger<00:01:24.340> really

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
all together so that the ginger really

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.700 
all together so that the ginger really
infuses<00:01:25.119> into<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:25.540> simple<00:01:25.840> syrup<00:01:26.110> then<00:01:26.530> we're

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
infuses into the simple syrup then we're

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.530 
infuses into the simple syrup then we're
going<00:01:26.800> to<00:01:26.860> move<00:01:26.920> this<00:01:27.280> over<00:01:27.520> to<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:28.270> fridge

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
going to move this over to the fridge

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.969 
going to move this over to the fridge
and<00:01:28.570> we're<00:01:28.960> going<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.350> allow<00:01:29.470> it<00:01:29.710> to<00:01:29.740> cool

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
and we're going to allow it to cool

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.710 
and we're going to allow it to cool
completely<00:01:30.190> before<00:01:30.550> adding<00:01:31.090> it<00:01:31.149> to<00:01:31.210> our<00:01:31.330> drink

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
completely before adding it to our drink

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.060 
completely before adding it to our drink
and<00:01:31.899> just<00:01:32.080> come<00:01:32.200> back<00:01:32.320> to<00:01:32.500> it<00:01:32.590> later<00:01:32.619> when<00:01:32.920> it's

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
and just come back to it later when it's

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.700 
and just come back to it later when it's
cooled<00:01:33.509> now<00:01:34.509> that<00:01:34.720> our<00:01:34.810> simple<00:01:35.140> syrup<00:01:35.410> is<00:01:35.530> nice

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
cooled now that our simple syrup is nice

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.950 
cooled now that our simple syrup is nice
and<00:01:35.890> cool<00:01:36.100> it's<00:01:36.399> time<00:01:36.580> to<00:01:36.759> make<00:01:37.060> our<00:01:37.180> drink<00:01:37.479> so

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.990 
reason that I zest the lemon is because
that's<00:01:45.160> going<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.369> give<00:01:45.490> a<00:01:45.520> more<00:01:45.670> intense

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
that's going to give a more intense

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.999 
that's going to give a more intense
flavor<00:01:46.360> than<00:01:46.600> just<00:01:46.780> juicing<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.350> lemon<00:01:47.649> alone

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
flavor than just juicing the lemon alone

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.190 
flavor than just juicing the lemon alone
so<00:01:48.820> next<00:01:49.119> we're<00:01:49.300> going<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.450> cut<00:01:49.660> our<00:01:49.780> lemon<00:01:50.080> in

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
so next we're going to cut our lemon in

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.460 
so next we're going to cut our lemon in
half<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:54.450> then<00:01:55.450> we're<00:01:55.660> going<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:55.929> juice<00:01:56.259> it

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
half and then we're going to juice it

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.260 
half and then we're going to juice it
and<00:01:56.710> it's<00:01:57.070> okay<00:01:57.340> if<00:01:57.399> you<00:01:57.490> get<00:01:57.580> seeds<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.090> there

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
and it's okay if you get seeds in there

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.580 
and it's okay if you get seeds in there
because<00:01:58.479> we're<00:01:58.840> going<00:01:59.050> to<00:01:59.110> strain<00:01:59.380> it<00:01:59.410> out

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
because we're going to strain it out

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.260 
because we're going to strain it out
before<00:01:59.830> we<00:02:00.220> finish<00:02:00.460> making<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:00.850> drink<00:02:01.090> and

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
before we finish making the drink and

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.630 
before we finish making the drink and
then<00:02:01.869> I'm<00:02:01.990> going<00:02:02.259> to<00:02:02.289> cut<00:02:02.710> this<00:02:02.860> limit<00:02:03.190> up<00:02:03.280> into

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
then I'm going to cut this limit up into

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.070 
then I'm going to cut this limit up into
wedges<00:02:03.789> and<00:02:04.179> add<00:02:04.509> the<00:02:04.690> wedges<00:02:05.050> to<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.470> mixture

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
wedges and add the wedges to the mixture

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.600 
wedges and add the wedges to the mixture
now<00:02:08.080> I'm<00:02:08.200> going<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.470> add<00:02:08.590> my<00:02:08.770> lemon<00:02:09.069> zest<00:02:11.610> so

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
now I'm going to add my lemon zest so

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.460 
now I'm going to add my lemon zest so
now<00:02:12.849> that<00:02:12.880> our<00:02:13.120> lemon<00:02:13.390> is<00:02:13.510> in<00:02:13.660> we're<00:02:14.050> going<00:02:14.290> to

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
now that our lemon is in we're going to

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.199 
now that our lemon is in we're going to
muddle<00:02:14.770> everything<00:02:15.280> together<00:02:15.459> while<00:02:15.910> adding

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
muddle everything together while adding

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.360 
muddle everything together while adding
our<00:02:16.300> simple<00:02:16.599> syrup<00:02:16.870> what<00:02:17.349> modeling<00:02:17.800> does<00:02:18.010> is

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
our simple syrup what modeling does is

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.610 
our simple syrup what modeling does is
kind<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.849> open<00:02:19.000> up<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.420> cranberries<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.260> add

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
kind of open up the cranberries and add

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.610 
kind of open up the cranberries and add
more<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.280> flavor<00:02:22.200> all<00:02:23.200> right<00:02:23.349> I'm<00:02:23.500> going

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
to add my simple syrup in and muddle a

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.199 
to add my simple syrup in and muddle a
little<00:02:28.030> bit<00:02:28.150> more<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:33.550> now<00:02:33.819> I'm<00:02:33.940> going<00:02:34.060> to
