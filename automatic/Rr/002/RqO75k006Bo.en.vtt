00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.110
 hello we are at quarries stone 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.820
 Belgian blue with emilie 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.340
 abraham hello emilie hello and hand 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.439
 so we're going to talk about what is a 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.029
 blue stone it is usually said that she 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.609
 is limestone and sedimentary it wants 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.189
 say what sedimentary then a stone 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.279
 sedimentary so that's the composition 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.050
 of stone this the way she 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.180
 was formed for the blue stone 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.430
 formed of sediments of different 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.620
 layers of sediment that have 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.510
 deposited on the ground and are compacted 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.270
 with time we also say that she 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.560
 is limestone wind so it's a stone 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.810
 limestone because there are 360 ​​million years 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.240
 soignies the region and is covered by 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.880
 a warm sea in which lived a 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.250
 bunch of animals 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.480
 sea ​​creatures of shells 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.070
 called described no id 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.570
 there was a lot of crinolines so 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.370
 this is an animal that is quite rare 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.650
 today we still find in 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.910
 hot seas today but who 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:14.150
 really covered the only the bottom of the 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.250
 sea ​​that lies here in the area and 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.140
 his animals when he died 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.510
 break down to settle on the bottom of the water 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.729
 and that's what's largely to 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.380
 the base the composition the blue stone 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.150
 thus today we have the 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.190
 stone how is it extracted 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.140
 this stone what color risk to 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.400
 which she is her composition 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.900
 it's yesterday it's extracted in 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.009
 taking advantage of the different layers 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.280
 I spoke earlier of 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.509
 different layers of sediment ago 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.850
 there the deposit form a kind 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.910
 staircase in which one cuts 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.410
 blocks that we then go back to the 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.400
 surface so these blocks when they are 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.080
 simply befits are light gray and when 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.180
 we work them we can give them 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.990
 different finishes that go from gray 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.990
 clear to black
