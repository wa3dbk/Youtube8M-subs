 in the Protestant hospital duisburg-nord comes one 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.690
 Nurse to work she prepares the warnings in a few minutes 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.470
 it goes to the rooms 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.830
 The patients want to be cared for by the nurse who once did it 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.870
 Duisburg back 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.580
 1989 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.970
 I am 42 years old Andrea Schreiber I wish him innate 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.039
 that's ugly March he grants 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.110
 at the same time manipulation suspected value 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.000
 we left the then GDR 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.900
 have only been two days left and then on 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.230
 Lower Bavaria 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.039
 have visited my friend Duisburg 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:10.499
 In% stated that the people here liked us much better 

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:13.499
 the sea is easier to find work and apartment 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.480
 a cellar in Duisburg north not far from the hospital 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.330
 Studio for the artists talk 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.079
 Since time immemorial, the 42-year-old Malsch 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.819
 In her youth, Bravo motifs were in high demand - they did not exist in them 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.509
 their home of the GDR from where I could hold the pen my stories 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.080
 has always had the kindergarten 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.070
 I do not have three years 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.650
 go worldwide and her father was emaciated all over the world costs 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.549
 The band did not exist 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.330
 she has not just painted and 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
 but part of which was given away 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.330
 to make this a lot of value 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.380
 Back in the hospital work on duty always runs at full speed for 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.380
 the sister and her colleagues 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.569
 highest concentration is necessary so that the patient is better off soon 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.640
 a professional disciplined work overtime paired with 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.640
 Empathy for the frail 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.359
 to the former start with the Balkan country that I know about all 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:23.589
 patients 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:27.209
 Percent after the late night service it matters importantly my things 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.079
 led 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.159
 among other things, the stations provider the patients 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:36.099
 We've gotten a lot of Brocade patients 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.900
 to Hannover Leo afterwards augen-op b 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.650
 around it speaks the blood pressure or other parameters but then fell one 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.290
 Reliable thing to relive, of course, you have to percent 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.680
 the goods must think economically I must not conceal 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.929
 but they are 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:53.929
 Foremost is the plans to care for the patients 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:03.339
 in the hospital, the nurse's shift ends up with little time left 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:05.629
 then her exhibition begins 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.629
 her exhibition 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:18.909
 my pictures can not be published any track Â»means that 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.369
 what I want 

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:24.939
 I find then the world of tennis is beautiful life for him 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.409
 "I want to show details that you would not otherwise pay attention to 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.840
 and for mild also represent emotions 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.480
 and I think everyday life is too stressful 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.090
 you just go your own way, you do not pay attention to restricting more than ten 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.190
 Percent are like the little Munich looks at the wayside 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.340
 There are also beautiful things you might not do in everyday life 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.889
 perceives 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.439
 Over the years, Andrea Schreiber has always painted hundreds of pictures 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.309
 between the work assignments in the hospital 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:59.369
 On the one hand, she can relax while painting, on the other, the paintings are now in 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:01.059
 sell half the world 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:04.559
 the old Bravo motives no longer play a role 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:07.639
 I did not stay with these pictures 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:08.819
 below percent 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:09.840
 and then of course 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.679
 Other materials also gave to paint I've got 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:16.060
 I would be educated percent 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.600
 and in which I read many things and had taken more and more 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:24.059
 then has "After being so big there was also much more time to paint 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:27.729
 Jan caught 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.569
 to make several exhibitions 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.760
 that I am now finally in 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.990
 Magath is almost also allowed to experience exhibitions 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.539
 when a lot of people come 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.089
 InWEnt a lot of people feel addressed by my pictures 

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:52.089
 then the exhibition is a success 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.639
 the hour of truth has come the painter gives insights 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.189
 The guests bow the pictures critically but how the verdict turns out 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:27.909
 I came here with the expectation that this furniture store is art 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:32.469
 looks decorative to look beautiful but under statements without depth and am very 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:33.770
 surprised 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.060
 that this trend continues to children who are not very appealing the depth 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.839
 the wedding the scenes are varied 

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:44.489
 that's what bothered me about what I've seen now since I caught the 

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:48.029
 Mixture and storage so that one has the receipt of abstract things and also 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:49.400
 representational 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.809
 and percent yes so what I've seen so far recognized the trend 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:59.180
 I'm very happy I think it's all very great the climate is great 

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:00.639
 in Tehran 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.310
 all people are very touched by my pictures 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.540
 I also think the number was very positive was surprisingly positive 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.840
 exciting and surprisingly good press is present 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.389
 with the totally excited 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.999
 Although Andrea Schreiber will be weak points success the guests 

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:17.819
 satisfied 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:21.719
 It will not be long before the artist starts a new painting 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:25.039
 in her cellar ever had 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:29.169
 if she does not care for people as a nurse 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:31.659
 Protestant Hospital Duisburg only 8
