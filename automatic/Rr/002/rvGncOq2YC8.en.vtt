how the bottom just swerves it's more

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.360 
how the bottom just swerves it's more

than like a basic t-shirt and then here

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.270 
than like a basic t-shirt and then here
it's<00:03:02.519> more<00:03:02.640> like<00:03:02.820> a<00:03:02.910> polo<00:03:03.380> so<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.980> very<00:03:05.220> very

like<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.780> beige<00:03:49.050> vina<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:50.069> this<00:03:50.790> one<00:03:50.970> is

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
like a beige vina and this one is

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.780 
like a beige vina and this one is
actually<00:03:51.270> by<00:03:51.720> Versace<00:03:52.140> so<00:03:53.100> if<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.489> guys<00:03:53.580> look

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
actually by Versace so if you guys look

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.100 
actually by Versace so if you guys look
very<00:03:53.819> closely<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.420> guys<00:03:54.540> can<00:03:54.720> see<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:54.959> there

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
very closely you guys can see it there

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.770 
very closely you guys can see it there
says<00:03:55.380> Versace<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:57.030> it's<00:03:57.209> more<00:03:57.360> like<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.510> beige

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
says Versace and it's more like a beige

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.180 
says Versace and it's more like a beige
sweater<00:03:58.019> so<00:03:58.349> I<00:03:58.380> would<00:03:58.560> consider<00:03:58.800> this<00:03:58.980> more

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
sweater so I would consider this more

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.660 
sweater so I would consider this more
like<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.400> fall<00:03:59.989> winter<00:04:00.989> kind<00:04:01.350> of<00:04:01.470> thing<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:02.489> was

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
it was originally three dollars so you

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.650 
it was originally three dollars so you
can<00:04:04.830> see<00:04:04.980> there<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.400> then<00:04:06.239> it<00:04:06.360> went<00:04:06.480> down<00:04:06.540> to

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
can see there and then it went down to

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.130 
can see there and then it went down to
one<00:04:07.640> $19.99<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:08.880> then<00:04:09.540> actually<00:04:09.870> bought<00:04:10.049> it

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140
