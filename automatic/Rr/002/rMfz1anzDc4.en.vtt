00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
a laptop that is maybe possibly an

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.050 
a laptop that is maybe possibly an
evolution<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.070> unit<00:01:41.430> cuz<00:01:41.610> slashers

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
evolution of this unit cuz slashers

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.179 
evolution of this unit cuz slashers
might<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.810> year<00:01:43.079> too<00:01:43.259> old<00:01:43.439> okay<00:01:43.950> it's
