like<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.949> how<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.130> think<00:00:23.730> Thousand

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
like this this is how I think Thousand

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.470 
like this this is how I think Thousand
Island<00:00:24.930> dressing<00:00:24.960> was<00:00:25.650> invented<00:00:26.480> because

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
Island dressing was invented because

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.529 
Island dressing was invented because
it's<00:00:27.840> strictly<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.380> combination<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.539> pickle

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
it's strictly a combination of pickle

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.100 
it's strictly a combination of pickle

now<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.989> think<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.890> relish<00:00:38.190> company<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
now I think that the relish company the

now I think that the relish company the
mayonnaise<00:00:39.149> company<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.440> ketchup

company<00:00:41.250> we're<00:00:41.430> all<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.700> same<00:00:41.760> company<00:00:42.450> at

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
company we're all the same company at

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.920 
company we're all the same company at
one<00:00:43.140> point<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.829> they<00:00:44.670> got<00:00:45.180> together<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.629> said

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
one point and they got together and said

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.420 
one point and they got together and said
let's<00:00:46.140> make<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.559> know<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> product<00:00:47.160> none<00:00:47.309> of

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
let's make and know the product none of

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.220 
let's make and know the product none of
the<00:00:47.550> products<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.149> already<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.629> that's

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the products we already have that's

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.430 
the products we already have that's
exactly<00:00:49.860> what<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.039> think<00:00:50.280> happened<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:51.059> that's

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
exactly what I think happened but that's

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.400 
exactly what I think happened but that's
pure<00:00:52.489> folklore<00:00:53.489> from<00:00:53.850> my<00:00:54.059> side<00:00:54.360> but<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:55.199> makes

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
pure folklore from my side but it makes

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.860 
pure folklore from my side but it makes
perfect<00:00:55.590> sense<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.309> I'm<00:00:56.789> gonna<00:00:56.879> take<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> cup<00:00:57.840> of

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
perfect sense so I'm gonna take a cup of

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.380 
perfect sense so I'm gonna take a cup of
mayonnaise<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.770> I'm<00:00:59.460> gonna<00:00:59.609> put<00:00:59.789> about<00:00:59.879> 1/4
