00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.109
 new minecraft video and this time 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.150
 something completely different than in these little ones 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.920
 I will explain tutorial to you 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.009
 Do not mine your minecraft 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.400
 people, but like me 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.400
 looks 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.850
 the three files he needs for it 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.390
 I uploaded for you and as 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:34.129
 link under the video packed first 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:37.079
 that would be the shader snort v 24.8 m &amp; c 1.8 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:41.190
 the other is kromer hills mine 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:48.899
 Resource package and the sv 10.1 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:51.120
 Standard Kromer did not need her 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.879
 but I find it absolutely fit 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.170
 just great in addition to shader pack and me 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.890
 Would you recommend to pack on it 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.510
 Do you have the three files? 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.159
 downloaded that should be in yours 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.159
 download folder looks like this 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.430
 before you install the shader scott 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.869
 You should first of all yours 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.180
 start minecraft 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.610
 because you have to use yours to use it 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.000
 reset the version to 1.8 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.460
 since the current version of minecraft 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.470
 1.8 3s you have to down here on edit pro 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.860
 case and then go down here at 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.900
 hughes version easy on the 1.8 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.340
 go back and then safe profile 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.259
 After you did that, just do it 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.060
 press briefly on play and into one 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.110
 Any world go in because he has to 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.640
 first create a profile for 1.8 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.399
 Did you do that then we can 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.330

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.340
 Just double click on it and 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.990
 then you get a message that says 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.520

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.420
 shaders folder that should then in the 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.549
 case still be empty 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.129
 you're almost in your download 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:54.879

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:56.200
 standard just copy once and 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.319
 insert here 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.639
 that's it from the shader 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.219
 then you can go back to your minecraft 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:05.980
 go and you see here is the sv 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:07.480

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.450
 then click and we are with the 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.920
 shader finished you would also comma hills 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.379
 use as I just click here 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.659
 on resources packages opens here below 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:20.829
 left the folder and already opens 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:23.620
 then your resources directory then 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.239
 you just copy the whole and 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.269
 Add it back to this one too 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.620
 folder one 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.540
 then we are done with it already 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.639
 choose kromer hits again 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.430
 and press finish but beware that 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.569
 can always take a while 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.250
 Then let's just go into one 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.790
 one world and look at the whole 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.979
 just in action 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.150
 because they are already what it 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:49.599
 so everything has changed 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.669
 you see light effects the idea that that 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:55.269
 Water now reflects you can do just that 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:57.159
 a little bit see the wind in the grass and 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:01.949
 just not the effects on the 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:04.239
 torches and of course in the sky 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.829
 I hope the tutorial was yours 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.209

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:11.010
