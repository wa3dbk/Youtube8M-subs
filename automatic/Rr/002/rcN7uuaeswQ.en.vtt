a down lock lucky

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.310 
a down lock lucky
ideally<00:01:59.280> we<00:01:59.399> would<00:01:59.549> have<00:01:59.579> had<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> sail<00:02:00.119> up<00:02:00.360> but

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
ideally we would have had a sail up but

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.639 
ideally we would have had a sail up but
with<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.680> wind<00:02:01.829> being<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.219> our<00:02:02.340> fares

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
with the wind being in our fares

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.539 
with the wind being in our fares
unfortunately<00:02:04.649> we<00:02:04.740> couldn't<00:02:04.950> use<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.219> which

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
unfortunately we couldn't use it which

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.980 
unfortunately we couldn't use it which
would<00:02:05.729> have<00:02:05.820> saved<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.149> lot<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.360> time<00:02:06.659> and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
would have saved a lot of time and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.760 
would have saved a lot of time and
energy<00:02:08.420> it's<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.509> little<00:02:09.780> still<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> now<00:02:10.379> we're

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
energy it's a little still a now we're

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.300 
energy it's a little still a now we're
keeping<00:02:11.090> quite<00:02:12.090> close<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.629> side

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
keeping quite close to the side

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.000 
keeping quite close to the side
seems<00:02:14.240> to<00:02:14.390> be<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.780> little<00:02:15.230> more<00:02:15.530> sheltered

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
seems to be a little more sheltered
