00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.730 

I<00:00:06.370> have<00:00:07.090> fond<00:00:07.450> memories<00:00:07.960> of<00:00:07.990> sorting<00:00:08.710> through

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
I have fond memories of sorting through

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.970 
I have fond memories of sorting through
seed<00:00:09.309> packets<00:00:10.000> as<00:00:10.269> a<00:00:10.300> child<00:00:10.750> with<00:00:11.320> my<00:00:11.530> mom<00:00:11.740> when

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
seed packets as a child with my mom when

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.830 
seed packets as a child with my mom when
we'd<00:00:12.129> go<00:00:12.250> to<00:00:12.309> the<00:00:12.460> garden<00:00:12.790> center<00:00:13.120> and<00:00:13.270> she'd

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
we'd go to the garden center and she'd

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.810 
we'd go to the garden center and she'd
always<00:00:14.049> let<00:00:14.230> me<00:00:14.350> pick<00:00:14.590> out<00:00:14.709> another<00:00:15.549> vegetable

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
always let me pick out another vegetable

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.720 
always let me pick out another vegetable
to<00:00:16.299> try<00:00:16.539> one<00:00:17.289> year<00:00:17.500> I<00:00:17.529> decided<00:00:17.949> to<00:00:18.130> grow<00:00:18.430> some

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 
to try one year I decided to grow some

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.970 
to try one year I decided to grow some
garden<00:00:19.119> peas<00:00:19.449> and<00:00:19.840> I<00:00:20.020> just<00:00:20.230> delighted<00:00:20.830> and

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
garden peas and I just delighted and

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.679 
garden peas and I just delighted and
watching<00:00:21.460> them<00:00:21.580> come<00:00:21.760> up<00:00:21.789> and<00:00:22.119> watching<00:00:22.539> those

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
watching them come up and watching those

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.470 
watching them come up and watching those
pods<00:00:23.019> fill<00:00:23.439> but<00:00:24.189> I<00:00:24.220> really<00:00:24.759> did<00:00:24.939> not<00:00:25.089> enjoy

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
pods fill but I really did not enjoy

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.009 
pods fill but I really did not enjoy
shelling<00:00:26.050> the<00:00:26.199> peas<00:00:26.439> so<00:00:26.859> now<00:00:27.550> I<00:00:27.580> stick<00:00:28.210> to<00:00:28.240> peas

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019 
shelling the peas so now I stick to peas

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.839 
shelling the peas so now I stick to peas
that<00:00:29.259> have<00:00:29.439> edible<00:00:29.740> pods<00:00:30.070> like<00:00:30.400> our<00:00:30.579> sugar

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
that have edible pods like our sugar

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.080 
that have edible pods like our sugar
snap<00:00:31.179> and<00:00:31.509> our<00:00:32.380> snow<00:00:32.890> peas<00:00:33.220> and<00:00:33.550> today<00:00:33.820> I'm

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
snap and our snow peas and today I'm

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.270 
snap and our snow peas and today I'm
going<00:00:34.329> to<00:00:34.420> be<00:00:34.480> planting<00:00:34.690> snow<00:00:35.230> peas<00:00:35.500> those<00:00:36.100> are

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
going to be planting snow peas those are

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.920 
going to be planting snow peas those are
the<00:00:36.340> kind<00:00:36.579> that<00:00:36.640> are<00:00:36.760> flattened<00:00:37.390> and<00:00:37.690> we<00:00:37.750> often

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
the kind that are flattened and we often

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.240 
the kind that are flattened and we often
use<00:00:38.290> them<00:00:38.470> in<00:00:38.650> oriental<00:00:39.310> dishes<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:42.100> get

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
use them in oriental dishes to get

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.060 
use them in oriental dishes to get
started<00:00:42.940> actually<00:00:43.630> before<00:00:44.200> I<00:00:44.230> start<00:00:44.590> you<00:00:44.890> want

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
started actually before I start you want

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.860 
started actually before I start you want
to<00:00:45.160> think<00:00:45.370> about<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:45.730> fact<00:00:45.970> that<00:00:46.060> most<00:00:46.390> piece

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
to think about the fact that most piece

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.320 
to think about the fact that most piece
need<00:00:47.680> to<00:00:47.830> be<00:00:47.980> staked<00:00:48.520> they<00:00:48.910> need<00:00:49.120> to<00:00:49.210> be

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
need to be staked they need to be

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.600 
need to be staked they need to be
supported<00:00:50.050> as<00:00:50.230> they<00:00:50.920> grow<00:00:51.160> because<00:00:51.430> they're

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
supported as they grow because they're

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.670 
supported as they grow because they're
rather<00:00:51.760> Viney<00:00:52.180> there<00:00:52.540> are<00:00:52.660> a<00:00:52.690> few<00:00:53.020> cultivars

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
rather Viney there are a few cultivars

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.770 
rather Viney there are a few cultivars
that<00:00:53.740> are<00:00:53.980> bushy<00:00:54.220> and<00:00:54.580> kind<00:00:55.150> of<00:00:55.270> support<00:00:55.660> one

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
that are bushy and kind of support one

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.330 
that are bushy and kind of support one
another<00:00:56.050> but<00:00:56.230> for<00:00:56.290> the<00:00:56.500> most<00:00:56.680> part<00:00:56.800> they<00:00:57.160> need

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
another but for the most part they need

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.760 
another but for the most part they need
some<00:00:57.970> sort<00:00:58.120> of<00:00:58.270> support<00:00:58.660> system<00:00:59.050> so<00:00:59.230> I've

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
some sort of support system so I've

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.259 
some sort of support system so I've
decided<00:01:00.010> to<00:01:00.430> make<00:01:00.580> two<00:01:01.020> teepee<00:01:02.020> style<00:01:02.440> rows<00:01:03.269> or

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
decided to make two teepee style rows or

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.539 
decided to make two teepee style rows or
triangular<00:01:04.900> rows<00:01:05.259> that<00:01:05.890> will<00:01:06.070> support<00:01:06.369> my

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
triangular rows that will support my

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.810 
triangular rows that will support my
peas<00:01:06.880> so<00:01:07.509> I'm<00:01:07.689> going<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.140> dig<00:01:08.439> and<00:01:08.770> plant<00:01:09.490> a<00:01:09.640> row

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
peas so I'm going to dig and plant a row

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.880 
peas so I'm going to dig and plant a row
of<00:01:09.850> peas<00:01:10.210> at<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.600> base<00:01:10.840> of<00:01:10.869> each<00:01:11.320> side<00:01:11.619> of<00:01:11.799> that

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
of peas at the base of each side of that

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.669 
of peas at the base of each side of that
triangle<00:01:12.340> so<00:01:12.759> I'll<00:01:12.850> have<00:01:13.060> four<00:01:13.390> rows<00:01:13.659> here<00:01:14.079> so

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
triangle so I'll have four rows here so

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:16.529 
triangle so I'll have four rows here so
to<00:01:14.770> start<00:01:15.070> that<00:01:15.249> off<00:01:15.460> I'm<00:01:15.789> simply<00:01:16.240> going<00:01:16.450> to

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
to start that off I'm simply going to

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.669 
to start that off I'm simply going to
use<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.380> hoe<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:18.070> dig<00:01:19.030> out<00:01:19.179> a<00:01:19.210> narrow<00:01:20.200> furrow

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
use a hoe to dig out a narrow furrow

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:25.230 
use a hoe to dig out a narrow furrow
where<00:01:21.549> I'll<00:01:21.640> be<00:01:21.850> putting<00:01:22.090> my<00:01:22.179> seeds<00:01:23.969> this<00:01:24.969> pea

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
where I'll be putting my seeds this pea

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.669 
where I'll be putting my seeds this pea
seeds<00:01:25.569> eventually<00:01:26.109> are<00:01:26.229> going<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.409> be<00:01:26.530> about

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
seeds eventually are going to be about

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:29.419 
seeds eventually are going to be about
one<00:01:26.950> inch<00:01:27.130> of<00:01:27.310> doom<00:01:27.460> so<00:01:27.700> you<00:01:27.759> can<00:01:27.939> use<00:01:28.119> that

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
one inch of doom so you can use that

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.120 
one inch of doom so you can use that
depth<00:01:30.429> to<00:01:31.170> determine<00:01:32.170> how<00:01:32.289> deep<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.619> dig<00:01:32.979> your

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
depth to determine how deep to dig your

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.340 
depth to determine how deep to dig your
furrow<00:01:33.429> you<00:01:34.149> might<00:01:34.299> notice<00:01:34.600> I<00:01:34.719> stepped<00:01:35.079> over

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
furrow you might notice I stepped over

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.679 
furrow you might notice I stepped over
my<00:01:35.469> bed<00:01:35.679> I<00:01:35.710> don't<00:01:36.039> like<00:01:36.249> to<00:01:36.639> walk<00:01:37.210> in<00:01:37.539> my

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
my bed I don't like to walk in my

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.599 
my bed I don't like to walk in my
planting<00:01:38.259> beds<00:01:38.530> because<00:01:38.979> it<00:01:39.069> compacts<00:01:39.460> the

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
planting beds because it compacts the

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.569 
planting beds because it compacts the
soil<00:01:40.119> so<00:01:40.929> I<00:01:40.960> typically<00:01:41.380> work<00:01:41.679> from<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.100> aisles

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
soil so I typically work from the aisles

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.590 
soil so I typically work from the aisles
that<00:01:43.740> way<00:01:44.740> I<00:01:45.039> keep<00:01:45.490> my<00:01:45.639> soil<00:01:45.909> nice<00:01:46.210> and<00:01:46.450> loose

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
that way I keep my soil nice and loose

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.349 
that way I keep my soil nice and loose
you<00:01:46.810> can<00:01:46.929> see<00:01:47.109> how<00:01:47.399> fresh<00:01:48.399> and<00:01:48.429> healthy<00:01:48.999> it<00:01:49.240> is

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
you can see how fresh and healthy it is

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.249 
you can see how fresh and healthy it is
and<00:01:49.600> nice<00:01:49.749> and<00:01:49.929> loose<00:01:50.109> soil<00:01:50.469> okay<00:01:51.280> so<00:01:51.340> my<00:01:51.670> peas

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
and nice and loose soil okay so my peas

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.899 
and nice and loose soil okay so my peas
to<00:01:53.259> get<00:01:53.439> started<00:01:53.979> I<00:01:54.130> just<00:01:54.159> want<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.579> space<00:01:54.850> them

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
to get started I just want to space them

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.410 
to get started I just want to space them
about<00:01:56.130> three<00:01:57.130> inches<00:01:57.549> apart<00:01:57.969> in<00:01:58.149> the<00:01:58.240> rows

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
about three inches apart in the rows

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.830 
about three inches apart in the rows
they're<00:01:58.749> pretty<00:01:58.990> large<00:01:59.340> so<00:02:00.340> it's<00:02:00.490> easy<00:02:00.819> to<00:02:01.209> set

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
they're pretty large so it's easy to set

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.459 
they're pretty large so it's easy to set
your<00:02:01.959> peas<00:02:02.639> at<00:02:03.639> the<00:02:04.270> proper<00:02:04.630> distance<00:02:05.020> unlike

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
your peas at the proper distance unlike

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.260 
your peas at the proper distance unlike
some<00:02:05.649> of<00:02:05.740> those<00:02:05.799> smaller<00:02:06.219> seeded<00:02:06.729> vegetables

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
some of those smaller seeded vegetables

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.059 
some of those smaller seeded vegetables
where<00:02:07.450> you<00:02:07.509> have<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.749> come<00:02:07.959> back<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.440> thin

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
where you have to come back and thin

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.620 
where you have to come back and thin
them<00:02:09.160> out<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.550> can<00:02:09.610> usually<00:02:09.910> get<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.330> pretty

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
them out you can usually get a pretty

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.620 
them out you can usually get a pretty
good<00:02:11.380> spacing<00:02:12.160> right<00:02:12.610> off<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:12.970> bat<00:02:13.150> with<00:02:13.420> your

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
good spacing right off the bat with your

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.830 
good spacing right off the bat with your
peas<00:02:13.980> once<00:02:14.980> they're<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.459> just<00:02:16.299> cover<00:02:16.629> them

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
peas once they're in just cover them

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.930 
peas once they're in just cover them
with<00:02:17.530> soil<00:02:17.980> from<00:02:18.909> your<00:02:19.090> furrow

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
with soil from your furrow

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.490 
with soil from your furrow
and<00:02:20.090> we're<00:02:20.240> not<00:02:20.360> necessarily<00:02:20.420> going<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.290> cover

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
and we're not necessarily going to cover

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.500 
and we're not necessarily going to cover
them<00:02:21.710> completely<00:02:22.340> we<00:02:22.730> only<00:02:22.850> want<00:02:23.120> them<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.420> be

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
them completely we only want them to be

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.740 
them completely we only want them to be
about<00:02:23.600> one<00:02:23.930> inch<00:02:24.170> below<00:02:24.710> the<00:02:24.860> soil<00:02:25.540> if<00:02:26.540> your

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
about one inch below the soil if your

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.600 
about one inch below the soil if your
soil<00:02:27.440> still<00:02:27.890> up<00:02:28.190> on<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.460> edges<00:02:28.910> that's<00:02:29.030> okay

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
soil still up on the edges that's okay

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.270 
soil still up on the edges that's okay
now<00:02:31.610> all<00:02:32.120> seeds<00:02:32.630> need<00:02:33.020> moisture<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.800> germinate

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
now all seeds need moisture to germinate

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.060 
now all seeds need moisture to germinate
and<00:02:34.520> that<00:02:34.880> includes<00:02:35.240> our<00:02:35.390> pea<00:02:35.630> seeds<00:02:35.990> but<00:02:36.980> we

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
and that includes our pea seeds but we

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.850 
and that includes our pea seeds but we
don't<00:02:37.280> want<00:02:37.430> them<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.670> be<00:02:37.790> wet<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.270> wet<00:02:38.600> soil<00:02:39.110> can

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
don't want them to be wet a wet soil can

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.850 
don't want them to be wet a wet soil can
cause<00:02:40.450> rotting<00:02:41.450> of<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.840> peas<00:02:42.110> but<00:02:42.500> they<00:02:42.800> do

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
cause rotting of the peas but they do

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.980 
cause rotting of the peas but they do
need<00:02:43.220> moisture<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.820> germinate<00:02:44.330> so<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:44.840> want

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
need moisture to germinate so you want

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.740 
need moisture to germinate so you want
to<00:02:45.080> keep<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.380> evenly<00:02:45.860> damp<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:47.300> do<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:47.540> we

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
to keep it evenly damp and to do that we

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.530 
to keep it evenly damp and to do that we
have<00:02:47.930> an<00:02:48.080> irrigation<00:02:48.680> system<00:02:48.710> I<00:02:49.430> pulled<00:02:50.420> it

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
have an irrigation system I pulled it

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.500 
have an irrigation system I pulled it
back<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.890> work<00:02:52.040> in<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.370> bed<00:02:52.550> but<00:02:53.120> I'm<00:02:53.300> going<00:02:53.480> to

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
back to work in the bed but I'm going to

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.740 
back to work in the bed but I'm going to
use<00:02:53.570> just<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.320> drip<00:02:54.620> irrigation<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:55.750> that'll

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
use just a drip irrigation and that'll

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.840 
use just a drip irrigation and that'll
help<00:02:56.870> keep<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.290> soil<00:02:57.530> damp<00:02:58.310> enough<00:02:58.640> to

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
help keep the soil damp enough to

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.260 
help keep the soil damp enough to
germinate<00:02:59.300> once<00:03:00.260> those<00:03:00.560> plants<00:03:01.100> come<00:03:01.400> up<00:03:01.670> we

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
germinate once those plants come up we

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.870 
germinate once those plants come up we
need<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.600> increase<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.440> irrigation<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:04.640> about

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
need to increase the irrigation to about

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.000 
need to increase the irrigation to about
a<00:03:04.910> half<00:03:05.210> an<00:03:05.450> inch<00:03:05.540> per<00:03:05.870> week<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:06.260> then<00:03:06.770> once

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
a half an inch per week and then once

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.370 
a half an inch per week and then once
they<00:03:07.220> flower<00:03:07.580> they'll<00:03:08.030> need<00:03:08.240> about<00:03:08.930> an<00:03:09.140> inch

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
they flower they'll need about an inch

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.350 
they flower they'll need about an inch
of<00:03:09.560> water<00:03:09.620> each<00:03:10.100> week<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:10.610> if<00:03:10.700> it<00:03:10.820> doesn't<00:03:11.180> rain

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
of water each week so if it doesn't rain

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.760 
of water each week so if it doesn't rain
we're<00:03:11.840> going<00:03:12.080> to<00:03:12.170> be<00:03:12.260> getting<00:03:12.350> into<00:03:12.680> the

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
we're going to be getting into the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.040 
we're going to be getting into the
raining<00:03:13.130> season<00:03:13.160> hopefully<00:03:14.090> but<00:03:14.870> if<00:03:14.960> it

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
raining season hopefully but if it

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.560 
raining season hopefully but if it
doesn't<00:03:15.230> rain<00:03:15.470> will<00:03:15.680> want<00:03:15.830> to<00:03:15.890> irrigate<00:03:16.570> now

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
doesn't rain will want to irrigate now

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.530 
doesn't rain will want to irrigate now
this<00:03:17.780> is<00:03:17.960> a<00:03:17.990> great<00:03:18.350> time<00:03:18.710> to<00:03:19.430> also<00:03:20.090> plant<00:03:20.330> some
