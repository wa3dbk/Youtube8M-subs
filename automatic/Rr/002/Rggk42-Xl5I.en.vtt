00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:18.190
 tripp lite this in this video I will teach you how to solve the magic cube 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.249
 let's know how our cube is made up 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.820
 we have to tell what 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.179
 three types of different pieces in the cube 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.630
 one of them and the most important is the center 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.010
 we have felt these that are central in the cube 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.580
 and each of them 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.780
 It represents 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.199
 oo the color that will win the face 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.210
 when the cube is solved 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.360
 these centers are pieces that are fixed 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.910
 in such a way that is that here we have a yellow 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.910
 its opposite will always be the target 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.449
 pieces that are fixed in the cube 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.560
 and therefore can not be moved 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.940
 of these pieces we're just going to see a color 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.670
 the next type of pieces 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.610
 this the PAN 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.270
 we have 12 room the cube 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.880
 and these are pieces of which we can see two different colors 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.970
 finally let's find the corners with corners 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.500
 of which we can see 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.870
 three colors 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.600
 of these corners we have 8 both the cube 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.370
 each of these pieces 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.330
 they are unique, that is, there are no two pieces that have the same combination 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.360
 of colors 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.240
 that makes the resolution of the cube implies that a piece can only 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.240
 be in a wii case in particular 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.100
 finally we can say 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.229
 the cube is divided into three layers the top layer is static and rotating in 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.580
 this moment 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.580
 composed of the entire upper face 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.700
 crown 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.410
 from up here 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.610
 then we have the intermediate layer 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.030
 who is a statesman here 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.970
 and finally the training that is this is that it is here 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.889
 obviously that returned to the cube 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.889
 then the bottom layer or make the top layer p 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.519
 I 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:29.639
 solving a magic cube involves knowing a series of united states 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.279
 these algorithms have an annotation that we should learn 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:36.519
 first of all let's make them fly 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.479
 to each of the faces 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:41.479
 cube col a letter 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:46.450
 there are different endowments in Spanish and in Spanish including 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.489
 the Guadalquivir river marÃ­a as you can tell 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.840
 but we're going to use the English annotation that is the most 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.619
 widespread 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:58.669
 for that we're going to say that this cove we have here 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.229
 efe the frontal 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.719
 and side does not identify with the letter efe 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:05.999
 the face we have here 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.389
 the face clair right 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.509
 and we're going to start it with the letter r 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:14.219
 the face we have here is the one above 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:15.579
 in English ap 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.709
 so we are not going to precipitate with the letter q 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:21.819
 the face that we have here that we do not see 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.169
 on the left 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.379
 in English read 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.039
 let's identify with the letter l 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:29.449
 the face that we have here back 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.999
 it is bacteria therefore with candle we give away 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.069
 and finally 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.740
 the face down here 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.739
 davos is loving dawn 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.739
 with which we go to and in chicago on alert d 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.569
 then in the endowment of these algorithms 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.269
 4 one of these letters appears 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.829
 for example, the letter f is showing us that we have turned the face 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.729
 frontal always clockwise 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:58.909
 that is to say in this sense 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.749
 efe efe 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:02.249
 efe if it appears 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:03.859
 the letter squared 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.319
 esther square uplifting we will see 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.819
 do a double spin 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.819
 that is, a 180 degree turn 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:15.559
 it deserves the letter of residence that we must turn 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.419
 the right hip 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.779
 90 degrees clockwise 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.069
 if it appears 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:25.610
 the sele prat of the riba 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.860
 then we see spin 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.990
 this face clockwise in the opposite direction is 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.990
 d this way 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.460
 I must always think 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.720
 like that clockwise if we saw face to face 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.009
 it's also worth 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.139
 for the left face 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.180
 the clockwise is that this sense 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.270
 I have felt part of the schedule 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.059
 for the hesperia face 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:59.059
 sense schedules this 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.710
 and for the top face in a clockwise direction that 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.539
 if the letter that identifies the face appears 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.699
 Corcuera for three more 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.689
 what is said efe prima 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:18.069
 ouna and 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:19.150
 lowercase 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.990
 this ii 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.360
 is telling us that we should turn 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.029
 the face in the opposite direction is to say 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:27.629
 antier to egypt then private efe 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:29.569
 3 this movement 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.930
 or efe 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.249
 ry with the private network 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:35.699
 this mobile 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:37.289
 and so on 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.839
 with the rest of the boxes 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.819
 when we talk about flipping the cube 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:46.490
 just make this move to put the face that is up down 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.460
 and when we talk about broken some carp 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.460
 we must 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.240
 the entire layer 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.479
 that if the unions of the superior 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.150
 the lower 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.349
 hello internet 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:04.569
 p 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.569
 Moscow 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.619
 let's finally say 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:13.860
 what a piece of the cube 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.020
 It is well located when the piece 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.710
 I must think of the piece as the compulsion of the two golds three colors 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.629
 be in the right place 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:27.159
 in this case this piece 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:30.369
 for example this one published correctly 

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:32.860
 but we can also say 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.059
 if the track is well rotated under magical 

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:39.749
 that indicates the orientation of the pieces 

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:42.860
 to see if it matches the colors it has 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.369
 next to 

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:47.729
 in this case these pieces like all 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:50.770
 they are also located but they are also monitored 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:53.860
 if this piece that we have here remove 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.520
 had lara jaca 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.249
 love and jack and green here 

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:01.789
 would be well located protest in the place that corresponds but would be 

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:02.850
 Valencia 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.830
