00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:08.799
 Rubber with a long supercharged soul, etc. 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:08.799
 Oh oh 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:17.120

 This month's lecturer will also teach the Niihama City Izumigawa Junior High School 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:33.230
 And there is a great history of how 30 years to advise the women's table tennis club teacher 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.110
 I will be a long-time teacher who will be a long-time table tennis school instructor Nice to meet you 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:43.110
 Let's say it, and Shiraoka Junki of Heart Network 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:47.490
 3 Thank you very much I was willing to be said that what there is a sense in teacher last month Yes 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.470
 Yes You Have you over there speak to you But good also working hard I hope good value ordering this month 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.680
 I will do my best 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.490
 Good luck, sir, yes this month 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:02.520
 Last month was a forecut back? 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:07.740
 I assumed that I came in 10 consecutive times in the ball out 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:11.610
 Practice way I'd like to introduce you to Yes I'm here Kedomo x direction of the foot have the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.720
 Is Kedomo is that of how to use for What good will and here a little explanation 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:21.180
 was 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:25.120
 It did in the fore and back the practice to cut now 1 out a foot of diagonally backward 45 degrees by the upstream 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:31.930
 Does Mase Kurukawakari but actually the ball where to fly 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:33.550
 So when you fly to various places , the usage of the foot changes, so this tree's usage of foot 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:39.850
 You need to practice 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:42.110
 This seems to be an example of how to use the foot Yes I would like to explain one 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.530
 This is how you use your feet 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:52.350
 Yes I just taught you how to use your own foot- 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:54.909
 I made a practice and sent a ball to there and practiced to cut there. 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.200
 The move actually at the ball 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.799
 Practice to beat Yes 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.350
 So we do not cut at our best in order to continue now 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:12.090
 This is not the best not the best 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.090
 It looks like full power, but please divide something Next back cut 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:24.550
 It is a bag 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:29.080
 I am a middle cut from now, but I made a forecut back cut now 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:33.870
 There is a relatively large amount of practice for the forecut back 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:38.330
 It is easy to learn, but it is the middle cut as the weak point of the cut man 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:43.720
 It is difficult to get it if you hit the ball in front of the cut 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:47.190
 For example, down straight at the ball flew way 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.569
 Yes even if the straightness goes down straight 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.810
 I can not take it 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:55.680
 But it is on its side it is hard to take is so lighting 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:02.250
 So although I did in the previous fully open 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.180
 On the other hand I would like to make a middle cut using which foot method 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.260
 Fore 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.640
 Please 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.299
 So I'm stuck from now but this Tsutsuki is very important for me 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.000
 Right? 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:20.800
 Well I can say that this is the life of the cutman Tsutsuzuki is the game 7 cutman is the best in the game 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.420
 Techniques that use a lot of Yes is the technology that this poking 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:30.370
 Because the attacking player and the cutman are slightly different 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:36.010
 Two of which do I think Yes Yes lectures blue and want to explain in comparison with the poking of Well crafts player 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:38.140
 Like that you wish please come poking is it a court to have the child I also different in poking 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.370
 Follow 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:48.989
 It's cut man 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:51.569
 That's right, because there is no time to go backwards when shot, so basic of the cutman 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:56.980
 The hit ball shop 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:59.069
 Then this practice is about ten times in a row by all means yes yes The reason is 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.760
 It looks easy 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.760
 it's simple 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:10.280
 What is it? 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:15.830
 However, it's kind of good to go 10 consecutive times at the beginning of the first grader first 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:21.609
 Sanyo I think it will take Thermo I think that can be done in 4 days Yes About the teacher cut 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:25.360
 Please tell us it means that what you are something new challenge but 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:30.460
 Well how to make a basic cut is that 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:34.860
 I think a lot of stories, but for example, a ball drive with a great rotation is loop drive 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:40.379
 With respect to the rotation I'd rotation called 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:43.980
 I hit a mark ball, but by all means the ball floats up, so I was up 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:48.120
 That it is being aimed straight off 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.510
 When thinking about the processing of the loop drive in various ways 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.380
 Well for example 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.380
 yeah 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:04.470
 You can register 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:09.990
 It doesn't flow because it doesn't go up, everyone was up to it. 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:13.140
 I am not here and all cutman beginners have finished this time 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:17.940
 Well basic forecutback at 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:24.569
 It is in fact is Well went to the middle processing Well kind of practice 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:30.389
 That's because the cut is accompanied by movement . 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:32.969
 Next time I would like to introduce the required footwork for that footwork cut man 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:36.179
 The owner is yes then everyone 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:38.539
 Please hit and see next month with your soul 

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:38.539
 If a
