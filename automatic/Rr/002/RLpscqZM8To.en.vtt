rosewood stream and I'd like to show you
what<00:00:28.939> it<00:00:29.060> looks<00:00:29.210> like<00:00:29.390> really<00:00:29.570> and<00:00:29.900> just<00:00:30.769> talk

what it looks like really and just talk

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.130 
what it looks like really and just talk
about<00:00:31.430> how<00:00:31.640> I<00:00:31.670> went<00:00:31.910> about<00:00:32.029> making<00:00:32.300> it<00:00:32.660> and

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
about how I went about making it and

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.370 
about how I went about making it and
I'll<00:00:33.260> say<00:00:33.410> this<00:00:33.680> box<00:00:34.100> is<00:00:34.570> blown<00:00:35.570> up<00:00:35.840> it's<00:00:36.200> got

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
I'll say this box is blown up it's got

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.709 
I'll say this box is blown up it's got
rosewood<00:00:36.920> stringing<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.329> reason<00:00:38.600> we<00:00:38.690> use

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
rosewood stringing the reason we use

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.479 
rosewood stringing the reason we use
stringing<00:00:39.350> is<00:00:39.500> partly<00:00:39.920> for<00:00:40.160> decorative

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
stringing is partly for decorative

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.990 
stringing is partly for decorative
reasons<00:00:41.090> but<00:00:41.660> also<00:00:41.780> because<00:00:42.129> the<00:00:43.129> bird<00:00:43.370> warned

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
reasons but also because the bird warned

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.760 
reasons but also because the bird warned
up<00:00:44.180> would<00:00:44.360> be<00:00:44.510> quite<00:00:44.780> delicate<00:00:45.020> on<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.500> edges

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
up would be quite delicate on the edges

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.760 
up would be quite delicate on the edges
so<00:00:46.489> we<00:00:46.730> apply<00:00:47.270> a<00:00:47.300> stringing<00:00:47.840> just<00:00:48.530> to

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
so we apply a stringing just to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.660 
so we apply a stringing just to
reinforce<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:49.789> edges<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:51.260> to<00:00:52.010> allow<00:00:52.219> us<00:00:52.250> to

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
reinforce the edges and to allow us to

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.420 
reinforce the edges and to allow us to
popularise<00:00:53.660> the<00:00:53.690> edges<00:00:54.050> round<00:00:54.289> them<00:00:54.500> over<00:00:54.860> if

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
popularise the edges round them over if

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.650 
popularise the edges round them over if
we<00:00:55.550> didn't<00:00:55.730> have<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:55.910> string<00:00:56.149> in<00:00:56.270> there<00:00:56.449> then

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
we didn't have the string in there then

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.540 
we didn't have the string in there then
when<00:00:57.379> we<00:00:57.500> round<00:00:57.620> it<00:00:57.800> out<00:00:57.949> or<00:00:58.129> we<00:00:58.190> might<00:00:58.340> go

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
when we round it out or we might go

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.340 
when we round it out or we might go
through<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:58.940> veneer

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
through the veneer

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.709 
through the veneer
I<00:01:00.350> like<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:01.030> Rosewood<00:01:02.030> string<00:01:02.420> in<00:01:02.539> because

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
I like the Rosewood string in because

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.329 
I like the Rosewood string in because
it's<00:01:02.899> it's<00:01:03.500> a<00:01:03.559> bit<00:01:03.680> more<00:01:03.770> subtle<00:01:04.039> than<00:01:04.280> the

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
it's it's a bit more subtle than the

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.750 
it's it's a bit more subtle than the
ebony<00:01:05.300> it<00:01:06.170> blends<00:01:06.470> in<00:01:06.710> nicely<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.549> it's<00:01:07.700> not

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
ebony it blends in nicely so it's not

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.719 
ebony it blends in nicely so it's not
also<00:01:08.420> in<00:01:08.540> your<00:01:08.990> face

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.149 

I<00:01:16.060> may<00:01:17.060> be<00:01:17.119> a<00:01:17.630> box<00:01:17.960> in<00:01:18.200> one<00:01:18.350> piece<00:01:18.650> and<00:01:18.950> then<00:01:19.040> I

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
I may be a box in one piece and then I

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.859 
I may be a box in one piece and then I
cut<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.549> lid<00:01:19.700> away<00:01:21.009> so<00:01:22.009> that<00:01:22.040> we<00:01:22.509> if<00:01:23.509> we<00:01:23.659> made

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
cut the lid away so that we if we made

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.090 
cut the lid away so that we if we made
the<00:01:24.020> lid<00:01:24.170> separately<00:01:24.649> then<00:01:24.799> there<00:01:24.950> be<00:01:25.070> a

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
the lid separately then there be a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.820 
the lid separately then there be a
danger<00:01:25.490> of<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:25.640> lid<00:01:25.850> not<00:01:26.420> being<00:01:26.689> exactly<00:01:27.320> an

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
danger of the lid not being exactly an

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.800 
danger of the lid not being exactly an
exact<00:01:28.280> fit<00:01:28.520> with<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.790> base<00:01:28.970> whereas<00:01:29.659> if<00:01:29.750> you

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
exact fit with the base whereas if you

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.749 
exact fit with the base whereas if you
make<00:01:29.960> more<00:01:30.170> in<00:01:30.320> one<00:01:30.350> then<00:01:31.100> obviously<00:01:31.220> when<00:01:31.670> you

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
make more in one then obviously when you

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.880 
make more in one then obviously when you
cut<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.030> little<00:01:32.240> way<00:01:32.360> would<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:33.200> exactly<00:01:33.710> fit

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
cut the little way would it exactly fit

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.840 
cut the little way would it exactly fit
the<00:01:33.920> base<00:01:35.979> interior<00:01:36.979> is<00:01:37.840> lined<00:01:39.159> with<00:01:40.159> black

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
the base interior is lined with black

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.790 
the base interior is lined with black
suede<00:01:41.320> I<00:01:42.320> deliver<00:01:43.280> a<00:01:43.340> job<00:01:43.549> finding<00:01:43.970> good<00:01:44.210> suede

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
suede I deliver a job finding good suede

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.020 
suede I deliver a job finding good suede
fortunately<00:01:45.800> I<00:01:45.830> found<00:01:46.250> a<00:01:46.310> good<00:01:46.399> supplier<00:01:46.789> now

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
fortunately I found a good supplier now

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.410 
fortunately I found a good supplier now
which<00:01:47.210> I'll<00:01:47.390> probably<00:01:47.840> continue<00:01:48.050> to<00:01:48.500> use

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
which I'll probably continue to use

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.289 
which I'll probably continue to use
black<00:01:50.420> suede<00:01:51.670> quite<00:01:52.670> tricky<00:01:52.909> to<00:01:53.119> work<00:01:53.240> with

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
black suede quite tricky to work with

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.950 
black suede quite tricky to work with
actually<00:01:53.780> because<00:01:54.340> it's<00:01:55.340> being<00:01:56.299> black<00:01:56.630> and

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
actually because it's being black and

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.080 
actually because it's being black and
matte<00:01:57.440> like<00:01:57.740> a<00:01:57.770> suede<00:01:58.069> is<00:01:58.340> it's<00:01:58.640> almost<00:01:58.789> like

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
matte like a suede is it's almost like

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.639 
matte like a suede is it's almost like
working<00:01:59.299> in<00:01:59.509> deep<00:01:59.720> space<00:01:59.899> you<00:02:00.289> can't<00:02:00.500> really

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
working in deep space you can't really

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:01.690 
working in deep space you can't really
see<00:02:00.799> what<00:02:00.950> you're<00:02:01.039> working<00:02:01.130> with<00:02:01.429> because

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
see what you're working with because

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.960 
see what you're working with because
it's<00:02:01.909> so<00:02:01.970> dark<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:03.530> also<00:02:03.729> it's<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.819> real

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
it's so dark and also it's a real

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.199 
it's so dark and also it's a real
nuisance<00:02:05.209> because<00:02:05.630> any<00:02:05.780> little<00:02:06.200> bits<00:02:06.920> of

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
nuisance because any little bits of

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.020 
nuisance because any little bits of
sawdust<00:02:08.209> or<00:02:08.450> any<00:02:09.280> hairs<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.610> things<00:02:10.819> really

sawdust or any hairs and things really

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.610 
sawdust or any hairs and things really
show<00:02:11.360> up<00:02:11.540> on<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.870> black<00:02:12.610> lining<00:02:14.170> this<00:02:15.170> handle
