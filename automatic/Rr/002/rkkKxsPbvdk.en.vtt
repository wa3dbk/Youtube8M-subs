00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
you can see it's got this grid pattern

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.900 
you can see it's got this grid pattern
here<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> top<00:00:46.800> that's<00:00:47.489> where<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
here on the top that's where the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.819 
here on the top that's where the
capacitive<00:00:48.510> sensor<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.350> that's<00:00:49.559> where

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
capacitive sensor is and that's where

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.760 
capacitive sensor is and that's where
you<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.160> do<00:00:50.280> gestures<00:00:50.579> with<00:00:51.180> one<00:00:51.930> two<00:00:52.289> three

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
you can do gestures with one two three

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.470 
you can do gestures with one two three
fingers<00:00:53.129> or<00:00:53.460> your<00:00:53.670> thumb<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.300> grid

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
fingers or your thumb in that grid

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.700 
fingers or your thumb in that grid
pattern<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:54.960> feel<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.590> your

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
pattern you can feel that with your

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.680 
pattern you can feel that with your
finger<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.730> has<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> tactile<00:00:57.360> feel

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
finger you can so it has a tactile feel

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.180 
finger you can so it has a tactile feel
if<00:00:57.899> you're<00:00:58.020> looking<00:00:58.289> at<00:00:58.379> your<00:00:58.530> screen<00:00:58.920> you're

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
if you're looking at your screen you're

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.880 
if you're looking at your screen you're
still<00:00:59.460> going<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.820> be<00:01:00.090> able<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.600> feel<00:01:01.500> where<00:01:01.770> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
still going to be able to feel where you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.670 
still going to be able to feel where you
are<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.609> mouse<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:02.940> your<00:01:03.930> gestures<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
are on the mouse and your gestures the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.899 
are on the mouse and your gestures the
the<00:01:04.949> grid<00:01:05.159> look<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.790> looks

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
the grid look on this this looks

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.750 
the grid look on this this looks
familiar<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.930> if<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.530> were<00:01:07.890> watching<00:01:08.070> some<00:01:08.670> of

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
familiar so if you were watching some of

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.789 
familiar so if you were watching some of
the<00:01:08.850> things<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.510> played<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.229> last<00:01:10.470> year

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the things that we played with last year

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.679 
the things that we played with last year
exactly<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.970> capacitive<00:01:12.510> mouse

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
exactly this is the capacitive mouse

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.510 
exactly this is the capacitive mouse
right<00:01:12.960> right<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.650> came<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.189> our<00:01:14.310> mouth

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
right right this came out of our mouth

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.880 
right right this came out of our mouth
to<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:15.150> research<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:16.049> we<00:01:16.170> talked<00:01:16.439> about<00:01:16.560> with

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
to do research that we talked about with

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.910 
to do research that we talked about with
you<00:01:17.040> last<00:01:17.280> year<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.780> was<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.470> cat<00:01:19.710> mouse

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
you last year and this was the cat mouse

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.880 
you last year and this was the cat mouse
out<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> five<00:01:20.549> mice<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.890> were

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
out of the five mice that we were

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.940 
out of the five mice that we were
looking<00:01:23.189> into<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> kapap<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.229> grid

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
looking into so the kapap this grid

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.130 
looking into so the kapap this grid
pattern<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.520> top<00:01:26.700> mimics<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.540> capacitive

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
pattern on the top mimics the capacitive

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.319 
pattern on the top mimics the capacitive
sensor<00:01:28.439> that's<00:01:28.650> underneath<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:30.150> that's

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
sensor that's underneath and so that's

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.789 
sensor that's underneath and so that's
just<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.630> fun<00:01:30.780> way<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:30.960> us<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.229> bring<00:01:31.560> that

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
just a fun way for us to bring that

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.789 
just a fun way for us to bring that
design<00:01:32.579> element<00:01:33.270> up<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> top<00:01:34.110> very<00:01:34.590> cool

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
design element up to the top very cool

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.560 
design element up to the top very cool
also<00:01:34.979> make<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.340> useful<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.390> wireless

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
also make it useful and it's a wireless

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.560 
also make it useful and it's a wireless
mouse<00:01:36.990> that's<00:01:37.619> right<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.850> dongle<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.270> it

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
mouse that's right and the dongle for it

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
then I can minimize that back down if I

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.960 
then I can minimize that back down if I
do<00:04:20.690> two<00:04:20.900> fingers<00:04:21.289> down<00:04:21.500> again<00:04:21.919> that<00:04:22.610> takes<00:04:22.849> it

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
restore it's like a Windows arrow key

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.570 
restore it's like a Windows arrow key
exactly<00:04:54.289> that's<00:04:54.800> what<00:04:54.979> it's<00:04:55.130> based<00:04:55.310> on

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
exactly that's what it's based on

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.360 
exactly that's what it's based on
because<00:04:56.419> that<00:04:56.870> were<00:04:57.349> this<00:04:57.740> is<00:04:57.890> exclusively

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
because that were this is exclusively

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.880 
because that were this is exclusively
for<00:04:58.640> windows<00:04:58.969> 7<00:04:59.330> so<00:04:59.930> we're<00:05:00.169> doing<00:05:00.380> it<00:05:00.500> in<00:05:00.620> the

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
for windows 7 so we're doing it in the

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.260 
for windows 7 so we're doing it in the
ways<00:05:01.039> that<00:05:01.070> are<00:05:01.250> familiar<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:02.000> Windows

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
ways that are familiar to the Windows

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.899 
ways that are familiar to the Windows
users<00:05:02.719> and<00:05:03.229> that<00:05:03.710> helps<00:05:04.130> them<00:05:04.190> get<00:05:04.580> their<00:05:04.760> work

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
users and that helps them get their work

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.649 
users and that helps them get their work
done<00:05:05.289> more<00:05:06.289> quickly<00:05:06.440> so<00:05:06.950> if<00:05:07.219> I<00:05:07.700> snap<00:05:07.940> this<00:05:08.270> then

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:08.659 
done more quickly so if I snap this then

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.830 
done more quickly so if I snap this then
I<00:05:08.750> can<00:05:08.960> take<00:05:09.140> a<00:05:09.320> word<00:05:09.560> document<00:05:09.860> and<00:05:10.539> snap<00:05:11.539> that

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
I can take a word document and snap that

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.920 
I can take a word document and snap that
to<00:05:12.229> the<00:05:13.159> right<00:05:13.400> just<00:05:14.090> swipe<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.510> the<00:05:14.599> right<00:05:14.630> so

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
to the right just swipe to the right so

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.779 
to the right just swipe to the right so
it's<00:05:15.050> very<00:05:15.169> logical<00:05:15.770> as<00:05:15.890> well<00:05:16.099> and<00:05:16.340> then

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
it's very logical as well and then

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.000 
it's very logical as well and then
