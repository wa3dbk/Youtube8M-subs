00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.699 
to get it right but there you have it
now<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.819> necklace<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.450> made<00:01:48.630> using<00:01:49.109> waxed

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
now the necklace is made using waxed

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.160 
now the necklace is made using waxed
cord<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.249> I<00:01:50.609> wanted<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.999> few<00:01:51.240> shells<00:01:51.569> to<00:01:51.810> dangle

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
cord and I wanted a few shells to dangle

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.769 
cord and I wanted a few shells to dangle
off<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.429> used<00:01:53.729> many<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.569> same

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:54.779 
off of it so I used many of the same

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:56.480 
off of it so I used many of the same
techniques<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.380> used<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.740> make<00:01:55.889> the<00:01:56.039> earrings

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
techniques I used to make the earrings

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.190 
techniques I used to make the earrings
to<00:01:56.759> create<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> few<00:01:57.420> elements<00:01:57.630> for<00:01:58.109> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
to create a few elements for the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.489 
to create a few elements for the
necklace<00:01:58.549> for<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.609> centerpiece<00:02:00.389> I<00:02:00.630> chose<00:02:01.289> my

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:01.499 
necklace for the centerpiece I chose my

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:04.010 
necklace for the centerpiece I chose my
most<00:02:01.799> unique<00:02:02.069> shell<00:02:02.609> and<00:02:02.909> instead<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.389> a<00:02:03.539> pin

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
most unique shell and instead of a pin

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.039 
most unique shell and instead of a pin
I<00:02:04.049> used<00:02:04.649> gold<00:02:05.069> bead<00:02:05.609> wire<00:02:05.969> which<00:02:06.420> looks<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.840> bit

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
I used gold bead wire which looks a bit

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.199 
I used gold bead wire which looks a bit
more<00:02:07.529> unique<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:08.099> bit<00:02:08.280> more<00:02:08.459> one-of-a-kind

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
more unique a bit more one-of-a-kind

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.390 
more unique a bit more one-of-a-kind
when<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.600> see<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.990> and<00:02:10.170> for<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.860> two<00:02:11.040> side

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
when you see it and for the two side

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.550 
when you see it and for the two side
elements<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.120> really<00:02:12.570> did<00:02:12.720> mirror<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.170> earring

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
elements I really did mirror the earring

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.180 
elements I really did mirror the earring
technique

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
technique

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.910 
technique
using<00:02:14.670> shells<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.210> similar<00:02:15.600> size<00:02:15.920> crimper

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
using shells of similar size crimper

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.000 
using shells of similar size crimper
beads<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.460> pin<00:02:18.000> wires<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.660> threaded<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.830> beads

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
beads and pin wires I threaded the beads

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.760 
beads and pin wires I threaded the beads
uniformly<00:02:20.670> on<00:02:20.850> either<00:02:21.090> side<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.380> finished

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
uniformly on either side and I finished

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.190 
uniformly on either side and I finished
it<00:02:22.950> off<00:02:23.130> by<00:02:23.400> looping<00:02:23.760> ends<00:02:24.240> of<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.480> waxed<00:02:24.870> cord

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
it off by looping ends of the waxed cord

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.800 
it off by looping ends of the waxed cord
including<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.220> clasp<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:26.880> one<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.210> these<00:02:27.450> loops

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
including a clasp on one of these loops

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.590 
including a clasp on one of these loops
and<00:02:28.140> tying<00:02:28.950> off<00:02:29.160> these<00:02:29.460> loops<00:02:29.730> with<00:02:29.940> gold<00:02:30.240> bead

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
and tying off these loops with gold bead

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.360 
and tying off these loops with gold bead
wire<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.170> securing<00:02:31.710> that<00:02:31.920> wire<00:02:32.160> with

wire and securing that wire with

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.480 
wire and securing that wire with
crimpers<00:02:32.930> this<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.080> truly<00:02:34.380> an<00:02:34.620> easy<00:02:34.890> task<00:02:35.250> it

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.790 
crimpers this is truly an easy task it
requires<00:02:35.820> very<00:02:36.150> little<00:02:36.330> skill<00:02:36.810> one<00:02:37.500> trip<00:02:37.770> to
