section<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> brain<00:00:39.020> because<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.320> shows<00:00:41.030> in

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
section of the brain because it shows in

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.750 
section of the brain because it shows in
really<00:00:42.870> fresh<00:00:43.170> gross<00:00:43.500> anatomy<00:00:43.800> really<00:00:44.489> well

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
you can see on the brain that the white

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.670 
you can see on the brain that the white
matter<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.250> internal<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> gray<00:00:55.110> matter

calibrating<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.650> course<00:01:13.860> has<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.100> same<00:01:14.430> lobes

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
calibrating of course has the same lobes

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.670 
calibrating of course has the same lobes
that<00:01:14.939> ours<00:01:15.210> does<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:16.140> frontal<00:01:16.500> lobe<00:01:16.650> which

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
that ours does the frontal lobe which

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.640 
that ours does the frontal lobe which
again<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.220> partly<00:01:17.490> removed<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:19.290> parietal

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
again is partly removed the parietal

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.149 
again is partly removed the parietal
lobe<00:01:19.830> which<00:01:20.130> would<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.549> these<00:01:20.700> areas<00:01:21.180> and

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
lobe which would be in these areas and

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.880 
lobe which would be in these areas and
the<00:01:23.159> occipital<00:01:23.520> lobes<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.570> back<00:01:24.890> the

the occipital lobes in the back the
temporal<00:01:26.310> lobes<00:01:26.520> are<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> bit<00:01:27.229> tougher<00:01:28.229> they

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
temporal lobes are a bit tougher they

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
temporal lobes are a bit tougher they
don't<00:01:28.530> come<00:01:28.799> up<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.100> forward<00:01:29.580> like<00:01:29.820> ours<00:01:30.060> do

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
don't come up and forward like ours do

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.020 
don't come up and forward like ours do
and<00:01:30.890> this<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.100> has<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> lot<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.640> blood

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
and this one has a lot of blood

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.430 
and this one has a lot of blood
underneath<00:01:35.149> this<00:01:36.149> cow<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.750> cow<00:01:36.960> was<00:01:37.200> killed

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
underneath this cow this cow was killed

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.180 
underneath this cow this cow was killed
at<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.590> slaughterhouse<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:39.170> they<00:01:40.170> put<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> bolt

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
at a slaughterhouse and they put a bolt

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.029 
at a slaughterhouse and they put a bolt
through<00:01:41.280> their<00:01:41.580> brain<00:01:41.850> or<00:01:42.590> at<00:01:43.590> least<00:01:43.770> into<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
through their brain or at least into the

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.430 
through their brain or at least into the
brain<00:01:44.250> case<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.210> causes<00:01:45.479> severe

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
brain case and that causes severe

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.690 
brain case and that causes severe
intracranial<00:01:46.740> bleeding<00:01:49.220> this<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.490> kind

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
intracranial bleeding this is the kind

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.249 
intracranial bleeding this is the kind
of<00:01:50.850> bleeding<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.179> might<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:51.899> somebody

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
of bleeding you might see if somebody

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.410 
of bleeding you might see if somebody
has<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> traumatic<00:01:52.860> brain<00:01:53.190> injury<00:01:53.310> from<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.240> car

let's go ahead and perform a sagittal
section

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.180 

it's<00:03:57.960> a<00:03:58.110> little<00:03:58.380> more<00:03:58.500> difficult<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.069> work

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
it's a little more difficult to work

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.970 
it's a little more difficult to work
with<00:03:59.490> a<00:03:59.520> fresh<00:03:59.819> specimen<00:04:00.120> fresh<00:04:01.050> specimen<00:04:01.500> by

with a fresh specimen fresh specimen by
the<00:04:02.040> way<00:04:02.420> because<00:04:03.420> it's<00:04:04.110> simply<00:04:04.709> much<00:04:05.490> softer

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
the way because it's simply much softer

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.600 
the way because it's simply much softer
rather<00:04:08.010> than<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.459> formaldehyde<00:04:08.930> fixed

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
rather than the formaldehyde fixed

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.910 
rather than the formaldehyde fixed
specimens<00:04:11.610> that<00:04:11.700> we<00:04:11.880> usually<00:04:12.030> use<00:04:12.270> in<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.600> lab

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
specimens that we usually use in the lab

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.550 
specimens that we usually use in the lab
this<00:04:13.920> is<00:04:14.100> completely<00:04:14.610> unfixed<00:04:18.200> so<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.350> brain

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
this is completely unfixed so the brain

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.009 
this is completely unfixed so the brain
has<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.010> consistency<00:04:20.820> of<00:04:20.850> a<00:04:21.120> maybe<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.630> stiff

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
has the consistency of a maybe a stiff

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.080 
has the consistency of a maybe a stiff
pudding<00:04:22.440> which<00:04:22.890> makes<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.340> bit<00:04:23.520> tough<00:04:24.060> to

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
pudding which makes it a bit tough to

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:42.689 
pudding which makes it a bit tough to
the<00:04:25.910> sect<00:04:26.960> spinal<00:04:27.960> cords<00:04:28.169> a<00:04:28.260> bit<00:04:28.410> tougher

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.399 

another<00:04:43.270> thing<00:04:43.509> I've<00:04:43.629> noticed<00:04:43.749> in<00:04:44.050> terms<00:04:44.080> of

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
another thing I've noticed in terms of

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.290 
another thing I've noticed in terms of
texture<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:45.039> gray<00:04:45.249> matter<00:04:45.580> is<00:04:45.789> a<00:04:45.819> lot<00:04:46.090> more

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
texture the gray matter is a lot more

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:54.200 
texture the gray matter is a lot more
delicate<00:04:47.759> than<00:04:48.759> the<00:04:48.819> white<00:04:49.060> matter<00:04:49.360> is

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.370 

so<00:04:54.780> here's<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.229> left<00:04:55.440> half<00:04:55.740> of<00:04:55.889> the<00:04:56.009> brain

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:06.090 

there's<00:04:59.950> that<00:05:00.250> corpus<00:05:00.730> collosum<00:05:01.330> again

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.310 

right<00:05:06.700> here's<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.120> corpus<00:05:07.480> collosum<00:05:07.990> after

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
right here's the corpus collosum after

right here's the corpus collosum after
been<00:05:08.500> after<00:05:08.830> having<00:05:09.280> been<00:05:09.400> cut<00:05:11.160> this<00:05:12.160> region

been after having been cut this region

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:19.280 
been after having been cut this region
here<00:05:13.000> would<00:05:13.180> be<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.450> third<00:05:13.690> ventricle

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290

cerebellums<00:05:20.290> back<00:05:20.530> here<00:05:20.860> and<00:05:21.010> you<00:05:21.100> can<00:05:21.130> nicely

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
cerebellums back here and you can nicely

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:27.760 
cerebellums back here and you can nicely
see<00:05:21.730> the<00:05:22.120> arbor<00:05:22.420> vitae

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.180 

pons<00:05:28.340> is<00:05:28.640> in<00:05:28.790> this<00:05:28.910> region<00:05:29.120> here<00:05:29.660> and<00:05:30.190> the

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
pons is in this region here and the

medulla oblongata is back here and then

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.640 
medulla oblongata is back here and then
of<00:05:34.550> course<00:05:34.790> we've<00:05:35.060> got<00:05:35.090> spinal<00:05:35.690> cord<00:05:35.960> and<00:05:36.170> I

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
of course we've got spinal cord and I

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.410 
of course we've got spinal cord and I
just<00:05:36.890> happen<00:05:37.280> to<00:05:37.490> cut<00:05:37.700> right<00:05:37.970> down<00:05:38.000> the

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
just happen to cut right down the

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:45.160 
just happen to cut right down the
central<00:05:38.810> canal<00:05:39.110> of<00:05:39.320> a<00:05:39.380> spinal<00:05:39.680> cord<00:05:44.170> fourth

central canal of a spinal cord fourth
ventricle<00:05:45.440> is<00:05:45.980> very<00:05:46.220> visible<00:05:46.670> here

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:06:03.210 

right<00:05:51.750> in<00:05:51.870> this<00:05:51.990> area

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:09.300 

let's<00:06:03.820> look<00:06:04.000> at<00:06:04.120> the<00:06:04.270> other<00:06:04.450> half

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.060 

looks<00:06:09.850> like<00:06:10.000> it<00:06:10.150> took<00:06:10.360> that<00:06:11.010> sectioning<00:06:12.010> a

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
looks like it took that sectioning a

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
looks like it took that sectioning a
little<00:06:12.280> worse<00:06:12.430> for<00:06:12.460> wear<00:06:14.610> blood<00:06:15.610> clots<00:06:15.880> in

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
little worse for wear blood clots in

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:23.290 
little worse for wear blood clots in
here<00:06:16.300> still

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.140 

this<00:06:23.930> is<00:06:24.229> the<00:06:24.379> thalamus

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.570 

an<00:06:29.150> in<00:06:30.140> frontal<00:06:30.620> section<00:06:31.040> you<00:06:31.130> can<00:06:31.220> kind<00:06:31.520> of

an in frontal section you can kind of

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.630 
an in frontal section you can kind of
see<00:06:31.850> the<00:06:32.030> thalamus<00:06:32.450> here<00:06:32.750> as<00:06:32.840> well<00:06:33.490> it's<00:06:34.490> a

see the thalamus here as well it's a
round<00:06:35.590> almost<00:06:36.590> almond<00:06:37.310> shaped<00:06:38.320> area<00:06:39.320> of<00:06:39.500> the

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
round almost almond shaped area of the

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:57.730 
round almost almond shaped area of the
brain<00:06:39.860> on<00:06:40.610> either<00:06:40.820> side

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740

and<00:06:58.190> that's<00:06:58.400> the<00:06:58.670> frame<00:06:58.940> of<00:06:59.510> the<00:06:59.720> cow<00:06:59.900> bisected

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:01.660 
and that's the frame of the cow bisected

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:07.540 
and that's the frame of the cow bisected
again<00:07:02.660> to<00:07:02.870> show<00:07:03.080> you<00:07:03.140> how<00:07:03.320> soft<00:07:03.650> this<00:07:03.980> is<00:07:06.550> it's

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
again to show you how soft this is it's

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.280 
again to show you how soft this is it's
very<00:07:07.640> very<00:07:08.240> soft<00:07:10.480> so<00:07:11.480> it<00:07:11.600> kind<00:07:11.840> of<00:07:11.900> shows<00:07:11.960> you

very very soft so it kind of shows you

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.720 
very very soft so it kind of shows you
why<00:07:12.440> you<00:07:12.500> really<00:07:12.860> don't<00:07:13.100> want<00:07:13.280> to<00:07:13.370> hit<00:07:13.580> your

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:13.730 
why you really don't want to hit your

at least not too hard
that's<00:07:22.289> the<00:07:22.589> cow<00:07:22.739> brain<00:07:23.009> dissection<00:07:23.369> thank

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:23.909 
that's the cow brain dissection thank

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:26.719 
that's the cow brain dissection thank
you<00:07:24.029> again<00:07:24.119> for<00:07:24.360> watching
