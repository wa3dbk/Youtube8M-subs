sexist<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.260> really<00:00:40.710> cool<00:00:40.829> gameplay

for<00:00:41.850> my<00:00:41.969> standards<00:00:42.360> at<00:00:42.420> least<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.750> i<00:00:42.930> think<00:00:43.469> my

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
for my standards at least so i think my

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.770 
for my standards at least so i think my
final<00:00:43.860> score<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.219> only<00:00:44.370> 61<00:00:44.969> 27<00:00:45.360> which<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.629> still

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
final score is only 61 27 which is still

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.810 
final score is only 61 27 which is still
a<00:00:45.840> good<00:00:46.050> score<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:47.010> that's<00:00:47.370> not<00:00:47.520> why<00:00:47.700> i'm

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
a good score but that's not why i'm

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.310 
a good score but that's not why i'm
