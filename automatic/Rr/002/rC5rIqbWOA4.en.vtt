about that you had to Fuhrer out to
match<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.939> ribs<00:00:23.939> because<00:00:24.240> if<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.480> run<00:00:24.750> your

match the ribs because if you run your

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.439 
match the ribs because if you run your
blocks<00:00:26.070> here<00:00:26.640> then<00:00:26.880> you're<00:00:27.029> going<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.240> need<00:00:27.420> a

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
blocks here then you're going to need a

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.009 
blocks here then you're going to need a
piece<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.930> top<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.380> them

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
that's the overlap of the post that came

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.560 
that's the overlap of the post that came
up<00:00:55.399> was<00:00:56.269> 1<00:00:56.839> foot<00:00:57.140> 10<00:00:57.440> inches<00:00:57.469> and<00:00:58.300> you<00:00:59.300> had<00:00:59.420> 2

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
up was 1 foot 10 inches and you had 2

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.270 
up was 1 foot 10 inches and you had 2
inches<00:00:59.899> on<00:01:00.050> top<00:01:00.260> of<00:01:00.409> that<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:00.710> maybe<00:01:00.829> to<00:01:01.070> run<00:01:01.250> a

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
inches on top of that and maybe to run a

inches on top of that and maybe to run a
sill<00:01:01.670> some<00:01:02.030> kind

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.730 

and<00:01:11.340> then<00:01:11.930> didn't<00:01:12.930> even<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.290> door<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
and then didn't even have a door on the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.050 
and then didn't even have a door on the
other<00:01:13.950> side<00:01:14.210> not<00:01:15.210> now<00:01:15.390> that's<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:17.880> can

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
other side not now that's it you can

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.649 
other side not now that's it you can
adhere<00:01:18.240> an<00:01:18.750> interior<00:01:19.820> plastic<00:01:20.820> lining<00:01:21.119> which

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
adhere an interior plastic lining which

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.649 
adhere an interior plastic lining which
I<00:01:21.810> guess<00:01:21.960> they're<00:01:22.170> suggesting<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.010> plan

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
I guess they're suggesting in this plan

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.080 
I guess they're suggesting in this plan
it<00:01:25.380> shows<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.950> film<00:01:26.130> covering<00:01:26.550> just<00:01:26.700> going

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
it shows the film covering just going

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.140 
it shows the film covering just going
from<00:01:27.300> side<00:01:27.660> to<00:01:27.690> side<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.500> being<00:01:28.800> buried<00:01:29.190> in<00:01:29.610> a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
from side to side and being buried in a

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.590 
from side to side and being buried in a
ditch<00:01:30.390> both<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.229> inside<00:01:32.270> and<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.479> outside

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
ditch both in the inside and the outside

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.090 
ditch both in the inside and the outside
not<00:01:33.990> sure<00:01:34.170> how<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.920> inside

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
not sure how you do that on the inside

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.690 
not sure how you do that on the inside
but<00:01:39.979> that<00:01:40.979> would<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.159> pretty<00:01:41.250> effective

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
but that would be pretty effective

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.330 
but that would be pretty effective
wouldn't<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:43.590> have<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.920> all<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.100> way<00:01:44.280> to

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
wouldn't it you have that all the way to

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.110 
wouldn't it you have that all the way to
the<00:01:44.550> ground<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.030> though

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.350 

okay<00:01:52.120> this<00:01:52.390> is<00:01:52.600> actually<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:54.460> very<00:01:54.850> first

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
okay this is actually the very first

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.310 
okay this is actually the very first
part<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.080> instructions<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:58.050> it<00:01:59.050> talks

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
part of the instructions and it talks

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.450 
part of the instructions and it talks
about<00:01:59.640> the<00:02:00.640> benefits<00:02:01.150> of<00:02:01.480> why<00:02:01.780> they<00:02:01.960> wanted<00:02:02.460> to

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
about the benefits of why they wanted to

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.780 
about the benefits of why they wanted to
make<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:03.820> clear<00:02:04.450> span<00:02:04.900> with<00:02:05.200> no<00:02:05.350> post<00:02:05.790> to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790

built in multiples of 4 foot links can

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.090 
built in multiples of 4 foot links can
be<00:02:24.640> up<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:25.060> hundred<00:02:25.140> feet<00:02:26.140> long<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:29.100> I'll

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
be up to a hundred feet long and I'll

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.930 
be up to a hundred feet long and I'll
just<00:02:30.250> let<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.460> read<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.790> rest<00:02:30.970> fetch<00:02:31.240> so<00:02:32.940> ok

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
just let you read the rest fetch so ok

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.640 
just let you read the rest fetch so ok
and<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.090> think<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:34.450> contains<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.170> rest<00:02:35.380> of

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
and I think this contains the rest of

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.170 
and I think this contains the rest of
the<00:02:35.800> instructions<00:02:36.160> for<00:02:37.290> making<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.620> jig<00:02:39.180> to

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
the instructions for making the jig to

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.270 
the instructions for making the jig to
create<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.580> rafters<00:02:43.650> what<00:02:44.650> I'll<00:02:44.770> do<00:02:44.950> if<00:02:45.070> y'all

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
create the rafters what I'll do if y'all

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.460 
create the rafters what I'll do if y'all
can't<00:02:45.580> read<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:46.000> I<00:02:46.030> guess<00:02:46.330> come<00:02:47.050> back<00:02:47.230> and

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
can't read that I guess come back and

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.890 
can't read that I guess come back and
read<00:02:47.710> to<00:02:47.950> you<00:02:48.010> know<00:02:48.310> it's<00:02:48.640> not<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:49.000> important

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.140 

but<00:02:52.900> this<00:02:53.140> is<00:02:53.290> interesting<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.520> building

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
but this is interesting the building

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.410

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
okay so the first part must have been

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.110 
okay so the first part must have been
talking<00:05:24.460> about<00:05:24.520> how<00:05:25.210> to<00:05:25.270> put<00:05:26.110> them<00:05:26.289> together
