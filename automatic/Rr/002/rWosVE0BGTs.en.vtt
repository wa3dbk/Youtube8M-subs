00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.250

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.590
 pay attention to breading i have here 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.810

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.730
 train for it, make it 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.400
 if you have frozen fish that we do 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.650
 has thawed quite well and nothing more 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.810
 better if we fry and after 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.050
 there is still something in there will be the next 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.460
 the meat is very mushy 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.750
 in the fish stop to pay attention that 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.040
 there are no more bones inside 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.140
 meat itself always good with the two 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.480
 index finger and finger middle finger 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.510
 sorry about the inside of the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.469
 fish dws goes 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.469
 if you still have a click 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.719
 There are original fresh extra for 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.610
 herringbone but you can too 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.610
 Take a pair of tweezers or something 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.710
 or with the knife hold the thumb out 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.670
 Depending on how you want it 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.890
 We can actually lose everyone 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.560
 Fish does not really matter which fish 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.900
 the panier some fish let themselves 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.189
 better can the drive is not so 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.600
 that I have to say absolutely is one 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.229
 very good idea of her reputation 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.930
 may lose 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.610
 first spice the fish with one 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.610
 pinch of salt and pepper 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:30.820
 then we turn the fish in the head that 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:34.390
 Cut off that fresh with the e10 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.390
 was beautiful again by 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.310
 Also that it was nicely covered in fish 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.350
 and then off to the sea 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.020
 and do not be afraid you press that 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.620
 fish is not broken or so beautiful that you 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.120
 press me firmly than usual at the end in 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.650
 the pan no longer adheres properly 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.990
 but it dissolves from the fish that is too 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.260
 may again that the melap sticks 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.260
 remains 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.080
 and the award-winning fish fillet is ready 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.970
