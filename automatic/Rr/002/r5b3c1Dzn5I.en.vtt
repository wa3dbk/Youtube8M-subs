so<00:00:09.890> today<00:00:10.250> I'm<00:00:10.490> replacing<00:00:10.850> the<00:00:11.650> rubber<00:00:12.650> boots

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
so today I'm replacing the rubber boots

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.519 
so today I'm replacing the rubber boots
on<00:00:13.280> a<00:00:13.310> Volkswagen<00:00:14.090> swing<00:00:14.390> axle<00:00:14.870> and<00:00:17.529> cousins

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
on a Volkswagen swing axle and cousins

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.200 
on a Volkswagen swing axle and cousins
they<00:00:18.619> have<00:00:18.740> a<00:00:18.770> nice<00:00:19.070> leaky<00:00:19.670> one<00:00:19.850> here<00:00:22.090> and<00:00:23.090> the

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
they have a nice leaky one here and the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.050 
they have a nice leaky one here and the
reason<00:00:23.540> I'm<00:00:23.660> filming<00:00:24.470> this<00:00:24.620> is<00:00:24.920> when<00:00:25.790> I<00:00:25.880> looked

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
reason I'm filming this is when I looked

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.720 
reason I'm filming this is when I looked
on<00:00:26.210> YouTube<00:00:26.420> it<00:00:26.930> was<00:00:27.050> only<00:00:27.340> one<00:00:28.340> other<00:00:28.490> video

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
on YouTube it was only one other video

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.260 
on YouTube it was only one other video
doing<00:00:29.240> it<00:00:29.450> and<00:00:29.660> it<00:00:30.230> was<00:00:30.350> some<00:00:30.590> old<00:00:30.620> guy<00:00:31.270> with

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
doing it and it was some old guy with

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.240 
doing it and it was some old guy with
Dueling<00:00:32.809> Banjos<00:00:32.840> playing<00:00:33.800> in<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.100> background

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
Dueling Banjos playing in the background

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.820 
Dueling Banjos playing in the background
and<00:00:34.850> he<00:00:35.150> had<00:00:35.270> no<00:00:35.570> idea<00:00:35.989> or<00:00:36.110> what<00:00:36.230> he<00:00:36.350> was<00:00:36.500> doing

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
and he had no idea or what he was doing

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.110 
and he had no idea or what he was doing
and<00:00:37.070> installed<00:00:37.699> them<00:00:37.910> wrong

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
and installed them wrong

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.229 
and installed them wrong
he<00:00:41.120> made<00:00:41.360> a<00:00:41.390> common<00:00:41.809> mistake<00:00:42.019> which<00:00:42.559> is

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
he made a common mistake which is

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.420 
he made a common mistake which is
putting<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:44.360> joint<00:00:44.629> there<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:45.650> the<00:00:45.769> top<00:00:46.070> of

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
putting the joint there to the top of

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.009 
putting the joint there to the top of
the<00:00:46.729> bottom<00:00:47.170> which<00:00:48.170> is<00:00:49.000> surefire<00:00:50.000> way<00:00:50.239> to<00:00:50.269> give

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
the bottom which is surefire way to give

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.869 
the bottom which is surefire way to give
short<00:00:51.350> life<00:00:51.650> because<00:00:51.949> I'll<00:00:52.129> split<00:00:52.610> very

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
short life because I'll split very

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.680 
short life because I'll split very
quickly<00:00:53.949> these<00:00:54.949> ones<00:00:55.250> were<00:00:55.760> fitted<00:00:56.420> in<00:00:58.690> 1998

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
quickly these ones were fitted in 1998

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.640 
quickly these ones were fitted in 1998
or<00:01:00.409> 99<00:01:00.890> I<00:01:01.070> think<00:01:01.489> it's<00:01:02.239> only<00:01:02.390> just<00:01:02.570> now<00:01:03.049> split

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
or 99 I think it's only just now split

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.240 
or 99 I think it's only just now split
and<00:01:04.220> just<00:01:04.519> see<00:01:04.790> there<00:01:05.089> where<00:01:05.299> it's<00:01:05.420> split<00:01:06.250> if

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
and just see there where it's split if

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.789 
and just see there where it's split if
my<00:01:07.460> focus<00:01:07.970> at<00:01:08.120> work<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:11.090> as<00:01:11.750> you<00:01:11.960> can<00:01:12.080> see<00:01:12.140> they

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
my focus at work and as you can see they

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.039 
my focus at work and as you can see they
piss<00:01:13.340> out<00:01:13.579> transmission<00:01:14.329> oil<00:01:14.479> when<00:01:14.840> they<00:01:14.990> do

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
piss out transmission oil when they do

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.830 
piss out transmission oil when they do
split<00:01:16.009> so<00:01:18.340> got<00:01:19.340> some<00:01:19.369> new<00:01:19.789> ones<00:01:19.969> here<00:01:20.299> to<00:01:20.450> go<00:01:20.600> in

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
split so got some new ones here to go in

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.200 
split so got some new ones here to go in
gonna<00:01:21.170> do<00:01:21.380> both<00:01:21.619> sides<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.610> other<00:01:22.759> side<00:01:23.000> isn't

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
gonna do both sides the other side isn't

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.170 
gonna do both sides the other side isn't
leaking<00:01:23.780> but<00:01:24.020> some<00:01:24.579> always<00:01:25.579> easier<00:01:25.939> doing

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
leaking but some always easier doing

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
leaking but some always easier doing
both<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:27.340> get<00:01:28.340> German<00:01:28.880> where<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:29.149> can<00:01:29.420> always

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
both and get German where you can always

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.779 
both and get German where you can always
much<00:01:30.409> better<00:01:30.500> quality<00:01:32.740> so<00:01:33.740> you<00:01:34.219> lose<00:01:34.430> a<00:01:34.460> little

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
much better quality so you lose a little

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.749 
much better quality so you lose a little
bit<00:01:34.939> of<00:01:35.060> oil<00:01:35.270> but<00:01:35.570> not<00:01:35.750> too<00:01:35.990> much<00:01:36.289> so<00:01:36.649> just<00:01:36.979> got

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
bit of oil but not too much so just got

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.060 
bit of oil but not too much so just got
a<00:01:37.789> pan<00:01:38.090> there<00:01:38.560> first<00:01:39.560> thing<00:01:39.710> I'm<00:01:39.770> going<00:01:39.859> to<00:01:39.950> do

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
a pan there first thing I'm going to do

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.219 
a pan there first thing I'm going to do
is<00:01:40.219> get<00:01:40.429> off<00:01:40.549> those<00:01:40.880> um<00:01:41.799> hose<00:01:42.799> clamps<00:01:43.810> got<00:01:44.810> one

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
is get off those um hose clamps got one

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.990 
is get off those um hose clamps got one
on<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.590> outside<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.640> uh<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:48.020> know<00:01:48.140> one<00:01:48.320> there

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
on the outside and uh you know one there

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.149 
on the outside and uh you know one there
and<00:01:50.000> they're<00:01:50.899> just<00:01:51.079> your<00:01:51.200> typical<00:01:51.380> were<00:01:51.859> more

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
and they're just your typical were more

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.310 
and they're just your typical were more
all<00:01:52.249> the<00:01:52.399> ones<00:01:52.609> there<00:01:52.939> but<00:01:53.179> your<00:01:53.780> original

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
all the ones there but your original

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.319 
all the ones there but your original
Volkswagen<00:01:55.070> ones<00:01:55.249> are<00:01:55.399> actually<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.759> special

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
Volkswagen ones are actually a special

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.899 
Volkswagen ones are actually a special
crimp<00:01:56.719> up<00:01:56.899> tight<00:01:57.259> but<00:01:57.560> you're<00:01:58.520> very<00:01:58.640> unlikely

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
crimp up tight but you're very unlikely

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.279 
crimp up tight but you're very unlikely
to<00:01:59.390> come<00:01:59.539> across<00:01:59.749> those<00:02:00.109> ones<00:02:01.749> like<00:02:02.749> a<00:02:02.780> morph

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
to come across those ones like a morph

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:10.779 
to come across those ones like a morph
easy<00:02:03.530> enough<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.719> I<00:02:07.509> was<00:02:08.509> going<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:09.610> slip<00:02:10.610> the

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
easy enough and I was going to slip the

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.210 
easy enough and I was going to slip the
boot<00:02:11.000> lengthways<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:12.200> remove<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:13.069> but

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
boot lengthways to remove it but

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.360 
boot lengthways to remove it but
actually<00:02:13.930> when<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:15.050> remove<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.440> two<00:02:15.830> hose

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
actually when I remove the two hose

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.540 
actually when I remove the two hose
clamps<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:17.180> just<00:02:17.390> split<00:02:17.960> I<00:02:18.230> was<00:02:18.800> able<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.160> tear

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
clamps it just split I was able to tear

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.310 
clamps it just split I was able to tear
it<00:02:19.730> pretty<00:02:20.060> easily<00:02:20.330> along<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.200> bolt<00:02:21.770> line

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
it pretty easily along the bolt line

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.800 
it pretty easily along the bolt line
and<00:02:24.320> see<00:02:24.620> here<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.040> just<00:02:25.370> ripped<00:02:26.360> where<00:02:26.660> the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
and see here I just ripped where the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.150 
and see here I just ripped where the
seams<00:02:27.140> are<00:02:29.140> rather<00:02:30.140> than<00:02:30.410> on<00:02:30.500> doing<00:02:30.860> all<00:02:30.980> those

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
seams are rather than on doing all those

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.680 
seams are rather than on doing all those
bolts<00:02:31.840> made<00:02:32.840> easy<00:02:33.110> quick<00:02:33.650> job<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:34.040> it

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
bolts made easy quick job of it

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.030 
bolts made easy quick job of it
these<00:02:35.690> ones<00:02:35.990> are<00:02:36.260> also<00:02:38.830> made<00:02:39.830> in<00:02:39.860> Germany<00:02:40.670> so

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
these ones are also made in Germany so

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.540 
these ones are also made in Germany so
that's<00:02:43.040> probably<00:02:44.470> why<00:02:45.470> they've<00:02:45.710> lasted<00:02:45.980> so

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
that's probably why they've lasted so

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.260 
that's probably why they've lasted so
long<00:02:48.100> so<00:02:49.100> you<00:02:49.220> can<00:02:49.340> see<00:02:49.520> with<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.820> new<00:02:50.000> ones

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
long so you can see with the new ones

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.540 
long so you can see with the new ones
where<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.840> bolts<00:02:51.230> go<00:02:51.440> through<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.070> join<00:02:52.340> the

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
where the bolts go through to join the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.510 
where the bolts go through to join the
two<00:02:52.790> halves<00:02:53.830> actually<00:02:54.830> got<00:02:55.630> male/female

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
two halves actually got male/female

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.490 
two halves actually got male/female
sections<00:02:58.520> to<00:02:58.820> help<00:02:59.450> make<00:02:59.690> them<00:02:59.870> seal<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.230> bit

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
sections to help make them seal a bit

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.970 
sections to help make them seal a bit
better<00:03:00.710> and<00:03:01.090> there<00:03:02.090> really<00:03:02.240> is<00:03:02.570> no<00:03:02.950> need<00:03:03.950> to

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
better and there really is no need to

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.610 
better and there really is no need to
put<00:03:04.220> sealant<00:03:04.610> in<00:03:05.150> there

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
put sealant in there

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.310 
put sealant in there
some<00:03:07.430> people<00:03:07.790> do<00:03:08.030> as<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.690> can<00:03:08.780> see<00:03:08.990> the<00:03:09.140> ones

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
some people do as you can see the ones

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.010 
some people do as you can see the ones
that<00:03:09.530> are<00:03:09.680> on<00:03:09.800> here<00:03:10.100> did<00:03:10.370> but<00:03:10.700> it's<00:03:11.510> more<00:03:11.780> just

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
that are on here did but it's more just

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.530 
that are on here did but it's more just
to<00:03:12.320> seal<00:03:12.860> a<00:03:12.890> gap<00:03:13.220> on<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.580> outside<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.240> keep<00:03:14.390> the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
to seal a gap on the outside to keep the

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.800 
to seal a gap on the outside to keep the
dust<00:03:14.780> out<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.700> if<00:03:16.820> you<00:03:16.940> don't<00:03:17.150> over<00:03:17.600> tighten

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
dust out and if you don't over tighten

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.310 
dust out and if you don't over tighten
the<00:03:18.290> two<00:03:19.100> hose<00:03:19.430> clamps<00:03:19.510> they<00:03:20.510> do<00:03:20.570> seal<00:03:21.140> around

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
the two hose clamps they do seal around

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.490 
the two hose clamps they do seal around
the<00:03:21.590> axle<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.520> side<00:03:23.390> plate<00:03:23.720> flange<00:03:24.080> quite

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
the axle and the side plate flange quite

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.830 
the axle and the side plate flange quite
well<00:03:24.770> on<00:03:25.040> their<00:03:25.430> own<00:03:27.760> now<00:03:28.760> dad's<00:03:29.390> actually<00:03:29.660> a

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
well on their own now dad's actually a

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.440 
well on their own now dad's actually a
requester<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:30.710> put<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.240> joint<00:03:32.240> to<00:03:32.420> the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
requester that I put the joint to the

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.000 
requester that I put the joint to the
back<00:03:32.840> on<00:03:33.110> this<00:03:33.410> which<00:03:33.740> is<00:03:33.770> fine<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:36.620> can<00:03:36.800> go<00:03:36.950> to

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
back on this which is fine you can go to

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.320 
back on this which is fine you can go to
the<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:38.060> back<00:03:38.330> or<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.720> front<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.970> only<00:03:41.180> thing

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
the the back or the front the only thing

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.540 
the the back or the front the only thing
you<00:03:41.420> don't<00:03:41.540> want<00:03:41.840> is<00:03:42.050> on<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.560> bottom<00:03:43.310> or<00:03:43.490> the

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
you don't want is on the bottom or the

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.490 
you don't want is on the bottom or the
top<00:03:44.590> there<00:03:45.590> isn't<00:03:45.830> for<00:03:45.950> that<00:03:46.040> as<00:03:46.310> the

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
top there isn't for that as the

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.860 
top there isn't for that as the
suspension<00:03:48.500> moves<00:03:48.710> up<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.160> down<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.940> the

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
suspension moves up and down the the

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.700 
suspension moves up and down the the
joint<00:03:51.170> flexes<00:03:51.920> and<00:03:52.670> it<00:03:52.790> will<00:03:52.910> very<00:03:53.150> quickly

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
joint flexes and it will very quickly

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.160 
joint flexes and it will very quickly
rip<00:03:54.710> between<00:03:55.580> the<00:03:55.760> corrugations<00:03:56.510> there<00:03:56.840> like

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
rip between the corrugations there like

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.550 
rip between the corrugations there like
the<00:03:57.320> old<00:03:57.470> one<00:03:57.680> has<00:03:58.210> in<00:03:59.210> very<00:03:59.510> short<00:03:59.930> time<00:04:00.050> if

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
the old one has in very short time if

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.060 
the old one has in very short time if
it's<00:04:01.810> has<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.840> joint<00:04:03.260> at<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.500> top<00:04:03.770> like<00:04:04.040> that

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
it's has a joint at the top like that

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.100 
it's has a joint at the top like that
other<00:04:04.760> video<00:04:05.000> on<00:04:05.210> YouTube<00:04:05.750> shows<00:04:06.340> so<00:04:08.080> all<00:04:09.080> I

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
other video on YouTube shows so all I

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.620 
other video on YouTube shows so all I
gotta<00:04:09.290> do<00:04:09.440> now<00:04:09.470> is<00:04:09.890> get<00:04:10.040> those<00:04:10.280> two<00:04:10.940> clamps<00:04:11.480> on

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
gotta do now is get those two clamps on

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.950 
gotta do now is get those two clamps on
it

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
it

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.910 
it
and<00:04:12.620> put<00:04:12.920> all<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:14.110> bolts<00:04:15.110> through<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.500> joints

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
and put all the bolts through the joints

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.060 
and put all the bolts through the joints
so<00:04:17.020> I've<00:04:18.020> just<00:04:18.200> got<00:04:18.350> that<00:04:18.380> on<00:04:18.710> there<00:04:18.739> now

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
so I've just got that on there now

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.610 
so I've just got that on there now
everything's<00:04:19.670> only<00:04:20.090> finger<00:04:20.930> tightest<00:04:21.410> or

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
everything's only finger tightest or

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.610 
everything's only finger tightest or
still<00:04:22.720> just<00:04:23.720> snubbed<00:04:24.140> up

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
still just snubbed up

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.430 
still just snubbed up
now<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.640> key<00:04:25.910> with<00:04:26.090> these<00:04:26.270> things<00:04:26.570> is<00:04:26.780> to<00:04:26.810> not

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
now the key with these things is to not

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.190 
now the key with these things is to not
over<00:04:27.920> tighten<00:04:28.220> it<00:04:28.490> snug<00:04:29.450> it<00:04:29.600> up<00:04:29.690> enough<00:04:30.020> that

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
over tighten it snug it up enough that

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.440 
over tighten it snug it up enough that
everything's<00:04:30.710> done<00:04:30.950> up<00:04:31.130> firm<00:04:31.460> but<00:04:31.880> when

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
everything's done up firm but when

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.230 
everything's done up firm but when
you're<00:04:32.600> over<00:04:32.840> tighten<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:34.220> bolts<00:04:34.580> along<00:04:34.820> here

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
you're over tighten the bolts along here

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.020 
you're over tighten the bolts along here

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
likely to leak oil so just start at the

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.000 
likely to leak oil so just start at the
inside<00:04:44.850> -<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.510> work<00:04:45.720> my<00:04:45.930> way<00:04:46.110> out<00:04:46.140> do<00:04:46.860> the

inside - and work my way out do the

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.850 
inside - and work my way out do the
first<00:04:47.310> two<00:04:47.580> then<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.810> outer<00:04:49.020> ones<00:04:49.380> and<00:04:49.710> keep

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
first two then the outer ones and keep

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.400 
first two then the outer ones and keep
working<00:04:50.070> out<00:04:50.490> just<00:04:50.790> to<00:04:51.420> sort<00:04:51.660> of<00:04:51.720> help<00:04:51.870> evenly

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
working out just to sort of help evenly

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.510 
working out just to sort of help evenly
distribute<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.190> force<00:04:54.230> and<00:04:55.230> that's<00:04:56.100> really

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
distribute the force and that's really

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.860 
distribute the force and that's really
all<00:04:56.820> there<00:04:57.030> is<00:04:57.060> to<00:04:57.480> it

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
all there is to it

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.970 
all there is to it
all<00:04:58.710> right<00:04:59.100> so<00:04:59.310> there's<00:04:59.550> both<00:04:59.820> sides<00:05:00.240> done<00:05:02.930> so

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
all right so there's both sides done so

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.340 
all right so there's both sides done so
one<00:05:04.980> really<00:05:05.250> important<00:05:05.790> thing<00:05:05.820> to<00:05:06.000> do<00:05:06.480> now<00:05:06.840> is

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
one really important thing to do now is

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.170 
one really important thing to do now is
because<00:05:07.830> they've<00:05:08.070> been<00:05:08.220> split<00:05:08.580> and<00:05:08.820> leaking

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
because they've been split and leaking

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.260 
because they've been split and leaking
oil<00:05:10.160> obviously<00:05:11.160> the<00:05:11.280> gearbox<00:05:11.760> is<00:05:11.940> going<00:05:12.090> to<00:05:12.150> be

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
oil obviously the gearbox is going to be

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.540 
oil obviously the gearbox is going to be
low<00:05:12.480> on<00:05:12.660> oil<00:05:12.810> now<00:05:13.230> so<00:05:13.650> uh<00:05:15.890> right<00:05:16.890> up<00:05:17.160> under

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
low on oil now so uh right up under

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.450 
low on oil now so uh right up under
there<00:05:17.760> somewhere<00:05:19.160> there<00:05:20.300> is<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:22.130> filler<00:05:23.130> plug

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
there somewhere there is the filler plug

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:30.350 
there somewhere there is the filler plug
I've<00:05:23.730> just<00:05:24.030> removed<00:05:24.510> and<00:05:28.580> all<00:05:29.580> I<00:05:29.640> do<00:05:29.910> is<00:05:30.120> top

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
I've just removed and all I do is top

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.260 
I've just removed and all I do is top
the<00:05:30.540> oil<00:05:30.720> up<00:05:31.040> until<00:05:32.040> it<00:05:32.160> starts<00:05:32.190> running<00:05:32.940> out

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
the oil up until it starts running out

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.230 
the oil up until it starts running out
that<00:05:33.480> filler<00:05:33.780> and<00:05:35.750> that's<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:36.960> correct<00:05:37.290> level

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
that filler and that's the correct level

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.200 
that filler and that's the correct level
but<00:05:39.560> we've<00:05:40.560> never<00:05:40.920> ever<00:05:41.250> changed<00:05:41.790> the<00:05:41.880> oil<00:05:41.910> in

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
but we've never ever changed the oil in

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.830 
but we've never ever changed the oil in
this<00:05:42.390> thing<00:05:42.660> since<00:05:42.960> new<00:05:43.290> which<00:05:43.830> was<00:05:45.470> 1997<00:05:46.470> some

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
this thing since new which was 1997 some

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.870 
this thing since new which was 1997 some
trike<00:05:48.840> was<00:05:49.080> built<00:05:49.380> and<00:05:50.010> the<00:05:50.310> oils<00:05:50.610> never

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
trike was built and the oils never

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.240 
trike was built and the oils never
actually<00:05:51.150> been<00:05:51.510> changed<00:05:51.810> so<00:05:52.350> we're<00:05:53.100> actually

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
actually been changed so we're actually

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.760 
actually been changed so we're actually
going<00:05:53.520> to<00:05:53.580> do<00:05:53.760> a<00:05:53.790> full<00:05:54.060> oil<00:05:54.810> change<00:05:55.410> on<00:05:55.680> the
