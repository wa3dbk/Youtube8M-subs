 the new android candy will project 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.940
 he says goodbye to Puerto Rico and the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.550
 rumors about the ipad brow how are they and 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.410
 welcome to another segment of the week 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.570
 in cinema in Spanish I'm vanessa hand 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.520
 orellana and today 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.390
 gabrielsson back to gabriel welcome 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.090
 from ariel thank you we miss you so much 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.460
 we all cry too, we cry 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.340
 marta say good let's start with the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.290
 news of the week that we started the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.059
 week with this news and is that google 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.949
 finally announced the name of the treat 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.140
 of maximum android 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.530
 we had speculated that it would be called 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.989
 muffin mn milkyway but it turns out that 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.059
 called marshmallow or marshmallow in 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.970
 Spanish in Spanish is said malvavisco 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.710
 but it's called marshmallow which today is 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.629
 a little bit a good tongue twister that does not 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.910
 love the name I liked more others 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.080
 as you mentioned menem yes 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.420
 milkyway as cat kit but good so 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.010
 flame and this is the next taste of 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.979
 android and the most interesting important 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.950
 is that it's version 6.0 had been 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.479
 speculated if it's going to be 5.22 and 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.210
 effectively a jump and I think that 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.340
 this is important because it marks that 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.040
 it's a radical change is a change 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.560
 important for the company is a 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.509
 completely new and good version to 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.400
 see how people receive it and little to 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.009
 little as it is always in the case of 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.740
 android we will start to hear what 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.930
 phones start to activate with this 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.180
 version because remember that in the case 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.509
 of android as opposed to apple ios 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.970
 it's a step-up update and it's going 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.340
 receiving little by little each brand and each 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.070
 device in different countries besides 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.539
 so in this case yes I recommend 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.729
 be very aware of what we are going 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.100
 publishing and we will have a very article 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.570
 very full length very detailed with 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.390
 all the updates of when 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.100
 impact their phones in particular and 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.420
 among the novelties gabriel that 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.280
 We expected that they were already seeing the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.630
 John's video was more privacy in 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.560
 applications now 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.880
 Android more or less will let you choose what 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.250
 information you share with 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.490
 applications that download another novelty 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.920
 is the one that now has usb support 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.500
 Type C for faster loading for 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.400
 phones that have it and also this 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.400
 this mode of dous that allows you to have 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.890
 turn off the device with sensors with 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.950
 sensors and that way will reduce the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.020
 the use of the battery when you're not in 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.630
 use and of course they can also 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.940
 see more news and we have the the 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.790
 analysis the first analysis in cinema 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.250
 puntocom diagonal that and continue with 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.100
 google gabriel but this time about 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.440
 will project this phone project 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.570
 Modular of the company tell us what happened 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.550
 that there is a bad news for port 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.650
 rich, it is undoubtedly one of the 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.440
 most anticipated projects at least 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.190
 in cinema is in Spanish the giant of 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.740
 mountain view and how do you know the idea 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.230
 to project is to offer the little ones 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.150
 modules that could form a phone 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.230
 complete for you to choose the camera 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.909
 what do you want 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.060
 processor that you want the screen that 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.129
 you want is a fabulous idea is the future 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.799
 of telephony but being that it is a 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.510
 google project when you throw things with 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.349
 this project denomination then it 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.360
 gives the luxury of changing dates to announce 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.160
 things at the last moment and they had said 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.080
 that they were going to try it in puerto rico in 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.000
 the third quarter of this year and now 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.489
 have changed it will no longer be in puerto rico 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.620
 if it's not going to be in a market in the USA that 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.560
 is about to be announced and will no longer be this 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.150
 year but at the beginning of 2016 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.069
 then we continue waiting we will be 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.140
 very outstanding but good those are 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.879
 important changes because what 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.250
 implies is that it will be delayed a bit more 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.260
 this project and it will not explain very well 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.989
 Why was it changed the market 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.060
 true not just yesterday there was a confusion 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.430
 because they made a tweet where he said 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.410
 nothing did not pass our crash tests 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.780
 and many people interpreted it as 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.700
 they were saying that because it 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.829
 disarmed the phones had to 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.720
 delay the release but today google 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.699
 He went out to say that no forgiveness is only 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.650
 a joke tweet then no longer 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.510
 we understood very well what is clear is 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.370
 who are still trying the best way to 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.790
 paste 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.130
 with magnets these modules to say to the 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.570
 skeleton of the phone and it is very clear 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.370
 that is not ready yet they continue 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.760
 doing tests and that now will not be 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.070
 until 2016 that we see it as no longer 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.229
 I was very joke is the thief pretty 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.760
 bad and confused a lot of good people and 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.280
 talking about google we can not talk about 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.720
 google without talking about support that also 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.940
 they had good there are several rumors this 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.860
 week around the launch of the 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.840
 next iphone is already almost already comes 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.479
 gabriel and also from ipad pro that 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.169
 we have been waiting for some 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:00.600
 years this most powerful support tablet 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.460
 type the surface that will be bigger than 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.979
 the previous ipads and that now 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.169
 supposedly already entered production or 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.300
 will go into production and the screen 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.310
 will be made of sharp is the last thing that 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.800
 we know the last one we know if you are 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.780
 talking about producing up to 5 million 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.729
 units in the first quarter is a 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.130
 ambitious figure because the sales of 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.750
 particular ipad tablets and 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.940
 really of all vanessa brands 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.100
 they are falling they are no longer sold as before 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.349
 there are very particular things this segment 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.520
 like people do not change their tablets to 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.440
 your tablet as often as 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.099
 to your phone and this of course has 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.199
 affected to the sale of ipads but is 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:41.110
 betting strong support for this that is 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:43.720
 rumored but there is so much rumor and it has 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.370
 said so much about this ipad pro that I 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.440
 It would be very strange if we did not see it in 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.300
 October and as you mentioned well 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.220
 there is a very strong rumor of when 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.280
 we will see the new iphones that very 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.590
 it's probably September 9 the 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.270
 presentation remember that in the USA it is 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.370
 Monday, September 7 is a day 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.169
 festive normally to be populated their 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.080
 presentations on Tuesday but in this 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:06.699
 house would be that I think it 's Wednesday 9 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.620
 of September if it is indeed 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.360
 Wednesday no longer points you in the 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.490
 ariel calendar because we know that 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.690
 this day only in this we will be there 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.000
 we will be with everything and I forgot 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.370
 mention vanessa who had all the 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.930
 weeks you make an incredible program that 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.090
 it's called apple gossip where 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.310
 come a lot more details of everything 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.500
 this and you do it more often 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.270
 when an event is approaching 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.340
 important to points do not miss it 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.530
 there's gossip from the apple with everyone 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.909
 the details of what we are talking about 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.259
 good and we also have the rest of 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:36.790
 this news that we are talking about 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.730
 now in puntocom cinema 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.920
 and we are waiting for you next week with 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.870
 Today's new technologies vanessa

 hand orellana and gabriel sama and until the 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.020
 next
