I would say that shade wise it's nearly

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.500 
I would say that shade wise it's nearly
identical<00:03:09.220> especially<00:03:10.060> when<00:03:10.209> you<00:03:10.299> actually

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
identical especially when you actually

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.979 
identical especially when you actually
apply<00:03:10.989> and<00:03:11.709> wear<00:03:12.070> both<00:03:12.519> but<00:03:13.299> what<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.810> comes

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
apply and wear both but what it comes

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.140 
apply and wear both but what it comes
down<00:03:14.109> to<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.620> biggest<00:03:15.150> inconsistency

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
down to the biggest inconsistency

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.210 
down to the biggest inconsistency
between<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.540> two<00:03:16.690> is<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.049> texture<00:03:17.650> I<00:03:17.680> do<00:03:17.829> find

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
between the two is the texture I do find

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.069 
between the two is the texture I do find
that<00:03:18.280> crowns<00:03:18.609> are<00:03:18.850> a<00:03:18.880> little<00:03:19.000> bit<00:03:19.180> more<00:03:19.209> the

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
that crowns are a little bit more the

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.599 
that crowns are a little bit more the
crown<00:03:20.290> trio<00:03:20.590> it's<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.190> little<00:03:21.400> bit<00:03:21.489> more

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
crown trio it's a little bit more

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.789 
crown trio it's a little bit more
powdery<00:03:22.120> personally<00:03:23.019> it<00:03:23.230> makes<00:03:23.470> them<00:03:23.680> more

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
powdery personally it makes them more

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.560 
powdery personally it makes them more
buildable<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.430> doesn't<00:03:24.730> make<00:03:24.850> them<00:03:24.970> chalky<00:03:25.359> or

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
buildable it doesn't make them chalky or

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.140 
buildable it doesn't make them chalky or
anything<00:03:25.870> they<00:03:26.290> still<00:03:26.620> lay<00:03:27.280> just<00:03:27.670> as<00:03:27.790> evenly

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
anything they still lay just as evenly

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.599 
anything they still lay just as evenly
they<00:03:28.329> wear<00:03:28.660> just<00:03:29.109> as<00:03:29.350> long<00:03:30.010> as<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.489> it

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
they wear just as long as the it

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.280 
they wear just as long as the it
cosmetics<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.630> just<00:03:31.810> comes<00:03:31.989> down<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.170> how

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
cosmetics it just comes down to how

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.710 
cosmetics it just comes down to how
buildable<00:03:33.190> these<00:03:33.459> are<00:03:33.670> so<00:03:34.000> this<00:03:34.480> might

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
buildable these are so this might

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.630 
buildable these are so this might
actually<00:03:34.870> flatter<00:03:35.709> a<00:03:35.859> deeper<00:03:36.250> skin<00:03:36.459> tone

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
actually flatter a deeper skin tone

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.160 
actually flatter a deeper skin tone
because<00:03:36.880> you<00:03:36.970> can<00:03:37.150> layer<00:03:37.390> it<00:03:37.480> up<00:03:37.660> that<00:03:37.930> much

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
because you can layer it up that much

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.410 
because you can layer it up that much
more<00:03:38.519> granted<00:03:39.519> then<00:03:39.700> you'll<00:03:39.850> get<00:03:40.000> sort<00:03:40.359> of

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
more granted then you'll get sort of

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.630 
more granted then you'll get sort of
into<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.780> muddy<00:03:41.170> territory<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.280> it

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
into the muddy territory and it

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.910 
into the muddy territory and it
certainly<00:03:42.880> doesn't<00:03:43.120> suit<00:03:43.329> fair<00:03:43.570> skin<00:03:43.900> but<00:03:44.470> it

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
certainly doesn't suit fair skin but it

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.650 
certainly doesn't suit fair skin but it
I<00:03:45.190> think<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.489> lends<00:03:45.670> itself<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:46.150> little<00:03:46.480> bit

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
I think it lends itself a little bit

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.630 
I think it lends itself a little bit
more<00:03:47.019> to<00:03:47.260> a<00:03:47.290> wider<00:03:47.560> range<00:03:47.650> of<00:03:47.950> skin<00:03:48.250> tones<00:03:48.280> in

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
more to a wider range of skin tones in

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.190 
more to a wider range of skin tones in
that<00:03:48.790> way<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.150> same<00:03:49.390> goes<00:03:49.600> for<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:49.900> blush

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
that way the same goes for the blush

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.039 
that way the same goes for the blush
exact<00:03:51.100> same<00:03:51.430> blush<00:03:51.790> tone<00:03:52.120> but<00:03:52.390> because<00:03:52.720> it's<00:03:52.959> a

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
exact same blush tone but because it's a

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.809 
exact same blush tone but because it's a
little<00:03:53.380> bit<00:03:53.590> more<00:03:53.739> powdery<00:03:54.130> it<00:03:54.250> just<00:03:54.400> kicks<00:03:54.609> up

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
little bit more powdery it just kicks up

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.280 
little bit more powdery it just kicks up
a<00:03:54.880> little<00:03:55.030> bit<00:03:55.180> more<00:03:55.329> product<00:03:55.720> as<00:03:55.989> you<00:03:56.109> have

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
a little bit more product as you have

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.250 
a little bit more product as you have
your<00:03:56.500> brush<00:03:56.950> in<00:03:57.160> there<00:03:57.340> it<00:03:57.700> lays<00:03:58.660> down<00:03:58.690> quite<00:03:59.230> a

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
your brush in there it lays down quite a

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.229 
your brush in there it lays down quite a
bit<00:03:59.470> more<00:03:59.709> it<00:04:00.010> has<00:04:00.160> a<00:04:00.190> little<00:04:00.459> bit<00:04:00.549> more<00:04:00.609> pop<00:04:01.000> in

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
bit more it has a little bit more pop in

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.449 
bit more it has a little bit more pop in
the<00:04:01.359> way<00:04:01.510> of<00:04:01.780> pigmentation<00:04:02.440> last<00:04:03.040> is<00:04:03.310> the

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
the way of pigmentation last is the

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.220 
the way of pigmentation last is the
highlight

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
highlight

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.110 
highlight
this<00:04:04.409> is<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.830> other<00:04:05.040> big<00:04:05.400> difference<00:04:05.519> for<00:04:06.000> me

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
this is the other big difference for me

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.059 
this is the other big difference for me
because<00:04:06.450> unfortunately<00:04:06.629> the<00:04:07.349> crown<00:04:07.650> just

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
because unfortunately the crown just

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.649 
because unfortunately the crown just
isn't<00:04:08.580> quite<00:04:09.000> as<00:04:10.159> ethereal<00:04:11.159> I<00:04:11.489> would<00:04:11.640> say<00:04:11.879> it's

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
isn't quite as ethereal I would say it's

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.960 
isn't quite as ethereal I would say it's
less<00:04:12.930> faceted<00:04:13.650> it's<00:04:14.010> more<00:04:14.280> just<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:14.640> straight

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
less faceted it's more just a straight

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.120 
less faceted it's more just a straight
champagne<00:04:15.390> highlight<00:04:15.780> still<00:04:16.229> absolutely

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
champagne highlight still absolutely

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.770 
champagne highlight still absolutely
very<00:04:17.340> beautiful<00:04:17.760> you<00:04:17.850> can<00:04:18.030> see<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.359> reflects

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
very beautiful you can see it reflects

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.140 
very beautiful you can see it reflects
the<00:04:18.989> ton<00:04:19.260> it's<00:04:19.590> very<00:04:20.100> similar<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.820> say<00:04:21.120> a

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
the ton it's very similar to say a

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.320 
the ton it's very similar to say a
pressed<00:04:21.750> Beca<00:04:22.169> powder<00:04:22.560> highlighter<00:04:23.100> so<00:04:24.060> it's

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
pressed Beca powder highlighter so it's

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.650 
pressed Beca powder highlighter so it's
not<00:04:24.540> bad<00:04:25.080> by<00:04:25.380> any<00:04:25.590> means<00:04:25.860> but<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:26.850> do<00:04:26.910> find<00:04:27.479> that

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
not bad by any means but I do find that

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.510 
not bad by any means but I do find that
the<00:04:27.930> highlighter<00:04:28.320> in<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.530> it<00:04:28.710> cosmetics<00:04:28.949> disc

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
the highlighter in the it cosmetics disc

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.300 
the highlighter in the it cosmetics disc
is<00:04:29.729> just<00:04:29.910> a<00:04:30.090> little<00:04:30.360> bit<00:04:30.479> more<00:04:30.919> complex<00:04:31.919> I

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
is just a little bit more complex I

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.360 
is just a little bit more complex I
would<00:04:32.550> say<00:04:32.760> that<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.180> has<00:04:33.560> some<00:04:34.560> pink<00:04:34.919> in<00:04:35.160> there

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
would say that it has some pink in there

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.129 
would say that it has some pink in there
so<00:04:35.669> it<00:04:35.760> can<00:04:35.880> play<00:04:36.120> off<00:04:36.360> of<00:04:36.389> the<00:04:36.630> pink<00:04:36.900> in<00:04:37.050> the

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
so it can play off of the pink in the

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.390 
so it can play off of the pink in the
blush<00:04:37.350> is<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.620> little<00:04:37.860> bit<00:04:37.979> more<00:04:38.130> reflective

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
blush is a little bit more reflective

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.909 
blush is a little bit more reflective
but<00:04:39.270> this<00:04:39.449> is<00:04:39.660> great<00:04:39.930> for<00:04:39.990> somewhat<00:04:40.620> more

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
but this is great for somewhat more

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.080 
but this is great for somewhat more
subtle<00:04:41.789> and<00:04:42.060> champagne<00:04:42.960> hewed<00:04:43.410> highlight

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
subtle and champagne hewed highlight

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.600 
subtle and champagne hewed highlight
still<00:04:45.090> I<00:04:45.960> can't<00:04:46.680> say<00:04:46.979> I<00:04:47.010> would<00:04:47.220> recommend

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
still I can't say I would recommend

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.980 
still I can't say I would recommend
buying<00:04:47.760> this<00:04:47.970> entire<00:04:48.300> trio<00:04:48.720> for<00:04:48.930> the

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
buying this entire trio for the

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.080 
buying this entire trio for the
highlight<00:04:49.350> alone<00:04:49.710> but<00:04:50.340> as<00:04:50.669> far<00:04:51.060> as

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
highlight alone but as far as

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.050 
highlight alone but as far as
differences<00:04:51.780> go<00:04:51.960> that<00:04:52.590> is<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:52.889> major<00:04:53.340> one<00:04:53.699> so

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
differences go that is the major one so

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.090 
differences go that is the major one so
beyond<00:04:54.630> that<00:04:54.900> it's<00:04:55.169> up<00:04:55.350> to<00:04:55.500> you<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.830> make<00:04:55.979> the

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
beyond that it's up to you to make the
