couple<00:00:45.750> things<00:00:46.079> right<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.950> see<00:00:47.160> these<00:00:47.309> numbers

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
couple things right we see these numbers

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.920 
couple things right we see these numbers
right<00:00:47.820> here<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.450> means<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.870> these

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
right here this means that these

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
right here this means that these
animations<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.590> going<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> play

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
animations are going to play

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.889 
animations are going to play
sequentially<00:00:50.550> first<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.360> going<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.660> fade

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
sequentially first it's going to fade

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.420 
sequentially first it's going to fade
and<00:00:52.079> then<00:00:52.199> it's<00:00:52.320> going<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.559> fly<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.219> want

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
and then it's going to fly if I want

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.799 
and then it's going to fly if I want
these<00:00:53.550> two<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.850> fly<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.239> are<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.660> work

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
these two to fly and are to work

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.569 
these two to fly and are to work
together<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.739> need<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.949> make<00:00:56.100> sure<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.489> of

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
together just need to make sure one of

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.520 
together just need to make sure one of
these<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.879> set<00:00:57.090> too<00:00:57.300> with<00:00:57.899> previous<00:00:58.410> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
these is set too with previous and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.229 
these is set too with previous and
that's<00:00:58.649> sort<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.859> piggybacks<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.579> along<00:01:00.090> with

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that's sort of piggybacks it along with

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.000 
that's sort of piggybacks it along with
the<00:01:00.329> first<00:01:00.510> animation<00:01:01.109> there<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.649> fading

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the first animation there it is fading

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.830 
the first animation there it is fading
up<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.789> other<00:01:02.940> thing<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.180> look<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
up the other thing to look for is to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.109 
up the other thing to look for is to
make<00:01:04.170> sure<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.559> duration<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.670> set<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
make sure that the duration is set the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.170 
make sure that the duration is set the
same<00:01:06.360> right<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:08.189> are<00:01:08.400> maybe<00:01:08.640> copying

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
same right if you are maybe copying

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.320 
same right if you are maybe copying
animations<00:01:09.720> or<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.960> start<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.200> modify<00:01:10.530> one

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
animations or you start to modify one

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.750 
animations or you start to modify one
you'll<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:13.770> animation<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
you'll see that if one animation is a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.670 
you'll see that if one animation is a
little<00:01:15.030> longer<00:01:15.210> or<00:01:15.479> shorter<00:01:15.509> they're<00:01:16.439> not

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
little longer or shorter they're not

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.560 
little longer or shorter they're not
going<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.040> obviously<00:01:17.610> complete<00:01:18.180> at<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> same

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
going to obviously complete at the same

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.789 
going to obviously complete at the same
time<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.110> want<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.350> make<00:01:19.470> sure<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
time so you just want to make sure the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.210 
time so you just want to make sure the
animations<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.400> set<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> same<00:01:22.070> make<00:01:23.070> that

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
animations are set the same make that

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.830 
animations are set the same make that
medium<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> other<00:01:24.630> thing<00:01:24.810> that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
medium and then the other thing that

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.510 
medium and then the other thing that
works<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.650> previous<00:01:25.890> versions<00:01:26.430> of

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
works just like previous versions of

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.300 
works just like previous versions of
PowerPoint<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:27.150> if<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.979> your<00:01:29.130> object

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
PowerPoint is if you have your object

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.940 
PowerPoint is if you have your object
selected<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.119> then<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.299> click<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:31.740> here

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
selected and then you click the up here

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.289 
selected and then you click the up here
in<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.070> animation<00:01:32.490> again<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:33.150> gonna

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
in the animation again it's gonna

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.390 
in the animation again it's gonna
replace<00:01:33.810> what<00:01:34.320> was<00:01:34.470> currently<00:01:34.650> there<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.280> let

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
replace what was currently there so let

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.859 
replace what was currently there so let
me<00:01:35.509> redo<00:01:36.509> that

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
me redo that

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.350 
me redo that
right<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:37.740> if<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.890> have<00:01:38.009> one<00:01:38.159> selected<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.240> now

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
right so if I have one selected and now

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.940 
right so if I have one selected and now
that<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.630> see<00:01:39.780> because<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.229> with<00:01:40.409> previous

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that you see because it is with previous

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.550 
that you see because it is with previous
right<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.610> tying<00:01:42.180> those<00:01:42.360> together<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.470> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
right it's tying those together and if I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.950 
right it's tying those together and if I
come<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.340> maybe<00:01:44.549> do<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> grow<00:01:45.149> it's

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
come in here and maybe do a grow it's

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.359 
come in here and maybe do a grow it's
gonna<00:01:46.079> replace<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:46.799> grow<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.310> you

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
gonna replace that with grow so you

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.429 
gonna replace that with grow so you
gonna<00:01:47.460> lose<00:01:47.670> your<00:01:47.759> animation<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.020> wanted

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
gonna lose your animation so if I wanted

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.219 
gonna lose your animation so if I wanted
to<00:01:49.560> grow<00:01:49.799> right<00:01:50.220> again<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:50.939> add<00:01:51.229> animation

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
to grow right again just add animation

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.319 
to grow right again just add animation
and<00:01:52.350> then<00:01:52.439> find<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.710> grow<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:54.060> then<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.240> adds

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
and then find the grow and then it adds

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.730 
and then find the grow and then it adds
it<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.659> there<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.320> see<00:01:55.560> by<00:01:55.680> default

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
it in there but you can see by default

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.609 
it in there but you can see by default
it<00:01:56.159> adds<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.549> on<00:01:56.640> click<00:01:57.350> just<00:01:58.350> do<00:01:58.500> it

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
it adds it to it on click just do it

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.590 
it adds it to it on click just do it
with<00:01:58.740> previous<00:01:59.189> now<00:02:00.060> you've<00:02:00.210> got<00:02:00.390> them<00:02:00.450> all

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
with previous now you've got them all

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.009 
with previous now you've got them all
