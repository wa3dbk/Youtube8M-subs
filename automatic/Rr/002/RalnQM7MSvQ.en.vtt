00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.799
 introduce you to present us your 

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:08.380
 association yes our association is 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:13.240
 the achbarrou association that was created 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:15.790
 by young people from the Akbou region who 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.360
 is a village at the end of the south 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.270
 Moroccan so a region that needs to 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.690
 a whole region a little left for 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.270
 account where and it needed someone 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:33.489
 cares and excess kids who are 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:36.850
 able to do it and we do it with 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:41.350
 the means of edge and as in plain 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:46.440
 with the priorities is missing the transport 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.440
 and my heart brake problems 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.519
 indicated ca 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:55.390
 and again the problem of the sapwood 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:57.309
 affected by the fake ones we were trying to 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.829
 carry the kids because he 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.229
 could not go to school which is 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.220
 hans km they have to come to cm2 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.960
 they stop then we on with the 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.090
 associations that help us 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.159
 contractors the sponsors and 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.409
 partners and we try to create 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.890
 to try to meet his needs 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:24.159
 so a second case is necessary 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.950
 because myself you just happen 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.140
 visit the village of horses and the 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.690
 needs are huge and the quarter 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.240
 who had could not go north 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.170
 and east to south both agree 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.729
 so what are these 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.899
 concretely the needs of your 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.970
 association is what you are looking for 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.939
 volunteers are what you are looking for 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.570
 more financial partnerships more than 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:50.140
 financial partnerships yes we have 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.340

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.460
 organisms we have small 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.899
 subsidies though but we need more 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.539
 for this club I want us to go 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.789
 much further and you console me 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.479
 in our little village because everything 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:11.349
 around 20 km 30 km from the village that 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.780
 are in the same situation so Sebastian 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.330
 what does it take you need if we 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.510
 gets to expand and once we have 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.370
 finished the needs of this of this village 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.489
 expanded expand and you'll know 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.019

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.590
 for your association and deadlines 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.160
 elements having besides if you 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.220
 allow 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.560
 we will talk about what was done a 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.079
 ambulance one in any case for us the 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.660
 kids college who was the first 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.400
 project it was 3000 binder that was 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.019
 allowed to school girls who to 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.780
 the times do not go there but these species 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:54.470
 of the received idea firstly secondly it 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.760
 there was a security problem too and 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.549
 the distance 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.590
 so that in most they 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.260
 sent Parisian girls to school 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.060
 we encouraged them or their 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.079
 provide all the material the binder 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.239
 full with all the necessary for 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:14.209
 finally convoy the girls from 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.269
 village and surrounding villages 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.640
 it is to make a good shot at the first 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.859
 it's true it has worked a lot and 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.220

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:27.769

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.260
 twenty days and in which 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.730
 conditions I do not tell you he despite 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.239

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.680
 despite that they came back the nama him 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.780
 we would need a lot of resources 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.150
 to continue to solve this problem 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.620
 of water is this second bus problem 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.530

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.010
 can not be there at 8:30 am 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.889
 flange not there the problem and that would be it 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.980
 more than four times in joy but 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:16.310
 that's what we needed and we 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.900

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.239
 sewing 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.590
 we also had to do workshop 2 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:27.480
