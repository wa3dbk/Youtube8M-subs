00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.520
 9 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.400
 yes 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.710
 details I got the pinion of the 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.390
 41 tooth plate for the bmv he 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.430
 passed to the reduction on the straight of the 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.800
 another day the race 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.930
 we have tried to expand the development and 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.050
 the front discs of the r6 by the 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.020
 supersport race is finally giving 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.770
 the return to the little bikes will leave us 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.780
 see if tomorrow tastes a little better and 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.450
 with the learning that I have accumulated 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.960
 of the sessions parts plus the races 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.060
 of the race since exposed all 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.790
 it will take me to go for a little more 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.240
 confidence and a little faster to 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.100
 improve the constructions because well 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.399
 until now I was basically engaged in 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.399
 to learn 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.620
 I would like it as soon as I have the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.510
 minimum security 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.120
 highlighting adding later 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.070
 accelerating sooner so that 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.840
 can improve my lap times 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.220
 normal that I practically run out 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.770
 then we will be doing since tomorrow 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.440
 they are all races but well 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.060
 in that process lathe with tomorrow runs the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.310
 Supersport race at 11 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.660
 morning 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.660
 can be seen online bbc.co.uk 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.710
 and good from after 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.540
 supersport race and I'll decide 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.030
 the rest of the morning races in 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.410
 which of them I will participate because 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.140
 in principle with the bikes that I have 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.170
 could participate in all but 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.580
 practically only the official pilots 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.580
 can afford a little 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.480
 the places of honor and have 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.799
 possibilities and means to do it myself 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.510
 I'll decide to run the race 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.700
 supersport after almost sure to 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.640
 superstock and let's see deer from 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.799
 superbike which the son as well as do the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.030
 second of supersport so you go to a 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.030
 entertaining morning 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.540
 yes 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.959
 do not 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.959
 i 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.600
 example 97 that the one here also have 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.970
 Grace 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.590
 and other details of road racing 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.590
 different to the races that we know 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.870
 I wanted this gasoline for a tube 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.209
 every time he goes out on the track it 's a tank 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.290
 full and very few turns that are made 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:19.870
 fast with gas so thoroughly 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.870
 what they spend many, many kilometers 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.199
 an aspect that has the career of 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.970
 short and important circuit because it is a 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.970
 money that is spent 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:40.469
 60 pounds plus the two tanks that I have 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:43.889
 there in the on the stick tomorrow for others 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:46.020
 we're going to spend about 150 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.740
 160 pounds are 200 euros only in 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.740
 normal gasoline 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.460
 Y 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:59.740
 in mine 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.330
 peace 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.110
 do not 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.110
 or not
