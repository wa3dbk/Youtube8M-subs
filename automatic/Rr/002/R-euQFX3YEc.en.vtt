00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:09.759
 I do not believe it again 99 casualties are not 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.339
 I've already had three games of 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.409
 99 casualties and those that will continue to come 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:16.330
 because I do not know what happened that 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:19.300
 this week help with gameplays noida 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.679
 for clips I went to for weapons in gold but 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.960
 is that he has not taken me a game of 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:27.939
 more than 99 I know what happened this week 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:30.099
 I got out of 99 out of 94 out of 90 out of 95 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.410
 been I do not know I do not know what has happened it has not 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.960
 removed more than 100 casualties but it happens 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.360
 nothing for a game of 90 casualties or more 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.970
 they are already broken so it is not 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.040
 no problem but I wanted to emphasize or 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.680
 is what has taken me three games of 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.290
 99 casualties I do not know why I've stayed 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.200
 so many times to one and carrying dogs 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.450
 Swarm and only dogs do not streak me 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.580
 low to nothing I do not know what happened this 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.430
 week that one has been able to get those 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.020
 three digits on the scoreboard but as 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.600
 I say absolutely nothing happens because 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.580
 I already have games thus saved more 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.960
 of 100 casualties on the computer to go 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.670
 taking a little bit out as you 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.830
 I said the last time 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.900
 and today I wanted to use a very gameplay 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.970
 short but did not have any at all 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.710
 the times they had were long 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.380
 because I wanted to use it to get 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.680
 the long teeth for tomorrow for the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.030
 Part 5 of this is not a montage that goes 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.950
 to be brutal I'm sure it's going to 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.259
 be brutal but I did not have any video 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.240
 short so good I've picked another 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.460
 starting more than 99 casualties and this week 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.189
 they take two and next week that's why 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.100
 I will bring you another more than 99 casualties could 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.420
 have put a gameplay from behind with 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.069
 I know that many of you 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.649
 you want to see one that implied the lack and 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.319
 I have one of more than 90 casualties almost 100 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.390
 low again again wink wink to 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.100
 so you can enjoy it all 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.340
 you but better I'll leave it for 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.619
 on Monday as a secondary video video 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.959
 answer for him this is not a montage 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.759
 for good to see how about opined opinion 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:00.429
 and good to leave that gameplay behind 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.440
 but as I was saying it does not have any 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.149
 is short so today also plays a 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.729
 I cut it more or less long 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.560
 a tad I think yes I think I've 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.119
 cut a tad so you do not happen 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.550
 it's a lot for the parties that I 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.010
 they kill then that 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.530
 so much and the lots be of course 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.140
 again I've put them on camera 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.000
 quick so that also that part is not 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.440
 so imposed on dense not because I do not 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.540
 you see me running and everything else 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.370
 because I want to know also your 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.470
 opinions about this since I do not have 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.260
 none still meets the python nor 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.210
 with the flight I do not know I do not know what other 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.160
 there are more planes that are handled alone 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.870
 but I would like to try that 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.030
 combination of for example what to be 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.950
 vítol and dogs or just to be vítol and 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.960
 swarm for example to go varying a 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.280
 little bit more the gusts I already know that I've 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.780
 brought very few times because I think 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.310
 came to the left but yes I 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.350
 like to go vary as you have seen 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.770
 we have brought you games with dogs 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.240
 swarm helicopters where to be of 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.580
 everything I think has everything except the 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.580
 python and some against more machines 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.800
 war or machines those weird I do not know 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.930
 still none but I do not know the truth 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.880
 I know if you want to see in gameplays with those 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.960
 gusts let me know in the section of 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.240
 comments 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.830
 It entertains a lot also to see me 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.870
 on top of being on top of a 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.800
 beatle killing killing and slaughtering 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.770
 to the people 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.510
 so well I'll take advantage again 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.970
 to tell you that we already put our teeth 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.130
 long for assembly tomorrow because if 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.520
 nothing happens you will have it at 4 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.470
 Saturday 19th at 4 in the afternoon and what 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.270
 I'm going to leave two whole days for 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.160
 then do not ask about frames because 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.870
 you upload video on Sunday, well, I'm not going 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.130
 to climb well on Sunday the assembly is going to 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.410
 be both Saturday and Sunday 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.110
 so that for him to catch visits 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.970
 so that it can look pretty not because 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.710
 I'm going to try to see it consume us 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.510
 for example that you see stacks some 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.640
 some big hesitation if you want 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.980
 go over and good to help a little 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.110
 channel with your like or your comment or 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.090
 simply that they see it or ymbro do 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.400
 know by private message because that's that 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.530
 tide illusion because I think it's going to 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.480
 be much better than the previous part of 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.550
 the song I have chosen a song that 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.740
 I think it 's super play for the 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.570
 assembly then there has been a lot of variety 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.490
 of weapons as I already told you in 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.740
 the previous occasion variety of weapons 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.299
 the clips I think I think from the point 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.130
 of view that are better than the previous 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.100
 that at least I have liked more 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.630
 there are variety of movements there are more 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.180
 variety than in other assemblies 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.800
 so I hope with a lot of desire that 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.110
 tell me I had it today that we have been 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.880
 today for me to pass it and then go to 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.670
 upload it and see your opinion do not see 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.710
 your comments the likes because the 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.600
 video more side of the channel that more me 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.760
 you like right now is that of the 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.390
 pistolite of 108 casualties that I think is 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.160
 already for the 1,800 likes then tell 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.870
 guys that mariah very many 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.700
 illusion as long as you like the 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.900
 assembly that I hope so because as I have 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.810
 said before it's going to be brutal 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.970
 I hope that then that figure will be exceeded 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.130
 that I know maybe to call me crazy 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.680
 but I would do so many, many 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.740
 illusion see tomorrow 2000 likes by 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.720
 example yes it is something so it is not 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.310
 hard to get but being 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.440
 subscribers as you are subscribers 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.540
 they are active and so good by the channel 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.580
 during all these good the latter 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.440
 month and the previous one that has also been 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.840
 brutal the increase of the ex the increase of 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.730
 comments I'm very happy with 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.220
 you and I have said it many times 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.890
 so I do not know if tomorrow if you can 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.530
 reach the 2000 likes I hope I hope 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.910
 yes because the video I'm sure that 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.150
 that is going to deserve or at least from my 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.400
 point 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.260
 of course and ruben can leave yours 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.880
 although I can not tackle two light 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.250
 to a video because we can only 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.169
 give one but I hope that tomorrow you 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.389
 like the video of truth that you spend 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.430
 also for the beagle channel because it's 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.900
 our editor he tries very hard 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.850
 in doing things helps us a 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.699
 heap and subscribe happen also to see 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:53.639
 their mounts and their gameplays and their 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.080
 trophies because to me also because it is another 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.669
 I wanted the truth because I wanted 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.400
 tell him apart from being the reader of the 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.830
 channel is a very good friend of mine so 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.449
 good also as a look first of all 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.030
 it was a little bit more to tell you that 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:08.550
 lately messages are coming from 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.160
 that are imitating the channel accounts 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.900
 of the channel so there's a lot of clone out there 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.280
 loose in both the xbox and the 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.539
 playstation3 and do not believe what you see 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.060
 because in the accounts that we 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:24.630
 we have are are unique or are our 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.910
 we do not have for example in rockies m like 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.760
 I have been told or look for gameplays the xbox 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.460
 we do not have xbox so look for gameplays 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.770
 the xbox is a clone not if I'm not ruben 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.750
 no it's nobody from the channel it's just 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.400
 a person who has invited us and there is 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.380
 many people in the play3 that like 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.930
 they are commenting that they are inviting us 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.940
 that then they do bad games and they 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.160
 ask if you are ruben frames or if 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.620
 you want red just like we are not 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.090
 we are pure indications to fix 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.550
 the accounts that we have from there 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:56.370
 we're not going to happen we do not have rockies 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:59.190
 with two R's that is a clone or as I have 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.560
 said rockies m &amp; g those accounts are 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.660
 subscribers or people or people who are fan 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.940
 of the channel because the thing so nothing 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.729
 but there enjoyed the gameplay and 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.620
 I'll talk about another comment if you follow the 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:12.479
 things and keeps giving ball 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.310
 you the subscribers over all the 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:16.139
 theme of imitating channel accounts and 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.520
 what seems to me and good from 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:20.190
 principle is that nothing bothers me 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.270
 because it gives me exactly the same but what 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.009
 said I hope you enjoyed the 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.500
 gameplay we're going to see tomorrow with the 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:28.139
 assembly if nothing happens if something happens what
