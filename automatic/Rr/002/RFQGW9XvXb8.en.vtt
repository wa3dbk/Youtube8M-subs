00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
alright I'll go I'll go over generate my

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.410 
alright I'll go I'll go over generate my
shields<00:01:01.610> look<00:01:01.730> how<00:01:01.820> fast<00:01:02.030> his<00:01:02.180> shield

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
shields look how fast his shield

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.229 
shields look how fast his shield
regenerate<00:01:03.250> takes<00:01:04.250> about<00:01:04.430> 10<00:01:04.730> seconds<00:01:05.120> I

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
regenerate takes about 10 seconds I

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.730 
regenerate takes about 10 seconds I
believe<00:01:05.540> 15<00:01:06.290> perhaps<00:01:06.830> who<00:01:07.520> knows<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:08.740> then

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
believe 15 perhaps who knows and then

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.580 
believe 15 perhaps who knows and then
just<00:01:10.430> BAM<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:11.420> basically<00:01:11.750> you<00:01:11.870> just<00:01:11.900> go<00:01:12.200> in<00:01:12.410> you

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
just BAM so basically you just go in you

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.110 
just BAM so basically you just go in you
attack<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:13.160> come<00:01:13.370> back<00:01:13.400> out<00:01:13.730> keep<00:01:14.000> in

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
attack and you come back out keep in

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.280 
attack and you come back out keep in
mind<00:01:14.390> he<00:01:15.350> does<00:01:15.560> get<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:16.480> shield<00:01:17.480> armor<00:01:17.870> /

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
mind he does get to shield armor /

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.180 
mind he does get to shield armor /
upgrade<00:01:18.770> for<00:01:19.670> armor<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:20.530> then<00:01:21.530> also<00:01:21.710> every

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
upgrade for armor and then also every

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.700 
upgrade for armor and then also every
hero<00:01:22.970> attack<00:01:23.390> upgrade<00:01:23.810> will<00:01:23.960> give<00:01:24.110> him<00:01:24.260> 20

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
hero attack upgrade will give him 20

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.860 
hero attack upgrade will give him 20
damage<00:01:25.370> and<00:01:25.760> the<00:01:26.240> way<00:01:26.360> that<00:01:26.510> this<00:01:26.690> attack

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
damage and the way that this attack

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.830 
damage and the way that this attack
works<00:01:27.320> is<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.070> main<00:01:28.250> attack<00:01:28.520> itself<00:01:28.909> is<00:01:29.420> doing

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
works is the main attack itself is doing

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.360 
works is the main attack itself is doing
the<00:01:29.960> 200<00:01:30.440> damage<00:01:30.500> and<00:01:30.830> it<00:01:30.890> doesn't<00:01:31.159> cite

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
the 200 damage and it doesn't cite

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.149 
the 200 damage and it doesn't cite
splash<00:01:31.670> and<00:01:31.970> then<00:01:32.210> also<00:01:32.510> hits<00:01:33.170> 10<00:01:33.890> other

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
splash and then also hits 10 other

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.950 
splash and then also hits 10 other
targets<00:01:34.610> around<00:01:34.790> it<00:01:35.030> for<00:01:35.240> like<00:01:35.390> twenty<00:01:35.780> five

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
targets around it for like twenty five

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.050 
targets around it for like twenty five
percent<00:01:35.990> weapon<00:01:36.979> damage<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.610> just<00:01:37.790> you

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
percent weapon damage so it just you

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.570 
percent weapon damage so it just you
just<00:01:38.270> destroys<00:01:38.750> things<00:01:39.050> look<00:01:39.920> at<00:01:40.040> this<00:01:40.159> this

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
just destroys things look at this this

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.980 
just destroys things look at this this
is<00:01:40.729> particularly<00:01:41.210> really<00:01:41.600> good<00:01:41.750> against

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
is particularly really good against

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.350 
is particularly really good against
smaller<00:01:42.320> units<00:01:42.680> like<00:01:43.130> Marines<00:01:43.549> or<00:01:43.820> snipers

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
smaller units like Marines or snipers

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.240 
smaller units like Marines or snipers
because<00:01:44.690> of<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.930> splash<00:01:45.229> that<00:01:45.799> each<00:01:45.950> attack

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
because of the splash that each attack

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.020 
because of the splash that each attack
also<00:01:46.670> does<00:01:46.880> but<00:01:47.870> I<00:01:48.080> mean<00:01:48.490> dark<00:01:49.490> Archon<00:01:49.700> is

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
also does but I mean dark Archon is

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.830 
also does but I mean dark Archon is
definitely<00:01:50.479> something<00:01:50.720> to<00:01:51.020> be<00:01:51.049> feared<00:01:52.840> well

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
definitely something to be feared well

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.120 
definitely something to be feared well
let<00:01:54.500> me<00:01:54.560> know<00:01:54.650> what<00:01:54.710> you<00:01:54.799> guys<00:01:54.890> think
