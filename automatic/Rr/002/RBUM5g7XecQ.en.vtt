that<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.859> produce<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.790> was<00:00:33.210> made<00:00:33.750> with<00:00:33.989> oil

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
that I produce it was made with oil

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.310 
that I produce it was made with oil
along<00:00:35.460> with<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.180> research<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.750> development

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
along with the research and development

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.110 
along with the research and development
that<00:00:37.440> went<00:00:37.649> along<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:38.129> make<00:00:38.430> those<00:00:38.610> computers

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
that went along to make those computers

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.090 
that went along to make those computers
they<00:00:39.450> had<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.809> drive<00:00:40.050> their<00:00:40.290> cars<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.980> where

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
they had to drive their cars to where

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.530 
they had to drive their cars to where
they<00:00:41.250> were<00:00:41.309> going<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.910> they<00:00:42.120> could<00:00:42.270> come<00:00:42.420> up

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540

they were going so they could come up
with<00:00:42.660> these<00:00:42.809> ideas<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.410> computers<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.950> then

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
with these ideas for computers and then

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.799 
with these ideas for computers and then
put<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.340> place<00:00:44.550> all<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.940> other<00:00:45.149> people<00:00:45.600> who

put in place all the other people who
drove<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.350> work<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:47.039> make<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.579> computer<00:00:48.030> that

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
drove to work to make the computer that

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.580 
drove to work to make the computer that
is<00:00:48.329> now<00:00:48.480> sitting<00:00:48.809> right<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.230> front<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.500> your

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
conveniences and one thing that was

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.260 
conveniences and one thing that was
talked<00:01:22.799> about<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> while<00:01:23.310> was<00:01:23.850> carbon

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
talked about for a while was carbon

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.230 
talked about for a while was carbon
credits<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.140> that's<00:01:25.650> just<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.009> tax<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.580> anyone

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
credits and that's just a tax on anyone

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.510 
credits and that's just a tax on anyone
who<00:01:27.509> uses<00:01:27.720> oil<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.560> don't<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:28.860> taxes<00:01:29.340> that

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
who uses oil and I don't like taxes that

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.730 
who uses oil and I don't like taxes that
much<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.630> believe<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.259> carbon

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
much and I believe that this carbon

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.370 
much and I believe that this carbon
credit<00:01:32.159> system<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.850> basically<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
credit system is basically just a

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.380 
credit system is basically just a
politician<00:01:35.100> out<00:01:35.220> there<00:01:35.280> who's<00:01:35.939> trying<00:01:36.299> to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
politician out there who's trying to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.660 
politician out there who's trying to
make<00:01:36.990> some<00:01:37.200> extra<00:01:37.320> money<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.400> just
