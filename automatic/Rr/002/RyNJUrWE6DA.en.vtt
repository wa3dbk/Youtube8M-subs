you<00:00:13.799> still<00:00:14.099> have<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.610> full<00:00:15.179> gear<00:00:15.450> range<00:00:15.690> of

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
you still have the full gear range of

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.560 
you still have the full gear range of
animal<00:00:16.170> fact<00:00:16.699> you<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:17.850> not<00:00:18.029> only<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.300> gears

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
animal fact you have not only the gears

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.380 
animal fact you have not only the gears
in<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> rear<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.199> also<00:00:19.500> have<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:20.010> triple<00:00:20.970> front

this<00:00:25.140> technology<00:00:25.859> drive<00:00:26.070> systems<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.760> we're

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
this technology drive systems that we're

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:39.790 
this technology drive systems that we're
gonna<00:00:26.970> hop<00:00:27.900> on<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.260> take<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.070> for<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> spin

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.250 

okay<00:00:40.670> here<00:00:41.210> we<00:00:41.300> go<00:00:41.770> again<00:00:42.770> you<00:00:43.129> can<00:00:43.280> see<00:00:43.309> the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
okay here we go again you can see the

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.430 
okay here we go again you can see the
triple<00:00:45.260> rings<00:00:45.500> up<00:00:45.710> there<00:00:45.920> above<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:46.220> stuff

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
triple rings up there above the stuff

00:00:47.440 --> 00:01:02.619 
triple rings up there above the stuff
those<00:00:49.840> see<00:00:50.840> how<00:00:51.050> that<00:00:51.230> works<00:00:51.379> a<00:01:01.239> bit<00:01:02.239> of<00:01:02.329> speed

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
those see how that works a bit of speed

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.109 
those see how that works a bit of speed
in<00:01:02.690> air<00:01:03.079> we<00:01:03.220> going<00:01:04.220> on<00:01:04.780> okay<00:01:05.780> that's<00:01:07.119> activated

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
in air we going on okay that's activated

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.219 
in air we going on okay that's activated
by<00:01:08.240> a<00:01:09.159> swaddle<00:01:10.159> can<00:01:10.430> you<00:01:10.490> see<00:01:10.640> it<00:01:10.729> there<00:01:10.759> on<00:01:11.090> the

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
by a swaddle can you see it there on the

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.499 
by a swaddle can you see it there on the
left-hand<00:01:12.229> side<00:01:12.440> we<00:01:12.619> just<00:01:13.070> give<00:01:14.000> that<00:01:14.030> a<00:01:14.180> fist

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
left-hand side we just give that a fist

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:24.490 
left-hand side we just give that a fist
there<00:01:14.750> we<00:01:14.899> go<00:01:22.570> we're<00:01:23.570> going<00:01:23.690> to<00:01:23.750> rather<00:01:23.960> low

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
there we go we're going to rather low

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.240 
there we go we're going to rather low
gear<00:01:25.090> up<00:01:26.090> shifts<00:01:26.590> shifters<00:01:27.590> announce<00:01:27.860> inside

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
gear up shifts shifters announce inside

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.550 
gear up shifts shifters announce inside
I<00:01:28.280> can't<00:01:28.670> hold<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.570> camera<00:01:29.810> ship<00:01:30.170> to<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:30.350> same

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
I can't hold the camera ship to the same

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.910 
I can't hold the camera ship to the same
time<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.070> there<00:01:31.250> we<00:01:31.340> go<00:01:31.990> higher<00:01:32.990> gear<00:01:33.320> on<00:01:33.860> the

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
time so there we go higher gear on the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:02:10.170 
time so there we go higher gear on the
problem<00:01:34.399> again

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.980 

that<00:02:11.180> is<00:02:11.630> our<00:02:12.140> new<00:02:13.390> multi-speed<00:02:14.390> electric

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
that is our new multi-speed electric

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.310 
that is our new multi-speed electric
