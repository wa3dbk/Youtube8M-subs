completely<00:03:53.739> around<00:03:54.609> that<00:03:54.940> and<00:03:55.329> i<00:03:55.540> do<00:03:55.599> want<00:03:55.870> to

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
completely around that and i do want to

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.599 
completely around that and i do want to
include<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.500> in<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.680> book<00:03:56.859> so<00:03:57.130> we<00:03:57.160> decided
