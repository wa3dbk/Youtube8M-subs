 and merck say your problem and we the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:16.439
 Sealer solution 50 flexible sealer 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.860
 Two- component polyurethane sealant 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:22.710
 50 is a self-leveling elastic sealer 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.989
 polyurethane used mainly for 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.989
 the perfect sealing of the joints 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:30.509
 dilation and construction avoiding the 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:33.690
 water passage through them use 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.880
 50 sealer to seal floor joints 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.890
 as a waterproof and flexible layer in 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.829
 irregular or deteriorated substrates 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.570
 how to use prepare the surface of 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.840
 the board where the 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.120
 50 sealer removing the dust that is 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.399
 find inside of it stick tape 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.070
 adhesive on the edges of the joints 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.140
 to prevent it from spilling and getting dirty 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.690
 the area to be sealed to improve the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.160
 adhesion and isolate the moisture that 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.530
 possibly found in the 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.070
 Surface of the board is recommended 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.360
 apply the first epoxy to 10ยบ h at 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.360
 throughout the board 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.960
 homogenize with smooth movements the 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.899
 components to ive separately before 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.240
 mix pour all the component b in 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.460
 the component to and mix up the 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.399
 homogeneity for approximately 2 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.439
 minutes without beating with force empty 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.240
 immediately since the time of 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.240
 Work skill is approximately 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.060
 10 minutes sealant performance 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.850
 50 in a one centimeter joint 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.540
 width by one centimeter deep 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.270
 is 35 linear meters 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.610
 High resistance qualities to the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.460
 abrasion forms a flexible compound 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.980
 excellent adhesion to good concrete 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.410
 chemical resistance unchanged by 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.020
 effects of protective aging 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.340
 against corrosion works in a wide 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.560
 Temperature range - 15 to 80 degrees 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.350
 Celsius considerations do not mix 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.350
 the product with solvents does not apply if 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.260
 the surface is wet if it were the 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.750
 case or zinc h to isolate the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.730
 50 sealer moisture for 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.010
 applications in very hot environments 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.440
 it is recommended to refresh the container 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.350
 closed product in ice water 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.030
 prior to its application, do not allow the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.959
 product inside the gun 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.940
 injection use sun pur for cleaning not 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.310
 batch components must be mixed 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.160
 different since it is not guaranteed 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.630
 adequate reactivity and consequently 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.630
 the curing of the material 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.739
 and merck say your problem and we the 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.739
 solution
