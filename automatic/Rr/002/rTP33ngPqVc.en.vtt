00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
it's no problem at all really since he

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.850 
it's no problem at all really since he
had<00:00:18.540> a<00:00:18.570> breeding<00:00:18.810> up<00:00:19.079> in<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.320> summaries<00:00:19.710> at

different<00:00:20.220> horse<00:00:20.869> confidence<00:00:21.890> ability

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
different horse confidence ability

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.839 
different horse confidence ability
everything<00:00:24.770> he<00:00:25.770> were<00:00:25.919> brewing<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.520> other<00:00:26.640> day

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
everything he were brewing the other day

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.740 
everything he were brewing the other day
he<00:00:27.720> looks<00:00:27.930> fantastic<00:00:28.380> he's<00:00:28.800> jumping<00:00:29.250> great<00:00:29.750> he

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
he looks fantastic he's jumping great he

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.299 
he looks fantastic he's jumping great he
keeps<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.110> drifting<00:00:31.590> which<00:00:31.710> makes<00:00:31.980> me<00:00:32.130> laugh

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
keeps on drifting which makes me laugh

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.220 
keeps on drifting which makes me laugh
and<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.550> think<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.329> know<00:00:33.360> he's<00:00:33.719> not<00:00:33.750> favored

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
and I think you know he's not favored

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.930 
and I think you know he's not favored
now<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> pressures<00:00:34.980> off<00:00:35.070> him<00:00:35.310> but<00:00:35.460> he<00:00:35.730> said

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
now so the pressures off him but he said

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.430 
now so the pressures off him but he said
different<00:00:36.570> also<00:00:36.810> what<00:00:36.930> he<00:00:36.990> was<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.260> time

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
different also what he was this time

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.830 
different also what he was this time
last<00:00:37.470> year<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.980> only<00:00:38.430> concern<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.150> the<00:00:39.600> ground

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
last year the only concern is the ground

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.390 
last year the only concern is the ground
a<00:00:39.960> little<00:00:40.080> bit<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.800> then<00:00:40.950> when<00:00:41.130> he<00:00:41.160> want<00:00:41.340> to

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
a little bit but then when he want to

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.760 
a little bit but then when he want to
ask<00:00:41.520> her<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.880> end<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.900> October<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> ground<00:00:43.620> was

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
ask her in end of October the ground was

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.350 
ask her in end of October the ground was
good<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.070> day<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.520> was<00:00:44.580> as<00:00:44.760> impressive

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
good that day and it was as impressive

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.670 
good that day and it was as impressive
that<00:00:45.660> day<00:00:45.870> as<00:00:45.930> I've<00:00:46.050> seen<00:00:46.290> him<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.650> long

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
that day as I've seen him for a long

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.190 
that day as I've seen him for a long
time<00:00:47.060> when<00:00:48.060> he<00:00:48.120> ran<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> task<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.720> January<00:00:49.140> it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
time when he ran a task in January it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.750 
time when he ran a task in January it
was<00:00:49.320> bottomless<00:00:49.740> which<00:00:49.920> probably<00:00:50.460> didn't

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
was bottomless which probably didn't

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.040 
was bottomless which probably didn't
suit<00:00:50.880> him<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.210> once<00:00:51.540> they've<00:00:51.660> had<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.810> breeding

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
suit him and once they've had a breeding

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.450 
suit him and once they've had a breeding

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
think he is very solid and I think the

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.040 
think he is very solid and I think the
ground<00:02:32.670> isn't<00:02:32.880> an<00:02:33.030> issue<00:02:33.150> farm<00:02:33.510> he<00:02:33.930> was

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
ground isn't an issue farm he was

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.450 
ground isn't an issue farm he was
beating<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.440> last<00:02:34.650> day<00:02:34.830> because<00:02:35.130> he<00:02:35.250> talked

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
to front far too soon and I don't think

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.740 
to front far too soon and I don't think
this<00:02:37.680> horse<00:02:37.920> does<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.130> tap<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.400> front<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.090> even

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
this horse does a tap in front and even

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.010 
this horse does a tap in front and even
