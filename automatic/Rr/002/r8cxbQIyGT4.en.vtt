00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.470 
because uh they'll still take this
low-grade<00:07:02.170> board<00:07:02.620> as<00:07:03.160> his<00:07:03.460> there's<00:07:04.150> a<00:07:04.210> little

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:04.480 
low-grade board as his there's a little

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.480 
low-grade board as his there's a little
transformer<00:07:04.900> there<00:07:05.200> definitely<00:07:05.890> keep<00:07:06.250> that

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
transformer there definitely keep that
