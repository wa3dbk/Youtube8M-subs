00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
one that's going to be awesome if we can

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.770 
one that's going to be awesome if we can
get<00:02:47.520> that<00:02:47.670> high<00:02:47.880> i'm<00:02:48.030> not<00:02:48.180> sure<00:02:48.360> if<00:02:48.450> we're<00:02:48.630> able

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780
