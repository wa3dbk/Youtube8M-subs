00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.870
 Hi, Professor Raúl Vega greets you 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.570
 muñoz of point calculation courses 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.340
 wordpress.com in this video I'm going to 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.910
 explain how to solve the next 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.250
 limit limit when x tends to 2 of x 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.930
 minus two divided between the root 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.060
 square of 2 x minus the number 2 to 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.980
 do the direct substitution in this 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.650
 algebraic expression we would get what 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.710
 next as the x is worth 2 would be 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:35.210
 equal to 2 - 2 over the square root of 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.960
 how here we multiply 2 by x 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.899
 would be 2 for 2 what gives us 4 within 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.359
 the root minus the 2 that is outside and 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.839
 would this be like the square root of 4 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:49.360
 is 2 then we would have like in 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.970
 the top part 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.790
 as two minus two gives us zero in the 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:01:00.010
 numerator and two minus 20 in the 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:02.900
 denominator we get an expression 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.520
 indeterminate 0 over zero 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.430
 we can not have this result in a 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.620
 limit is not a correct result for 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.080
 so we have to alter the 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:16.240
 algebraic expression in a way that 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.399
 let us factor or simplify 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.100
 to be able to do this let's remember 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.530
 a basic subject of algebra is one of the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.790
 remarkable products that is called 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:33.060
 conjugated binomials 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:37.200
 more bx unless the same can be seen 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.020
 if we first put the subtraction x less by 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.590
 X more 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.659
 both are conjugated binomials is when 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.229
 we multiply the sum of two quantities 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.750
 by subtracting the same amounts or 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.510
 vice versa 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.210
 the result of a conjugate binomial or 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.460
 conjugated binomials is obtained from the 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.520
 following way taking into account 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.260
 only the parenthesis of the subtraction is 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.820
 squares the first term that 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.250
 would be in this case to square 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.789
 - the square of the second term that 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.000
 would be b square remember that only 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.780
 we ignore the subtraction not the sum 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.780
 we ignore the sum now in the example of 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.910
 below we would have as a result the 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.660
 square of the first term of the subtraction 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.790
 that would be x but squared minus the 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.300
 square of the second term of the subtraction 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.700
 what would be the square 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.440
 as you can see it is only taken in 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.960
 count the parenthesis of the subtraction 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.050
 If you understand this topic well, we are going to 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.720
 keep going but if you want to see a 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.990
 more complete review of the binomial theme 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.080
 conjugated you can see the video that 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.100
 find by clicking on this region 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.100
 let's continue 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.379
 to be able to simplify the expression 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:01.269
 algebraic of our limit we are going to 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.549
 implement a procedure that 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.890
 flame conjugate or complete the binomial 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.590
 conjugate observes that here below we have 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.129
 one subtracts a difference of two 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.470
 amounts less than conjugating wants 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.230
 simply say complete the binomial 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.790
 conjugated and that is nothing more than 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.469
 write c + d 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.540
 if here was the sign of sum 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:27.379
 conjugate would put here a sign of 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.209
 subtract and it's simply about that what 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.680
 same thing that we did here we are going to do 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.439
 with this expression that is down here 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.409
 which is the subtraction of the root minus the 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:39.349
 number 2 we are going to conjugate what is 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:41.239
 we will complete with the sum of the 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.180
 same amounts for that we're going to 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.269
 put a parenthesis here and we're going to 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.189
 add here together another parenthesis in the 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.830
 which we are going to write the same thing that is 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:55.650
 here the same terms the root of 2x 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.050
 the 2 but here we are going to place a sign 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.740
 of sum 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.690
 we are completing a conjugate binomial 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.430
 to take advantage of the binomial concept 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.820
 conjugate that is very simple remember 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.530
 square the first term of the subtraction 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.890
 least square of the second term of the 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.590
 subtraction 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.019
 the key point here is that in 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.030
 the part where we add the parenthesis 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.330
 we have to put on the top 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.850
 another identical parenthesis when adding 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.010
 same up and down are canceled 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.350
 mutually it is as if we had not 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.090
 added nothing otherwise we would be 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.090
 altering the algebraic expression 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:37.899
 remember if you put here with a sign of 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:40.299
 sum here you also have to put sign 

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:41.739
 of sum and if outside of re is here 

00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:44.589
 you should also put a sign of 

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:47.049
 subtract you have to add the same thing above 

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:49.299
 and below that we're going to put here 

00:04:47.049 --> 00:04:51.270
 in parentheses to indicate that this is 

00:04:49.299 --> 00:04:53.310
 multiplying 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.230
 because we are doing this because 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.330
 we want to change the denominator of the 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.430
 fraction over all the denominator 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.430
 because that's where the conflict is not 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.370
 there must be a zero in the denominator 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.260
 then we remember that to solve a 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.710
 conjugate binomial that would be what is 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.680
 down here in the denominator 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.870
 only the denominator would be the 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:20.230
 square of the positive term of the 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:22.360
 subtract or be the square of the root of 2x 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.380
 the square with the root and 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.560
 only 2x remains 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.800
 minus the square of the negative term 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.560
 of the subtraction that would be 2 but squared 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.990
 4 therefore we can remove all the 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.900
 denominator and put only what 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.530
 we obtained as a result of the binomial 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.530
 conjugate 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.150
 but here we find the 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.570
 following if we did the substitution 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.910
 direct instead of the x we're going to 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.400
 realize that we get again 0 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.229
 about 0 try to make the substitution and 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.880
 check for yourself what I am 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:04.180
 explaining 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.870
 but what we are going to do is factor 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:13.300
 the denominator 2 x 4 can be factored 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:15.190
 as 2 that multiplies x minus 2 what 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.680
 I did it was factoring by factor 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.500
 common 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.039
 the greatest common divisor of 2 and 4 is the 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.039
 number 2 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.710
 we divide the term 2x between 2 and 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.990
 we get x and 4 between two gives us 2 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.600
 multiplying two checks that 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.300
 you get 2x and 2 for less 2 gives you 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.520
 minus 4 therefore all this expression 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.910
 you can replace this expression of 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.310
 below if you want to delve into the 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.440
 Factoring by common factor I invite you 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.760
 to see the video that appears giving 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.960
 click on this region 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.960
 let's continue 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.910
 remember that we are factoring in the 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:03.540
 denominator by common factor and was 2 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:03.540
 that multiplies x minus 2 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.650
 you can see that parentheses x2 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.310
 you can delete with parentheses 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.310
 identical from above 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:17.300
 whereby the limit has been simplified 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:20.380
 because now we have only the 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.390
 limit expression when x tends to 2 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:27.100
 of what was left above that was the root 

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:30.590
 square 2 x 2 is no longer necessary 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:33.920
 parenthesis about 2 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:36.140
 everything else I delete here we can do 

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:39.710
 the direct substitution like the X 

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:43.240
 it's worth 2 then it would be 2 for 2 who wants 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.240
 say it would be 4 

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:51.980
 but the square root of 42 so 

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:56.490
 we can erase this and put only 2 

00:07:51.980 --> 00:08:01.430
 224 is four over two but as 4 

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:01.430
 between 2 on 2 the final result is 2
