00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
gets a new vehicle this issue which is

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.920 
gets a new vehicle this issue which is
called<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.460> bat<00:00:38.700> tank<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.480> basically<00:00:39.809> a

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
called the bat tank and it's basically a

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.660 
called the bat tank and it's basically a
bigger<00:00:40.290> version<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.829> bat<00:00:41.010> loi<00:00:41.190> accept

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
bigger version of the bat loi accept

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.760 
bigger version of the bat loi accept
that<00:00:41.760> as<00:00:41.910> much<00:00:42.149> as<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.719> room<00:00:43.200> for<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.440> crew

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
that as much as like a room for a crew

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.740 
that as much as like a room for a crew
inside<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.640> basically<00:00:44.969> go<00:00:45.329> around<00:00:45.600> with

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
inside that can basically go around with

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.119 
inside that can basically go around with
them<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.230> think<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> people<00:00:47.100> that

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
them and I think it's the people that

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.220 
them and I think it's the people that
sponsor<00:00:47.730> his<00:00:47.879> new<00:00:48.090> bat<00:00:48.300> armor<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.899> stuff<00:00:49.020> like

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
that is bat costume and the subplot to

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.450

kind<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.170> contradicted<00:01:10.860> what<00:01:10.890> took<00:01:11.310> place<00:01:11.369> in

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790

anti-climactic<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.680> felt<00:01:16.890> kind<00:01:16.950> of

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
anti-climactic and just felt kind of

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.219 
anti-climactic and just felt kind of
silly<00:01:17.430> overall<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:18.720> kind<00:01:19.200> of

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
silly overall like it just kind of

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.990 
silly overall like it just kind of
happened<00:01:19.619> out<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.710> nowhere<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.759> I

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
happened out of nowhere and it it I

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.060 
happened out of nowhere and it it I
really<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:21.450> wish<00:01:21.840> they<00:01:22.110> had<00:01:22.259> left<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.770> for

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
really just wish they had left it for

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.190

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
maybe like three or four she's down just

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.730 
maybe like three or four she's down just
to<00:01:27.570> introduce<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.080> now<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.409> just<00:01:28.470> kind<00:01:28.710> of

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
to introduce it now it's just kind of

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.679 
to introduce it now it's just kind of
like<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:29.430> however<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.090> art<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.420> has<00:01:30.509> been

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
like a but however the art here has been

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.510 
like a but however the art here has been
amazing<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.470> far<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.710> think<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.250> some<00:01:32.400> of

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
amazing so far I think it's some of

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.700 
amazing so far I think it's some of
coulombs<00:01:33.030> best<00:01:33.329> work<00:01:33.689> yet<00:01:34.079> given<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.500> vast

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
coulombs best work yet given the vast

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.380 
coulombs best work yet given the vast
differences<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> overall<00:01:35.880> design<00:01:36.060> of
