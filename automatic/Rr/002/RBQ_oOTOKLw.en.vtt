I'm out closer home speaker what I mean

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.840 
I'm out closer home speaker what I mean
is<00:01:37.619> when<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.920> buy<00:01:38.070> these<00:01:38.130> speakers<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.670> they

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
is when you buy these speakers and they

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.179 
is when you buy these speakers and they
say<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.360> own<00:01:39.540> sometimes<00:01:40.439> at<00:01:40.799> 3.8<00:01:41.400> 3.9<00:01:42.240> 4.1<00:01:43.200> 4.2

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189

I<00:01:44.610> usually<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.780> stay<00:01:45.990> within<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.409> point

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
I usually have to stay within that point

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.469 
I usually have to stay within that point
4<00:01:47.579> decimal<00:01:48.329> range<00:01:49.189> so<00:01:50.189> if<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.430> got<00:01:50.640> some<00:01:51.180> that

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
4 decimal range so if we got some that

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.609 
4 decimal range so if we got some that
are<00:01:52.280> 3.8<00:01:53.509> then<00:01:54.509> it'll<00:01:54.840> come<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.049> little<00:01:55.259> below

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
are 3.8 then it'll come a little below

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.550 
are 3.8 then it'll come a little below
one<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.820> won't<00:01:57.000> be<00:01:57.119> good<00:01:57.329> I'll<00:01:58.229> test

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
one on so it won't be good I'll test

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.090 
one on so it won't be good I'll test
them<00:01:58.710> they'll<00:01:59.700> be<00:01:59.820> w5

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
them they'll be w5

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.790

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
this brand for the components it I think

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.070 
this brand for the components it I think
it's<00:02:53.970> probably<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.300> best<00:02:54.390> we<00:02:54.750> went<00:02:54.959> this

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
it's probably the best we went this

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.900 
it's probably the best we went this
route<00:02:55.320> because<00:02:55.620> this<00:02:55.739> will<00:02:55.950> give<00:02:56.459> us<00:02:56.489> a<00:02:56.730> better
