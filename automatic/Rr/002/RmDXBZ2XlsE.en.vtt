00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
which is a contract year for him with a

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.080 
which is a contract year for him with a
lot<00:00:33.620> of<00:00:33.739> questions<00:00:34.100> about<00:00:34.219> whether<00:00:34.489> he<00:00:34.730> truly

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
lot of questions about whether he truly

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.490 
lot of questions about whether he truly
is<00:00:35.120> an<00:00:35.360> elite<00:00:35.570> player<00:00:35.719> whether<00:00:36.140> they<00:00:36.200> can<00:00:36.320> take

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
is an elite player whether they can take

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.319

them<00:00:36.680> to<00:00:36.829> the<00:00:36.920> next<00:00:36.950> level<00:00:37.219> they've<00:00:37.910> had<00:00:37.969> some

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
them to the next level they've had some

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.420 
them to the next level they've had some
player<00:00:38.809> deletions<00:00:39.350> on<00:00:39.500> defense<00:00:39.949> lost<00:00:40.219> their

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
player deletions on defense lost their

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.560 
player deletions on defense lost their
left<00:00:40.550> tackle<00:00:41.030> so<00:00:41.180> it's<00:00:41.300> going<00:00:41.390> to<00:00:41.480> be

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
left tackle so it's going to be

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.270 
left tackle so it's going to be
important<00:00:41.960> for<00:00:41.989> shabb<00:00:42.230> deputies<00:00:42.649> in

competition<00:00:44.539> going<00:00:45.050> on<00:00:45.199> there<00:00:45.440> but<00:00:45.590> you<00:00:45.680> think

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
competition going on there but you think

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.290

that's<00:00:48.949> one<00:00:49.129> of<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.250> reasons<00:00:49.640> why<00:00:49.760> they've

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
that's one of the reasons why they've

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.639 
that's one of the reasons why they've
