about<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.750> I

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
about this I

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.309 
about this I
this<00:01:46.530> one<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.890> comparable<00:01:47.429> to<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:48.319> kerastase

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
this one is comparable to a kerastase

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.660 
this one is comparable to a kerastase
mask<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:50.069> think<00:01:50.399> it's<00:01:50.549> comparable<00:01:50.999> to<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:52.670> what

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
mask I think it's comparable to the what

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.010 
mask I think it's comparable to the what
is<00:01:53.789> it<00:01:53.909> it's<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.179> 10<00:01:54.479> mask<00:01:56.030> it's<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.450> really

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
is it it's a 10 mask it's it's really

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.109 
is it it's a 10 mask it's it's really
good<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:58.859> the<00:01:59.100> thick<00:01:59.369> one<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.060> do

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
good and it's the thick one and I do

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.080 
good and it's the thick one and I do
this<00:02:00.420> probably<00:02:01.020> once<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:02.009> week<00:02:02.219> or<00:02:02.490> once<00:02:02.579> every

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
this probably once a week or once every

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.639 
this probably once a week or once every
other<00:02:03.539> week<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.649> put<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.100> mainly<00:02:06.090> from

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
other week and I put it in mainly from

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.109 
other week and I put it in mainly from
probably<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.890> middle<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.190> my<00:02:08.340> hair<00:02:08.580> down<00:02:08.789> you

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
probably the middle of my hair down you

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.279 
probably the middle of my hair down you
don't<00:02:09.269> really<00:02:09.420> want<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.690> put<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.170> your

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
don't really want to put this on your

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.780 
don't really want to put this on your
roots<00:02:10.560> because<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.129> really<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.519> deep

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
roots because it really is a deep

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.140 
roots because it really is a deep
conditioning<00:02:12.360> treatment<00:02:13.349> so<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.849> then<00:02:15.060> I

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
conditioning treatment so and then I

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.580 
conditioning treatment so and then I
leave<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.569> in<00:02:15.690> while<00:02:15.959> I<00:02:15.989> do<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.349> other<00:02:16.470> stuff

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
leave it in while I do the other stuff

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.710 
leave it in while I do the other stuff
in<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.010> shower<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.700> my<00:02:18.150> hair<00:02:18.360> comes<00:02:18.569> out

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
in the shower and my hair comes out

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.589 
in the shower and my hair comes out
really<00:02:19.140> soft<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.680> love<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:21.030> other<00:02:21.269> thing

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
really soft I love it the other thing

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.039 
really soft I love it the other thing
she<00:02:21.810> sent<00:02:22.049> me<00:02:22.200> was<00:02:22.940> cb's<00:02:23.940> ancient<00:02:24.450> serum<00:02:24.840> and

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
she sent me was cb's ancient serum and

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.979 
she sent me was cb's ancient serum and
this<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.410> an<00:02:25.560> argan<00:02:25.890> oil<00:02:26.099> and<00:02:26.750> similar<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.959> a

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
this is an argan oil and similar to a

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.080 
this is an argan oil and similar to a
Moroccan<00:02:28.590> oil<00:02:28.769> you've<00:02:29.459> heard<00:02:29.700> me<00:02:29.849> talk<00:02:29.879> about

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
Moroccan oil you've heard me talk about

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.569 
Moroccan oil you've heard me talk about
this<00:02:30.299> to<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.930> one<00:02:31.079> that<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.230> have<00:02:31.579> think

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
this to the one that I have think

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.420 
this to the one that I have think
there's<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.879> hair<00:02:33.060> on<00:02:33.090> um<00:02:33.500> I'm<00:02:34.500> like<00:02:34.860> almost<00:02:35.160> out

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
there's a hair on um I'm like almost out

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.580 
there's a hair on um I'm like almost out
so<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.000> perfect<00:02:36.450> timing<00:02:36.720> for<00:02:37.110> this<00:02:37.290> and

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
so this is perfect timing for this and

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.430 
so this is perfect timing for this and
this<00:02:37.739> is<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:37.950> small<00:02:38.340> bottle<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:40.140> think<00:02:40.319> this

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
this is a small bottle and I think this

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.559 
this is a small bottle and I think this
one<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.650> about<00:02:40.829> twelve<00:02:41.250> dollars<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.420> the

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
one is about twelve dollars I like the

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.059 
one is about twelve dollars I like the
small<00:02:42.810> one<00:02:43.019> too<00:02:43.170> because<00:02:43.319> it's<00:02:43.560> easier<00:02:43.950> to

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
small one too because it's easier to

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.420 
small one too because it's easier to
pack<00:02:44.310> for<00:02:44.340> travel<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.030> it's<00:02:45.239> only<00:02:45.390> two<00:02:45.780> ounces

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
pack for travel and it's only two ounces

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.430 
pack for travel and it's only two ounces
and<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.730> put<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:48.359> you<00:02:48.540> can<00:02:48.690> put<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.079> when

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
and I put this in you can put it in when

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.470 
and I put this in you can put it in when
your<00:02:49.530> hair's<00:02:49.709> wet<00:02:49.950> or<00:02:50.250> dry<00:02:50.459> what<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:50.940> usually<00:02:51.150> do

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
your hair's wet or dry what I usually do

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.240 
your hair's wet or dry what I usually do
is<00:02:51.569> put<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.900> little<00:02:52.109> bit<00:02:52.290> in<00:02:52.440> when<00:02:52.620> it's<00:02:52.650> wet<00:02:53.010> and

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
is put a little bit in when it's wet and

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.849 
is put a little bit in when it's wet and
then<00:02:53.760> when<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.940> finish<00:02:54.269> blow<00:02:54.989> drying<00:02:55.230> my<00:02:55.290> hair<00:02:55.620> I

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
then when I finish blow drying my hair I

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.280 
then when I finish blow drying my hair I

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
just do it on the end so that my ends

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.789 
just do it on the end so that my ends
especially<00:03:00.750> when<00:03:00.930> i'm<00:03:01.049> in<00:03:01.170> need<00:03:01.319> of<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.590> near

especially when i'm in need of a near
cut<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.790> they<00:03:02.970> don't<00:03:03.150> look<00:03:03.389> all<00:03:03.660> frizzy<00:03:04.319> and

cut that they don't look all frizzy and

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.059 
cut that they don't look all frizzy and
everything<00:03:04.829> so<00:03:05.579> I<00:03:05.609> love<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.500> then<00:03:07.500> she<00:03:07.769> sent

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069

me which I've never tried this one the

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.129 
me which I've never tried this one the
cebu<00:03:10.980> Shanghai<00:03:11.549> root<00:03:11.880> booster<00:03:12.329> and<00:03:12.569> this<00:03:12.810> is

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
cebu Shanghai root booster and this is

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.909 
cebu Shanghai root booster and this is
probably<00:03:14.120> actually<00:03:15.120> one<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.569> these<00:03:15.919> sprayed

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:16.919 
probably actually one of these sprayed

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.030 
probably actually one of these sprayed
on<00:03:17.099> wet<00:03:17.340> hair<00:03:17.370> at<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.690> roots<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.290> then<00:03:19.769> it

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
on wet hair at the roots and then it

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.129 
on wet hair at the roots and then it
will<00:03:20.160> give<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.489> more<00:03:20.519> vol<00:03:20.910> volume<00:03:21.450> which<00:03:21.930> will

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
serum I don't know if I said this but

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.600 
serum I don't know if I said this but
it's<00:04:42.690> similar<00:04:42.930> to<00:04:43.140> like<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.680> Moroccan<00:04:44.130> oil<00:04:44.220> I

think it smells better and the other

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.340 
think it smells better and the other
benefit<00:04:46.890> is<00:04:46.950> that<00:04:47.100> it<00:04:47.370> has<00:04:47.550> a<00:04:47.580> pump<00:04:48.140> and<00:04:49.140> that

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
benefit is that it has a pump and that

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.630 
benefit is that it has a pump and that
way<00:04:49.470> you<00:04:49.530> can<00:04:49.800> get<00:04:49.950> out<00:04:50.130> what<00:04:50.310> you<00:04:50.460> need
