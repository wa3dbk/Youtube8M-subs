00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:10.620
 how do transformers 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:13.070
 from special steel casts magnet 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.070
 the wire 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.460
 on the frame is wound wire 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.650
 for ease of assembly on the finished coil 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:35.480
 put on a pre-cut 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.480
 halved magnet wire 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.660
 assembled transformers pass 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.920
 quality control check 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.790
 isolation is necessary for safe 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.790
 operation 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.540
 in the manufacture of more powerful 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:10.550
 transformers use wire 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.550
 a larger section of the pile winding isolate 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.680
 so collects transformers which 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.190
 included in the electrical kit 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.190
 math study 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.640
 different in power and size 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.540
 transformers are used in household 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.540
 devices and devices 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.890
 tape recorders and receivers 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:46.280
 TVs and micro calculators and even 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.280
 in toys and models
