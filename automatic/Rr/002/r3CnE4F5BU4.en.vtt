00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.190
 effects of the mutation that is very good to leave 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.410

 son Peter we bodies are 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.170
 investigating Peter for some time I 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.810
 I like these mysteries because it gives 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.810
 one more thing in the plot is not only 16 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.030
 have to face a villain and that's not 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:13.300
 gives a thing wiser but without leaving 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:19.900

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.900

 elektro looks at it in africa 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.390
 Paulo 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.480
 Dude, I want to leave mine here. 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.690
 complaint is the same boot a comparison 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:55.440
 of the realm of comics and the movie like that 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:58.739
 I do not care to make it as 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.950
 an armor knows if he only 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.170
 walk and be the river but they invented it 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.410
 running like a rhinoceros car is not 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.230
 So why do that then thanks to 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.690
 God he will only appear well 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.190
 quickly for five minutes and thus 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.030
 will not have much interference in the 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:24.979
 movie for what I read and why not 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:31.350
 nothing to see face but finally only has effect 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:34.250
 sensational elektro wins the chance it is 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.250
 fuck more expensive 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:48.140
 the only cg all very massive here is goiano 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.390
 I 'm with her, she's here, she's not. 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.590
 will die in style because the 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:57.620
 occurrence is legal 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.970
 there the spider conflict of the emd without grace 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.510
 What did people like to eat and did not they? 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.510
 to die right 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:15.470
 then a comic relief the final and not 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.400
 I'll like the movie, it's going to be the river. 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.400
 rest
