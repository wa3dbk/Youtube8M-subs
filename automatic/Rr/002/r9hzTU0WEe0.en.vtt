00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello very good to all guys and girls 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.600
 we are here again in another video and 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.460
 as I announced a few days ago in my networks 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.370
 social this weekend I attended 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.019
 to a new event that has been held in 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.389
 the region of Murcia and to which they have 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.609
 decided to call winter freak on his 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.800
 first edition in addition this convention 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.109
 had the peculiarity that they were going to 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.630
 bring two guest cosplayer 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.570
 very famous internationals one of them 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.250
 it's Ryan Braun and the other the popular 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.610
 jessica nigris what the truth is that 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.680
 attracted many people even from several 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.660
 parts of Spain is worth one of the things 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.579
 what I would like to discuss about this room 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.800
 which it is what I liked it well 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.920
 right when entering is the space since it 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.989
 He did in the center ifema de torre pacheco 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.969
 and the truth is I have to say that it has 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.129
 It was a great success to do it there because 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.620
 the truth you could walk with total 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.320
 quiet eat quiet thing that 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.239
 for questions also of other enclosures 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.850
 as for example in the one of murcia 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.770
 it was impossible not to have a 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.750
 little hole and although this was also a 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.810
 pretty good point also gave him a 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.240
 little glue that I wanted to mention 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.820
 that the space to be so big had 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.979
 just at the end of the ship a part that 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.810
 I was very wasted that I was 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.700
 empty that in my opinion you could have 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.070
 used to put there more are 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.869
 commercial or let's say do other 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.270
 activities that I hear is not that it is 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.610
 bad but not that it gave a sensation 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.649
 as empty at the end of the room the 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.229
 commercial stand I saw them quite 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.909
 varied that in my opinion were scarce 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.740
 and in terms of quantity they are 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.689
 material and all that the truth is that 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.200
 there were quite a few things one in particular 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.179
 it was blizzard officer where he is 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.700
 recognize that I bought some other 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.950
 cosilla and apart good the stand 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.500
 also of video game shirts from 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.959
 second hand figures but as I say with 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.729
 with very varied articles although 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.830
 it emits a little short walk through the 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.959
 states this also a suggestion that 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.939
 I give the winter free guys that 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.770
 for the next edition because if they can 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.599
 in the area that I have commented on the end 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.369
 that was a little more wasted 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.560
 that they put there just are 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.899
 commercial if people are encouraged in 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.450
 Regarding the internal organization of this 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.040
 event the first day I noticed a little bit of 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.920
 Sun 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.959
 for example with the subject of pamphlets 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.150
 of activities and others when I arrived 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.400
 Saturday they had been finished or not 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.349
 they had not had a foresight to have 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.480
 there more papers not for people who 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.430
 came though in the middle of the afternoon 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.799
 solved without any problem what 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.689
 they replenished and everyone could have a 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.000
 pamphlet to see the activities 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:35.920
 and if not then you could take a picture 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.139
 with the mobile phone even though I am more of the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.659
 that prefers to take the paper also 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:43.719
 something happened during the session 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:46.030
 signatures and photos with jessica nigris with 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:48.040
 ryan the first day that good this is no longer 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.590
 I know if it was up to the organization 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.019
 internal or the manager of the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.599
 cosplayers that every two times gives you 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.370
 a deer and what they did was cut or 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.069
 be they cut the session to do 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.540
 interviews or other activities without 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.299
 prior notice or the uncle arrived 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.310
 cut and they left us there waiting for the 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.169
 rest hours and hours in the queue that 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.689
 come back in this case also make a 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:12.700
 special mention to those volunteers 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.650
 that were there at the stand watching how 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.060
 were we doing photos and so on 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.310
 corpses that had a lot of patience 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.709
 with this because of course imagine 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.989
 a line of people so long and tell 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.060
 Well, I do not know when the girls will return 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.950
 that is, the best comes within an hour 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.280
 comes from two I took a small 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.319
 I pissed on Saturday since I could not get to 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.260
 take a picture with her because she left 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.690
 and it had to be Sunday already at last 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.760
 when you can get to jessica nigri 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.560
 and make me the longed for signature photo of 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.150
 Articles without problems the girls the 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.430
 truth is that it is very nice and very 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.739
 nice I liked good apart when 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.200
 He cut the manager one of the times 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.790
 principle even snuck out people who 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.530
 was left to force to be able to 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.750
 photo not that since it shows that 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.519
 funny not the girls but good as 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.370
 you know these things because they are like that in 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.989
 Regarding the workshops and activities 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.760
 really quite well there was almost no 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.709
 gaps in the schedule that is one thing that 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.500
 I sometimes critic in this kind of 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.900
 events you had things to do and see in 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.319
 every moment there were also the classic ones 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.690
 exhibitions of bundang signatures and others 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.479
 very curradas articles and also the boy 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.090
 that I had in the stand I do not explain it with 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.139
 every detail every figurine what he had 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.139
 wings 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.090
 the models and others for very well the 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.400
 hall of acts elected for the 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.009
 conference was also very broad as 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.199
 the living room itself and nice to me 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.659
 I liked it very much I was in two in particular 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.400
 one of initiation at cost and another of 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:41.529
 collecting and the truth is that I 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.840
 he liked quite the environment 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:46.419
 how it was distributed at the time of 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.279
 eat that I 'm going to put another small 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.789
 hit the room because if you put 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:51.129
 look 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.949
 there were two posts worth nothing more than 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:56.680
 meal with kilometric tails one to 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.900
 the tickets and another to ask for the truth 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.909
 I saw it exaggerated and long because 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.840
 example there were four other posts that 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:07.870
 they were sweet waffles crepes and so on 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.490
 things that the truth is better for the 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.430
 dessert not for when you finish eating 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.469
 but for what was food itself only 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.569
 there were two no posts and the truth is that 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:18.520
 they were mounted there are exaggerated tails 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:21.759
 when the room could have had 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.740
 really more food stalls because 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:26.169
 There was enough space but good 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.090
 I imagine that another little thing that will solve 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.279
 for the next one just after 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.020
 buy the food I noticed the area 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:34.360
 camped that the truth was also 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.889
 great was a covered area because 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.020
 good these days it's also colder 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.219
 it's not that it was quite comfortable about 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.379
 everything for the people who had done 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:44.289
 so many kilometers to get there and 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:47.080
 good ending this brief experience 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:49.180
 of ministers over there I will tell you about 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.879
 the cosplay contests something that never 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.430
 I forget and that as always I enjoy 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:56.620
 a lot to say that the flirt cosplayers 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.020
 legend because they were present not by the 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.969
 fashion but the rest that they did not 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.279
 other characters were very curious 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:05.680
 also some performances seemed to me 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.509
 very surprising, I'll leave you some for 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.669
 the video as I've always done and in this 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.889
 case they made me change or they were made 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:15.069
 the individual dessert contest the 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:17.259
 Saturday and the group on Sunday followed 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:19.779
 plus a short walkway of about 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:21.069
 seconds for participating in people who do not 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:23.110
 I had prepared a performance and that 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:24.759
 I just went up to a pose and 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.560
 contributions or people as well 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:28.180
 I selected in groups to give 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.520
 prizes and other things that I 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.070
 I would like to emphasize also here is that 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.490
 normally the jury gives 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.230
 a microphone to speak and the public 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.450
 listen to what he is saying in this 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:42.150
 occasion the jury was composed 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:44.460
 by jessica nigris herself and by ryan 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.900
 and some some people more than by 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.610
 there in the living room the truth is that to me 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.830
 I would have liked to hear the 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.540
 comments from them even if they were in 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.970
 English yes it is true that the subject of 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.650
 the language barrier in this case of 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.990
 jessica speaks in english yes that is a 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.760
 little complicated maybe they wanted it 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.050
 do for that but the truth that to me 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.790
 I would have liked to hear some 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.680
 Comment on this girl at least 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.620
 for those who extend English but in 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:10.260
 definitively I will say that it has been a very 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:13.770
 nice and fun with some glitches 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:16.950
 I already say the first part of Saturday but 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:19.740
 that I'm usually very satisfied 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.540
 I liked it a lot and I'm at 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.640
 wait for the next edition of the 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.470
 next year to see what guests 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.540
 international bring this time that the 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.770
 I'm really curious, so 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.890
 nothing guys I hope you liked it 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:34.500
