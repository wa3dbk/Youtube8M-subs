00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
miss the first look at the bike it is a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.569 
miss the first look at the bike it is a
trek<00:00:46.469> navigated<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.280> point<00:00:47.699> o<00:00:48.079> in<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.460> at<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
trek navigated to point o in a at the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.220 
trek navigated to point o in a at the
front<00:00:50.820> suspension<00:00:50.879> which<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.629> really<00:00:51.870> nice<00:00:52.020> on

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
front suspension which is really nice on

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.299 
front suspension which is really nice on
the<00:00:52.350> back<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.809> bad<00:00:54.989> part<00:00:55.019> is<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the back but the bad part is it is a

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.880 
the back but the bad part is it is a
where<00:00:56.670> item<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:58.019> you<00:00:58.230> know<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.500> does<00:00:58.680> where

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
where item that you know it does where

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.279 
where item that you know it does where
the<00:00:59.100> seals<00:00:59.340> go<00:00:59.579> bad<00:00:59.789> they<00:01:00.780> get<00:01:00.899> fill<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.230> up

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the seals go bad they get fill it up

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.759 
the seals go bad they get fill it up
with<00:01:01.350> dirt<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.769> gunk<00:01:02.300> you<00:01:03.300> also<00:01:03.449> sort<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.809> put

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
with dirt and gunk you also sort of put

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.520 
with dirt and gunk you also sort of put
more<00:01:04.949> fluid<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.110> an<00:01:07.259> item

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
more fluid in on it so it is an item

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.350 
more fluid in on it so it is an item
that<00:01:07.560> would<00:01:08.130> potentially<00:01:08.340> need<00:01:08.759> repair<00:01:09.119> and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
that would potentially need repair and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.030 
that would potentially need repair and
then<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.259> a<00:01:10.409> shtf<00:01:12.259> event<00:01:13.259> would<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.710> probably

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
then in a shtf event would be probably

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.700 
then in a shtf event would be probably
hard<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.520> find<00:01:14.790> replacement<00:01:15.330> parts<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.710> so

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
hard to find replacement parts for so

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.170 
hard to find replacement parts for so
something<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.759> probably<00:01:17.939> less

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
something like this is probably less

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.380 
something like this is probably less
than<00:01:18.360> ideal<00:01:18.479> for<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> dedicated<00:01:19.640> SHTF<00:01:20.640> bike<00:01:21.000> for

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
than ideal for a dedicated SHTF bike for

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.380 
than ideal for a dedicated SHTF bike for
transportation<00:01:21.750> purposes<00:01:22.729> but<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:24.060> me<00:01:24.150> it's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
transportation purposes but for me it's

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.109 
transportation purposes but for me it's
nice<00:01:24.600> because<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.229> good<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.619> back

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
nice because it is good on the back

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.010 
nice because it is good on the back
makes<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.210> lie<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.720> ride<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> little<00:01:28.110> bit<00:01:28.409> nicer

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
makes a lie the ride a little bit nicer

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.700 
makes a lie the ride a little bit nicer
another<00:01:31.020> nice<00:01:31.170> feature<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:33.380> rack<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.649> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
another nice feature is the rack on the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.770 
another nice feature is the rack on the
back<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.040> i<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.520> top<00:01:36.000> with<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> basket

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.929 
back that i have on top with a basket

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.550 
as you can see is the mesh covering
which<00:06:08.310> is<00:06:08.430> nice<00:06:08.580> to<00:06:08.730> keep<00:06:08.850> bugs<00:06:09.090> off<00:06:09.380> so<00:06:10.380> you

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
which is nice to keep bugs off so you

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.470 
which is nice to keep bugs off so you
have<00:06:10.740> air<00:06:11.070> ventilation<00:06:11.400> for<00:06:11.940> the<00:06:12.030> kids<00:06:12.270> or

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
whatever you're carrying here and you

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.210 
whatever you're carrying here and you
keep<00:06:14.160> the<00:06:14.310> bugs<00:06:14.460> off<00:06:14.670> and<00:06:15.150> then<00:06:15.660> there's<00:06:15.810> also

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
keep the bugs off and then there's also

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.800 
keep the bugs off and then there's also
this<00:06:17.220> like<00:06:17.700> a<00:06:17.730> rain<00:06:17.970> shield<00:06:18.300> that<00:06:18.450> goes<00:06:18.600> on<00:06:18.750> top

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
this like a rain shield that goes on top

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.980 
this like a rain shield that goes on top
that<00:06:19.560> velcro's<00:06:19.980> down<00:06:20.190> as<00:06:20.570> you<00:06:21.570> can<00:06:21.690> see<00:06:21.810> it's

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
that velcro's down as you can see it's

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.170 
that velcro's down as you can see it's
still<00:06:22.230> kind<00:06:22.440> of<00:06:22.500> dirty<00:06:22.740> but<00:06:23.070> not<00:06:23.850> carrying
