00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.299
 hello to everyone friends i'm jay 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.640
 today I bring you a news wii and is 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.310
 which, as the title says, can load 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.320
 those of wii very soon apparently the 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.240
 final stage of hacking Emulator 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.180
 wii present in the new desktop 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.520
 nintendo wii it has already come to an end 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.189
 since according to they inform us as the power 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:36.170
 Bilbao has completely adapted him 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:39.250
 the 2 x 2 v8 so that this can be 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:44.690
 use in wy mode present in wii u 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:48.280
 remember that he the 2 x 2 v8 is a 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.810
 uncle is improved and present for for wii 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.000
 I think I have a video about that 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.160
 about how to install vitaly is a guy 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.920
 after that it allows us to load backup it 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.570
 so much in him 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.750
 on cd that is on a disk or on a 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.430
 pendrive no and well he has done 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.710
 this simply what the 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.950
 power is to adapt that takes a lot 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.190
 work behind all that adapt this 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.700
 this application so that you can use 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.680
 in uy mode that is present in wii and 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.600
 well, this means that we can 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.450
 load the wii si sos and that the 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.180
 system so u and it has already been 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.929
 hacked thus allowing the execution 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.210
 Well, of all kinds of applications 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:36.819
 a few days ago I published my website 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.420
 that since you could already you could 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:43.179
 install the homebrew without it on the web 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.050
 ok remember that wii has present 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:49.800
 an emulator so to speak of wii 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.200
 which is called wi mode and then simply 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.230
 the console the new console emulates the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.670
 wii system and the original system and 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.450
 Well, apparently you can already 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.750
 load backups from that mode no no no 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.080
 have gotten a lot like saying it they have not 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.630
 I was able to create code just for wii but 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.420
 yes for wii and this is already a breakthrough 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.880
 for the console scene of the new 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.790
 nintendo desktop not because then 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.040
 it's very good the truth is that 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.110
 after his few days after his 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.180
 launch can already be loaded those of 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.180
 wii 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.069
 and little else you have to make friends yet 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.709
 the work has not come out the light has not been 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.530
 published the project but it is expected that 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.930
 within a few days or a few weeks then 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.200
 already give in it the download link for 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.859
 that this can be installed on the web and 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.019
 little more 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:44.730
 I hope you liked the news already 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.500
 you know that you can enter to carry a 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.840
 net point to be informed day to 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.969
 day about the news news of 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.950
 computer consoles and video games me 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:55.969
