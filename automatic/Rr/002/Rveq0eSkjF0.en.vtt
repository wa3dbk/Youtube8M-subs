from that you know there could be

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.990 
from that you know there could be
different<00:01:56.130> ways<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.430> could<00:01:56.670> do<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.939> could

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
different ways you could do it you could

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.319 
different ways you could do it you could
do<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:57.630> for<00:01:58.310> war<00:01:59.310> attacks<00:01:59.700> if<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.149> could

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
do it just for war attacks if you could

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.910 
do it just for war attacks if you could
you<00:02:00.540> know<00:02:00.659> somehow<00:02:01.049> delegate<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.680> that

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
you know somehow delegate it to that

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.709 
you know somehow delegate it to that
maybe<00:02:02.729> when<00:02:02.909> they<00:02:02.969> hit<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.180> attack<00:02:03.450> button

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
maybe when they hit the attack button

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.389 
maybe when they hit the attack button
they<00:02:03.899> could<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.649> know<00:02:04.770> put<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.250> there

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
they could you know put it in there

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.460 
they could you know put it in there
right<00:02:05.640> from<00:02:05.939> that

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
right from that

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.720 
right from that
from<00:02:06.740> that<00:02:06.830> pop-up<00:02:07.100> screen<00:02:07.340> where<00:02:07.700> it

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
from that pop-up screen where it

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.960 
from that pop-up screen where it
confirms<00:02:08.090> your<00:02:08.240> army<00:02:08.649> that<00:02:09.649> way<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.190> know<00:02:10.310> the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
confirms your army that way you know the

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.730 
confirms your army that way you know the
since<00:02:11.630> we've<00:02:11.780> been<00:02:11.870> in<00:02:11.930> town<00:02:12.050> hall<00:02:12.230> 5<00:02:12.500> it's

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
since we've been in town hall 5 it's

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.100 
since we've been in town hall 5 it's
been<00:02:12.890> great<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:14.030> much<00:02:14.240> easier<00:02:14.450> on<00:02:14.720> people<00:02:15.020> but

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
been great so much easier on people but

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
been great so much easier on people but
this<00:02:15.320> way<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.530> know<00:02:15.740> if<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.010> have

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
this way you know if you have

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.040 
this way you know if you have
international<00:02:16.700> clan<00:02:16.910> like<00:02:17.120> we<00:02:17.240> do<00:02:17.450> some

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
international clan like we do some

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.450 
international clan like we do some
people<00:02:18.260> in<00:02:18.350> different<00:02:18.470> time<00:02:18.740> zones<00:02:18.770> it's<00:02:19.250> it's

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
people in different time zones it's it's

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.490 
people in different time zones it's it's
harder<00:02:19.850> at<00:02:20.000> times<00:02:20.240> for<00:02:20.660> them<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:21.080> get<00:02:21.260> the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
harder at times for them to get the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.260 
harder at times for them to get the
donations<00:02:21.980> they<00:02:22.130> need<00:02:22.340> for<00:02:22.550> war<00:02:22.760> attacks<00:02:23.060> and

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
donations they need for war attacks and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.270 
donations they need for war attacks and
if<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:23.840> just<00:02:24.080> have<00:02:24.260> like<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.770> don't<00:02:25.070> know<00:02:25.220> a

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
if you just have like I don't know a

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.070 
if you just have like I don't know a
thousand<00:02:25.850> troops<00:02:26.030> pace<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.420> maybe<00:02:26.570> it<00:02:26.690> could

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
thousand troops pace and maybe it could

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.630 
thousand troops pace and maybe it could
even<00:02:27.200> be<00:02:27.260> something<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.560> levels<00:02:28.040> up<00:02:28.250> with

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
even be something that levels up with

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.750 
even be something that levels up with
the<00:02:28.850> clan<00:02:29.180> perk<00:02:29.480> system<00:02:29.960> that<00:02:30.710> you<00:02:31.100> know<00:02:31.220> me

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
could put in you know golems which are

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.100

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
to do their attack they can draw from

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.170 
to do their attack they can draw from
that<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:49.490> they<00:02:49.580> don't<00:02:49.670> have<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.940> wait<00:02:50.150> on

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
that and they don't have to wait on

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.910 
that and they don't have to wait on
someone<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.780> build<00:02:50.959> it<00:02:51.170> maybe<00:02:51.560> if<00:02:51.709> they<00:02:51.830> have

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
someone to build it maybe if they have

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.380 
someone to build it maybe if they have
to<00:02:52.010> come<00:02:52.160> in<00:02:52.280> late<00:02:52.490> to<00:02:52.640> do<00:02:52.730> their<00:02:52.880> attack<00:02:53.180> and

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
to come in late to do their attack and

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.180 
to come in late to do their attack and
they<00:02:53.450> need<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:53.630> golem<00:02:54.050> someone<00:02:54.890> isn't<00:02:54.980> have<00:02:55.130> to

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
they need a golem someone isn't have to

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.160 
they need a golem someone isn't have to
either<00:02:55.280> gem<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.820> or<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.510> know<00:02:56.630> they<00:02:56.810> don't<00:02:56.930> get

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
either gem it or you know they don't get

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.530 
either gem it or you know they don't get
the<00:02:57.410> troop<00:02:57.950> that<00:02:58.100> they<00:02:58.190> need<00:02:58.459> so<00:02:58.730> that's<00:02:59.390> not

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
the troop that they need so that's not

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.850 
the troop that they need so that's not
that<00:02:59.750> I've<00:02:59.840> not<00:03:00.050> heard<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.350> before<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.740> I

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
that I've not heard of before and I

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.530 
that I've not heard of before and I
think<00:03:01.070> would<00:03:01.220> probably<00:03:01.520> be<00:03:01.610> pretty<00:03:01.850> simple<00:03:02.240> to

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
think would probably be pretty simple to

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.900 
think would probably be pretty simple to
do<00:03:02.920> maybe<00:03:03.920> I'm<00:03:04.100> wrongly<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:04.580> they<00:03:04.700> quite<00:03:04.850> a

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
do maybe I'm wrongly that they quite a

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.970 
do maybe I'm wrongly that they quite a
bit<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.150> coding<00:03:05.360> but<00:03:05.600> still<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:06.050> think<00:03:06.770> will<00:03:06.920> be

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
bit of coding but still I think will be

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.610 
bit of coding but still I think will be
a<00:03:07.040> pretty<00:03:07.220> cool<00:03:07.459> perk<00:03:08.240> for<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.510> game<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:09.410> next

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
a pretty cool perk for the game the next

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.440 
a pretty cool perk for the game the next
one<00:03:09.950> is<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:10.580> I<00:03:10.670> would<00:03:10.820> love<00:03:11.030> for<00:03:11.090> them<00:03:11.269> to<00:03:11.330> do

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
one is and I would love for them to do

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.030 
one is and I would love for them to do
this<00:03:11.510> I<00:03:11.630> know<00:03:11.690> this<00:03:12.080> treatment<00:03:12.380> would<00:03:12.650> have<00:03:12.890> to

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
this I know this treatment would have to

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.540 
this I know this treatment would have to
be<00:03:13.130> easy<00:03:13.310> for<00:03:13.580> them<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:13.730> do<00:03:13.910> is<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:15.769> be<00:03:15.800> able<00:03:15.980> to

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
be easy for them to do is to be able to

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.100 
be easy for them to do is to be able to
have<00:03:17.239> a<00:03:17.300> setting<00:03:18.050> to<00:03:18.320> where<00:03:19.010> if<00:03:19.670> if<00:03:20.600> I<00:03:20.810> want<00:03:21.050> to

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
have a setting to where if if I want to

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.720 
have a setting to where if if I want to

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
people that like to visit maybe clan

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.280

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
families things of that nature that you

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.350 
families things of that nature that you
could<00:04:24.440> mark<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:24.890> whenever<00:04:25.700> there's<00:04:26.090> room

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
could mark and whenever there's room

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.000 
could mark and whenever there's room
they<00:04:26.570> could<00:04:26.750> just<00:04:26.960> go<00:04:27.140> in<00:04:27.320> and<00:04:27.440> out<00:04:27.590> so<00:04:27.860> that's

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
they could just go in and out so that's

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.280 
they could just go in and out so that's
an<00:04:28.190> idea<00:04:28.460> that<00:04:28.610> again<00:04:28.880> I've<00:04:29.360> not<00:04:29.600> heard<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:29.960> but

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
an idea that again I've not heard of but

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.130 
an idea that again I've not heard of but
maybe<00:04:30.560> would<00:04:30.860> be<00:04:30.980> a<00:04:31.010> cool<00:04:31.370> one<00:04:31.640> if<00:04:32.540> supercell

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
maybe would be a cool one if supercell

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.290 
maybe would be a cool one if supercell
is<00:04:33.380> possibly<00:04:34.190> listening<00:04:34.580> that<00:04:34.940> would<00:04:35.060> be<00:04:35.150> nice

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
is possibly listening that would be nice

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.560 
is possibly listening that would be nice
the<00:04:36.260> last<00:04:36.530> one<00:04:36.860> is<00:04:37.070> an<00:04:37.280> idea<00:04:37.670> that<00:04:37.820> I<00:04:37.880> heard<00:04:38.240> and

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
the last one is an idea that I heard and

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.390 
the last one is an idea that I heard and
I<00:04:38.840> think<00:04:39.110> it<00:04:39.230> was<00:04:39.350> great<00:04:39.740> I<00:04:39.980> don't<00:04:40.130> know<00:04:40.250> where

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
I think it was great I don't know where

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.620 
I think it was great I don't know where
this<00:04:40.490> originated<00:04:40.970> from<00:04:41.060> or<00:04:41.360> who<00:04:41.450> was<00:04:41.540> the

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
this originated from or who was the

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.090 
this originated from or who was the
first<00:04:41.810> one<00:04:41.930> to<00:04:41.990> come<00:04:42.110> up<00:04:42.260> with<00:04:42.290> it<00:04:42.530> but<00:04:43.010> I<00:04:43.040> think

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
first one to come up with it but I think

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.340 
first one to come up with it but I think
it<00:04:43.430> would<00:04:43.550> really<00:04:43.940> breathe<00:04:44.600> some<00:04:45.140> new<00:04:45.170> life

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350

it would really breathe some new life

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
but it would it would give clan

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.530 
but it would it would give clan
something<00:06:32.370> to<00:06:32.460> do<00:06:32.610> in<00:06:32.790> clanmates<00:06:33.180> it<00:06:33.300> gives<00:06:33.450> a

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540 
something to do in clanmates it gives a

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.630 
something to do in clanmates it gives a
little<00:06:33.630> more<00:06:33.750> practice<00:06:34.250> it<00:06:35.250> would<00:06:35.370> just<00:06:35.400> be<00:06:35.550> a

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
little more practice it would just be a

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.070 
little more practice it would just be a
lot<00:06:35.940> of<00:06:36.090> benefits<00:06:36.450> to<00:06:36.510> it<00:06:36.690> and<00:06:36.780> I<00:06:36.840> think<00:06:36.900> it

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
lot of benefits to it and I think it

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.680 
lot of benefits to it and I think it
would<00:06:37.170> be<00:06:37.260> a<00:06:37.290> lot<00:06:37.650> of<00:06:37.680> fun<00:06:38.160> again<00:06:39.090> the<00:06:39.450> timer

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
would be a lot of fun again the timer

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.150 
would be a lot of fun again the timer
would<00:06:39.900> be<00:06:39.960> completely<00:06:40.320> separate<00:06:40.770> from<00:06:40.800> your
