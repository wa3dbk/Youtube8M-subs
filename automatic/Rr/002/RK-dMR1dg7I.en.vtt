00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.610
 yes I have again been given today 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:13.069
 say after an hour of play 

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:15.969
 I trained for Heerenveen in the weekend 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.199
 a year fixed because feed 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:18.570
 it good the vandals 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.159
 what i am today 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:21.829
 sent yesterday experienced 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.460
 so that's why I both injured today 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.470
 and internet 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.119
 yes but that went well and 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.869
 I think I had Koeman hits back at the right time as well 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.450
 likely to contain sales a year earlier 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.520
 it's the band in the world 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.530
 Ryan groups with procrastination 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.340
 they tell what exactly happened 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.370
 when it's really not touching 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.210
 yes i had 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.210
 I made a sliding in at that time 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.020
 on my and 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.690
 yes i don't know what's in her suitcase 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.010
 there is nobody who kicked against my will 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.010
 and at that time years I felt 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.900
 yes something 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.550
 we stabbing says mario leg making the 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.570
 therefore I no longer wish it was possible 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.770
 the mexicans 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.050
 henk that little bit extra this time physically short of her album of it goes you 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.829
 can't say wk went 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.260
 I think the call rhythm 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.110
 maybe 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.200
 I am not very much the difference 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.900
 I think for those guys though the training was different for me 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.290
 because they have anyway 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.790
 played many matches 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.010
 relatively calmly trained and I was there last week, I really am 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.530
 developed there and so yes I noticed today that it 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.010
 ep we have to start it up somewhere 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.390
 and then we can look further tomorrow and everything feels good too 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.590
 you can also just go for it 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.350
 who apparently raised himself is nicolas lodeiro 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.570
 as the only one in the group, he does not care about the training room 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.690
 shorten 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.290
 it all goes well the match against juventus has one on Sunday evening 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.420
 year it is ready for 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.130
 I am ready for and disadvantages of what I say 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.229
 rasmus and it turned out that they might be the ones who want to lose weight 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.059
 that's a shame for the team 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:14.439
 maybe that one also that of the ordinary citizen 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.439
 so big bellies come running with sanne of course running 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.909
 yes, sir, it is even better to lose some nice points
