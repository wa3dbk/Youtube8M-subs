take<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> bars<00:00:55.829> out<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.730> they<00:00:57.000> know<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> wrong

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
take the bars out if they know the wrong

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.510 
take the bars out if they know the wrong
with<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.660> foot<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.020> ain't<00:00:58.199> real<00:00:58.379> necessary<00:00:59.039> so

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
with the foot it ain't real necessary so

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.580 
with the foot it ain't real necessary so
why<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.030> take<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> bars<00:01:00.629> out<00:01:00.930> basically

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
why do you take the bars out basically

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.160 
why do you take the bars out basically
simple<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.699> less<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.390> dirt<00:01:03.600> trap<00:01:03.899> that's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
simple it's less of a dirt trap that's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.320 
simple it's less of a dirt trap that's
the<00:01:04.379> only<00:01:04.589> reason<00:01:04.769> but<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:05.610> you've<00:01:05.760> got<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> foot

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the only reason but if you've got a foot

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.810 
the only reason but if you've got a foot
that's<00:01:06.540> flared<00:01:06.960> or<00:01:07.200> way<00:01:07.320> out<00:01:07.560> I'd<00:01:08.310> recommend

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
that's flared or way out I'd recommend

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.330 
that's flared or way out I'd recommend
driving<00:01:09.240> all<00:01:09.479> four<00:01:09.780> nails<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.500> side<00:01:10.770> then

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
driving all four nails in that side then

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.859 
driving all four nails in that side then
that<00:01:11.549> way<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.820> keeps<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.150> foot<00:01:12.390> from<00:01:12.570> going

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
that way it keeps the foot from going

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.380 
that way it keeps the foot from going
out<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.260> far<00:01:13.439> but<00:01:14.010> by<00:01:14.189> examining<00:01:14.820> issue<00:01:15.150> you'll

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
out so far but by examining issue you'll

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.120 
out so far but by examining issue you'll
see<00:01:15.600> what<00:01:15.810> reason<00:01:16.290> why<00:01:16.409> i<00:01:16.470> said<00:01:16.860> if<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.100> don't

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
see what reason why i said if you don't

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.310 
see what reason why i said if you don't
fit<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> shoe<00:01:17.820> right<00:01:18.060> then<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.810> may<00:01:18.930> not<00:01:18.960> have

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
fit the shoe right then you may not have

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.260 
fit the shoe right then you may not have
no<00:01:19.500> walls<00:01:19.770> or<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.580> may<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.909> your<00:01:20.939> foot

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
no walls or you may have your foot

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.270 
no walls or you may have your foot
flared<00:01:21.630> out<00:01:21.810> too<00:01:22.020> much<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.380> foot<00:01:22.619> preparations

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
flared out too much so foot preparations

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.580 
flared out too much so foot preparations

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
importa therefore you can nip correct

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.530 
importa therefore you can nip correct
such<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.310> correct<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.150> what<00:01:27.330> we're<00:01:27.450> going
