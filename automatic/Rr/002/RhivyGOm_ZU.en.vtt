but it is the middle of the winter so I

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.059 
but it is the middle of the winter so I

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
wanted it to be a little bit darker so

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.100 
wanted it to be a little bit darker so
what<00:02:09.160> I<00:02:09.250> do<00:02:09.310> is<00:02:09.459> I<00:02:09.670> just<00:02:09.819> fill<00:02:10.209> in<00:02:10.360> my<00:02:10.599> lips<00:02:10.629> with

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110

what I do is I just fill in my lips with
this<00:02:11.290> color<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:12.129> mean<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.519> could<00:02:12.730> wear<00:02:12.940> on<00:02:13.120> your
