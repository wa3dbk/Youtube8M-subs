 crianza segovia liberators was great 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.980

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.360
 liberators with chivas 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.150
 in fact knowing that I'm going to play with him 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.510
 It was one of the reasons that brought me 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.510

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.890
 what the Brazilian wanted to say is 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.739
 I identify a lot with the technician enrique 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.110

 that video of one of my matches in 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.980
 Brazil 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:31.649
 as in common sense 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:34.380
 that's a good sense 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.520
 if there are a lot of Brazilian soccer players that 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.520
 they passed 20 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:44.299

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.360
 work 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.979

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.289
 present it and put it in conference 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.149
 of the press because it is very complicated that 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.909
 you understand the truth the truth is 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.860
