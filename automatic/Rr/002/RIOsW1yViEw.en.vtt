five<00:00:50.680> chapters<00:00:51.129> and<00:00:51.280> each<00:00:51.640> chapter

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
five chapters and each chapter

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.320 
five chapters and each chapter
represents<00:00:53.129> qualities<00:00:54.129> of<00:00:54.400> a<00:00:54.640> wizard<00:00:54.879> so<00:00:55.239> it

represents qualities of a wizard so it

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.810 
represents qualities of a wizard so it
could<00:00:55.449> be<00:00:55.480> importance<00:00:55.930> of<00:00:56.019> practice<00:00:56.610> any<00:00:57.610> any

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
could be importance of practice any any

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.610 
could be importance of practice any any
kind<00:00:58.089> of<00:00:58.180> attribute<00:00:58.660> that<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:58.870> young<00:00:59.350> wizard<00:00:59.589> of

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
kind of attribute that a young wizard of

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.649 
kind of attribute that a young wizard of
which<00:00:59.769> would<00:00:59.980> need<00:01:00.129> to<00:01:00.550> progress<00:01:00.820> in<00:01:01.390> it<00:01:01.510> was

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
which would need to progress in it was

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.300 
which would need to progress in it was
in<00:01:01.780> the<00:01:01.839> world<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:05.170> once<00:01:05.379> we<00:01:05.500> had<00:01:05.710> that<00:01:05.740> kind<00:01:06.250> of

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
in the world so once we had that kind of

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.390 
in the world so once we had that kind of
skeleton<00:01:06.970> of<00:01:07.180> these<00:01:07.360> five<00:01:07.659> chapters<00:01:08.229> and<00:01:08.440> a

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
skeleton of these five chapters and a

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.060 
skeleton of these five chapters and a
theme<00:01:09.700> for<00:01:09.729> each<00:01:10.119> one<00:01:10.479> then<00:01:10.990> we<00:01:11.200> tied<00:01:11.560> in<00:01:11.740> for

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
theme for each one then we tied in for

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.820 
theme for each one then we tied in for
spells<00:01:12.369> per<00:01:12.700> chapter<00:01:13.410> so<00:01:14.410> the<00:01:14.560> first<00:01:14.770> thing

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
spells per chapter so the first thing

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.190 
spells per chapter so the first thing
play<00:01:15.670> might<00:01:15.880> do<00:01:16.030> is<00:01:16.210> learn<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.539> incantation

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
play might do is learn the incantation

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.070 
play might do is learn the incantation
for<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.550> sin<00:01:18.550> dios<00:01:18.759> both<00:01:18.970> of<00:01:19.149> them<00:01:19.300> so<00:01:19.990> they

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
for the sin dios both of them so they

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.960 
for the sin dios both of them so they
have<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.259> repeat<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.649> words<00:01:20.860> of<00:01:21.100> shown<00:01:21.880> on

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
have to repeat the words of shown on

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.999 
have to repeat the words of shown on
screen<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:23.020> next<00:01:23.320> stage<00:01:23.470> is<00:01:23.649> to<00:01:23.679> perform

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
screen and the next stage is to perform

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.880 
screen and the next stage is to perform
a<00:01:24.130> gesture<00:01:24.550> which<00:01:25.270> is<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.479> simple<00:01:26.080> shape<00:01:26.289> drawn

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
with a move controller and then they

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.999 
with a move controller and then they
weren't<00:01:28.810> going<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.140> edit<00:01:29.590> or<00:01:29.679> practice

these spells and they're played out
within<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.980> paper<00:02:19.280> theatre

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
within a paper theatre

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.710 
within a paper theatre
I<00:02:20.959> wanted<00:02:21.860> something<00:02:22.159> that<00:02:22.340> was<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.540> book

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
I wanted something that was of the book

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.570 
I wanted something that was of the book
but<00:02:24.290> was<00:02:24.440> also<00:02:25.870> quirky<00:02:26.870> funny<00:02:27.379> playful<00:02:28.190> in

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
but was also quirky funny playful in

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.220 
but was also quirky funny playful in
itself<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:31.790> think<00:02:31.970> what<00:02:32.599> we've<00:02:32.750> got<00:02:32.989> now<00:02:33.019> is

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
itself so I think what we've got now is

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.740 
itself so I think what we've got now is
