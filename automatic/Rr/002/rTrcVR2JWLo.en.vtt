00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.229
 preparing for competitions physically 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.200
 we are preparing but already spring 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.159
 we train more on motorcycles 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.500
 everyday physical training 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.450

 famous motorcyclists are therefore on 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.470
 childhood wanted to do motor sport but 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.049
 my daughter was given to rhythmic gymnastics 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.939
 then kickboxing by chance 8 years 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.040
 Kate still got behind the wheel of a motorcycle and 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.259
 so far it does not break up with someone 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.390
 it seems that seo gave gas and drove on 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.659
 you really hold a motorcycle which 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.790
 under 110 pounds weighs an obstacle 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.649
 somewhere to carry naturally humeral 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.290
 arm belt to hold this 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.360
 heavy machinery 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.280
 all these strong-willed power qualities 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.470

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.390
 and material 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.280
 most of today 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.410
 young queens once men of no sponsorship 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.300
 assistance though as noted by the trainer 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.950
 the development of moto sports the state has become 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.180
 pay more attention to the means 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.920
 current gathering of participants 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.720
 financed by the budget 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.850
 Russian Motorcycle Federation 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.710
 supported by the Ministry of Sports for all 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.270
 order to choose those who are worthy 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.550
 to represent the country in the championships 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.120
 next year there are leaders 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.250
 teams and yes but there are athletes more 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.100
 low level of preparedness but in 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.800
 Basically these to them as a reference in 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.990
 others have a perspective and show themselves 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.600
 as if to the next stages of preparation 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.920
 that they were the same composition 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.060
 I consider it prestigious it is worthy 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.770
 on the basis of pre-competition 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.300
 training coaching staff will make 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.459
 adjustments to further work with korra 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.860
 shifts so that they reach even greater 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.610
 heights itself something sports career now 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.930
 Here I have 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.760
 top 10 goals at the world championships 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.970
 Russia has already won three times 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.950
 a little bit wrong level therefore grows 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.350
 international prospects for the future 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.210
