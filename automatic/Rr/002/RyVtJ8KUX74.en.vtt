00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.060
 horizontal 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.980
 and take the contact only on the end to her and then near is the phase 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.700
 this is the horse's neck and it is in this phase that the horse starts to give 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.970
 his head in the vertical position da starts to work the vertebrae here 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.860
 caballÃ©

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.280

 happy raul of his soul 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.840
 according to he said he is only reins hip hop here will happen more or less four 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.840
 fingers above the meeting of the horse the athlete 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.560
 through its value 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.409
 both already work the horse on the left dead his sister rage and buy a 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.409
 put only the right rein family 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.220
 go to the center theme na 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.370
 to protest 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.140
 He did not tie and now look for shit if the horse had the currents and 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.240
 make the lease contact from outside prepare because it is the rein 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.850
 the exterior that rejects on love, although it is what must be done o'neal 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.240
 alcolea we remove the rope dale a little rope and lose lowered a little 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.410
 rope and the outer rein has no contacts if we then re-cut the 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.910
 rope the psoe picks up the rope picks up the last areco agreement 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.850
 we take contact on the rope and the horse little by little returns to have 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.830
 contact on the rein is to make the species this is just to explain the 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.860
 first lessons that are given with the fixed reins seat should be made of this 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.390
