00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 my name is Dmitry I would like to do 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.779
 small review on razer keyboard 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.760
 The black widow 2013 version of xpeke is also on 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.940
 the market has version of ultimate kcl 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.559
 distinguished by the presence of backlight as well 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.310
 price and the price they have is 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.910
 the price difference is more accurate to insert it 100 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:23.810
 or 120 30 dollars but depending on 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.260
 store and more precisely the greed of stores 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.560
 yusbi yusb hub microphone output headphones 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.110
 also present on this keyboard 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.070
 so I want to beat off the first one 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.140
 assembly build quality is generally beautiful 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.730
 nowhere creaks nowhere not this not 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.390
 backlash and the like here 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.850
 accordingly if you are straight 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.360
 cork law to hrenachit fans of ulta 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.620
 there may and that tales creak 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.840
 2 is the weight of you keyboard just like that 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.539
 just do not move here let's say 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.340
 need to attach let's say enough 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.570
 normal amount to her 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.900
 move even if you have a rug 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.990
 but I will not talk about what's here 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.880
 cherry mx blue who speak the same 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:21.210
 Type under print but connect here 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.960
 heated for me common cerebro you for 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.970
 games are generally perfect let's say I played 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:33.960
 from a friend on a stalker right up to this 7g in my 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.939
 and g7 I absolutely did not like it to 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.250
 Firstly the buttons on the steelseries are very 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.060
 tight and hard lived that is she 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.409
 there need a little more sales 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.100
 make an effort to click on this 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.540
 button how much of the buttons yes here as well 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.360
 I would like to notice tons of forums read 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.869
 on many what if very very fast 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.560
 press the keyboard yes you can 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.090
 skip places a few actions and 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.119
 no wonder that you can skip where 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.180
 happy at that speed right if u 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.160
 you there have been there for a thousand 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.020
 it is impossible to digest itself 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.720
 Koreans or stones 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.840
 where are there any more japanese koreans 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.500
 legs so from zadroty say so yes here 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:27.150
 i can demonstrate 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:31.920
 that is, as if immediately dwell yes 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.950
 that's all pretty easy 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.650
 pressed give everything ok let's say so 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.150
 in this plan 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.170
 also before the candle 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.930
 loud but discomfort neither me nor have 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.020
 my parents who sleep by son in 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.620
 neighboring bedroom does not cause 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.590
 absolutely i cant even say 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.130

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.670
 whether moto or something else here namatame 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.130
 parents are very awake 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.510

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.020
 where to sleep for the like this is here on 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.080
 sounds 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.950
 the keyboard itself they have zero reaction 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.920
 never slept and slept so if 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.140
 for your sake if you have a computer 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.660
 more than ten years then we say you have there 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.580
 parents next door 5 to who them 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.350
 absolutely immediately tell him absolutely 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.570
 don't give a damn what is there to when you have there 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.040
 the keyboard will be 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.440
 because they won't hear it here 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.459
 years already straight from the noise of the cooler yes there on 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.660
 computer there fridge everyones there 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.370
 gadgets are the same degree 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.380
 accustomed to that he really does not care 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.450
 who's your keyboard there will be glee 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:53.550
 loudness that's what i wanted 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.660
 note also i would like to develop about 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:00.810
 plastic dutton mat plastic matt 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:04.709
 no longer slips already said watched 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.850
 there in the reviews there from these that downloaded 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.690
 what is not really brand 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:13.770
 horseradish there he marks and brand brush clean out 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.200
 its practically impossible only later 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.070
 cities you are already watching the entire keyboard 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.130
 let's say so the first spraying layer which 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:26.630
 mostly gets dirty yes she will merge you 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.580
 in one of each monolithic light first 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:34.160
 whether markn will not give a damn about marks 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.570
 shorter and so on here what else 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.930
 can answer 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.980
 software and not so I would like to talk more 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:48.590
 about software starting with 20 software in real 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:52.540
 shit, that's macro macros on 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:59.870
 keyboard which language can be pressed 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:05:02.330
 for a hundred button fn f9 disgusting 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.520
 it's just easier to manually fill them in 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.930
 20 synapse that is better then the work 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.760
 is if valuable per day is it that is 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.090
 enable magician auto start 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.880
 just fda here is the computer button lit 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:21.410
 here and make it a little definite 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:28.310
 the number of macros there is valid from 20 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:31.610
 from 20 in short let's say so click and yes the case 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:36.250
 Yamakasi data from simok time he push 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:38.680
 again etc. on at 9 here he write them down and 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.450
 he will write fucking 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.360
 very very long here it is real 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:51.880
 unrealistically long will record minutes 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.880
 five is exactly literally that is 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.100
 that is, well, like sony macros, it is oil 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.700
 it is better 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:05.090
 how exactly for contests avtomaks 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.680
 automatic recording of macros here 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.340
 I do not know if someone can work faster 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:16.360
 but they work exactly for me 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:19.400
 still answer this keyboard then 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:23.650
 say more precisely well keyboard medicine 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.830
 where much like the buttons here 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.620
 good ones 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.680
 the males themselves candles doing sbu me very 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.180
 I liked it here to type in them 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.120
 generally fine 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.660
 I just recently did not place a couple on defended 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.150
 diploma 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:42.710
 I scored 140 sheets for you 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.420
 stopped I think you attach what is 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:48.200
 143 so I took it literally 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:55.220
 get better one and a half days court say so 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:57.470
 that is, for hours 40 you can fire 40 to 630 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:05.050
 let's say then 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:10.460
 here at transition from a membrane to mechanics 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:12.800
 a little discomfort at first here but 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:17.450
 with time literally in 2-3 days 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.370
 this discomfort is gone also present 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:22.580
 you will know the multimedia buttons 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:25.010
 like, well, like I wanted everything 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.050
 I wanted to say to the face 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.900
 thank you bye 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:33.170
 still rolling and then I would not want to 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:36.260
 do a small review on 35 somewhere 

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.780
 about five minutes lies down ie we are 35 mouse 

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:45.040
