bomb is only short the animations kind

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.779 
bomb is only short the animations kind
of<00:02:02.780> repeat<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.110> bit<00:02:03.289> but<00:02:03.530> it's<00:02:03.979> only<00:02:04.159> short<00:02:04.520> of<00:02:04.700> a

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
of repeat a bit but it's only short of a

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.820 
of repeat a bit but it's only short of a
minute<00:02:05.060> well<00:02:05.299> that's<00:02:05.450> what<00:02:05.569> it<00:02:05.690> does<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.110> of

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
minute well that's what it does and of

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.889 
minute well that's what it does and of

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
throw and it'll stick to the ground now

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.720 
throw and it'll stick to the ground now
you<00:02:11.630> need<00:02:12.110> someone<00:02:12.680> or<00:02:12.950> something<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.580> walk

over it if it to actually blow up and
again<00:02:17.390> it's<00:02:17.630> very<00:02:17.690> useful<00:02:18.110> when<00:02:18.349> you<00:02:18.590> get<00:02:18.739> into

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
any sticky situations so there we go and

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.710 
any sticky situations so there we go and
you<00:02:22.310> can<00:02:22.459> plant<00:02:22.730> them<00:02:22.819> around<00:02:23.060> your<00:02:23.239> house<00:02:23.420> and

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
if it wants to just try to break in

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.420 
if it wants to just try to break in

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
much more efficient and it does turn to

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.569 
much more efficient and it does turn to
damage<00:02:39.440> like<00:02:39.620> it's<00:02:39.769> killing<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.130> sheep<00:02:40.430> in

grass<00:02:53.840> block<00:02:54.079> butterbur<00:02:54.980> battering<00:02:55.370> is

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
grass block butterbur battering is

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.630 
grass block butterbur battering is
extremely<00:02:55.940> useful<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:57.620> hook<00:02:57.799> it's<00:02:58.310> meant

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
extremely useful and the hook it's meant

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.160 
extremely useful and the hook it's meant
to<00:02:58.760> hold<00:02:58.880> items<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.660> you'll<00:02:59.750> get<00:02:59.900> dragged

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
to hold items and you'll get dragged

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.349 
to hold items and you'll get dragged
towards<00:03:00.350> there<00:03:00.799> again<00:03:01.609> I<00:03:01.639> think<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.180> just

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
towards there again I think you just

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.479 
towards there again I think you just
need<00:03:02.510> string<00:03:02.930> for<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.319> but<00:03:03.799> I<00:03:03.829> just<00:03:03.980> can't<00:03:04.340> get

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
need string for it but I just can't get

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.520 
need string for it but I just can't get
it<00:03:04.609> to<00:03:04.760> work<00:03:04.959> maybe<00:03:05.959> it's<00:03:06.230> something<00:03:06.380> I've

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
it to work maybe it's something I've

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.099 
it to work maybe it's something I've
done<00:03:06.739> wrong<00:03:06.950> but<00:03:07.569> you<00:03:08.569> just<00:03:08.690> kind<00:03:08.870> of<00:03:08.900> hook

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
done wrong but you just kind of hook

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.830 
done wrong but you just kind of hook
onto<00:03:09.400> items<00:03:10.400> but<00:03:10.639> I'm<00:03:10.760> just<00:03:11.090> not<00:03:11.299> so<00:03:11.540> sure<00:03:11.569> if

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
onto items but I'm just not so sure if

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.050 
onto items but I'm just not so sure if
you<00:03:11.930> can<00:03:12.109> yet<00:03:12.410> he<00:03:13.190> got<00:03:13.459> it<00:03:13.579> working<00:03:13.970> the

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
you can yet he got it working the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
make just CNT and some clay I mean the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.539 
make just CNT and some clay I mean the
last<00:03:36.560> one<00:03:36.769> this<00:03:36.859> one's<00:03:37.069> a<00:03:37.160> bit<00:03:37.280> more<00:03:37.400> difficult

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
last one this one's a bit more difficult

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.129

because you need to get the eyes you
need<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.380> pick<00:03:39.530> so<00:03:39.769> you<00:03:39.859> can<00:03:39.980> actually<00:03:40.100> break

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
need to pick so you can actually break

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.850 
need to pick so you can actually break
the<00:03:40.549> ice<00:03:40.819> and<00:03:41.150> get<00:03:41.330> the<00:03:41.420> block<00:03:41.659> so<00:03:42.560> we're

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
the ice and get the block so we're

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.130
