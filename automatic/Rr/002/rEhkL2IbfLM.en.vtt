a<00:02:39.959> tear<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.320> lab<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:40.769> after<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.100> it's<00:02:41.340> been

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
a tear of lab but after that it's been

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
running fine and I'm actually very very

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.430

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
the theme of it I think on it starts off

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.270 
the theme of it I think on it starts off
on<00:02:48.780> turquoise<00:02:49.170> which<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:50.390> videos<00:02:52.280> but

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
on turquoise which is videos but

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.600 
on turquoise which is videos but
fortunately<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:54.540> dark<00:02:54.810> theme<00:02:55.080> looks<00:02:55.890> just

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
fortunately the dark theme looks just

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.860 
fortunately the dark theme looks just
like<00:02:56.819> what<00:02:56.940> we've<00:02:57.060> come<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.239> expect<00:02:57.390> out<00:02:57.810> of

0.68<00:03:12.690> alpha<00:03:13.079> so<00:03:13.290> for<00:03:13.440> an<00:03:13.500> alpha<00:03:13.799> i'd<00:03:13.950> say<00:03:14.190> that

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
0.68 alpha so for an alpha i'd say that

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.810 
0.68 alpha so for an alpha i'd say that
this<00:03:14.430> is<00:03:14.489> actually<00:03:14.940> very<00:03:15.360> stable<00:03:15.930> amp<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.820> and

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
this is actually very stable amp and and

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.640 
this is actually very stable amp and and
it's<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.180> another<00:03:18.660> strong<00:03:18.989> contender<00:03:19.410> in<00:03:19.500> the
