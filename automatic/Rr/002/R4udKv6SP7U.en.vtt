00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 many times 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.210
 we think 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.210
 in our physique 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.590
 makes us be 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.590
 better than others 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.520
 many times we pretend that a physicist 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.039
 worked up 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.600
 with physical 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:31.840
 overdeveloped a tilted physicist 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.920
 without excessively toned fat 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.930
 even 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.300
 is the excessively hypertrophied 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.460
 everyone likes 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.850
 we think that makes us better 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.850
 superior to others 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.350
 It is normal 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.820
 Above all we will tell when we are 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.380
 young when we started with this 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.920
 sport 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.420
 look at others over your shoulder 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.420
 but as I said many times 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.259
 in the end we have to realize that 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.259
 we live in a society 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.770
 where taking care 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:19.240
 It is imperative to improve our 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.740
 image and to enable the relationship or 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.700
 relationships with others 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.960
 You are going to find me a job, it's easy 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.320
 especially girls looking for a 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.130
 girl 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.860
 with a good appearance 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.649
 before one who is overweight 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.479
 that you have experienced many like 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.330
 that the guys have also experienced 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:47.170
 that a neat guy 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:50.140
 good looking is always more appetizing 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.450
 for companies that one when you have 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.010
 so good image and some will tell me good 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.690
 to work as a mechanic also 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.210
 maybe even 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.330
 but 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.409
 what you have to understand is that having 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.229
 a physicist 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.539
 work in the gym without very fat 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.840
 Muscular or girls who have a physical 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.840
 spectacular 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.840
 although the girl is another topic especially 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.019
 the boys do not think that's why 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.180
 people will respect you more think that 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.670
 the envy 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.500
 often wakes up when we have 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.000
 something close that leaves us in evidence 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.970
 since this program we have never 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.350
 tried that people obese that the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.100
 people 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.100
 that does not have a good physical appearance 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.100
 objectively 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.680
 let yourself be left on the couch and stop 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.720
 do a cardiovascular job a 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.160
 training and a proper diet not 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.350
 only to improve its image but to 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.760
 improve your health in this program not 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.960
 we despise anyone essentially 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.150
 we try to mobilize 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:07.569
 to this part of society that is the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.180
 majority part to realize 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.489
 and in physical activity and good 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.069
 feeding is imperative for 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:19.180
 make sure not only the future 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.180
 but the present 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.750
 and with that I mean 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.700
 that all of you who are very strong 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.470
 you have very good physics of perspective 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.400
 bodybuilder or the people that we understand 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.750
 of the sector do not think that's why 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.060
 I will respect you more often 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.060
 you will even have more criticism or you will have 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.549
 even more distancing on the part of 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.040
 friends even from relatives not very very 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.360
 nearby because the nearby are usually 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.370
 those are not usually more 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.159
 condescending but 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.500
 continue with what you think you are already 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.940
 on the right track and although many times 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.940
 the society tries 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.490
 of the large size models for 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:08.660
 demonstrate that women with fats are 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.340
 precious we know that women who 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.960
 we like are those that have little fat 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.110
 good forms already worked at the gym 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.600
 dieting 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.190
 with that I want to say to those of you who are 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.300
 little more muscular you can find it 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.470
 a little with what happens with the guys 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.930
 that you also understand that your 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.670
 caixa transvestite compete and that 'to 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.030
 who you have to like is yours 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.940
 partner 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.560
 those two judges things score 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.790
 the people on the street do not understand that this 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.160
 we do for a competitive eagerness 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.990
 and that many times the body that one 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.990
 he has is not the one who likes 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.660
 to the people 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.020
 but yes that is what it has to have 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.350
 to win or to try we continue in 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.350
 the problem
