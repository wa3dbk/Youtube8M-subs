heli<00:00:25.230> but<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.039> wanted<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.609> at<00:00:26.730> least<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.480> a

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
heli but I wanted to at least do just a

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.660 
heli but I wanted to at least do just a
quick<00:00:27.630> test<00:00:28.289> with<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> directly<00:00:29.130> mounted<00:00:29.369> to

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
quick test with the directly mounted to

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.880 
quick test with the directly mounted to
the<00:00:29.699> frame<00:00:30.060> zip<00:00:30.869> tie<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.109> realize<00:00:31.560> that's<00:00:31.710> not

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
the frame zip tie I realize that's not

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.680 
the frame zip tie I realize that's not
the<00:00:32.130> best<00:00:32.309> way<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.550> do<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:32.940> but<00:00:33.210> normally

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the best way to do this but normally

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.780 
the best way to do this but normally
like<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:34.469> Mike<00:00:34.649> UAV<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.160> others<00:00:35.520> when<00:00:35.760> I

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
like with Mike UAV and others when I

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.729 
like with Mike UAV and others when I
first<00:00:36.180> get<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.480> frame<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.750> build<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.410> mount

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
first get a frame and build it I mount

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.619 
first get a frame and build it I mount
the<00:00:37.800> camera<00:00:38.040> directly<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> quad<00:00:39.149> with<00:00:39.480> no

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
the camera directly to the quad with no

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.360 
the camera directly to the quad with no
vibration<00:00:40.200> dampening<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.219> how<00:00:41.340> it

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
vibration dampening just to see how it

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.250 
vibration dampening just to see how it
looks<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.420> I'll<00:00:42.480> take<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.780> up<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> quick

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
looks so I'll take it up for a quick

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.810 
looks so I'll take it up for a quick
maiden<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:44.070> we'll<00:00:44.190> take<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.399> look<00:00:44.579> at<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
maiden and then we'll take a look at the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.729 
maiden and then we'll take a look at the
footage<00:00:45.000> now<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.989> little<00:00:46.110> bit<00:00:46.350> windy<00:00:46.649> in

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
footage now it's a little bit windy in

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.700 
footage now it's a little bit windy in
Austin<00:00:47.160> today<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.610> 28<00:00:48.239> degrees<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:48.989> not<00:00:49.620> going

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
Austin today and 28 degrees so not going

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.860 
Austin today and 28 degrees so not going
to<00:00:49.829> stay<00:00:50.010> outside<00:00:50.190> too<00:00:50.700> long<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.780> know

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
to stay outside too long but you know

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.119 
to stay outside too long but you know
enough<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.260> get<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.440> couple<00:00:52.680> minutes<00:00:53.010> of

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
enough to get a couple minutes of

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.479 
enough to get a couple minutes of
footage<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.640> then<00:00:53.789> bring<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.780> back<00:00:54.809> down<00:00:55.489> okay

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
footage and then bring it back down okay

footage and then bring it back down okay
we're<00:00:56.640> waiting<00:00:56.730> for<00:00:56.910> good<00:00:57.149> satellite

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
we're waiting for good satellite

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.459 
we're waiting for good satellite
coverage<00:00:57.920> when<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.070> have<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.430> will<00:00:59.699> arm<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
coverage when we have it will arm and

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:07.200 
coverage when we have it will arm and
take<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.590> up<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> air

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:15.940 

see<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.930> wind<00:01:08.140> picking<00:01:08.500> up<00:01:08.590> a<00:01:08.740> little<00:01:08.979> bit

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.029 

I'll<00:01:16.430> just<00:01:16.759> do<00:01:16.939> a<00:01:16.969> quick<00:01:17.210> 360<00:01:18.079> rotation<00:01:18.590> view

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
I'll just do a quick 360 rotation view

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.069 
I'll just do a quick 360 rotation view
will<00:01:19.670> just<00:01:19.880> spin<00:01:20.149> it<00:01:20.180> around<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.869> then<00:01:20.899> we'll

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
will just spin it around and then we'll

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:31.030 
will just spin it around and then we'll
bring<00:01:21.289> it<00:01:21.439> back<00:01:21.619> down

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.960

Oh
we<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.780> lost<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.140> foam<00:01:36.050> vibration<00:01:37.050> thought

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
we just lost the foam vibration thought

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.070 
we just lost the foam vibration thought
we<00:01:37.650> lost<00:01:37.800> the<00:01:38.040> battery<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:39.330> we<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.660> lost<00:01:39.840> one

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
we lost the battery but we just lost one

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.930 
we lost the battery but we just lost one
of<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.260> foam<00:01:40.650> vibration<00:01:41.430> dampeners<00:01:43.670> that<00:01:44.670> sit

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
of the foam vibration dampeners that sit

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.760 
of the foam vibration dampeners that sit
on<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.180> landing<00:01:45.540> gear<00:01:45.840> that's<00:01:46.440> always<00:01:46.650> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
on the landing gear that's always a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.500 
on the landing gear that's always a
little<00:01:46.920> nerve-racking<00:01:53.060> so<00:01:54.060> let's<00:01:54.210> go<00:01:54.300> take<00:01:54.450> a

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
little nerve-racking so let's go take a

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:42.789 
little nerve-racking so let's go take a
look<00:01:54.660> at<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.870> footage

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.110 

okay<00:02:43.799> so<00:02:43.859> let's<00:02:44.189> talk<00:02:44.250> about<00:02:44.400> what<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.819> learned

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
okay so let's talk about what I learned

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.059 
okay so let's talk about what I learned
with<00:02:45.359> the<00:02:45.480> backyard<00:02:45.930> made<00:02:46.170> now<00:02:46.439> that<00:02:46.650> wasn't<00:02:47.010> a

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
with the backyard made now that wasn't a

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.369 
with the backyard made now that wasn't a
very<00:02:47.250> long<00:02:47.519> flight<00:02:47.819> nor<00:02:48.359> very<00:02:48.629> complicated<00:02:49.230> I

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
very long flight nor very complicated I

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.319 
very long flight nor very complicated I
just<00:02:49.620> took<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:49.859> up<00:02:50.040> spun<00:02:50.579> it<00:02:50.700> around<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.239> then

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
just took it up spun it around and then

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.660 
just took it up spun it around and then
brought<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.569> back<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:52.079> but<00:02:52.680> these<00:02:53.159> guys<00:02:53.400> you

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
brought it back in but these guys you

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.520 
brought it back in but these guys you
definitely<00:02:54.090> need<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.299> mount<00:02:54.480> those<00:02:54.780> on<00:02:55.079> this

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
definitely need to mount those on this

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.809 
definitely need to mount those on this
thing<00:02:55.739> came<00:02:55.890> falling<00:02:56.129> to<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.459> ground<00:02:56.489> I

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
thing came falling to the ground I

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.429 
thing came falling to the ground I
thought<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.150> was<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.420> lipo<00:02:57.780> because<00:02:58.079> I've<00:02:58.230> had

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
thought it was the lipo because I've had

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.530 
thought it was the lipo because I've had
a<00:02:58.709> lipo<00:02:59.189> fall<00:02:59.430> out<00:02:59.549> of<00:02:59.579> my<00:02:59.700> quad<00:03:00.000> before<00:03:00.389> and

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
a lipo fall out of my quad before and

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.020 
a lipo fall out of my quad before and
it's<00:03:00.629> not<00:03:00.840> pretty<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.709> maybe<00:03:02.250> make<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.670> sure

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
it's not pretty so maybe make the sure

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.240 
it's not pretty so maybe make the sure
those<00:03:03.239> are<00:03:03.389> zip-tied<00:03:03.650> now<00:03:04.650> regarding<00:03:05.159> the

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
those are zip-tied now regarding the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.890 
those are zip-tied now regarding the
video<00:03:05.519> footage<00:03:05.760> there<00:03:06.299> was<00:03:06.420> definitely<00:03:06.750> more

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
video footage there was definitely more

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.869 
video footage there was definitely more
jello<00:03:07.230> than<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.620> expected<00:03:07.769> for<00:03:08.459> those<00:03:08.639> of<00:03:08.760> you

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
jello than I expected for those of you

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.280 
jello than I expected for those of you
have<00:03:09.030> followed<00:03:09.359> my<00:03:09.480> channel<00:03:09.870> you'll<00:03:10.079> have

have followed my channel you'll have
seen<00:03:10.530> all<00:03:10.829> sorts<00:03:11.099> of<00:03:11.280> experiment<00:03:11.939> with<00:03:12.090> the

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
seen all sorts of experiment with the

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.990 
seen all sorts of experiment with the

TBS and my gopro hero2 and just working
with<00:03:15.239> vibration<00:03:15.780> dampening<00:03:16.230> it's<00:03:16.530> definitely

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
with vibration dampening it's definitely

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.429 
with vibration dampening it's definitely
not<00:03:17.129> recommended<00:03:17.849> to<00:03:18.000> mount<00:03:18.959> your<00:03:19.260> GoPro

when I first get a frame and dry it out

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.619 
when I first get a frame and dry it out
just<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.769> get<00:03:25.919> a<00:03:25.950> feel<00:03:26.189> for<00:03:26.609> what<00:03:27.510> the

with some techniques to hopefully get

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.319 
with some techniques to hopefully get
this<00:03:45.120> video<00:03:45.450> more<00:03:46.109> vibration<00:03:46.859> free<00:03:47.329> this

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
this video more vibration free this

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.379 
this video more vibration free this
thing<00:03:48.599> flies<00:03:48.840> incredible<00:03:49.440> partially<00:03:50.040> due<00:03:50.250> to

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
thing flies incredible partially due to

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.129 
thing flies incredible partially due to
the<00:03:51.389> Naza<00:03:51.629> and<00:03:52.049> its<00:03:52.680> capabilities<00:03:53.549> but

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
the Naza and its capabilities but

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.899 
the Naza and its capabilities but
definitely<00:03:55.139> a<00:03:55.199> good<00:03:55.409> build<00:03:55.680> once<00:03:56.400> again<00:03:56.579> the
