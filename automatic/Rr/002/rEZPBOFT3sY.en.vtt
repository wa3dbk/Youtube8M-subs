00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
pocket really isn't that small it is

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.630 
pocket really isn't that small it is
just<00:04:15.380> angled<00:04:15.860> so<00:04:16.070> it's<00:04:16.220> kind<00:04:16.400> of<00:04:16.430> like<00:04:16.580> a

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
just angled so it's kind of like a

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
triangular pocket so I could probably

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.320 
triangular pocket so I could probably
fit<00:04:19.790> my<00:04:20.030> cell<00:04:20.330> phone<00:04:20.540> in<00:04:20.690> here<00:04:22.030> but<00:04:23.030> that's

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
fit my cell phone in here but that's

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.720 
fit my cell phone in here but that's
probably<00:04:24.140> about<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:25.100> maybe<00:04:25.310> some<00:04:25.580> loose

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
probably about it maybe some loose

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.910
