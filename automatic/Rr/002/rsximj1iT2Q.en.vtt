flashed<00:00:20.390> but<00:00:21.390> what<00:00:21.570> they<00:00:21.690> did<00:00:21.900> was<00:00:21.930> instead<00:00:22.380> of

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
flashed but what they did was instead of

the flat roof we can see that they

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.749 
the flat roof we can see that they
tucked<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.929> modified<00:01:31.770> underneath<00:01:32.639> the

tucked the modified underneath the

tucked the modified underneath the
siding<00:01:33.090> which<00:01:33.209> is<00:01:33.329> good<00:01:33.539> but<00:01:34.439> they<00:01:34.590> left<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
siding which is good but they left the

nasty area where the siding had been
tarred

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
tarred

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.109

it<00:01:40.020> would<00:01:40.139> have<00:01:40.229> been<00:01:40.319> nice<00:01:40.499> to<00:01:40.529> see<00:01:41.119> maybe

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
it would have been nice to see maybe

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.879 
it would have been nice to see maybe
take<00:01:42.329> an<00:01:42.419> angle<00:01:42.719> grinder<00:01:42.869> cut<00:01:43.349> that<00:01:43.560> put<00:01:43.770> some

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:43.889 
take an angle grinder cut that put some

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:46.039 
take an angle grinder cut that put some
turn<00:01:44.159> bar<00:01:44.429> there<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.999> finish<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.810> up<00:01:45.869> a

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
turn bar there and finish that up a

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.739 
turn bar there and finish that up a
little<00:01:46.289> nicer<00:01:46.649> way<00:01:46.999> especially<00:01:47.999> up<00:01:48.119> here<00:01:48.149> or

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:48.749 
little nicer way especially up here or

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:51.379 
little nicer way especially up here or
they<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.109> took<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.520> siding<00:01:51.060> had<00:01:51.179> just

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:51.389 
they just took the the siding had just

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:54.040 
they just took the the siding had just
nailed<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.380> with<00:01:52.529> roofing<00:01:52.889> nails

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
nailed it in with roofing nails

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.160 
nailed it in with roofing nails
here<00:01:54.680> I<00:01:54.710> don't<00:01:54.860> know<00:01:55.100> what<00:01:55.340> they<00:01:55.490> did<00:01:55.550> but<00:01:55.970> it's

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
here I don't know what they did but it's

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.100 
here I don't know what they did but it's
it's<00:01:57.170> really<00:01:57.590> ugly<00:01:58.510> again<00:01:59.510> we<00:01:59.660> can<00:01:59.840> see<00:01:59.990> the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
it's really ugly again we can see the

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.350 
it's really ugly again we can see the
back<00:02:00.290> of<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.560> chimney<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.820> see<00:02:02.030> where<00:02:02.210> they

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
back of the chimney to see where they

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.340 
back of the chimney to see where they
just<00:02:02.570> tarred<00:02:03.080> in<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.440> step<00:02:03.650> flashing<00:02:05.170> if<00:02:06.170> you

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
just tarred in the step flashing if you

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.690 
just tarred in the step flashing if you
look<00:02:06.560> here<00:02:06.770> there's<00:02:06.980> a<00:02:07.040> slope<00:02:07.310> in<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.520> roof

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
look here there's a slope in the roof

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.250 
look here there's a slope in the roof
where<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.180> sheathing<00:02:08.540> ended<00:02:08.900> they<00:02:09.020> didn't

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
where the sheathing ended they didn't
