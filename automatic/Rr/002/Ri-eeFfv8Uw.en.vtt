00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
my first time driving it and the more i

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.560 
my first time driving it and the more i
mounted<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.120> more<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.420> get<00:00:51.539> more

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
mounted the more and get more

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.000 
mounted the more and get more
comfortable<00:00:52.079> than<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> track<00:00:52.680> looks<00:00:52.829> like

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
comfortable than the track looks like

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.049 
comfortable than the track looks like
it's<00:00:53.129> drying<00:00:53.340> out<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.550> little<00:00:53.670> bit<00:00:53.789> more<00:00:53.940> today

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
it's drying out a little bit more today

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.209 
it's drying out a little bit more today
so<00:00:54.239> i<00:00:54.690> think<00:00:55.079> about<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.590> get<00:00:55.710> confident

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
so i think about you just get confident

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.979 
so i think about you just get confident
