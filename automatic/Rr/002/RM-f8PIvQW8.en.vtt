00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.680 

the<00:01:46.080> target's<00:01:46.650> been<00:01:46.800> neutralized<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.360> so

the target's been neutralized and so
have<00:01:48.870> those<00:01:49.110> who<00:01:49.290> stood<00:01:49.530> with<00:01:49.770> him<00:01:50.010> or<00:01:50.490> against

guess<00:01:55.650> some<00:01:55.860> people<00:01:55.890> were<00:01:56.340> spared<00:01:56.730> having<00:01:57.120> to

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270

guess some people were spared having to
deal<00:01:57.480> with<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.960> I'd<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.190> think<00:01:59.370> that<00:01:59.490> was

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
deal with it I'd like to think that was

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.580 
deal with it I'd like to think that was
it<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:01.110> last<00:02:01.320> mission<00:02:02.090> time<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.270> go<00:02:03.450> home<00:02:03.690> but
