00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
lot of times this is this is kind of

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.899 
lot of times this is this is kind of
tough<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.820> get<00:01:03.030> used<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.359> sometimes<00:01:03.660> because

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
tough to get used to sometimes because

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.190 
tough to get used to sometimes because
whereas<00:01:05.909> with<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.240> hi-hat<00:01:06.630> lift<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
whereas with the hi-hat lift on the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.950 
whereas with the hi-hat lift on the
upbeat<00:01:07.880> your<00:01:08.880> hi-hat<00:01:09.270> was<00:01:09.540> only<00:01:09.780> doing

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
upbeat your hi-hat was only doing

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.510 
upbeat your hi-hat was only doing
quarter<00:01:10.590> notes<00:01:10.830> right<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.250> was<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
quarter notes right so it was on the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.620 
quarter notes right so it was on the
downbeat<00:01:11.700> which<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> little<00:01:12.479> more

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
downbeat which is a little more

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.469 
downbeat which is a little more
intuitive<00:01:13.080> usually<00:01:13.549> and<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.880> usually<00:01:15.030> you

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
intuitive usually and it's usually you

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.999 
intuitive usually and it's usually you
know<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.869> helps<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:16.560> you're<00:01:16.770> usually

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
know it helps because you're usually

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.130 
know it helps because you're usually
going<00:01:17.189> or<00:01:17.700> at<00:01:17.729> least<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> examples<00:01:19.110> that

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
going or at least in the examples that

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.020 
going or at least in the examples that
we<00:01:19.320> did<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.680> were<00:01:19.799> doing<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> downbeat<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
we did we were doing the downbeat of the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.510 
we did we were doing the downbeat of the
kick<00:01:21.240> drum<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.689> same<00:01:21.869> time<00:01:22.400> so<00:01:23.400> you're

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
kick drum at the same time so you're

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.359 
kick drum at the same time so you're
kind<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.759> hitting<00:01:23.909> together<00:01:24.530> but<00:01:25.530> now<00:01:25.890> we're

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
kind of hitting together but now we're

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.890 
kind of hitting together but now we're
kind<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.759> getting<00:01:27.060> into<00:01:27.330> more<00:01:27.479> advanced<00:01:27.780> stuff

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
kind of getting into more advanced stuff

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.969 
kind of getting into more advanced stuff
and<00:01:28.380> we're<00:01:28.650> doing<00:01:30.110> hitting<00:01:31.110> separately<00:01:31.650> okay

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
and we're doing hitting separately okay

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.090 
and we're doing hitting separately okay
so<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.970> going<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.680> for<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> lot<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.009> you

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
so this is going to be for a lot of you

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.530 
so this is going to be for a lot of you
this<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.180> main<00:01:36.329> thing<00:01:36.509> that

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
this is going to be the main thing that

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.840 
this is going to be the main thing that
will<00:01:36.720> maybe<00:01:36.960> throw<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.290> off<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:38.729> be
