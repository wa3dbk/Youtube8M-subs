but that doesn't help you in the long

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.609 
but that doesn't help you in the long
run<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:14.969> costs<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.480> money<00:00:15.660> because<00:00:16.170> if

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
run and it costs you money because if

you were in a yellow in the first place

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.300 
you were in a yellow in the first place
you<00:00:18.750> will<00:00:18.960> probably<00:00:19.380> drop<00:00:19.650> back<00:00:19.890> down<00:00:20.100> again

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
you will probably drop back down again

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.580 
you will probably drop back down again
very<00:00:20.670> quickly<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.270> for<00:00:21.960> those<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.350> that

very quickly and for those of you that
are<00:00:22.740> like<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.400> my<00:00:23.609> team<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.330> only<00:00:24.480> thing

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
are like but my team is the only thing

that's holding me back in this élow I'm

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.630 
that's holding me back in this élow I'm
much<00:00:27.539> better<00:00:27.779> than<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.160> not<00:00:29.580> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
much better than this this is not the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.880 
much better than this this is not the
reason<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.630> were<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.929> whatever<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.590> low

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
reason that you were in whatever a low

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.680 
reason that you were in whatever a low
you're<00:00:32.040> at<00:00:32.160> right<00:00:32.369> now<00:00:32.430> now<00:00:33.239> there<00:00:33.570> will

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
you're at right now now there will

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.780 
you're at right now now there will
obviously<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:34.350> very<00:00:34.680> bad<00:00:34.890> teams<00:00:35.190> once<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.730> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
obviously be very bad teams once in a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.240 
obviously be very bad teams once in a
while<00:00:35.969> but<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.420> very<00:00:36.899> very<00:00:37.350> rarely<00:00:37.710> happens

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
while but this very very rarely happens

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.100 
while but this very very rarely happens
because<00:00:38.579> about<00:00:39.090> ninety<00:00:39.570> percent<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.989> your

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
because about ninety percent of your

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.590 
because about ninety percent of your
games<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.530> actually<00:00:41.190> winnable<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:42.329> saying

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
games are actually winnable not saying

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.510 
games are actually winnable not saying
that<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:42.930> easy<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.680> accomplish<00:00:43.950> because

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
that this is easy to accomplish because

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.630 
that this is easy to accomplish because
there<00:00:44.969> will<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.450> difficult<00:00:45.690> games<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.440> win

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
there will be difficult games to win

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.430 
there will be difficult games to win
however<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:48.210> can<00:00:48.239> win<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.079> by<00:00:49.200> playing

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
however you can win it by playing

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.250 
however you can win it by playing
without<00:00:49.739> mistakes<00:00:50.340> now<00:00:51.329> don't<00:00:51.960> pressure

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
without mistakes now don't pressure

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.139 
without mistakes now don't pressure
yourself<00:00:52.500> too<00:00:53.160> much<00:00:53.190> because<00:00:53.730> playing

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
yourself too much because playing

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.150 
yourself too much because playing
without<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.510> single<00:00:54.870> mistake<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.469> impossible

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
without a single mistake is impossible

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160 
without a single mistake is impossible
this<00:00:56.940> would<00:00:57.180> mean<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.660> miss<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> single

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
this would mean you can miss a single

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.260 
this would mean you can miss a single
minion<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.770> single<00:00:59.160> skill<00:00:59.370> shot<00:00:59.609> or<00:00:59.730> even<00:01:00.239> just

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
minion a single skill shot or even just

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.380 
minion a single skill shot or even just
mess<00:01:00.690> up<00:01:00.719> one<00:01:01.170> micro<00:01:01.649> movement<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.210> can

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
mess up one micro movement but you can

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.420 
mess up one micro movement but you can
try<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.870> make<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.379> flawless<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:04.860> possible

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
try to make it as flawless as possible

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.800 
try to make it as flawless as possible
by<00:01:05.580> nothing<00:01:06.060> else<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.450> practice<00:01:07.369> practice<00:01:08.369> is

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
by nothing else but practice practice is

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.600 
by nothing else but practice practice is

everything but there are also a few

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.969 
everything but there are also a few
tricks<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.360> make<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.659> easier<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.229> climb<00:01:13.409> faster

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
tricks to make it easier to climb faster

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.469 
tricks to make it easier to climb faster
and<00:01:14.159> those<00:01:14.490> tricks<00:01:14.820> I'll<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.119> showing<00:01:15.270> you

and those tricks I'll be showing you

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.510 
and those tricks I'll be showing you
right<00:01:15.750> now<00:01:15.990> trick<00:01:16.500> number<00:01:16.530> one<00:01:16.920> pick<00:01:17.490> a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
right now trick number one pick a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.190 
right now trick number one pick a
champion<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.180> stick<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.689> champion

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
champion and stick with that champion

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.320 
champion and stick with that champion
this<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.950> probably<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.490> most<00:01:20.549> important

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
this is probably the most important

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.109 
this is probably the most important
trick<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:22.200> very<00:01:22.710> hard<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> actually<00:01:23.340> gain<00:01:23.850> a

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
trick it's very hard to actually gain a

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.940 
trick it's very hard to actually gain a
low<00:01:24.240> as<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.810> stantly<00:01:25.200> play<00:01:25.500> different

low as you can stantly play different

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.880 
low as you can stantly play different
champions<00:01:26.430> why<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.030> ask<00:01:27.509> well<00:01:28.080> because<00:01:28.590> you

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
champions why you ask well because you

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.679

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
important there are so many people that

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.140 
important there are so many people that
farm<00:05:25.410> finding<00:05:25.890> the<00:05:25.980> early<00:05:26.310> game<00:05:26.520> and<00:05:26.760> in<00:05:27.000> the

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
they just don't farm anymore there is a

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.560 
they just don't farm anymore there is a

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
reason people in the LCS for example hit

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.950 
reason people in the LCS for example hit
240<00:05:34.410> s<00:05:34.650> at<00:05:34.800> twenty<00:05:35.070> minutes<00:05:35.340> and<00:05:35.460> still<00:05:35.669> hit

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
340 CS at 30 minutes they keep farming

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.700 
340 CS at 30 minutes they keep farming
and<00:05:39.419> if<00:05:39.510> you<00:05:39.600> keep<00:05:39.780> farming<00:05:40.140> you<00:05:40.320> keep<00:05:40.560> getting

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
and if you keep farming you keep getting

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.710 
and if you keep farming you keep getting
stronger<00:05:41.190> and<00:05:41.520> this<00:05:41.729> makes<00:05:41.910> it<00:05:42.060> easier<00:05:42.540> to

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
stronger and this makes it easier to

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.719 
stronger and this makes it easier to
carry<00:05:42.990> because<00:05:43.380> if<00:05:43.530> you<00:05:43.740> were<00:05:43.890> to<00:05:44.040> have<00:05:44.250> like<00:05:44.520> a

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
carry because if you were to have like a

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.580 
carry because if you were to have like a
hundred<00:05:45.030> CS<00:05:45.479> more<00:05:45.750> than<00:05:45.930> your<00:05:46.050> opponent<00:05:46.500> you

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
hundred CS more than your opponent you

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.320 
hundred CS more than your opponent you
will<00:05:46.710> obviously<00:05:47.280> be<00:05:47.550> stronger<00:05:48.030> than<00:05:48.150> him

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
will obviously be stronger than him

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.840 
will obviously be stronger than him
because<00:05:48.690> this<00:05:48.840> is<00:05:48.990> roughly<00:05:49.380> 2k<00:05:49.680> cash<00:05:50.130> and<00:05:50.430> that

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
because this is roughly 2k cash and that

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.090 
because this is roughly 2k cash and that
is<00:05:51.030> a<00:05:51.060> lot<00:05:51.510> of<00:05:51.540> stats<00:05:52.020> worth<00:05:52.290> of<00:05:52.500> money<00:05:52.650> so<00:05:53.040> to

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
is a lot of stats worth of money so to

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.130 
is a lot of stats worth of money so to
sum<00:05:53.370> it<00:05:53.400> up<00:05:53.550> pick<00:05:54.060> a<00:05:54.090> champion<00:05:54.570> you<00:05:54.690> love<00:05:54.900> and
