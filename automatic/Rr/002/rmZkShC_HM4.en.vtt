00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
petal dust and then to give it kind of a

petal dust and then to give it kind of a
shiny<00:02:04.070> look<00:02:04.250> I<00:02:04.610> held<00:02:04.940> it<00:02:05.119> over<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.780> teapot<00:02:06.229> and

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
and it adds a really nice finishing

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.090 
and it adds a really nice finishing
touch<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:15.500> would<00:02:15.620> just<00:02:15.860> add<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.430> wire<00:02:16.750> and

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
touch you would just add the wire and

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.880 
touch you would just add the wire and
there<00:02:19.100> is<00:02:19.220> your<00:02:19.370> peony
