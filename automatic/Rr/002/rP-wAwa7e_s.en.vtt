00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
off this look so the first things we're

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.920 
off this look so the first things we're
going<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.500> do<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.859> highlight<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.609> face

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
going to do is highlight the face

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.210 
going to do is highlight the face
anything<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.050> highlight<00:00:25.470> will<00:00:25.650> come<00:00:25.830> out<00:00:26.039> at

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
anything we highlight will come out at

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.730 
anything we highlight will come out at
us<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.210> why<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:27.599> highlight<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> under

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
us so this is why we highlight the under

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.650 
us so this is why we highlight the under
the<00:00:28.859> eyes<00:00:29.000> the<00:00:30.000> center<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.449> forehead

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
the eyes the center of the forehead

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.600 
the eyes the center of the forehead
bridge<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.470> nose<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.250> these<00:00:32.369> are<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
bridge of the nose so these are the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.840 
bridge of the nose so these are the
areas<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.000> we<00:00:33.180> want<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.420> bring<00:00:33.570> out<00:00:34.790> now<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
areas that we want to bring out now the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.639 
areas that we want to bring out now the
real<00:00:36.149> difference<00:00:36.329> between<00:00:36.750> clown<00:00:37.050> contouring

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
real difference between clown contouring

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.350 
real difference between clown contouring
and<00:00:37.860> regular<00:00:38.399> highlighting<00:00:38.790> contouring<00:00:38.940> is

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and regular highlighting contouring is

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.990 
and regular highlighting contouring is
the<00:00:39.690> addition<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.290> color<00:00:40.620> which<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.370> tends<00:00:41.820> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the addition of color which is tends to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.760 
the addition of color which is tends to
be<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.180> cream<00:00:42.510> will<00:00:42.719> be<00:00:42.809> adding<00:00:43.079> cream<00:00:43.410> color

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
be in cream will be adding cream color

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.920 
be in cream will be adding cream color
to<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> face<00:00:44.309> as<00:00:44.579> well<00:00:44.760> as<00:00:45.000> you'll<00:00:45.539> see<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:45.809> we

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
to the face as well as you'll see as we

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.290 
to the face as well as you'll see as we
go<00:00:46.170> along<00:00:46.399> so<00:00:47.399> now<00:00:47.579> we're<00:00:47.730> going<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.879> contour

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
go along so now we're going to contour

now<00:00:48.840> i'm<00:00:49.079> contouring<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.950> masculine<00:00:50.399> way

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700

now i'm contouring in a masculine way
which<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:50.969> following<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> cheekbone<00:00:52.020> and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
which is following the cheekbone and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.799 
which is following the cheekbone and
then<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.680> down<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.850> will<00:00:54.059> give<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.449> very

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
then going down this will give a very

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.720 
then going down this will give a very
masculine<00:00:55.289> look<00:00:55.590> if<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.920> do<00:00:56.070> not<00:00:56.160> want<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.520> do

maybe<00:01:43.930> even<00:01:44.200> a<00:01:44.350> sort<00:01:44.530> of<00:01:44.560> like<00:01:44.740> a<00:01:44.770> fuchsia

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
maybe even a sort of like a fuchsia

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.580 
maybe even a sort of like a fuchsia
actually<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.119> apply<00:01:46.570> this<00:01:46.630> on<00:01:46.930> top<00:01:47.320> of<00:01:47.500> this

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
actually and apply this on top of this

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.230 
actually and apply this on top of this
to<00:01:47.830> really<00:01:48.039> get<00:01:48.159> some<00:01:48.399> color<00:01:48.640> in<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:48.939> cheeks

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
to really get some color in the cheeks

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.090 
to really get some color in the cheeks
even<00:01:50.049> though<00:01:50.140> it<00:01:50.259> looks<00:01:50.289> quite<00:01:50.649> scary<00:01:51.009> I

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
even though it looks quite scary I

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.440 
even though it looks quite scary I
promise<00:01:51.550> you<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.789> whole<00:01:52.000> thing<00:01:52.179> will<00:01:52.330> be

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
promise you the whole thing will be

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.669 
promise you the whole thing will be
blended<00:01:52.899> in<00:01:53.050> and<00:01:53.259> more<00:01:53.560> look<00:01:53.800> like<00:01:54.460> skin<00:01:55.679> it's

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
blended in and more look like skin it's

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.109 
blended in and more look like skin it's
also<00:01:56.830> bearing<00:01:57.159> in<00:01:57.369> mind<00:01:57.399> that<00:01:57.610> you<00:01:57.759> do<00:01:57.940> need<00:01:58.090> to

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
also bearing in mind that you do need to

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.820 
also bearing in mind that you do need to
have<00:01:58.299> some<00:01:58.659> form<00:01:58.899> of<00:01:59.080> skill<00:01:59.350> in<00:01:59.500> terms<00:01:59.710> of

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
have some form of skill in terms of

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.800 
have some form of skill in terms of
blending<00:02:00.310> with<00:02:00.340> this<00:02:00.700> technique<00:02:01.090> because<00:02:01.690> it

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
blending with this technique because it

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.320 
blending with this technique because it
requires<00:02:02.170> a<00:02:02.380> lot<00:02:02.590> of<00:02:02.619> blending<00:02:03.209> we're<00:02:04.209> going

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
requires a lot of blending we're going

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.149 
requires a lot of blending we're going
to<00:02:04.390> be<00:02:04.479> using<00:02:04.509> a<00:02:04.959> Beauty<00:02:05.409> Blender<00:02:05.440> sponge<00:02:05.740> and

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
to be using a Beauty Blender sponge and

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.740 
to be using a Beauty Blender sponge and
we're<00:02:06.280> just<00:02:06.369> going<00:02:06.580> to<00:02:06.610> blur<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.090> edges<00:02:07.270> first

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
we're just going to blur the edges first

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.600 
we're just going to blur the edges first
before<00:02:08.229> we<00:02:08.350> even<00:02:08.440> get<00:02:08.619> into<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.920> foundation

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
before we even get into the foundation

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.490 
before we even get into the foundation
we're<00:02:09.729> just<00:02:09.880> going<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.060> blur<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:11.019> edges<00:02:11.140> so

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
we're just going to blur the edges so

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.440 
we're just going to blur the edges so
that<00:02:11.530> it's<00:02:11.739> easier<00:02:12.160> for<00:02:12.220> us<00:02:12.459> to<00:02:12.489> blend<00:02:12.910> we

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
that it's easier for us to blend we

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.910 
that it's easier for us to blend we
don't<00:02:13.540> take<00:02:13.900> them<00:02:14.080> away<00:02:14.319> we<00:02:14.530> just<00:02:14.709> want<00:02:14.860> to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
don't take them away we just want to

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:24.870 
don't take them away we just want to
soften<00:02:15.130> them

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.680 

you

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
you

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.890 
you
so<00:02:27.200> just<00:02:27.440> blend<00:02:27.710> them<00:02:27.980> lightly<00:02:28.790> tap<00:02:29.210> banks

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
so just blend them lightly tap banks

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.260 
so just blend them lightly tap banks
however<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:30.830> want<00:02:31.040> but<00:02:31.550> just<00:02:31.610> make<00:02:31.970> sure<00:02:32.000> that

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
however you want but just make sure that

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.120 
however you want but just make sure that
the<00:02:32.360> color<00:02:32.510> is<00:02:32.780> more<00:02:33.080> diffused<00:02:33.680> we're<00:02:34.010> going

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
the color is more diffused we're going

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.560 
the color is more diffused we're going
to<00:02:34.190> be<00:02:34.250> going<00:02:34.400> in<00:02:34.640> with<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:34.790> stippling<00:02:35.210> brush

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
to be going in with a stippling brush

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.390 
to be going in with a stippling brush
which<00:02:35.990> is<00:02:36.140> obviously<00:02:36.470> my<00:02:36.650> brush<00:02:36.950> but<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.250> can

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
which is obviously my brush but you can

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.270 
which is obviously my brush but you can
use<00:02:37.520> whatever<00:02:37.670> brush<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:38.240> have<00:02:38.390> at<00:02:38.480> hand<00:02:39.280> and

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
use whatever brush you have at hand and

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.250 
use whatever brush you have at hand and
we're<00:02:40.820> going<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.000> be<00:02:41.090> using<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.450> foundation<00:02:41.630> to

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
we're going to be using a foundation to

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.710 
we're going to be using a foundation to
just<00:02:42.680> blend<00:02:42.950> everything<00:02:43.280> amoled<00:02:44.120> everything

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
just blend everything amoled everything

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.990 
just blend everything amoled everything
into<00:02:45.110> one<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:46.040> there<00:02:46.190> you<00:02:46.340> go<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.550> can<00:02:46.790> pretty

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
into one so there you go you can pretty

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.600 
into one so there you go you can pretty
much<00:02:47.090> see<00:02:47.540> now<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:48.380> kind<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.680> final<00:02:49.070> effect<00:02:49.400> of

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
much see now the kind of final effect of

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.770 
much see now the kind of final effect of
this<00:02:49.790> blending<00:02:50.540> which<00:02:50.690> looks<00:02:51.020> pretty<00:02:51.140> scary

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
this blending which looks pretty scary

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.540 
this blending which looks pretty scary
so<00:02:53.780> what<00:02:54.050> we're<00:02:54.200> going<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.380> do<00:02:54.590> is<00:02:54.830> now<00:02:55.160> move<00:02:55.400> on

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
so what we're going to do is now move on

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.190 
so what we're going to do is now move on
to<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.760> foundation<00:02:56.060> with<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.570> stippling<00:02:56.900> brush

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
to the foundation with a stippling brush

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.350 
to the foundation with a stippling brush
I'm<00:02:57.530> using<00:02:57.590> a<00:02:58.040> spray<00:02:58.310> foundation<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.150> all<00:02:59.240> the

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
I'm using a spray foundation and all the

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.760 
I'm using a spray foundation and all the
information<00:02:59.810> is<00:02:59.900> in<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.080> description<00:03:00.110> bar

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
information is in the description bar

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.410 
information is in the description bar
below<00:03:00.800> but<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:01.670> can<00:03:01.820> use<00:03:01.940> whatever<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.360> have

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
below but you can use whatever you have

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.630 
below but you can use whatever you have
at<00:03:02.690> hand<00:03:02.920> now<00:03:03.920> you<00:03:03.980> can<00:03:04.160> see<00:03:04.370> that<00:03:04.520> I'm

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
at hand now you can see that I'm

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.570 
at hand now you can see that I'm
stippling<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.510> onto<00:03:05.960> the<00:03:06.080> skin<00:03:06.320> I'm<00:03:06.500> not<00:03:06.920> going

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
stippling it onto the skin I'm not going

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.130 
stippling it onto the skin I'm not going
in<00:03:07.670> circular<00:03:07.910> motions<00:03:08.600> because<00:03:08.780> I<00:03:08.900> don't<00:03:09.110> want

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
in circular motions because I don't want

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.600 
in circular motions because I don't want
to<00:03:09.290> cover<00:03:09.530> everything<00:03:10.100> I<00:03:10.310> don't<00:03:10.430> want<00:03:10.550> to

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
to cover everything I don't want to

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.220 
to cover everything I don't want to
remove<00:03:10.940> those<00:03:11.150> lines<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:11.660> just<00:03:11.870> want<00:03:12.020> to<00:03:12.110> blend

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
remove those lines I just want to blend

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.750 
remove those lines I just want to blend
them<00:03:12.410> in<00:03:12.560> which<00:03:12.920> is<00:03:13.040> why<00:03:13.250> I'm<00:03:13.430> doing<00:03:13.610> this

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
them in which is why I'm doing this

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.940 
them in which is why I'm doing this
stippling<00:03:14.270> motion<00:03:14.510> of<00:03:14.960> bouncing<00:03:15.470> which<00:03:15.830> is

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
stippling motion of bouncing which is

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.800 
stippling motion of bouncing which is
why<00:03:16.160> my<00:03:16.400> brush<00:03:16.640> was<00:03:16.820> created<00:03:17.390> with<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.570> long

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
why my brush was created with the long

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.900 
why my brush was created with the long
bristles<00:03:18.080> as<00:03:18.530> opposed<00:03:18.860> to<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.250> kind<00:03:19.460> of<00:03:19.580> inner

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
bristles as opposed to the kind of inner

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.020 
bristles as opposed to the kind of inner
short<00:03:20.210> ones<00:03:20.710> and<00:03:21.710> you<00:03:22.070> can<00:03:22.220> see<00:03:22.460> how<00:03:22.670> all<00:03:23.000> of

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
short ones and you can see how all of

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.270 
short ones and you can see how all of
that<00:03:23.180> color<00:03:23.570> is<00:03:23.840> starting<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.620> look<00:03:24.710> like<00:03:24.890> skin

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
that color is starting to look like skin

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.010 
that color is starting to look like skin
there's<00:03:25.730> still<00:03:25.970> definition<00:03:26.540> on<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:26.720> cheek

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
there's still definition on the cheek

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.930 
there's still definition on the cheek
you<00:03:27.530> can<00:03:27.680> still<00:03:27.890> see<00:03:28.100> some<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.430> contouring

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
you can still see some of the contouring

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.780 
you can still see some of the contouring
of<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.150> shadow<00:03:29.420> but<00:03:30.020> everything<00:03:30.560> is<00:03:30.770> as<00:03:31.280> one

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
of the shadow but everything is as one

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.670 
of the shadow but everything is as one
which<00:03:32.060> is<00:03:32.090> how<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:32.510> want<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:33.050> be<00:03:33.080> and<00:03:33.440> it

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
which is how you want it to be and it

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.770 
which is how you want it to be and it
does<00:03:33.950> require<00:03:34.190> some<00:03:34.430> practice<00:03:35.090> in<00:03:35.270> terms<00:03:35.630> of

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
does require some practice in terms of

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:43.600 
does require some practice in terms of
blending

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.490 

okay<00:03:44.360> so<00:03:44.420> we're<00:03:44.660> just<00:03:44.690> going<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:45.020> finish<00:03:45.230> off

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
okay so we're just going to finish off

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.070 
okay so we're just going to finish off
the<00:03:45.650> face<00:03:45.860> when<00:03:46.760> we<00:03:46.850> get<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.180> nose<00:03:47.480> contour

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
the face when we get to the nose contour

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.240 
the face when we get to the nose contour
it's<00:03:48.290> very<00:03:48.470> important<00:03:48.890> that<00:03:48.920> when<00:03:49.130> you're

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
it's very important that when you're

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.680 
it's very important that when you're
using<00:03:49.400> a<00:03:49.550> stippling<00:03:49.820> brush<00:03:50.090> that<00:03:50.300> you<00:03:50.420> go<00:03:50.570> in

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
using a stippling brush that you go in

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.390 
using a stippling brush that you go in
an<00:03:50.780> upward<00:03:51.050> motion<00:03:51.320> mainly<00:03:52.160> because<00:03:52.280> you

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
an upward motion mainly because you

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.550 
an upward motion mainly because you
don't<00:03:52.670> drag<00:03:53.120> any<00:03:53.480> of<00:03:53.690> that<00:03:53.810> contour<00:03:54.290> colored

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
don't drag any of that contour colored

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.950 
don't drag any of that contour colored
down<00:03:54.830> onto<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.430> face<00:03:55.640> so<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:56.540> want<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.810> really
