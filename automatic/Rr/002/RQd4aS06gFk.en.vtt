guess it sounds cool and beats but
pretty<00:01:33.990> hard<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.409> like<00:01:34.560> incorporate<00:01:35.189> it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
pretty hard to it like incorporate it

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.960 
pretty hard to it like incorporate it
into<00:01:35.460> different<00:01:35.820> beats<00:01:36.060> though<00:01:36.270> yeah

you want to put them closer and then and
set<00:02:11.740> up<00:02:11.860> like<00:02:12.010> blowing<00:02:12.280> out<00:02:12.490> like<00:02:12.790> super<00:02:13.300> super

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
set up like blowing out like super super

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.750 
set up like blowing out like super super
fast<00:02:13.870> you're<00:02:14.800> not<00:02:14.920> blowing<00:02:15.130> in<00:02:15.310> super<00:02:15.640> super

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
fast you're not blowing in super super

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.430 
fast you're not blowing in super super
fast<00:02:16.120> well<00:02:16.630> that's<00:02:16.750> what<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:16.990> have<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.110> do<00:02:17.290> but

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
fast well that's what you have to do but

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.230 
fast well that's what you have to do but
yet<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.650> like<00:02:17.800> picture<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:18.850> super<00:02:19.120> super

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
yet to like picture that super super

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.670 
yet to like picture that super super
close<00:02:19.540> together<00:02:19.870> like<00:02:20.110> while<00:02:20.290> you're<00:02:20.410> doing

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
close together like while you're doing

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.630 
close together like while you're doing
it<00:02:20.770> too<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.190> it's<00:02:21.370> just<00:02:21.460> so<00:02:22.210> it's<00:02:22.240> not<00:02:22.390> like

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
it too so it's just so it's not like

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.570 
it too so it's just so it's not like
it's<00:02:24.640> put<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:24.880> little<00:02:25.090> close<00:02:25.210> together<00:02:25.360> like

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.580 

yes<00:02:33.540> but<00:02:34.540> get<00:02:34.660> like<00:02:34.780> faster<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.170> faster<00:02:35.290> with

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
yes but get like faster and faster with

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.110 
yes but get like faster and faster with
it<00:02:35.740> but<00:02:35.920> don't<00:02:36.040> try<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.220> like<00:02:36.460> separate<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:36.970> so

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
it but don't try to like separate it so

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.180 
it but don't try to like separate it so
just<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:40.380> that's<00:02:41.380> pretty<00:02:41.620> much<00:02:41.709> how<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:41.920> do<00:02:42.070> it

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
just a that's pretty much how you do it

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.920 
just a that's pretty much how you do it
so<00:02:42.610> I'll<00:02:42.700> put<00:02:42.850> out<00:02:42.880> each<00:02:43.150> one<00:02:43.330> of<00:02:43.420> them<00:02:43.540> I<00:02:43.750> guess

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
so I'll put out each one of them I guess

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.479 
so I'll put out each one of them I guess
kind<00:02:44.230> of<00:02:44.320> in<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.470> beat<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.100> bits<00:02:45.280> name<00:02:45.370> would

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
kind of in a beat so the bits name would

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:57.449 
kind of in a beat so the bits name would
be<00:02:45.550> like<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:54.810> guess<00:02:55.920> terrible<00:02:56.920> but<00:02:57.100> I<00:02:57.130> guess

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
be like I guess terrible but I guess

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.990 
be like I guess terrible but I guess
that's<00:02:57.580> but<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:57.820> could<00:02:57.970> put<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.209> in<00:02:58.300> a<00:02:58.330> none

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
that's but you could put it in a none

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.410 
that's but you could put it in a none
before<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.860> M<00:03:00.860> word<00:03:01.100> liberal<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:01.790> guess<00:03:02.330> you

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
before the M word liberal I guess you

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.700 
before the M word liberal I guess you
don't<00:03:02.540> really<00:03:02.690> like<00:03:02.990> put<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:03.500> Chile

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
don't really like put that in Chile

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.130 
don't really like put that in Chile
Cantrell<00:03:04.070> B<00:03:04.220> it's<00:03:04.400> more<00:03:04.610> like<00:03:04.730> a--<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.900> keep

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
Cantrell B it's more like a-- to keep

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.950 
Cantrell B it's more like a-- to keep
like<00:03:06.410> they<00:03:07.130> like<00:03:07.280> have<00:03:07.550> Gooden<00:03:07.880> like<00:03:08.090> rough

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
like they like have Gooden like rough

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.070 
like they like have Gooden like rough
control<00:03:09.440> so<00:03:09.800> like<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.460> sounds<00:03:10.760> like<00:03:11.060> just<00:03:11.960> like

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
control so like it sounds like just like

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.150 
control so like it sounds like just like
trying<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.320> put<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:12.560> into<00:03:12.740> a<00:03:12.770> beat<00:03:12.950> which<00:03:13.130> is

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
trying to put it into a beat which is

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.580 
trying to put it into a beat which is
probably<00:03:13.820> impossible<00:03:14.180> I<00:03:14.720> would<00:03:14.990> be<00:03:15.200> surprised

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
probably impossible I would be surprised

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:29.020 
probably impossible I would be surprised
he<00:03:16.190> died<00:03:26.560> like<00:03:27.560> that<00:03:27.800> and<00:03:28.100> then<00:03:28.220> I<00:03:28.610> guess<00:03:28.760> I<00:03:28.880> can

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
he died like that and then I guess I can

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.660 
he died like that and then I guess I can
be<00:03:29.060> a<00:03:29.150> beat<00:03:29.330> so<00:03:29.800> that's<00:03:30.800> all<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.010> got<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.580> uh

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
be a beat so that's all I got and uh

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.089 
be a beat so that's all I got and uh
