 with only one difference when singing 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.110

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.000
 petal with a hole 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.000

 smooth circle 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.930
 when I started to create 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.840

 using universal polymer 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.000
 glue in the center of the composition
