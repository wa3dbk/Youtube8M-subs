00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.899 
the replication right here which would
help<00:01:25.320> protect<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.130> corners<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.610> stuff<00:01:26.759> like

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
help protect the corners and stuff like

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.060 
help protect the corners and stuff like
that<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.119> as<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.540> know<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.350> phone<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.590> more

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
that and as you know the phone is more

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.530 
that and as you know the phone is more
susceptible<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.640> damage<00:01:29.850> when<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.329> dropped

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
susceptible to damage when it's dropped

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.300 
susceptible to damage when it's dropped
on<00:01:30.780> orbitz<00:01:31.259> corner<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.770> should<00:01:32.159> protect

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
on orbitz corner so that should protect

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.640 
on orbitz corner so that should protect
it<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:32.729> well<00:01:32.909> now<00:01:33.810> right<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.290> have<00:01:34.320> this
