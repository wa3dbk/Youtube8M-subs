tanks for a while usually for a

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.230 
tanks for a while usually for a
territory<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.160> push<00:00:26.310> out<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.609> need<00:00:26.760> around<00:00:27.029> 10

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
tanks and that's going to take him a

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.150 
tanks and that's going to take him a
long<00:00:29.340> long<00:00:29.609> time<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.000> produce<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:31.590> that

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
long long time to produce so in that

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.920 
long long time to produce so in that
time<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.730> he's<00:00:32.850> producing<00:00:33.149> those<00:00:33.360> 10<00:00:33.570> tanks

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930

my economy wallet will already be kicked

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.799 
my economy wallet will already be kicked
in<00:00:36.809> vary<00:00:37.739> greatly<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.879> will<00:00:39.360> be<00:00:39.570> able<00:00:39.660> to

but I'm not going to that's another

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.440 
but I'm not going to that's another

paranoid

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
paranoid

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.450 
paranoid
I<00:02:13.240> did<00:02:13.540> want<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.750> look<00:02:13.840> shuttle<00:02:14.110> bomb<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.470> he

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
I did want to look shuttle bomb so he

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.440 
I did want to look shuttle bomb so he
probably<00:02:15.640> thinks<00:02:15.820> I<00:02:15.940> could<00:02:16.090> do<00:02:16.150> another<00:02:16.270> one

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
probably thinks I could do another one

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.760 
probably thinks I could do another one
of<00:02:16.570> them<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.230> he's<00:02:17.380> getting<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.650> lot<00:02:17.740> of

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
of them and so he's getting a lot of

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.010 
of them and so he's getting a lot of
spending<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.760> lot<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:18.910> resources<00:02:19.210> and<00:02:19.570> getting

spending a lot of resources and getting

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.700 
spending a lot of resources and getting

the fact that he can scan stuff he

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
the fact that he can scan stuff he

like I don't see him doing anything in
this<00:02:55.150> game<00:02:55.360> unless<00:02:56.080> he<00:02:56.200> could<00:02:56.350> like<00:02:56.470> pull<00:02:56.650> off

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
this game unless he could like pull off

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.700 
this game unless he could like pull off
something<00:02:56.920> pretty<00:02:57.220> crazy<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.620> thing

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
something pretty crazy and the thing

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.800 
something pretty crazy and the thing
with<00:02:59.830> islands<00:03:00.250> expected<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:00.790> tend<00:03:01.060> not<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.690> get

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
with islands expected I tend not to get

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.360 
with islands expected I tend not to get
island<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.290> mention<00:03:02.560> this<00:03:02.680> is<00:03:02.740> that<00:03:02.950> he<00:03:03.070> it's

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
island to mention this is that he it's

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.070 
island to mention this is that he it's
just<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.700> he<00:03:03.880> had<00:03:03.970> me<00:03:04.120> contained<00:03:04.480> that's

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
just that he had me contained that's

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.540 
just that he had me contained that's
what<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.290> needed<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.680> get<00:03:05.770> that<00:03:05.830> and<00:03:06.160> expansion

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
what I needed to get that and expansion

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.660 
what I needed to get that and expansion
but<00:03:06.850> usually<00:03:07.450> I<00:03:08.010> tend<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.100> stay<00:03:09.310> off<00:03:09.460> island

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
but usually I tend to stay off island

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.270 
but usually I tend to stay off island
basis<00:03:10.090> because<00:03:10.270> I<00:03:10.860> don't<00:03:11.860> like<00:03:11.950> our<00:03:12.100> land

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
basis because I don't like our land

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.630 
basis because I don't like our land
expansions<00:03:12.730> there<00:03:13.530> transparent<00:03:14.530> easily<00:03:14.950> I

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
expansions there transparent easily I

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.370 
expansions there transparent easily I
wouldn't<00:03:16.450> say<00:03:16.540> easily<00:03:16.840> but<00:03:16.990> they<00:03:17.110> can<00:03:17.230> take

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
wouldn't say easily but they can take

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.500 
wouldn't say easily but they can take
them<00:03:17.500> all<00:03:17.590> relatively<00:03:18.370> without<00:03:19.210> that<00:03:19.390> much

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
them all relatively without that much

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.690 
them all relatively without that much
trouble<00:03:19.870> i<00:03:20.050> don't<00:03:20.590> i<00:03:20.770> don't<00:03:21.190> like<00:03:21.430> islands

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
trouble i don't i don't like islands

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.190 
trouble i don't i don't like islands
mountains<00:03:22.030> because<00:03:22.240> siege<00:03:22.690> tanks<00:03:23.050> and

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
mountains because siege tanks and

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.010 
mountains because siege tanks and
vultures<00:03:23.530> in<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:25.000> dropship<00:03:25.420> are<00:03:25.600> stronger<00:03:25.930> than

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
vultures in a dropship are stronger than

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.990 
vultures in a dropship are stronger than
dragoons<00:03:26.410> insults<00:03:26.800> in<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:26.920> dropship<00:03:27.370> i<00:03:27.580> think

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
dragoons insults in the dropship i think

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.680 
dragoons insults in the dropship i think
so<00:03:29.160> that's<00:03:30.160> why<00:03:30.340> i<00:03:30.400> tend<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.240> stay<00:03:31.510> away<00:03:31.540> from

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
so that's why i tend to stay away from

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.600 
so that's why i tend to stay away from
eiling's<00:03:32.050> mentioned<00:03:32.470> but<00:03:32.680> you<00:03:32.980> know<00:03:33.100> II<00:03:33.310> like

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
wouldn't really care that much because I

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.020 
wouldn't really care that much because I
I'm<00:03:38.410> still<00:03:38.650> going<00:03:38.770> to<00:03:38.830> be<00:03:38.950> ahead<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.160> him<00:03:39.370> and

corner or top left corner I mean is when

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.400 
corner or top left corner I mean is when
your<00:04:57.360> opponent<00:04:57.720> pushes<00:04:57.990> because<00:04:58.200> then<00:04:58.320> you

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
your opponent pushes because then you

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.750 
your opponent pushes because then you
need<00:04:58.560> everything<00:04:58.770> you<00:04:58.980> have<00:04:59.010> to<00:04:59.310> try<00:04:59.550> to<00:04:59.610> break

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
that push and most likely your won't

have came here when the trent there was
pushing<00:05:15.600> and<00:05:15.810> i<00:05:16.290> guess<00:05:16.470> now<00:05:16.650> they<00:05:16.680> have<00:05:16.980> but

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280

pushing and i guess now they have but
which<00:05:18.000> is<00:05:18.150> already<00:05:18.270> over<00:05:18.450> so<00:05:18.750> that<00:05:19.020> doesn't

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
which is already over so that doesn't

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
whole new level of starcraft day I don't

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:07.640 
whole new level of starcraft day I don't
know<00:06:06.510> they're<00:06:06.780> they're<00:06:07.050> pretty<00:06:07.290> crazy<00:06:07.470> like

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
know they're they're pretty crazy like

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.650 
know they're they're pretty crazy like
there<00:06:07.770> 8pm<00:06:08.100> is<00:06:08.370> so<00:06:08.610> high<00:06:08.790> I<00:06:08.820> don't<00:06:09.450> even<00:06:09.510> know

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
there 8pm is so high I don't even know

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.080 
there 8pm is so high I don't even know
like<00:06:09.900> my<00:06:10.050> theory<00:06:10.350> is<00:06:10.590> at<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:11.580> start<00:06:11.820> of<00:06:11.880> every

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
like my theory is at the start of every

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.780 
like my theory is at the start of every
match<00:06:12.350> the<00:06:13.350> pro<00:06:13.500> gamers<00:06:13.800> hockey<00:06:14.220> their<00:06:14.460> probes

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
match the pro gamers hockey their probes

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.060 
match the pro gamers hockey their probes
or<00:06:15.060> suvs<00:06:15.479> or<00:06:15.630> drones<00:06:15.840> in<00:06:16.050> every<00:06:16.830> possible

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
or suvs or drones in every possible

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.550 
or suvs or drones in every possible
combination<00:06:17.550> you<00:06:17.940> can<00:06:17.970> and<00:06:18.390> that's<00:06:19.169> how<00:06:19.410> they

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
combination you can and that's how they

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.320 
combination you can and that's how they
get<00:06:19.710> so<00:06:19.919> high<00:06:20.100> a<00:06:20.250> p.m.<00:06:20.490> at<00:06:20.610> the<00:06:20.669> start<00:06:20.880> like<00:06:21.090> I

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
get so high a p.m. at the start like I

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.940 
get so high a p.m. at the start like I
don't<00:06:21.840> know<00:06:22.020> man<00:06:22.229> that<00:06:22.470> they're<00:06:22.710> they're

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
don't know man that they're they're

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.680 
don't know man that they're they're
pretty<00:06:23.160> crazy<00:06:23.370> it's<00:06:23.580> it's<00:06:23.880> kind<00:06:24.120> of<00:06:24.150> odd<00:06:24.330> but

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
pretty crazy it's it's kind of odd but

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.210

so pretty much the posting commentary
for<00:06:49.370> this<00:06:49.490> game<00:06:49.639> the<00:06:50.539> honestly<00:06:51.020> the<00:06:51.110> best

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 
for this game the honestly the best

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.749 
for this game the honestly the best
thing<00:06:51.380> you<00:06:51.500> do<00:06:51.650> would<00:06:51.770> get<00:06:51.979> some<00:06:52.130> turrets<00:06:52.550> or

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 
thing you do would get some turrets or

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:54.850 
thing you do would get some turrets or
have<00:06:53.630> that<00:06:53.840> contain<00:06:54.139> a<00:06:54.199> little<00:06:54.530> stronger

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
have that contain a little stronger

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.490 
have that contain a little stronger
because<00:06:55.009> I<00:06:55.310> say<00:06:56.000> that<00:06:56.509> it's<00:06:56.840> easy<00:06:57.139> to<00:06:57.349> break

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
because I say that it's easy to break

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.070 
because I say that it's easy to break
out<00:06:57.680> of<00:06:57.710> it<00:06:57.919> but<00:06:58.280> if<00:06:58.400> a<00:06:58.490> transfer<00:06:58.910> commits<00:06:59.330> like

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
out of it but if a transfer commits like

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.230 
out of it but if a transfer commits like
say<00:07:00.740> if<00:07:00.800> he<00:07:00.830> makes<00:07:01.039> four<00:07:01.430> turrets<00:07:01.699> at<00:07:02.060> my

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 
say if he makes four turrets at my

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.480 
say if he makes four turrets at my
natural<00:07:02.660> and<00:07:02.840> then<00:07:02.930> he<00:07:03.020> makes<00:07:03.139> like<00:07:03.380> he<00:07:04.190> sends

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
natural and then he makes like he sends

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.850 
natural and then he makes like he sends
like<00:07:04.610> three<00:07:04.880> SUVs<00:07:05.150> he's<00:07:05.479> fully<00:07:06.199> commits<00:07:06.560> to<00:07:06.740> it

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
like three SUVs he's fully commits to it

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.420 
like three SUVs he's fully commits to it
then<00:07:07.370> he<00:07:07.880> probably<00:07:08.120> could<00:07:08.539> um<00:07:09.310> then<00:07:10.310> he

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
then he probably could um then he

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.999 
then he probably could um then he
probably<00:07:10.610> could<00:07:10.940> defend<00:07:11.570> our<00:07:11.900> attacker<00:07:12.830> and

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:13.009 
probably could defend our attacker and

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:13.990 
probably could defend our attacker and
