 Hi everyone, I'm Diego Gilton here. 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.400
 on the pt channel to give a tip about 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.039
 cycles of five-tenths sixteenth 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.160
 for those who do not remember it is that figure who 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:34.770
 within 1 4 by 4 km in four rings 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:37.860
 for a while I think of the cycle of five 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:43.200
 touches like two plus three 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:48.480
 then you can think 121 23 12 123 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:54.780
 forming two seats or else 1 2 3 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.930
 4 5 1 234 yes this cycle takes five 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:26.040
 with steps the first seat back to 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:29.310
 fall in the first half we can 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.189
 apply this situation in several ways 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.619
 I created two variations for 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.310
 to exemplify for you only that applying 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.560
 only on a compass the cycle does not close the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.280
 time that interrupted the cycle to return 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.549
 playing the rhythm again so I made a 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.220
 composite of rhythm where variation 1 of 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.479
 rhythm 1 of variation for you to feel 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:58.820
 the effect that seat in 5 causes rock 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.820
 I hope you enjoy a big hug
