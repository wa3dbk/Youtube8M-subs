00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.949
 huge lizard go off in a cool drink with 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.590
 a clear intention to eat 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.900
 hapless hunters x not on that 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.790
 attacked leap toward the creature flies by 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.190
 read centimeters from heroes bumps 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.960
 in the wall is tied in short 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.120
 distance the monster works hard 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.120
 fangs tail pours fire but the fighter 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.610
 deftly avoids blows methodically 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.290
 treating a dangerous enemy with a dragon sword 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.510
 can not stand the pressure and fall to the side 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.329
 creature with a dozen minutes ago 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.250
 seemed invincible now helplessly 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.789
 swinging paws waiting for the last 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.980
 hitting 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.059
 sharp bloodthirsty blade from a hare 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.280
 right up bringing a long-awaited victory 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.479
 it remains only to collect trophies and return 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.670
 to native village 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.560
 a phenomenon called monster hunter 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.810
 very difficult to explain to those who have never 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.910
 I did not try to play it from the side 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.970
 it may seem like nothing interesting 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.399
 there is no well running for monsters you kill 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.580
 they come back and repeat again 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.200
 yes but no it is worth going into the game like 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.090
 it becomes clear why none of 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.189
 imitators do not even get close 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.390
 on quality to an incredibly successful 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.180
 serial from capcom 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.950
 and probably never will do it because 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.659
 developers constantly improve without myself 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.009
 polished product release 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.899
 added versions 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.110
 about one of them today and will be discussed 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.450
 it's monster hunter 4 ultima and she took it away 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.759
 I have a dream to do something and 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.350
 even the creation of this material took place 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.560
 with breaks to hunt 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.750
 why it happened so listen 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.090
 mentioned none of the ideological 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.630
 Man Khan's followers are not even close 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.979
 getting close to my great and terrible 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.040
 patron the problem is that they 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.439
 constantly something forgotten something overboard 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.810
 turned out to be a plot then there was no motivation 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.299
 again rush into battle that narration 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.829
 so wanted to highlight what worked 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.500
 tedious freedom wars 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:18.380
 monster hunter 4 Ultimate let's for 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.440
 we will call convenience i'm eating them all 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.170
 it stands exactly in its place 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.640
 shows wonderful introductory 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.850
 video and then no extra 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.080
 ranting informs you here 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.200
 new hunter sword 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.240
 the monster is there ahead it only remains to take 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.400
 take up arms and learn to survive in 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.380
 this bright world from time to time 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.380
 the dragons are falling off their heads 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.300
 lands crawl out creatures and worse here on 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.760
 the foreground is one of the main 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.460
 merits gray monster hunter in general 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.710
 m x x and y in particular the game motivates 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.540
 explore again and again locations 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.000
 fight huge unknowns 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.940
 beings thanks to their diversity and 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.670
 worthy reward for the victory of the bestiary 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.620
 under a hundred position the game design is built 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.210
 in such a way that by the time when 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.120
 some of the monsters will start repeating 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.430
 you will only be glad of it since 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.220
 differently materials are needed for 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.530
 Improve equipment not to get at all 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.230
 collecting all that comes across 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.750
 on the eyes of the project engine without it 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.540
 new armor not forge non-healing potions 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.930
 don't remember bad that hunter 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.270
 which goes to the monster without the possibility 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.940
 recuperate while doing mx 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.220
 built in such a way that never 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.850
 will give you tasks that are impossible 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.980
 perform 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.290
 you shouldn't get upset 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.060
 quests here every second but where such 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.910
 the hero falls from two special strikes 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.160
 you will not find a strong opponent when 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.250
 provided that you will improve in a timely manner 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.470
 create and buy new equipment to 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.330
 way, even those who are treated badly 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.459
 the notorious farm will be able to feel 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.590
 yourself completely free materials for 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.870
 good armor or weapons will even get 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.630
 in that case if one performs the task 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.090
 times the best examples of blacksmithing such 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.280
 way not to get but still nice 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.760
 that the game even adapts to such 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.760
 style 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.570
 the list of changes ultimate version 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.420
 It may be small but strong enough 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.160
 changes the approach to hunter battles 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.250
 for example the opportunity to attack 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.810
 adversary jumps off walls cling 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.210
 waiting for any surface 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.460
 right moment and then collapses 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.190
 on the head of a monster with good luck 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.380
 circumstances will be able to get essentially 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.420
 on your back and try to put him like 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.230
 possible more damage before he 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.330
 will throw you off 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.060
 However, the main feature of this 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.220
 online multiplayer appearance editions 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.130
 now there is no need to search 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.520
 companions locally enough to go out 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.650
 network 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.720
 is it worth saying that a similar function 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.880
 long time was not enough for a portable console 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.610
 and shred teach new shchi where 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.890
 more fun with partners 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.680
 only distresses the management of the absence of 3ds 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.720
 2 sticks do not allow to rotate quickly 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.790
 camera despite being on the second 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.580
 the screen is a virtual cross 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.740
 autoname works only on large 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.860
 monsters get used to like 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.240
 features I managed after an hour 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.780
 three or four then play becomes easier 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.730
 but never easier circle pet should 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.980
 to be much more comfortable but also to buy it 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.960
 it is necessary separately in general from which side 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.560
 do not come to a problem and everywhere it will be found 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.960
 shortcomings but otherwise i'm losing it 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.750
 a project close to the ideal is so 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.850
 as far as possible for hunting 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.550
 for the next mutant time flies by 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.350
 completely unnoticed by the vast bestiary 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.480
 dozens of items of equipment will be 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.850
 force to go for materials 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.550
 for crafting an infinite number of times 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.830
 the project will always find something to entice 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.190
 users for a week and then another 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:57.190
 on one more in the current price situation 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.620
 On games this is important in improved 4 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.140
 pieces can really spend hundreds 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.780
 hours and not even notice it 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.760
 so the process of extermination 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:10.630
 diverse wildlife fascinating welcome 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.680
 newcomer here's the sword there monster you 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.680
 know what to do 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:20.240
 The author of the text Ivan would have silk to text 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.240
 announced Demetrius bushings 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.230
 but 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.370
 this
