00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.130
 sure Palfinger ksta 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.179
 the money comes from 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.509
 this has more 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.509
 Dr 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.730

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.140
 Veit can install in Pecs percent GTA San Andreas 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.140
 First of all, what is your goal? 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.880
 Cavs is a murder 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.280
 Amann GTA San Andreas can install to improve the graphics and 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.650
 more realistic 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.630
 So this lesson 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.460
 Lighting effects and so on 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.460
 what that is exactly and what it looks like CG 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.680
 In principle, the installation is quite simple 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.680
 their party wants to target but is the gate 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.190
 opens is anxious 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.870
 Do you go to your GTA San Andreas installation? 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.530
 and just adds the entire content of the folder so its pointed here 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.090
 in the GTA order 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.340

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.910

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.600
 then you threaten your writing and f12 then you activate 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.990
 if there are too many of you there you can press Schulz Essen 9 because that 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.030
 I believe 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.829
 and sprint the loo stone on an am 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.670
 pending 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.920
 and with pin at 8 and s11 Commander also something easy to do 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.369
 so why so 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:13.599
 Chief of the Tibetan I believe 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.010
 And here everything prepares no lags or as you have seen in the video 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.269
 everything is running smoothly 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.199
