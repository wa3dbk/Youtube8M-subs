let's<00:01:48.460> get<00:01:48.640> in<00:01:48.820> vertex<00:01:49.180> I<00:01:49.660> feel<00:01:50.560> this<00:01:50.650> is<00:01:50.710> quite

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
let's get in vertex I feel this is quite

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.220 
let's get in vertex I feel this is quite
an<00:01:51.100> experience<00:01:51.370> let's<00:01:51.850> go<00:01:51.970> right<00:01:52.240> if<00:01:52.690> I'm<00:01:52.990> well

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
an experience let's go right if I'm well

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.900 
an experience let's go right if I'm well
I<00:01:53.260> guess<00:01:53.530> I'm<00:01:53.650> first<00:01:53.890> of<00:01:54.010> a<00:01:54.070> slaughterfest<00:01:54.460> all

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
I guess I'm first of a slaughterfest all

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.690 
I guess I'm first of a slaughterfest all
right<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:56.170> what<00:01:56.320> do<00:01:56.410> you<00:01:56.500> do<00:01:56.650> in<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:57.310> simulator

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
right so what do you do in a simulator

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.890 
right so what do you do in a simulator
like<00:01:57.760> this<00:01:57.970> what<00:01:58.150> are<00:01:58.210> you<00:01:58.270> learning<00:01:58.450> from<00:01:58.780> me

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
like this what are you learning from me

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.570 
like this what are you learning from me
doing<00:01:59.170> this<00:01:59.290> well<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.920> first<00:02:00.160> thing<00:02:00.220> is<00:02:00.340> just

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
doing this well the first thing is just

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.400 
doing this well the first thing is just
the<00:02:00.730> driving<00:02:01.000> experience<00:02:01.240> itself<00:02:01.930> so<00:02:02.140> we<00:02:02.260> can

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
the driving experience itself so we can

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.890 
the driving experience itself so we can
experiment<00:02:02.800> with<00:02:03.130> lots<00:02:04.000> of<00:02:04.120> different<00:02:04.480> setups

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
experiment with lots of different setups

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.900 
experiment with lots of different setups
in<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.170> vehicle<00:02:05.530> whether<00:02:05.680> seating<00:02:06.370> positions

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
in the vehicle whether seating positions

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.090 
in the vehicle whether seating positions
steering<00:02:07.420> wheel<00:02:07.570> configurations<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.830> type

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
steering wheel configurations the type

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.150 
steering wheel configurations the type
of<00:02:09.130> displays<00:02:09.850> that<00:02:10.119> we<00:02:10.240> have<00:02:10.390> in<00:02:10.510> the<00:02:10.630> car<00:02:11.160> we

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
of displays that we have in the car we

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.740 
of displays that we have in the car we
also<00:02:12.340> see<00:02:12.700> in<00:02:12.760> front<00:02:13.030> of<00:02:13.210> you<00:02:13.270> Brian<00:02:13.570> there's

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
also see in front of you Brian there's

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.720 
also see in front of you Brian there's
some<00:02:13.960> cameras<00:02:14.440> up<00:02:14.680> Yeah<00:02:15.130> right<00:02:15.280> in<00:02:15.490> front<00:02:15.670> of

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
some cameras up Yeah right in front of

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.190 
some cameras up Yeah right in front of
me<00:02:15.820> here<00:02:15.970> we<00:02:16.090> can<00:02:16.240> actually<00:02:16.360> use<00:02:16.570> to<00:02:16.990> monitor

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
me here we can actually use to monitor

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.260 
me here we can actually use to monitor
your<00:02:17.500> face<00:02:17.800> particularly<00:02:18.610> your<00:02:18.700> eyes<00:02:18.910> and

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
your face particularly your eyes and

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.660 
your face particularly your eyes and
detect<00:02:20.200> whether<00:02:20.380> you're<00:02:20.560> dry<00:02:20.830> drowsy<00:02:21.640> or

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
detect whether you're dry drowsy or

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.550 
detect whether you're dry drowsy or
whether<00:02:22.060> you're<00:02:22.180> distracted<00:02:22.930> because<00:02:23.290> those

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
whether you're distracted because those

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.140 
whether you're distracted because those
wouldn't<00:02:23.890> lie<00:02:24.100> those<00:02:24.460> cameras<00:02:24.910> will<00:02:25.030> know

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
wouldn't lie those cameras will know

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.460 
wouldn't lie those cameras will know
what<00:02:25.300> I'm<00:02:25.390> really<00:02:25.630> doing<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:26.140> my<00:02:26.200> eyes<00:02:26.440> are

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
what I'm really doing and my eyes are

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.900 
what I'm really doing and my eyes are
really<00:02:26.800> knowing<00:02:27.070> they<00:02:27.400> know<00:02:27.520> whether<00:02:27.730> you're

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
really knowing they know whether you're

looking<00:02:28.180> at<00:02:28.270> me<00:02:28.420> they<00:02:28.690> know<00:02:28.840> whether<00:02:29.050> you're

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
looking at me they know whether you're

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.510 
looking at me they know whether you're
looking<00:02:29.470> down<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:30.010> know<00:02:30.070> whether<00:02:30.400> you're

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
looking down I know whether you're

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.160 
looking down I know whether you're
focusing<00:02:31.030> on<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.320> road<00:02:32.320> ahead<00:02:33.930> being<00:02:34.930> our<00:02:35.020> own

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
focusing on the road ahead being our own

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.510 
focusing on the road ahead being our own
yeah<00:02:35.470> now<00:02:35.650> it's<00:02:35.800> getting<00:02:35.980> interesting<00:02:36.130> now

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
yeah now it's getting interesting now

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.340 
yeah now it's getting interesting now
I'm<00:02:36.820> getting<00:02:36.970> traffic<00:02:37.450> here's<00:02:37.870> an<00:02:37.990> area<00:02:38.230> where

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
I'm getting traffic here's an area where

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.470 
I'm getting traffic here's an area where
you<00:02:38.440> might<00:02:38.650> start<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.130> sort<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.000> measure<00:02:40.209> my

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
you might start to sort to measure my

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.600 
you might start to sort to measure my
workload<00:02:40.810> right<00:02:41.380> exactly<00:02:41.860> some<00:02:42.220> more<00:02:42.370> things

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
workload right exactly some more things

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.040 
workload right exactly some more things
are<00:02:42.760> happening<00:02:43.180> now<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.420> got<00:02:43.570> a<00:02:43.600> lot<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:43.810> traffic

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
are happening now I got a lot of traffic

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.260 
are happening now I got a lot of traffic
around<00:02:44.290> me<00:02:44.560> all<00:02:44.680> of<00:02:44.740> a<00:02:44.800> sudden<00:02:45.130> we<00:02:46.090> might

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
around me all of a sudden we might

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.180 
around me all of a sudden we might
choose<00:02:46.540> for<00:02:46.780> example<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:47.350> say<00:02:47.500> hey<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.860> can't

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
choose for example to say hey I can't

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.270 
choose for example to say hey I can't
receive<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.700> telephone<00:02:49.060> call

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
receive a telephone call

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.340 
receive a telephone call
or<00:02:50.459> we<00:02:50.640> might<00:02:50.850> write<00:02:51.150> new<00:02:51.420> radial<00:02:52.050> or<00:02:52.080> you

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
or we might write new radial or you

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.250 
or we might write new radial or you
might<00:02:52.500> stop<00:02:53.209> changing<00:02:54.209> chapters<00:02:54.660> on<00:02:54.810> premium

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
might stop changing chapters on premium

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.840 
might stop changing chapters on premium
if<00:02:55.470> i<00:02:55.620> recall<00:02:55.740> correctly<00:02:55.920> with<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.520> evos

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
if i recall correctly with the evos

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.000 
if i recall correctly with the evos
concept<00:02:56.880> you're<00:02:57.690> looking<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.500> future<00:02:58.860> of

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
concept you're looking to a future of

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.850 
concept you're looking to a future of
starting<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.490> measure<00:02:59.730> even<00:03:00.120> more<00:03:00.860> biometric

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
starting to measure even more biometric

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.580 
starting to measure even more biometric
or<00:03:01.980> biological<00:03:02.670> inputs<00:03:03.240> is<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.510> right<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:04.410> is

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
or biological inputs is that right it is

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.020 
or biological inputs is that right it is
and<00:03:04.830> one<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.370> things<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.760> we<00:03:05.850> have<00:03:05.970> in

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
and one of the things that we have in

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.720 
and one of the things that we have in
there<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.600> evos<00:03:06.900> as<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.110> concept<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.890> heart

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
there the evos as a concept is a heart

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.520 
there the evos as a concept is a heart
rate<00:03:08.940> monitoring<00:03:09.420> sing<00:03:09.720> we<00:03:10.020> can<00:03:10.170> use<00:03:10.350> that

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
rate monitoring sing we can use that

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.120 
rate monitoring sing we can use that
information<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:11.900> shut<00:03:12.900> down<00:03:12.930> displays<00:03:13.590> to
