00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.050 
it quickly goes down the tunnel of what
I<00:01:52.180> like<00:01:52.420> calling<00:01:52.660> a<00:01:52.750> conversational<00:01:54.060> dialogue

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
I like calling a conversational dialogue

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.060 
I like calling a conversational dialogue
if<00:01:55.270> you<00:01:55.360> will<00:01:55.570> between<00:01:56.080> salesperson<00:01:56.890> and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
if you will between salesperson and

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.040 
if you will between salesperson and
client<00:01:57.790> and<00:01:57.910> you<00:01:58.060> find<00:01:58.390> yourself<00:01:58.540> talking

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
client and you find yourself talking

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.950 
client and you find yourself talking
only<00:01:59.800> 30%<00:02:00.100> of<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.490> time<00:02:00.760> and<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.390> client<00:02:01.720> ends

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
only 30% of the time and the client ends

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.420 
only 30% of the time and the client ends
up<00:02:02.080> talking<00:02:02.230> seventy<00:02:02.830> percent<00:02:02.980> of<00:02:03.190> the<00:02:03.280> time

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
up talking seventy percent of the time

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.310 
up talking seventy percent of the time
and<00:02:03.550> that<00:02:03.790> creates<00:02:04.120> a<00:02:04.270> more<00:02:04.750> of<00:02:04.840> a<00:02:04.930> win-win

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
and that creates a more of a win-win

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.320 
and that creates a more of a win-win
relationship<00:02:06.070> and<00:02:06.280> that's<00:02:06.580> saying<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.150> rule
