00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.140
 next we will tell you all the accusations of the mayor barrier against 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.360
 laughs dances and we will denounce publicly 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.430
 violations of the constitution, abuse of functions abuses of the 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.849
 power 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.139
 and many more by the mayor 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.339
 because it removed deserve the truth 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:20.779
 the mayor barrier accuses them of not taking permits lying 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.499
 in ordinance 3 30 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:23.300
 does not say 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.880
 no part that traffic signs with advertising should ask 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.240
 permissions so the prosecution has no legal support 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:35.350
 ordinance 3 30 says the following traffic signage is 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.150
 need 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.300
 the payment of debts 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.300
 but the publicity of his reverse life pay 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.160
 no mother 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.210
 queen group 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.410
 I can not accept paying fees not because I do not want to, but because if I do it 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.480
 insubstantiated the judgment of the constitutional court in favor of the river group 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.490
 since said ruling says that traffic signs with advertising 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.330
 belonging to the king group lear 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.680
 the Blaugranas 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.680
 for providing a free signage service 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.560
 the stamps of the municipality placed in the visit of many of which gives 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.190
 traffic signs months ago are arbitrary and has no 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.070
 no legal backing 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.860
 and it has led to total bankruptcy 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.409
 the same thing happened in the municipal government of paco moncayo 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.250
 the seals of efforts have not led to bankruptcy and the trial of damages and 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.160
 damage that is being done years ago still has no sentence and 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.180
 what would be our favor 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.130
 for having won constitutional protections 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.030
 that's why it has not come out yet and maybe it never came out 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.650
 the one of san just that is the justice of his country 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.100
 they are judged by ordinance 3 30 illegally 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.650
 he made to throw away the concertaciÃ³n the transit of the world 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.800
 all this to replace it 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.490
 spending money unnecessarily 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.390
 because what's behind all this 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.200
 the barrier mayor says that traffic signs and advertising placed on 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.000
 the standards of being the municipality control lie 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.669
 the barrier mayor argues that the law of the quota 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.039
 it transfers the vertical signage 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:21.430
 If that were the case because then it signs an agreement with the national agency of 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:25.839
 transit represented by Mr. Ricardo Anton to be transferred to the 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:27.659
 vertical signage 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.039
 no sir 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:33.269
 that is not the truth there is a transfer committee 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.969
 to analyze the possibilities of doing 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:39.319
 said transfers in addition and that is the most important thing 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.160
 the municipality is acting lawyers because it does not have the power 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.380
 of traffic signage as evidenced by the official registration number 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.110
 415 of March 29, 2000 11 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.509
 on page 22 number 24 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:02.049
 says that the transit powers will remain from the direction 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.869
 national transit national police 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:08.489
 and decide if the military never had the municipality 

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:10.979
 barrier mayor 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:14.519
 says that the constitutional protections in favor of the rebel group 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.919
 were given by the previous constitution 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.179
 tour 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:20.229
 one more lie of the mayor 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:25.829
 since the new constitution governs since August 2004 the repeal of the 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.839
 ordinance 186 is signed in the constitutional court on March 19, 2009 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:34.839
 that is to say that this constitution is fine 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:41.399
 that's why the constitutional court asks the mayor in writing 

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:44.369
 because he is disregarding the sentence of the court 

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:47.699
 and a hearing for April 19 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.859
 for which the municipality did not show up 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.879
 like they did not go to the previous audience because they know they can not 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.939
 defend yourself legally 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.729
 in view of the fact that the mayor of the city of Quito did not want to talk 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:03.239
 forced to demonstrate 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.260
 of all his accusations are false and now Germany the hit 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:13.430
 the defendant without any legal basis a week or two not only 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.140
 50-year-old emotional judgments 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.630
 but also patented against the legal security of the country 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.449
 discrediting not only our good name 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.499
 if not also the one of all the private companies to which threatened with strong 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:33.110
 fines for working with us 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.770
 violating the constitution also in functions and finally defending the 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.210
 Palestinians that we put in protest 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.130
 the same ones that did not contain insults and were placed on private property 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.389
 so he could not get them out without proper authorization is 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.590
 a competent judge the fourth never existed 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.139
 this is called that there is potential national activity is suppressed 

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:05.919
 all this with the public order to throw away one of the best signs of 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.150
 transit of the world 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.190
 lula da silva in civil areas 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.310
 the program of permanent coordination with the national police of the 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.189
 Ecuador 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:19.149
 or is that we already forget that all traffic signals were rotten 

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:22.229
 years ago with the municipality the matters 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:23.620
 It was made of wood 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.080
 they say that traffic signals with justice 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.279
 causes visual contamination 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:30.870
 day 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.190
 on the contrary they reduce the visual noise painted on the back discovered with 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.210
 iron frames lights 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.120
 or the mayor believes that he drinks by the black backs that today adorns 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.809
 our beautiful city 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:50.639
 advertising is then delivered with vehicular traffic because it is 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.039
 oversized 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.849
 so they do not cause visual contamination 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:56.169
 the barrier mayor 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.569
 been acting out of the constitution in the next first 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:03.189
 you can not sue the accusers 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:08.499
 that a person for the same subject that prohibits the constitution and here 

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:13.820
 we won the constitutional amparos second are using retroactivity 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.310
 that the cajasol hard promoted the third constitution the municipal norm 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.830
 that governs throughout the country is the constitution of the republic then 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.210
 come international treaties on the subject 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.839
 with this he makes them to the ministerial decrees 

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:29.990
 and finally 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.009
 the municipal ordinances 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.319
 as stipulated by the ordinance 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:36.080
 and an illegal demonstration 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.360
 wants to pass through the constitution 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.449
 the repeal of the previous ordinance number 186 counts 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:47.830
 on March 19, 2009 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.860
 while the new constitution of the republic governs from the 10 of August of 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.309
 2008 

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:55.939
 as you can see 

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:58.749
 r do not have a single legal argument 

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:01.649
 that justifies its procedure 

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:02.589
 it will not make us free
