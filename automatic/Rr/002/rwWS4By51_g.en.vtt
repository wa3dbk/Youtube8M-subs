00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.120

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.050

 very well and you Julian ben me I am 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.340
 always thrilled to meet you then we 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.840
 saw you driving a racing car 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.450
 6 which will interest us today 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.820
 to have impression since roof of 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.739
 grand marc thuet vehicles real 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.050
 and beat the pilots gold what do you 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.489
 felt like flying virtual in hand then 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.710
 firstly if you can tell statement 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.480
 a few gtc today is the same 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.090
 car that I used for the 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.980
 advertising premium accounts on note 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.570
 a ferrari 458 italia 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.530
 ok so what can i say bah 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.990
 it's not bad I admit that it's not bad 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.759
 it's not the reality but it's a game 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.229
 video 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.880
 I had in my hands another game that 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.140
 is called forza for xbox 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.360
 Quan I found relatively flat 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.890
 because there we can not we do not have too much 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.240
 the time to play that stuff there 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.670
 must say one thing is that you are 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.050
 rather to a lover of gran turismo 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.820
 first generation 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.040
 and then after everything rocked on the side of 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.840
 forza and then you would be in the process of 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.200
 come back more about the simulate appearance of gran 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.610
 turismo 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.530
 yes quite so I got myself 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.840
 criticized by some Cyril Drevet 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.760
 for having loved for sale if you 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.310
 cyril looks present but in short it's 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.280
 true but has for now what I have 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.659
 seen from forza samsam on that side it hurts me 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.409
 less than what I'm trying to 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.090
 see on gran turismo 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.860
 why why this burst that gran 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.750
 turismo 6 because on gran turismo 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.280
 I start again to have the sensation 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.490
 that I had in the past for example 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.500
 with forza 2 where I had for example 80% 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.810
 of a feeling of a real car 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.400
 the first forwards make before forza 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.720
 so gran turismo we had the impression 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.340
 to have a scooter any 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.360
 vehicle that you could test it was 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.700
 a scinette in the order in the 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.200
 reality no it was not on ice there 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.729
 if you want you really feel 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.320
 to have a real car between 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.170
 hands the problem is that I hate 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.430
 the setting that was who were here 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.040
 in life in a car when 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.420
 was driving a 458 like that happens to you 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.340
 every day obviously exactly 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.049
 no, but what I 'm really saying is 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.030
 that we have not stopped this in turn these 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.709
 false return from in the steering wheel that 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.030
 does not exist in truth it's softer 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.470
 more flow it's not that it's yes 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.880
 it's sweeter and cooler and here it's a 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.380
 shock you from time to time we have a big 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.090
 empty we do not know why and it comes back 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.920
 so it's not really the best 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.020
 setting 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.099
 but even if I did not have the 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.630
 best is worthy of the other side 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.540
 at chez microsoft 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.280
 I think Gran Turismo Gran Turismo 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.450
 6 comes back with something 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.520
 with which I will be able to have fun 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.440
 on the other hand, we still regret 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.020
 always the absence of deformation of 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.830
 vehicles which is the fact that in that 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.300
 term of realism 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.489
 it takes a hit this is the case of the 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.690
 to say what did you think of 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.250
 gran turismo 5 and what especially 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.660
 thur already feels in terms 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.190
 perhaps improvement of physics 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.720
 she was apparently totally overhauled 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.760
 I absolutely hated gran turismo 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.420
 5 for me gran turismo 5 is a big 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.650
 shit 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.230
 I 'm going to do sports 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.459
 by three men but the problem is 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.170
 that I have the impression that actually 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.239
 they listened a little bit what is 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.019
 what people did not like about gran 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.180
 turismo 5 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.620
 they made improvements and this 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.230
 so I can not say now 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.640
 gran turismo 6 yes why not it's ok 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.400
 to be on my list but if I have to 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.019
 compare between forza and gran version 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.060
 turismo 6 for now I will go more 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.380
 at gran turismo 6 so in any case 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.880
 it's interesting from 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.470
 someone who is really used to 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.180
 fly beautiful and most beautiful 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.980
 cars of the world and the one we 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.390
 found in gran turismo if I 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.090
 understand well in terms of realism this 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.130
 gran turismo 6 really took a little 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.690
 he likes me but I like him 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.590
 more compared to what I saw from 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.269
 the other side at microsoft 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.350
 and above all, it's better than 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.370
 did gran turismo 5 is clearly 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.100
 yes that's clear 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.600
 well listen gonzague thanks a lot have 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.060
 too much will probably cross in others 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.739
 adventures on gameblog in the future in 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.650
 Anyway thank you thank you too 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.640
 see you soon on tokyo game show 2013 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.000
