00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
NADPH that are produced through this

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.330 
NADPH that are produced through this
process<00:01:50.990> those<00:01:51.990> high-energy<00:01:52.439> products<00:01:53.100> are

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
process those high-energy products are

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.940 
process those high-energy products are
then<00:01:53.610> used<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.509> calvin<00:01:54.930> cycle<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.590> drive

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
then used in the calvin cycle to drive

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.590 
then used in the calvin cycle to drive
the<00:01:56.340> fixation<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.090> co2

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.410

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
so when that light energy is harvested

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.080 
so when that light energy is harvested
it<00:02:04.690> is<00:02:05.229> absorbed<00:02:05.920> by<00:02:05.950> a<00:02:06.040> chlorophyll<00:02:06.610> molecule

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
it is absorbed by a chlorophyll molecule

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.540 
it is absorbed by a chlorophyll molecule
within<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.540> sample<00:02:08.020> and<00:02:08.369> once<00:02:09.369> that

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
within the sample and once that

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.730

here in this figure we can see that in

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.180 
here in this figure we can see that in
blue<00:04:56.880> photon<00:04:57.330> of<00:04:57.360> light<00:04:57.540> there<00:04:58.050> is

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
blue photon of light there is

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.760 
blue photon of light there is
considerably<00:04:59.190> more<00:04:59.550> energy<00:05:00.210> and<00:05:00.770> therefore

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
considerably more energy and therefore

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.160 
considerably more energy and therefore
the<00:05:02.310> chlorophyll<00:05:02.820> molecule<00:05:03.300> is<00:05:03.450> raised<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:04.020> a

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
the chlorophyll molecule is raised to a

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.250 
the chlorophyll molecule is raised to a
higher<00:05:04.680> level<00:05:04.710> a<00:05:05.400> higher<00:05:05.670> excited<00:05:06.330> state<00:05:06.660> if

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
higher level a higher excited state if

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.680 
higher level a higher excited state if
the<00:05:07.950> leaf<00:05:08.130> absorbs<00:05:08.640> our<00:05:08.790> red<00:05:08.970> photon<00:05:09.480> of<00:05:09.510> light

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
the leaf absorbs our red photon of light

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.310 
the leaf absorbs our red photon of light
we<00:05:10.560> see<00:05:10.770> that<00:05:10.980> the<00:05:11.660> excited<00:05:12.660> level<00:05:13.050> that<00:05:13.230> the

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
we see that the excited level that the

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.560 
we see that the excited level that the
chlorophyll<00:05:13.770> is<00:05:13.920> raised<00:05:14.160> to<00:05:14.340> is<00:05:14.760> not<00:05:14.970> quite<00:05:15.420> as

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
levels we have relaxation steps and if

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.560

the photon of light the chlorophyll
molecule<00:05:28.170> is<00:05:29.000> relaxed<00:05:30.000> to<00:05:30.180> the<00:05:30.210> first<00:05:30.810> excited

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
singlet state and then relaxes to the

singlet state and then relaxes to the
ground<00:05:36.090> state<00:05:36.510> this<00:05:37.410> is<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.680> same<00:05:38.100> wavelength

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
ground state this is the same wavelength

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.040 
ground state this is the same wavelength

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
as a red photon of light and this is why

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.890 
as a red photon of light and this is why
fluorescence<00:05:43.050> appears<00:05:43.530> red<00:05:44.420> in<00:05:45.420> between

these<00:05:46.110> other<00:05:46.410> excited<00:05:47.220> States<00:05:47.550> we<00:05:48.180> can<00:05:48.390> have

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
these other excited States we can have

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.420 
these other excited States we can have
other<00:05:49.650> relaxation<00:05:50.130> processes<00:05:51.060> going<00:05:51.930> to<00:05:52.430> non

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:13.480 

so<00:06:11.659> you<00:06:11.720> may<00:06:11.960> be<00:06:11.990> asking<00:06:12.289> well<00:06:13.189> how<00:06:13.310> do<00:06:13.370> we

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
so you may be asking well how do we

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.879 
so you may be asking well how do we
actually<00:06:13.729> measure<00:06:14.120> fluorescence<00:06:14.960> there<00:06:15.710> is

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
actually measure fluorescence there is

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:17.679 
actually measure fluorescence there is
actually<00:06:16.520> quite<00:06:16.789> a<00:06:16.819> bit<00:06:17.000> of<00:06:17.030> fluorescence

00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:17.689 
actually quite a bit of fluorescence

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:20.439 
actually quite a bit of fluorescence
coming<00:06:18.139> back<00:06:18.319> from<00:06:18.560> a<00:06:18.740> leaf<00:06:18.949> and<00:06:19.280> it's<00:06:19.879> bright

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:20.449 
coming back from a leaf and it's bright

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.270 
coming back from a leaf and it's bright
enough<00:06:20.479> that<00:06:20.840> we<00:06:21.169> can<00:06:21.409> actually<00:06:21.650> measure<00:06:22.129> it

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
enough that we can actually measure it

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.649 
enough that we can actually measure it
some<00:06:23.090> distance<00:06:23.539> away<00:06:23.689> from<00:06:23.810> the<00:06:24.259> leaf<00:06:24.439> surface

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:25.659 
some distance away from the leaf surface

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:29.249 
some distance away from the leaf surface
but<00:06:26.659> there<00:06:26.840> are<00:06:26.960> really<00:06:27.139> two<00:06:27.530> main<00:06:27.830> types<00:06:28.159> of

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:29.259 
but there are really two main types of

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.990 
but there are really two main types of
fluorometers<00:06:30.259> which<00:06:30.800> measure<00:06:31.159> fluorescence

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
fluorometers which measure fluorescence

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.589 
fluorometers which measure fluorescence
the<00:06:32.689> first<00:06:33.020> type<00:06:33.289> is<00:06:33.560> a<00:06:33.590> continuous

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 
the first type is a continuous

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:38.950 
the first type is a continuous
fluorometer<00:06:35.599> and<00:06:36.219> in<00:06:37.219> what<00:06:37.669> this<00:06:37.879> does<00:06:38.389> is<00:06:38.690> you

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
fluorometer and in what this does is you

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.040 
fluorometer and in what this does is you
need<00:06:39.319> to<00:06:39.349> have<00:06:39.469> a<00:06:39.879> black<00:06:40.879> background<00:06:41.330> or<00:06:42.020> a

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
need to have a black background or a

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.170 
need to have a black background or a
black<00:06:42.349> room<00:06:42.800> where<00:06:43.699> you<00:06:43.849> have<00:06:44.030> your

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
black room where you have your

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.360 
black room where you have your
fluorometer<00:06:44.870> and<00:06:45.080> there<00:06:45.590> needs<00:06:45.800> to<00:06:45.889> be<00:06:45.979> no

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
fluorometer and there needs to be no

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.420 
fluorometer and there needs to be no
other<00:06:46.550> source<00:06:46.940> of<00:06:47.090> red<00:06:47.659> light<00:06:48.099> except<00:06:49.099> the<00:06:49.250> red

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
other source of red light except the red

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.159 
other source of red light except the red
light<00:06:49.639> that's<00:06:49.909> coming<00:06:50.030> from<00:06:50.419> the<00:06:50.629> leaf<00:06:50.840> and

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:51.169 
light that's coming from the leaf and

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:53.860 
light that's coming from the leaf and
then<00:06:52.009> this<00:06:52.250> fluorometer<00:06:52.940> has<00:06:53.150> a<00:06:53.180> detector

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.870 
then this fluorometer has a detector

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.990 
then this fluorometer has a detector
that's<00:06:54.169> specific<00:06:54.800> to<00:06:54.830> the<00:06:55.400> emission

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 
that's specific to the emission

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.140 
that's specific to the emission
wavelengths<00:06:56.690> of<00:06:56.840> fluorescence<00:06:57.680> and<00:06:58.150> this

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
wavelengths of fluorescence and this

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.570 
wavelengths of fluorescence and this
type<00:06:59.389> of<00:06:59.419> fluorometer<00:07:00.110> is<00:07:01.719> typically<00:07:02.719> used<00:07:03.289> to

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
type of fluorometer is typically used to

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.360 
type of fluorometer is typically used to
measure<00:07:04.580> the<00:07:05.150> kotsky<00:07:05.900> curve<00:07:06.349> which<00:07:06.889> we<00:07:07.129> see

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370 
measure the kotsky curve which we see

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.330 
measure the kotsky curve which we see
here<00:07:07.669> in<00:07:07.789> this<00:07:07.939> figure<00:07:08.210> it<00:07:08.810> is<00:07:09.620> basically

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
here in this figure it is basically

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.050 
here in this figure it is basically
taking<00:07:11.210> a<00:07:11.300> leaf<00:07:11.509> that's<00:07:11.779> been
