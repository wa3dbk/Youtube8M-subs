00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:17.949
 Nissan Motor Co. killed and injured in safety 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:19.000
 Development of safety technology with the goal of virtually eliminating fatal accidents 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:23.079
 Is advancing 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.740
 The high award applicants are making good progress 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:31.850
 I still can not get or reduce those that just the number of accidents 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.500
 However technology areas: prevention safety in its first is important to 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.900
 It is why it has become to 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:43.900
 Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. has developed safety safety technology development as a safety seal. 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:50.870
 We are developing under the concept of safety shield concept 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:53.520
 The idea that cars protect people with 360 degree omnidirectional technology 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.790
 It is a dangerous day depending on when you are driving normally 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.650
 Starting with technology that answers not to float 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:04.260
 It is a large risk by 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:07.210
 Avoid it when it's coming and actively drive the driver from the danger 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:13.630
 Flow of flowing 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:18.790
 In the scene where you have to do 4 最後 の last emergency avoidance 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:23.320
 When the driver can not make a voice, the car replaces the driver 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.820
 It says very'm strong key and way of performing an emergency avoidance 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.570
 Easy 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.090
 It consists of the concept of safety 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.790
 It seems that emergency meeting support system is 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.070
 For example 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.560
 The other side 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.659
 It stops Although it brake and late life is to apply the brakes when the end discovery of j Corps was delayed 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.820
 I can not do it sometimes 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:52.170
 I have to cut the handle 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:58.650
 There is still no traffic jam on the right side and no car on the left when it becomes impossible to avoid a collision 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:03.869
 The system will automatically detect the situation and the instruction of system on the left first 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.810
 Is not put out to the driver and to be cut to the driver left the system is the aircraft automatically 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:11.620
 When we are done 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:15.090
 The place where the car always monitors what is good high school doing research soda 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.629
 It is not made despite significant technological development of this time 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:24.690
 Another scene is suddenly in front of you 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:29.970
 As dangers appear this is for example from among the vehicles parked in the city 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.900
 People This Well came a little jump out than not in time even over the other brake 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.080
 Suddenly 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:41.860
 If it is not good to correspond to the touch of the gram by the instruction to turn the steer 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:45.140
 If you can not do it, the car will automatically turn off the emergency and it will appear in front of you 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:51.140
 Reasons to carry out avoiding obstacles 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:57.560
 In order to reduce the world's accidents at 23 cars , such safety technology 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:01.190
 We are putting great effort into putting in many cars 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:08.510
 Multi-sensing system using rear camera 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:13.800
 By this, various alarms can be realized by an inexpensive system to 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:18.480
 With the idea of helping to keep away from the danger of an accident 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:24.150
 Well, like this, all the old technology 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:26.299
 It is expected that we will hesitate to reduce the accident more by being widely used 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.299
 is
