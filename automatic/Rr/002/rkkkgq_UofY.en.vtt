00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
runs and go from there but we're not

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.399 
runs and go from there but we're not
gonna<00:06:21.699> abandon<00:06:22.569> it<00:06:22.840> because<00:06:22.960> we<00:06:23.289> obviously

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
ourselves out of this rut and we will

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.910 
ourselves out of this rut and we will
maybe<00:06:52.720> it<00:06:52.870> doesn't<00:06:53.110> matter<00:06:53.290> but<00:06:53.590> there<00:06:53.800> was<00:06:53.890> a

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920 
maybe it doesn't matter but there was a

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.800 
maybe it doesn't matter but there was a
couple<00:06:54.160> other<00:06:54.250> close<00:06:54.760> calls<00:06:55.090> that<00:06:55.300> didn't<00:06:55.570> I

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
couple other close calls that didn't I
