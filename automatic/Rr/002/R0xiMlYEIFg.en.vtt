00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
games on a VR headset and that's the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.030 
games on a VR headset and that's the
bottom<00:00:56.040> line<00:00:56.280> but<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.990> step<00:00:58.380> in<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.680> right

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
bottom line but it's a step in the right

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.740 
bottom line but it's a step in the right
direction<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.970> a<00:01:00.090> step<00:01:00.360> in<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.630> direction

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
direction it's a step in the direction

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.399 
direction it's a step in the direction
of<00:01:01.350> virtual<00:01:02.340> reality<00:01:02.370> which<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.450> awesome<00:01:03.660> and

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
of virtual reality which is awesome and

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.499 
of virtual reality which is awesome and
while<00:01:04.829> project<00:01:05.339> Morpheus<00:01:05.789> isn't<00:01:06.119> what<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> lot

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
while project Morpheus isn't what a lot

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.510 
while project Morpheus isn't what a lot
of<00:01:06.539> people<00:01:06.659> think<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.319> I<00:01:07.530> still<00:01:08.069> think<00:01:08.100> it's

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
of people think it is I still think it's

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.730 
of people think it is I still think it's
opening<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> doors<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.289> future<00:01:10.710> of

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
opening the doors for the future of

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.880 
opening the doors for the future of
gaming<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.600> what<00:01:12.600> gaming<00:01:12.990> could<00:01:13.289> be<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
gaming and what gaming could be in the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.889 
gaming and what gaming could be in the
future<00:01:14.249> now<00:01:14.429> I'm<00:01:14.609> not<00:01:14.789> saying<00:01:15.060> project

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
future now I'm not saying project

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.599 
future now I'm not saying project
Morpheus<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.469> going<00:01:16.649> to<00:01:16.710> be<00:01:16.799> successful<00:01:17.189> I

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:17.609 
Morpheus is going to be successful I

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.279 
Morpheus is going to be successful I
think<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.359> be<00:01:18.509> really<00:01:18.749> hard<00:01:19.200> for

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
think it's going to be really hard for

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.469 
think it's going to be really hard for
project<00:01:19.889> Morpheus<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.609> successful<00:01:21.270> I

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
project Morpheus to be successful I

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.989 
project Morpheus to be successful I
think<00:01:22.049> oculus<00:01:22.530> rift<00:01:22.829> will<00:01:23.159> be<00:01:23.280> much<00:01:23.670> more

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:23.999 
think oculus rift will be much more

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:26.809 
think oculus rift will be much more
successful<00:01:24.229> than<00:01:25.229> project<00:01:25.770> Morpheus<00:01:26.189> only

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
successful than project Morpheus only

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.940 
successful than project Morpheus only
because<00:01:27.210> oculus<00:01:28.109> rift<00:01:28.350> will<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.740> higher

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
because oculus rift will have higher

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.209 
because oculus rift will have higher
resolutions<00:01:29.819> um<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.659> will<00:01:30.780> depend<00:01:31.109> on<00:01:31.469> what<00:01:31.709> PC

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
resolutions um it will depend on what PC

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:34.129 
resolutions um it will depend on what PC
you're<00:01:32.429> running<00:01:32.880> things<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.899> can

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:34.139 
you're running things like that you can

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:36.980 
you're running things like that you can
always<00:01:34.380> upgrade<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:35.249> can<00:01:35.399> put<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.729> 3gp<00:01:36.539> use<00:01:36.780> in

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
always upgrade you can put to 3gp use in

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.340 
always upgrade you can put to 3gp use in
your<00:01:37.079> PC<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:38.039> can<00:01:38.069> upgrade<00:01:38.490> your<00:01:38.729> ps4<00:01:39.179> and<00:01:39.719> the

your PC you can upgrade your ps4 and the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.620 
your PC you can upgrade your ps4 and the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
sick from it so I think people with any

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.100 
sick from it so I think people with any
motion<00:02:35.310> sickness<00:02:35.579> problems<00:02:36.209> like<00:02:36.390> me<00:02:36.599> aren't

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
motion sickness problems like me aren't

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.500 
motion sickness problems like me aren't
going<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.739> be<00:02:37.860> able<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.220> use<00:02:38.459> this<00:02:38.700> yet<00:02:39.120> maybe

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
going to be able to use this yet maybe

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.420 
going to be able to use this yet maybe
in<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.870> future<00:02:40.019> they<00:02:40.409> figure<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.829> out<00:02:40.980> they

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
in the future they figure it out they

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.460 
in the future they figure it out they
figure<00:02:41.760> out<00:02:41.879> how<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.150> not<00:02:42.480> give<00:02:42.750> people<00:02:43.110> motion

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
figure out how to not give people motion

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.130 
figure out how to not give people motion
sickness<00:02:43.709> but<00:02:44.400> as<00:02:44.579> of<00:02:44.790> right<00:02:44.849> now<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.569> don't

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
sickness but as of right now I don't

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.990 
sickness but as of right now I don't
think<00:02:46.349> I'll<00:02:46.470> be<00:02:46.590> able<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.799> use<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.190> stuff<00:02:47.459> but

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
think I'll be able to use this stuff but

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.759 
think I'll be able to use this stuff but
I<00:02:48.030> still<00:02:48.480> want<00:02:48.810> them<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.109> move<00:02:49.290> forward<00:02:49.590> with

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
I still want them to move forward with

guess to be successful project Morpheus
an<00:02:58.530> oculus<00:02:58.920> rift<00:02:59.159> could<00:02:59.370> be<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.670> beginning<00:02:59.790> of

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
an oculus rift could be the beginning of

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.349 
an oculus rift could be the beginning of
you<00:03:00.750> stepping<00:03:01.230> into<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.680> room<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:03.090> and

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
being inside a video game there's so

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.490 
being inside a video game there's so
many<00:03:05.970> ways<00:03:06.209> they<00:03:06.510> could<00:03:06.569> go<00:03:06.840> forward<00:03:07.170> with

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
many ways they could go forward with

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.530 
many ways they could go forward with
this<00:03:07.650> technology<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:08.609> in<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.060> future<00:03:09.420> it

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
this technology and in the future it

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.390 
this technology and in the future it
could<00:03:09.659> be<00:03:09.840> just<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.290> most<00:03:10.530> amazing<00:03:10.739> thing

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
don't think project Morpheus is going to

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.110 
don't think project Morpheus is going to
be<00:03:34.169> that<00:03:34.530> successful<00:03:35.000> hopefully<00:03:36.000> it's

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
be that successful hopefully it's

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.170 
be that successful hopefully it's
