00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.460
 very good this is just sheet metal and paint 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:11.520
 and today what we are going to see is how 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.800
 remove a speck in an original way 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.800
 and with a homemade sander whenever you want 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.180
 that's a toothbrush 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.300
 and we are going to remove 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.810
 it's worth more has already pointed out the mota vale 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.940
 perfectly 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.300
 we see it there 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.660
 it's pretty big ok let's remove 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.660
 the weed 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.829
 so you're giving it a grain 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.940
 1000 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.940
 until eliminate 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.810
 eliminate the around 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.820
 this function in sight 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.140
 in many smaller 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.070
 you can also appreciate 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.820
 now they can go down because if they are not going to 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.820
 wet 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.750
 ah 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.530
 and now let's fine tune with 1500 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.740
 we wet a little so that the containers 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.049
 we open ourselves a little 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.850
 It is very little because it is not noticed 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.729
 created by the first grain 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.000
 and practically studying for is for 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.000
 Polish 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.390
 OK, perfect 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.950
 and now you are going to use a polisher 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.670
 little 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.670
 OK 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.870
 at first I do very low turns 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.870
 so that the material is cutting 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:22.600
 and when the mate part is eliminated 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.600
 of the sandpaper 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.090
 when we are going to change a whore 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.850
 to polish 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.790
 good we passed the cloth 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.120
 and a little bit will show good for 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.120
 to regret 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.030
 and hours more laps we give 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.590
 a little dressing 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.590
 the drop disappeared 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.590
 with a totally homemade sander and 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.590
 cheap 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.790
 very well 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.790
 thank you very much
