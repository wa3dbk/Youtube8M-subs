really<00:00:54.510> good<00:00:54.600> games<00:00:54.809> because<00:00:55.079> he<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:56.039> know<00:00:56.160> how

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
really good games because he we know how

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.529 
really good games because he we know how
to<00:00:56.340> play<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.640> diners<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.000> dives<00:00:57.120> know<00:00:57.300> how<00:00:57.480> we

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
to play on diners and dives know how we

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
should be playing around him so that's a

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.959 
should be playing around him so that's a
big<00:00:58.980> change<00:00:59.129> for<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> season<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.789> think

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
big change for the season that I think

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.279 
big change for the season that I think
we're<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.570> constantly<00:01:00.750> figuring<00:01:01.020> out<00:01:01.230> how

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
we're just constantly figuring out how

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.360 
we're just constantly figuring out how
we<00:01:01.320> should<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.649> playing<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.010> what's<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.190> best

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
we should be playing and what's the best

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.950 
we should be playing and what's the best
of<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> team<00:01:02.699> can<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.480> talk<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.719> me<00:01:03.809> more

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
putting a little bit more time and

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.789 
putting a little bit more time and
effort<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> dyrus<00:01:06.930> was<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.650> come

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799

into<00:01:07.920> practicing<00:01:08.369> hey<00:01:08.520> let's<00:01:08.670> try<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.820> gank

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
into practicing hey let's try to gank

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.370 
into practicing hey let's try to gank
for<00:01:09.180> divers<00:01:09.420> three<00:01:09.570> times<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.900> game<00:01:10.110> or<00:01:10.290> what

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
for divers three times this game or what

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.620 
for divers three times this game or what
would<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.590> take<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.770> learn<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.520> style<00:01:11.970> well

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
would it take to learn that style well

really really interesting battles as

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.399 
really really interesting battles as
what<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.150> understand<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.689> main<00:01:40.170> shot

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
what I understand is the main shot

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.780 
what I understand is the main shot
caller<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.799> team<00:01:40.950> how<00:01:41.159> do<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.340> keep<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
caller for the team how do you keep the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.730 
caller for the team how do you keep the
team<00:01:41.970> focus<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.479> how<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.750> understand

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
team focus and how do you understand

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.350 
team focus and how do you understand
like<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> next<00:01:44.130> five<00:01:44.310> minutes<00:01:44.549> goals<00:01:44.909> when

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
like the next five minutes goals when

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.730 
like the next five minutes goals when
you're<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.600> game<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.990> keeps<00:01:46.470> going<00:01:46.680> back

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
you're in a game that keeps going back

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.100 
you're in a game that keeps going back
and<00:01:46.860> forth<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.399> it's<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.420> hard<00:01:48.509> to

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
and forth like this it's really hard to

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.060 
and forth like this it's really hard to
really<00:01:49.259> talk<00:01:49.439> all<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.770> game<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:49.920> this

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
really talk all in a game like this

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.469 
really talk all in a game like this
because<00:01:50.340> we<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.970> control<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.390> we're

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
because we have the control but we're

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.940 
because we have the control but we're
losing<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.869> team<00:01:52.020> fights<00:01:52.229> because<00:01:52.380> they<00:01:52.860> have

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
losing the team fights because they have

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.990 
losing the team fights because they have
a<00:01:52.979> really<00:01:53.159> strong<00:01:53.189> team<00:01:53.460> find<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> comp<00:01:53.880> with

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
a really strong team find a comp with

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.700 
a really strong team find a comp with
Rumble<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.479> when<00:01:54.570> tristana<00:01:54.899> reach<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.409> late

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
Rumble and when tristana reach that late

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.620 
Rumble and when tristana reach that late
game<00:01:55.860> point<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.820> really<00:01:57.149> hard<00:01:57.270> because<00:01:57.329> we

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
game point so is really hard because we

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.999 
game point so is really hard because we
were<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:58.140> were<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.350> control<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:58.799> we<00:01:58.890> would

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
were we were in control but we would

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.170 
were we were in control but we would
just<00:01:59.159> weren't<00:01:59.280> able<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.610> win<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.759> team<00:01:59.969> fights

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
just weren't able to win the team fights

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.209 
just weren't able to win the team fights
