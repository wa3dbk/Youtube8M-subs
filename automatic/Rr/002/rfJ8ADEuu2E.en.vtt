00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.470 
physical game we knew the teams that
we'd<00:03:56.580> played<00:03:56.790> before<00:03:56.940> they<00:03:57.240> were<00:03:57.330> really

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
we'd played before they were really

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.700 
we'd played before they were really
close<00:03:57.690> with<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:58.080> we<00:03:58.140> were<00:03:58.230> close<00:03:58.350> with<00:03:58.560> as

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
close with that we were close with as

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.500 
close with that we were close with as
well<00:03:58.890> so<00:03:59.490> we<00:03:59.700> were<00:03:59.760> getting<00:03:59.940> ready<00:04:00.030> for<00:04:00.150> just<00:04:00.450> a

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
well so we were getting ready for just a

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.850 
well so we were getting ready for just a
slugfest<00:04:00.750> that's<00:04:01.230> what<00:04:01.350> it<00:04:01.440> turned<00:04:01.620> out<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.740> be

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
slugfest that's what it turned out to be

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.610 
slugfest that's what it turned out to be
in<00:04:02.010> our<00:04:02.130> defense<00:04:02.460> just<00:04:02.880> pick<00:04:03.120> this<00:04:03.210> up<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:04.140> like

in our defense just pick this up I like

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.810 
in our defense just pick this up I like
to<00:04:04.650> have<00:04:04.860> in<00:04:05.010> all<00:04:05.130> year<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.430> we<00:04:05.520> were<00:04:05.610> able<00:04:05.640> to

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
to have in all year and we were able to

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.640 
to have in all year and we were able to
come<00:04:06.000> back<00:04:06.150> get<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.420> win<00:04:06.630> all<00:04:07.080> along<00:04:07.410> in<00:04:07.560> the

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
come back get the win all along in the

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.050 
come back get the win all along in the
first<00:04:07.860> half<00:04:08.160> of<00:04:08.310> games<00:04:08.490> we<00:04:08.670> were<00:04:08.760> shutting

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
first half of games we were shutting

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.570 
first half of games we were shutting
teams<00:04:09.240> down<00:04:09.450> on<00:04:09.660> defense<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.320> I<00:04:11.100> think<00:04:11.130> today

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
teams down on defense and I think today

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.010 
teams down on defense and I think today
they<00:04:11.730> kind<00:04:11.940> of<00:04:12.000> jumped<00:04:12.300> on<00:04:12.390> us<00:04:12.600> right<00:04:12.780> off<00:04:12.900> the

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
they kind of jumped on us right off the

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.680 
they kind of jumped on us right off the
bat<00:04:13.170> on<00:04:13.320> that<00:04:13.380> 55<00:04:13.920> yard<00:04:14.250> touchdown<00:04:14.610> run<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.600> we

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
bat on that 55 yard touchdown run and we

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.479 
bat on that 55 yard touchdown run and we
knew<00:04:15.840> right<00:04:15.870> away<00:04:16.049> we<00:04:16.470> had<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.830> kind<00:04:17.100> of<00:04:17.220> settle

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
knew right away we had to kind of settle

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.460 
knew right away we had to kind of settle
just<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:18.420> make<00:04:18.540> some<00:04:18.690> plays<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.170> we<00:04:19.230> did<00:04:19.350> that

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
just to make some plays and we did that

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.930 
just to make some plays and we did that
in<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.620> second<00:04:19.890> half<00:04:19.920> I<00:04:20.370> think<00:04:20.700> they've

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
in the second half I think they've

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.730 
in the second half I think they've
credit<00:04:21.209> to<00:04:21.270> our<00:04:21.299> defense<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:21.750> tried<00:04:21.989> hard<00:04:22.140> we

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
credit to our defense you tried hard we

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.380 
credit to our defense you tried hard we
were<00:04:22.800> ripping<00:04:22.980> and<00:04:23.190> tearing<00:04:23.310> all<00:04:23.580> game<00:04:23.850> they

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
were ripping and tearing all game they

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.000 
were ripping and tearing all game they
have<00:04:24.480> some<00:04:24.600> wild<00:04:24.750> play<00:04:25.020> some<00:04:25.260> wild<00:04:25.500> plays<00:04:25.710> but

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
have some wild play some wild plays but

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.790
