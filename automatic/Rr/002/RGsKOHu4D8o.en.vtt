toxicity<00:04:08.670> so<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.480> want<00:04:09.660> to<00:04:09.720> use<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.870> safe<00:04:10.380> fat

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
toxicity so you want to use a safe fat

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.850 
toxicity so you want to use a safe fat
other<00:04:11.549> safe<00:04:11.970> fats<00:04:12.239> could<00:04:12.510> be<00:04:12.660> using<00:04:13.080> animal

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
other safe fats could be using animal

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.860 
other safe fats could be using animal
fats<00:04:14.100> like<00:04:14.420> lard<00:04:15.420> from<00:04:15.720> organic

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
fats like lard from organic

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.719 
fats like lard from organic
pasture-raised<00:04:18.870> hogs<00:04:19.260> lard<00:04:20.160> would<00:04:20.370> be<00:04:20.489> a<00:04:20.519> good

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
pasture-raised hogs lard would be a good

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.420 
pasture-raised hogs lard would be a good
oil<00:04:21.060> or<00:04:21.419> other<00:04:22.320> animal<00:04:22.860> oils<00:04:23.160> could

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
oil or other animal oils could

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.640 
oil or other animal oils could
substitute<00:04:23.970> or<00:04:24.300> even<00:04:24.570> butter<00:04:24.780> it's<00:04:25.050> just<00:04:25.260> it's

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
substitute or even butter it's just it's

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.440 
substitute or even butter it's just it's
easy<00:04:25.950> to

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
easy to

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.720 
easy to
but<00:04:26.720> ER<00:04:26.840> so<00:04:27.350> I<00:04:27.380> prefer<00:04:27.820> not<00:04:28.820> to<00:04:28.850> use<00:04:29.090> butter<00:04:30.730> so

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
but ER so I prefer not to use butter so

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.630 
but ER so I prefer not to use butter so
we<00:04:31.850> put<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:32.060> big<00:04:32.390> dollop<00:04:32.810> of<00:04:33.170> coconut<00:04:34.010> oil<00:04:34.130> right

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
we put a big dollop of coconut oil right

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.670 
we put a big dollop of coconut oil right
into<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.030> pan<00:04:35.240> now<00:04:35.450> you<00:04:35.510> notice<00:04:36.080> I'm<00:04:36.230> using<00:04:36.260> my

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
into the pan now you notice I'm using my

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.890 
into the pan now you notice I'm using my
hands<00:04:37.130> I<00:04:37.280> plane<00:04:37.940> my<00:04:38.150> hands<00:04:38.510> so<00:04:38.630> they're<00:04:38.750> not

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
hands I plane my hands so they're not

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.920 
hands I plane my hands so they're not
filthy<00:04:39.740> dirty<00:04:39.950> even<00:04:40.400> though<00:04:40.450> coconut<00:04:41.450> oil<00:04:41.630> has

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
filthy dirty even though coconut oil has

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.350 
filthy dirty even though coconut oil has
antibacterial<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:43.430> antiviral<00:04:43.760> properties

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
antibacterial and antiviral properties

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.050 
antibacterial and antiviral properties
so<00:04:44.840> it<00:04:45.290> probably<00:04:45.620> kills<00:04:46.190> any<00:04:46.430> bacteria<00:04:46.460> that<00:04:47.030> I

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
so it probably kills any bacteria that I

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.360 
so it probably kills any bacteria that I
might<00:04:47.240> have<00:04:47.750> on<00:04:47.900> my<00:04:48.020> hand<00:04:48.290> but<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:48.950> advantage

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
might have on my hand but the advantage

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.270 
might have on my hand but the advantage
of<00:04:49.520> that<00:04:49.640> is<00:04:49.880> now<00:04:50.120> I<00:04:50.360> have<00:04:50.990> a<00:04:51.020> nice<00:04:51.350> hand

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
of that is now I have a nice hand

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.210 
of that is now I have a nice hand
oil<00:04:52.940> on<00:04:53.510> my<00:04:53.930> hands<00:04:54.170> that<00:04:54.290> I<00:04:54.380> can<00:04:54.590> rub<00:04:54.800> in<00:04:54.950> later

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
oil on my hands that I can rub in later

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.630 
oil on my hands that I can rub in later
okay<00:04:55.970> so<00:04:56.030> we<00:04:56.270> want<00:04:56.480> to<00:04:56.630> turn<00:04:57.230> on<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.740> gas<00:05:00.640> which

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
okay so we want to turn on the gas which

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:08.050 
okay so we want to turn on the gas which
it<00:05:01.880> as<00:05:02.060> you<00:05:02.240> can<00:05:02.390> see<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:07.160> heat<00:05:07.520> it<00:05:07.670> up<00:05:07.760> first

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
it as you can see and heat it up first

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.720 
it as you can see and heat it up first
we<00:05:08.810> want<00:05:09.050> to<00:05:09.170> heat<00:05:09.530> up<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.830> pan<00:05:10.070> before<00:05:10.430> we<00:05:10.550> add

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
we want to heat up the pan before we add

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.850 
we want to heat up the pan before we add
the<00:05:10.910> eggs<00:05:12.040> so<00:05:13.040> now<00:05:13.190> we<00:05:13.250> add<00:05:13.490> the<00:05:13.640> eggs<00:05:13.850> to<00:05:14.860> the

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
the eggs so now we add the eggs to the

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:30.589 
the eggs so now we add the eggs to the
heated<00:05:16.220> pan

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:37.399 

turn<00:05:31.599> down<00:05:31.780> the<00:05:31.840> heat<00:05:33.330> and<00:05:34.330> now<00:05:34.900> we<00:05:34.960> want<00:05:35.500> to

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
turn down the heat and now we want to

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:44.670 
turn down the heat and now we want to
baste<00:05:41.099> the<00:05:42.099> top<00:05:42.430> to<00:05:42.939> cook<00:05:43.180> the<00:05:43.389> top<00:05:44.379> of<00:05:44.590> the

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
baste the top to cook the top of the

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.950 
baste the top to cook the top of the
eggs<00:05:44.830> with<00:05:45.069> the<00:05:45.099> hot<00:05:45.460> oil<00:05:46.889> just<00:05:47.889> when<00:05:48.280> the<00:05:48.960> top

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
eggs with the hot oil just when the top

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.480 
eggs with the hot oil just when the top
of<00:05:50.319> the<00:05:50.439> yolk<00:05:50.710> is<00:05:50.949> white<00:05:51.219> from<00:05:51.610> the<00:05:51.759> hot<00:05:51.969> oil<00:05:53.490> we

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
of the yolk is white from the hot oil we

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.300 
of the yolk is white from the hot oil we
want<00:05:54.849> to<00:05:55.150> quickly<00:05:55.719> take<00:05:56.469> the<00:05:56.530> egg<00:05:56.889> out<00:05:57.129> of<00:05:57.189> the

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
want to quickly take the egg out of the

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.559 
want to quickly take the egg out of the
pan<00:05:57.610> so<00:05:58.270> the<00:05:58.389> idea<00:05:58.719> here<00:05:58.780> is<00:05:59.379> to<00:05:59.889> keep<00:06:00.490> the<00:06:01.210> yolk

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:01.569 
pan so the idea here is to keep the yolk

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:04.200 
pan so the idea here is to keep the yolk
running<00:06:02.229> and<00:06:02.620> the<00:06:03.340> reason<00:06:03.639> we<00:06:03.729> want<00:06:03.969> to<00:06:04.030> do

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
running and the reason we want to do

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.490 
running and the reason we want to do
that<00:06:04.360> is<00:06:04.629> we<00:06:04.810> don't<00:06:05.050> want<00:06:05.199> to<00:06:05.770> cook<00:06:06.900> away<00:06:07.900> all

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
that is we don't want to cook away all

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.740 
that is we don't want to cook away all
the<00:06:08.919> nutrients<00:06:09.550> that<00:06:09.610> are<00:06:09.940> contained<00:06:10.569> in<00:06:10.690> the

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
the nutrients that are contained in the

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.740 
the nutrients that are contained in the
egg<00:06:10.960> yolk<00:06:11.289> and<00:06:11.500> we<00:06:11.620> want<00:06:11.860> don't<00:06:12.190> want<00:06:12.280> to

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
egg yolk and we want don't want to

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.290 
egg yolk and we want don't want to
denature<00:06:13.750> the<00:06:13.780> cholesterol<00:06:14.819> so<00:06:15.819> here<00:06:16.000> we<00:06:16.120> have

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
denature the cholesterol so here we have

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.399 
denature the cholesterol so here we have
it<00:06:17.159> very<00:06:18.159> simple<00:06:18.669> we're<00:06:19.509> getting<00:06:19.779> our<00:06:19.930> protein

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:20.409 
it very simple we're getting our protein

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:23.640 
it very simple we're getting our protein
we're<00:06:20.770> getting<00:06:21.069> healthy<00:06:21.490> fats<00:06:21.789> and<00:06:22.599> all<00:06:23.469> we

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
we're getting healthy fats and all we

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.559 
we're getting healthy fats and all we
need<00:06:23.770> to<00:06:23.830> do<00:06:24.069> is<00:06:24.250> add<00:06:24.490> some<00:06:24.520> source<00:06:25.360> of

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:25.569 
need to do is add some source of

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.990 
need to do is add some source of
carbohydrates<00:06:26.289> to<00:06:26.379> this<00:06:26.560> this<00:06:26.770> could<00:06:26.949> be<00:06:27.009> you

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
carbohydrates to this this could be you

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.269 
carbohydrates to this this could be you
could<00:06:28.150> fry<00:06:28.360> potatoes<00:06:29.020> with<00:06:29.349> it<00:06:29.590> you<00:06:29.919> could<00:06:30.129> add

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:30.279 
could fry potatoes with it you could add

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:32.249 
could fry potatoes with it you could add
some<00:06:30.610> rice<00:06:30.849> you<00:06:31.240> could<00:06:31.449> add<00:06:31.599> some<00:06:31.870> sprouted

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:32.259 
some rice you could add some sprouted
