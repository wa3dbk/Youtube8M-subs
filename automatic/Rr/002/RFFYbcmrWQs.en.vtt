00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:12.360
 today we'll talk about running 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:15.719
 but not an easy run so let's call it a taxi 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.310
 for stone this is used in the exercise 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.520
 hand-to-hand fight then so he learned something 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.120
 XIX century actually it is taken from 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.990
 practices still say so warrior dog u 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.650
 some schools of unarmed combat 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.720
 applied 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.250
 the meaning comes down to the fact that he is already on 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.710
 hikkami can take a dumbbell you took 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.329
 either in this position you need to keep 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.920
 either in such 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.150
 on half bent around the navel and all 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.770
 simple enough i mean you have to run 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.770
 hundred meters maximum speed 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.720
 run a hundred meters right away 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:02.540
 stop and do something about 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.540
 so exactly do at the same time squats and 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.409
 top when you start getting hit 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.409
 up stone 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.540
 did ten times 10 squats together 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.560
 with a punch 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:26.840
 it's good for explosive power to strike and 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.840
 stamina and ran again 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.770
 the task is not to release the stone from the hands of this 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:48.440
 it will seem easy 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:50.180
 stone is taken or dumbbell here 10 to 25 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.600
 kilogram dependence depending on weight 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.640
 yours 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:59.470
 and there are such circles that is jogging 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.430
 squatting with punches 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:09.890
 I need to do if for 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:13.220
 hand-to-hand combat from 30 to 100 times well i 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.360
 I'll say this in 10 15 circles 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.940
 you brush that to your hands really 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.210
 pain come decree operetta this 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.110
 then we would not even be clear that 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.080
 the most you have 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.570
 numb hands or feet or refuse breath 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.590
 points that is it is a complex specifically for 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.170
 martial arts 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:39.290
 how cardio as a workout 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:42.920
 explosive power and unequivocally endurance 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.520
 Fighting which above all 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.580
 It is necessary for any fighter except 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:54.140
 ability to only beat will call 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:57.459
 this taxi is for stone and kill from the hill 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.459
