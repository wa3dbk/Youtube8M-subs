a<00:02:20.500> lot<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.740> people<00:02:20.860> would<00:02:21.010> be<00:02:21.100> done<00:02:21.720> but<00:02:23.010> still

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
a lot of people would be done but still

a lot of people would be done but still
Del<00:02:25.990> Rio<00:02:26.170> should<00:02:26.440> have<00:02:26.560> been<00:02:26.680> champion<00:02:27.070> a<00:02:27.130> long

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
Del Rio should have been champion a long

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.830 
Del Rio should have been champion a long
time<00:02:27.490> ago<00:02:27.610> Sheamus<00:02:27.850> has<00:02:28.090> been<00:02:28.240> champion<00:02:28.600> since

history<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.910> my<00:02:34.030> knowledge<00:02:34.260> most<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.440> rains

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
history to my knowledge most the rains

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.370 
history to my knowledge most the rains
are<00:02:36.010> between<00:02:36.580> 100<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.690> 300<00:02:38.170> 100<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.460> 200<00:02:39.850> days

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
are between 100 and 300 100 and 200 days

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.320 
are between 100 and 300 100 and 200 days
so<00:02:41.380> that's<00:02:41.860> what<00:02:42.550> would<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.730> be<00:02:42.790> three

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
so that's what would that be three

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.280 
so that's what would that be three
months<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:44.550> six<00:02:45.550> months<00:02:45.700> about<00:02:46.300> approximately

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
months to six months about approximately

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.130 
months to six months about approximately
that<00:02:48.280> that's<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:48.730> longest<00:02:48.940> they<00:02:49.300> usually<00:02:49.960> go

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
that that's the longest they usually go

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.360 
that that's the longest they usually go
so<00:02:51.040> I<00:02:51.310> mean<00:02:52.120> they<00:02:52.720> definitely<00:02:53.500> do<00:02:53.770> swap<00:02:54.100> that

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
so I mean they definitely do swap that

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.570 
so I mean they definitely do swap that
quite<00:02:54.670> a<00:02:54.700> bit<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:55.140> mean<00:02:56.140> World<00:02:56.350> Heavyweight<00:02:56.580> w/e

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
quite a bit I mean World Heavyweight w/e

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.710 
quite a bit I mean World Heavyweight w/e
it's<00:02:57.970> more<00:02:58.800> five<00:02:59.800> months<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.250> about<00:03:00.720> nine

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
it's more five months to about nine

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.300 
it's more five months to about nine
months<00:03:01.930> is<00:03:02.230> what<00:03:02.440> they<00:03:02.560> usually<00:03:02.710> do<00:03:02.980> for<00:03:03.010> it

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
months is what they usually do for it

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.400 
months is what they usually do for it
depending<00:03:03.730> on<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.450> person<00:03:04.750> CM<00:03:05.020> Punk<00:03:05.200> spin

Sheamus losing cross armbreaker is

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.790 
Sheamus losing cross armbreaker is
deadly<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:37.050> even<00:04:38.050> though<00:04:38.139> Sheamus<00:04:38.470> isn't<00:04:38.620> one

of<00:04:46.720> my<00:04:46.840> prediction<00:04:47.199> i<00:04:47.259> expect<00:04:47.620> Sheamus<00:04:47.949> to

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
of my prediction i expect Sheamus to

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.330 
of my prediction i expect Sheamus to
have<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.490> very<00:04:49.150> good<00:04:49.300> match<00:04:50.250> definitely<00:04:51.250> get

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
have a very good match definitely get

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.939 
have a very good match definitely get
some<00:04:51.370> shots<00:04:51.729> in<00:04:51.940> Del<00:04:52.599> Rio<00:04:52.780> dominated<00:04:53.500> for<00:04:53.740> a

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
some shots in Del Rio dominated for a

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.379 
some shots in Del Rio dominated for a
good<00:04:54.370> portion<00:04:55.979> and<00:04:56.979> then<00:04:57.220> that's<00:04:58.030> pretty<00:04:58.240> much

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
good portion and then that's pretty much

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.020 
good portion and then that's pretty much
that<00:04:58.979> now<00:04:59.979> I<00:05:00.039> would<00:05:00.340> like<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:00.639> see<00:05:00.759> a<00:05:00.789> good

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
that now I would like to see a good

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.790 
that now I would like to see a good
back-and-forth<00:05:01.240> between<00:05:01.780> them<00:05:02.139> but<00:05:02.409> I<00:05:02.470> just

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
back-and-forth between them but I just

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.189 
back-and-forth between them but I just
can't<00:05:03.069> see<00:05:03.250> that<00:05:03.430> because<00:05:03.490> of<00:05:03.970> Sheamus<00:05:04.960> being

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
can't see that because of Sheamus being

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.909 
can't see that because of Sheamus being
injured<00:05:05.680> and<00:05:05.949> me<00:05:06.419> being<00:05:07.419> such<00:05:08.020> a<00:05:08.050> more<00:05:08.349> well

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
injured and me being such a more well

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:10.980 
injured and me being such a more well
he's<00:05:09.370> such<00:05:09.610> a<00:05:09.639> brawler<00:05:10.030> in<00:05:10.270> comparison<00:05:10.780> to

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
he's such a brawler in comparison to

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.730 
he's such a brawler in comparison to
feel<00:05:11.680> Rio<00:05:11.889> and<00:05:12.220> that's<00:05:12.340> just<00:05:12.720> you<00:05:13.720> know<00:05:14.620> what<00:05:14.710> I

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
feel Rio and that's just you know what I

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.809 
feel Rio and that's just you know what I
mean<00:05:14.919> so<00:05:15.880> I<00:05:15.909> do<00:05:16.060> expect<00:05:16.419> Del<00:05:16.930> Rio<00:05:17.139> to<00:05:17.289> end<00:05:18.009> up

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:18.819 
mean so I do expect Del Rio to end up

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.320 
mean so I do expect Del Rio to end up
beating<00:05:19.030> Sheamus<00:05:19.509> that<00:05:20.110> parts<00:05:20.409> of<00:05:20.500> given

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
beating Sheamus that parts of given

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.189 
beating Sheamus that parts of given
it'll<00:05:22.330> be<00:05:22.389> interesting<00:05:22.539> to<00:05:22.750> see<00:05:22.840> how<00:05:23.080> it

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.260 
happens and from here I'm feeling that
Shanna's<00:05:26.770> can<00:05:26.889> get<00:05:27.039> a<00:05:27.069> rematch<00:05:27.310> well<00:05:28.150> of
