here<00:00:02.280> is<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.820> average<00:00:03.060> amount<00:00:03.389> of<00:00:03.720> set-up

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
here is the average amount of set-up

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.440 
here is the average amount of set-up
time<00:00:04.350> I<00:00:04.560> use<00:00:04.830> when<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.640> hit<00:00:05.970> on<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.299> ball

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
time I use when I hit on the ball

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.440 
time I use when I hit on the ball
machine<00:00:06.870> it's<00:00:07.529> approximately<00:00:08.309> one<00:00:09.179> ball

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
machine it's approximately one ball

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.749 
machine it's approximately one ball
every<00:00:09.960> five<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.590> five<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.040> half<00:00:11.099> seconds

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
every five to five and a half seconds

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.209 
every five to five and a half seconds
and<00:00:12.330> as<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.630> can<00:00:12.780> see<00:00:13.080> at<00:00:13.349> that<00:00:13.530> rate<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.920> feed

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
and as you can see at that rate of feed

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.540 
and as you can see at that rate of feed
I<00:00:14.250> have<00:00:14.639> an<00:00:14.880> ample<00:00:15.120> time<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.900> do<00:00:16.800> my<00:00:17.010> footwork

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
I have an ample time to do my footwork

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.179 
I have an ample time to do my footwork
and<00:00:18.060> my<00:00:18.270> racket<00:00:18.660> prep<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.230> actually<00:00:20.010> put<00:00:20.160> a

and my racket prep and actually put a
pretty<00:00:20.550> good<00:00:20.699> swing<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.240> hit<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.449> ball

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
pretty good swing and hit the ball

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.500 
pretty good swing and hit the ball

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.150 
lower left-hand corner here in a minute
is<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.760> drill<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.420> I'm<00:00:30.539> using<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:31.109> improve<00:00:31.980> my

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
is a drill that I'm using to improve my

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.090 
is a drill that I'm using to improve my
footwork<00:00:32.610> my<00:00:32.940> racket<00:00:33.390> prep<00:00:33.660> shorten<00:00:34.559> my<00:00:34.590> swing

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
footwork my racket prep shorten my swing

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.709 
footwork my racket prep shorten my swing
a<00:00:35.309> bit<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.820> most<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.690> all<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.500> like<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:39.480> drill

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
a bit and most of all I like the drill

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.540 
a bit and most of all I like the drill
because<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.320> absolutely<00:00:40.440> forces<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.460> to

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
because it absolutely forces you to

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.490 
because it absolutely forces you to
forget<00:00:41.879> about<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.239> ball<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:42.719> hit<00:00:43.260> and

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
forget about the ball you just hit and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.690 
forget about the ball you just hit and
it<00:00:44.100> really<00:00:44.460> trains<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.210> keep<00:00:45.870> your<00:00:46.079> eyes

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
it really trains you to keep your eyes

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.180 
it really trains you to keep your eyes
on<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.030> incoming<00:00:48.510> ball<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.140> not<00:00:49.770> really<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
on the incoming ball and not really to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.920 
on the incoming ball and not really to
follow<00:00:50.430> whatever<00:00:50.730> your<00:00:51.059> shot<00:00:51.329> does<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.870> you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
follow whatever your shot does so you

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.990 
follow whatever your shot does so you
hit<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.530> goes<00:00:52.739> away<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.070> never<00:00:53.489> look<00:00:53.789> up

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
hit it it goes away you never look up

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.150 
hit it it goes away you never look up
you<00:00:54.270> don't<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.170> pick<00:00:55.680> up<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.980> next

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
you don't you just pick up the next

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.189 
you don't you just pick up the next
incoming<00:00:56.579> ball<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.210> concentrate<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.020> that

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
incoming ball and concentrate on that

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.399 
incoming ball and concentrate on that
and<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:59.989> use<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.230> drill<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:02.460> kind<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.969> a

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
and I use this drill it's kind of a

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.090 
and I use this drill it's kind of a
drill<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:05.420> was<00:01:06.420> inspired<00:01:06.990> by<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.350> drill

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
drill that was inspired by a drill

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.770 
drill that was inspired by a drill
that's<00:01:08.369> similar<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.210> saw<00:01:09.540> Victoria

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
that's similar that I saw Victoria

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:36.270 
that's similar that I saw Victoria
Azarenka<00:01:10.320> doing

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:54.899 

I<00:01:50.220> should<00:01:51.220> also<00:01:51.369> add<00:01:51.549> that<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:54.340> balls<00:01:54.580> being

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
I should also add that the balls being

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.940 
I should also add that the balls being
fed<00:01:55.300> in<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.630> lower<00:01:56.110> picture<00:01:56.470> and<00:01:56.800> picture

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
fed in the lower picture and picture

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
fed in the lower picture and picture
video<00:01:57.340> are<00:01:58.080> set<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.350> same<00:01:59.619> speed<00:02:00.100> as<00:02:00.399> the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
video are set to the same speed as the

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.490 
video are set to the same speed as the
big<00:02:01.390> picture<00:02:01.420> balls<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:03.670> just<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.299> setup<00:02:05.200> for

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
big picture balls it's just a setup for

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.469 
big picture balls it's just a setup for
comparison<00:02:06.130> purposes<00:02:06.670> that<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.210> rate<00:02:07.450> of

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
comparison purposes that the rate of

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.040 
comparison purposes that the rate of
speed<00:02:08.080> is<00:02:08.320> about<00:02:09.160> one<00:02:09.489> ball<00:02:09.820> every<00:02:10.630> three

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
speed is about one ball every three

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.690 
speed is about one ball every three
seconds<00:02:11.590> in<00:02:11.739> that<00:02:11.920> lower<00:02:12.160> picture-in-picture

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
seconds in that lower picture-in-picture

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.180 
seconds in that lower picture-in-picture
so<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.480> ball<00:02:13.630> gets<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.290> really<00:02:14.650> fast<00:02:14.920> you

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
so the ball gets to you really fast you

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.070 
so the ball gets to you really fast you
just<00:02:15.220> really<00:02:16.120> have<00:02:16.239> to<00:02:16.360> concentrate<00:02:16.570> on<00:02:16.989> the

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
just really have to concentrate on the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.990 
just really have to concentrate on the
next<00:02:17.260> ball<00:02:17.470> whereas<00:02:17.830> in<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.190> in<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.820> big

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
next ball whereas in the in the big

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.790 
next ball whereas in the in the big
picture<00:02:19.239> you<00:02:19.540> got<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.750> lot<00:02:19.959> of<00:02:20.080> time<00:02:20.320> it's<00:02:20.590> one

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
picture you got a lot of time it's one

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.170 
picture you got a lot of time it's one
every<00:02:21.069> five<00:02:21.310> seconds<00:02:22.830> so<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:24.130> makes<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:25.000> big

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
every five seconds so it makes a big

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.000 
every five seconds so it makes a big
difference<00:02:25.569> and<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:25.900> hope<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:26.739> drills

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
difference and I hope that this drills

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.300 
difference and I hope that this drills
gonna<00:02:27.160> really<00:02:28.470> make<00:02:29.470> me<00:02:29.680> be<00:02:29.830> more<00:02:30.010> prepared

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
gonna really make me be more prepared

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.720 
gonna really make me be more prepared
and<00:02:30.790> really<00:02:31.480> work<00:02:31.690> on<00:02:31.930> not<00:02:32.920> really<00:02:33.130> caring

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
and really work on not really caring

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.190 
and really work on not really caring
what<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.120> do<00:02:34.360> with<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.720> ball<00:02:34.900> that<00:02:35.080> you're

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
what you do with the ball that you're

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.330 
what you do with the ball that you're
hitting<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.739> be<00:02:36.340> ready<00:02:36.550> for<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.850> next<00:02:37.150> one
