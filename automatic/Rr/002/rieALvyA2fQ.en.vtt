00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.670
 hello friends how are you and I do not come 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.480
 with a theme another type has been going up 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.930
 of videos but I wanted to talk with 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.840
 you about something that affects many 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.669
 people including myself though 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.329
 we try sometimes not to talk 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.160
 of this because they are things that hurt 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.809
 honestly it hurts whole however 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.210
 how we live in this society 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.899
 of people who only watch the part 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.570
 people's physics then sometimes 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.700
 we can not forget about 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.620
 certain things because they tell us 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.950
 always in the face tell us in the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.380
 faces things and people do not think 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.690
 when they say it and that's how he kept asking 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.329
 when they say it they say it to hurt 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.670
 or they say it to help I think I give it 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.309
 for both, there are people who say 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.979
 things to help you and there are others that 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.070
 they say because they know that that's where they 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.440
 it hurts a good one to me it does not hurt 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.040
 all of mine usually says something thousand 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.979
 Sometimes one does not hurt anymore but 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.240
 However, one has to be aware that 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.070
 if there are things that one can improve in 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.869
 our lives and I want to tell you that if 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.660
 I have things that I have to improve 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:32.530
 in my life especially physically more 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.780
 that everything but I am 100% sure that 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.670
 you also have something that you have to 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.850
 improve maybe you can have the best 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.360
 physical of the world but I'm sure friend 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.550
 that you have something that could improve 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.860
 because nobody is perfect can be you 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.800
 character can be the way that 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.080
 talks with people may be that you 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.119
 Angers very easily you can not 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.850
 be many things but in the way that 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.070
 they treated women because women who 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.509
 men look at them like animals and that's 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:07.660
 I totally dislike myself but I do what 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.810
 I want to talk today about my weight ok 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.830
 because my mom sat down to talk 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.310
 with me 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.740
 he says he has a desire and that desire is 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.440
 to see me thin and 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.740
 in good health because she says that she 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.690
 when you look at me look sick though 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.810
 You know that I've been with that 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.340
 tumors and treating me and all that but without 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:39.340
 However, if I could lose weight 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.840
 I would be much much better right now 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:47.800
 I'm weighing 296 pounds that are 135 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.820
 kilos when I started a diet of 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.530
 November of last year I weighed 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.230
 practically the same the incredible as 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.310
 that I carry this weight and here here I 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.640
 I stay my body fattens us more but I 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.960
 I began to lose weight I started a diet and 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.770
 it worked for me I lost 50 pounds and they have 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.800
 seen my video of at least january february 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.100
 of the year 2012 they will see a great 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.110
 Unlike how I look at myself right now 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.730
 so I said well you know I'm going to 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.110
 start to go back but my mom told me 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.900
 other things says felipe 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.080
 if losing 75 pounds makes it a great 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.540
 please for you because I do not have a 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.340
 car that bought it last year and are 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.320
 like five years of payment that are 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.540
 doing she said she was going to pay me the 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.540
 cart so that the weight is a 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.360
 initiative for me a motivation 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.030
 so I really looked at the eyes 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.610
 from my mom who is already old and everything 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.240
 but she wants to see me healthy 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.670
 then I on my day-to-day channel that 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.920
 here is the below I am posting 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.010
 video in the last these two three 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.650
 months of losing weight of the diet that I'm 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:08.060
 using what I'm taking is 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.890
 eating the exercise is whatever it is and what 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.390
 I'm going to do for her and I'm going to do it 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:17.299
 for me because I want to see myself better 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.870
 another day I went into clinical medium to 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:24.360
 buying clothes is my favorite store since 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.520
 I got a little sorry because 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.050
 We were practically an hour 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:35.550
 looking for a shirt that I had left 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:39.180
 there were some shirts so if they were left 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.580
 but in what he voted nothing, everything 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.800
 they were shocked by the belly and I 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.870
 said the girl as you may 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.729
 you do not have a xxl because if I stretch the 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.699
 who wants but I did not have questions 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.979
 pull if I fit then but it was a 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:59.129
 painful point because I looked so hard 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.470
 boys girls try on everything 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:05.490
 kind of clothes and I had that great desire 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:09.509
 to be able to try on those clothes but I could not 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.080
 because I did not stay then I said 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.509
 low 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.139
 man I have to do something and when 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:20.889
 they are not touring with a very difficult band 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:23.710
 and one that can not be on a diet 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:26.259
 seeing gold but already the tour finished already 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.750
 I will be practically here in the 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:31.990
 home for the following months then 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.840
 I do not have any excuse now I know 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.689
 that some of you instead of wanting 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.610
 support morally because that's what 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:42.939
 they make the comments when they let me 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.770
 they are going to tell me angel and see that come back from 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:47.169
 talk and talk and he's serious I know there's 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:51.490
 people who hate short if he has 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:53.500
 talked about that before although most 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:58.830
 of the fat and crazy people are not very 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:03.219
 very good very sentimental open mind 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.990
 they can be can even be the 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:07.629
 best friends because they already have 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.490
 that feeling inside of being rejected and 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:11.949
 when someone needs a friend they 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.020
 help but nevertheless there are always 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:17.550
 true people 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:19.949
 to criticize but I wish I have only 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:24.229
 moral in these in this situation because 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:24.229
 remember something and I finish with this 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:31.620
 and I am a person with a disease 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.560
 I am a person who has to take 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.740
 11 daily medications 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.600
 I am a person that I have to take 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.220
 steroids or from a person that I have 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.130
 to take medicine that takes 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:48.650
 chemotherapy to lower the tumor in my 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:51.229
 head I am a person who 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.820
 it happens with so strong leg pains 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:55.509
 for the medicine that sometimes I can not 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.509
 get out of bed 

00:06:55.689 --> 00:07:03.429
 I want to show everyone but more to me 

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:06.980
 mom and myself that if I do the 

00:07:03.429 --> 00:07:09.680
 I will achieve this effort 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:14.750
 everything can be done with force and 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:18.020
 will and with patience and I know what 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:20.450
 I can do because I did it almost a 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.210
 year and then I got fat again when 

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:26.780
 I wanted to go to Honduras and I got lost 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.270
 life totally but I do it for that 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.390
 same 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:35.430
 because I know I can do it even though I 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:37.050
 it's going to cost what I'm going to accomplish 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.690
 If you want to continue with the diet 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:44.970
 freeze down that I did day by day 

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:47.490
 with felipe in subscribe there and there he goes 

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:51.210
 be showing my weights and all this 

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:55.500
 starting a 295 pounds that are 135 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:57.180
 kilos and let's see how where it goes up to 

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.139
 then mine 

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.139
 see you
