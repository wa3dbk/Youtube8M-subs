just were signing riders so we've come a
long<00:00:20.550> ways<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.119> feel<00:00:21.449> now<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.810> we've<00:00:22.020> got<00:00:22.199> more

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
long ways I feel now that we've got more

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.590 
long ways I feel now that we've got more
into<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> pattern<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.160> week<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.359> week<00:00:24.390> out

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
into a pattern of week in and week out

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.660 
into a pattern of week in and week out
racing<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.260> we've<00:00:25.410> started<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.430> get<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
racing that we've started to get the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.250 
racing that we've started to get the
flow<00:00:26.849> going<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.330> starting<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.900> get<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.109> where

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
flow going and starting to get to where

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.259 
flow going and starting to get to where
we<00:00:28.380> need<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.619> pick<00:00:28.800> up<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:29.189> getting<00:00:29.970> everybody

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
we need to pick up on getting everybody

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.479 
we need to pick up on getting everybody
I<00:00:30.660> think<00:00:31.470> more<00:00:31.619> comfortable<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.279> bikes

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
I think more comfortable on the bikes

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.240 
I think more comfortable on the bikes
and<00:00:33.260> we're<00:00:34.260> getting<00:00:34.350> our<00:00:34.530> track<00:00:34.739> field<00:00:34.950> which

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
and we're getting our track field which

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.010 
and we're getting our track field which
is<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.550> help<00:00:35.610> out<00:00:35.850> quite<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> bit<00:00:36.210> and

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
is going to help out quite a bit and

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.540 
is going to help out quite a bit and
just<00:00:37.170> get<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> better<00:00:37.530> program<00:00:37.950> going<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.340> think

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
just get a better program going I think

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.080 
just get a better program going I think
for<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.700> riders<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:40.100> it<00:00:41.100> should<00:00:41.280> be<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.760> lot

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
for the riders and it should be a lot

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.340 
for the riders and it should be a lot
better<00:00:42.210> than<00:00:42.420> its<00:00:42.540> been<00:00:42.600> blessed<00:00:42.960> by<00:00:43.050> weeks

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
better than its been blessed by weeks

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.920 
better than its been blessed by weeks

future and we put a lot of sponsors
together<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> short<00:00:52.949> time<00:00:53.390> feel<00:00:54.390> really

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
together in a short time feel really

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.080

happy<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.989> what<00:00:55.110> we've<00:00:55.260> done<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.730> look<00:00:56.730> for

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
happy with what we've done and look for

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.880 
happy with what we've done and look for
with<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.449> sponsors<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.379> were<00:00:58.530> working<00:00:58.710> with

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
with the sponsors that were working with

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.959 
with the sponsors that were working with
to<00:00:59.280> grow<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> team<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:01.350> think<00:01:02.100> four<00:01:02.520> rounds<00:01:02.820> in

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
to grow the team I think four rounds in

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.820 
to grow the team I think four rounds in
where<00:01:03.629> we're<00:01:03.750> at<00:01:03.780> right<00:01:03.960> now<00:01:04.019> with<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> riders

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
where we're at right now with the riders

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.289 
where we're at right now with the riders
and<00:01:05.010> how<00:01:05.159> we've<00:01:05.309> been<00:01:05.339> doing<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.820> think<00:01:05.880> we're

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
and how we've been doing I think we're

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.480 
and how we've been doing I think we're
at<00:01:07.229> where<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.159> expected<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:08.790> Kyle<00:01:10.369> being<00:01:11.369> on

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
at where we expected with Kyle being on

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.950 
at where we expected with Kyle being on
a<00:01:11.520> new<00:01:11.700> bike<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.240> short<00:01:12.540> time<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.750> we've

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
a new bike in the short time that we've

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.999 
a new bike in the short time that we've
had<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.229> spend<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:14.210> he's<00:01:15.830> making<00:01:16.830> all<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
had to spend on it he's making all the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.350 
had to spend on it he's making all the
main<00:01:17.159> events<00:01:17.580> he's<00:01:17.729> running<00:01:18.000> right<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.240> there

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
main events he's running right in there

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.940 
main events he's running right in there
in<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.509> mid<00:01:18.659> pack<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.320> guys<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.740> you

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
in the mid pack with the guys that you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.140 
in the mid pack with the guys that you
know<00:01:20.009> he<00:01:20.189> should<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.490> riding<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.119> I

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
know he should be riding with and I

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.660 
know he should be riding with and I
think<00:01:21.360> now<00:01:21.509> we're<00:01:22.250> getting<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> point<00:01:23.549> where

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
think now we're getting to a point where

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.640 
think now we're getting to a point where
an<00:01:23.880> hour<00:01:24.000> we're<00:01:24.479> gonna<00:01:24.570> be<00:01:24.869> comfortable<00:01:25.500> where

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
an hour we're gonna be comfortable where

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.140 
an hour we're gonna be comfortable where
the<00:01:25.740> bike<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.220> knows<00:01:26.340> what<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.549> can<00:01:26.970> do<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the bike is it knows what it can do and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.609 
the bike is it knows what it can do and
I<00:01:27.299> think<00:01:27.509> we<00:01:27.600> need<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.780> now<00:01:27.960> start<00:01:28.170> working<00:01:28.500> on

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
I think we need to now start working on

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.109 
I think we need to now start working on
that<00:01:28.650> aspect<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.640> give<00:01:29.729> them<00:01:29.909> stuff

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
that aspect of it and give them stuff

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.250 
that aspect of it and give them stuff
that<00:01:30.299> will<00:01:30.360> make<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.540> better

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.990
