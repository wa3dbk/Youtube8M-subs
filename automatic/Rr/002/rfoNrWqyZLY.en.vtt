00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.320
 The bow arm lies on an imaginary layer 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.069
 which is represented by the red line on this layer should be the arm 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.979
 remain during the parting until the change to the spread 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:16.669
 the arm extends the bow and provides a unit with it the pulling direction 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:17.779
 of the poor 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.710
 is identical to the direction of the bow 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.169
 put the bow on the page 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.339
 always feel in the layer and put the few on the weight on it 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.599
 Koblenz now out of her arm with small impulses in dash direction so well 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.380
 the direction in which the trial period 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.790
 that the sheet moves easily on the page 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.670
 Chats sounds may arise as well 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.150
 so they lie on the arm no impulse dash direction and leave him 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.970
 on the layer down or who turned the shot after 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.240
 right out 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.150
 the four should have taken up the impulse of sting movement after they have 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.210
 Do not actively move any more. Sneeze time feeling again 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.510
 Years on the side 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.510
 with his weight lies mainly to know 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.560
 they were not in danger 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.650
 as far as possible to the right 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.900
 the Steelers today exciting and fast 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.130
 this rug 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.130
 should run 80 as long as possible 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.990
 and the subsequent one 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.900
 if they care about it 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.210
 they were called for the first time this weekend 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.670
 only in the beginning 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.320
 and they return the bow for a short time and put it back on 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.800
 later on every bow change will become a frog 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.820
 come 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.600
 when the fingers are loaded again so the suspension has yielded us 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.060
 the poor limped back to the side 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.060
 the new stitch begins with a new impulse 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.310
 Frequent mistakes are on the one hand the premature leaving of the smear layer 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.720
 with the elbow, which causes agitation on the pole in the middle of the boom 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.870
 substance in the clay at the top lets go 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.270
 and the change to the spread difficult 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.350
 on the other, that start too high on the simple thing with the danger 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.569
 right on the frog press the point deduction 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.129
 that the bow begins to flutter by the impulse against stench
