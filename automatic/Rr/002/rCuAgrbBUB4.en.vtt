 the left hand and holding the r2 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.009
 would be the brake button then for you 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.350
 You can understand just putting it on 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.830

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.549

 He's here in the car and the lester wants to 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.000
 give a lot and let's do some more 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.520
 far to stay a little better there 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.159
 our right system by giving a 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.680
 pinpoint speeded up when you 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.210

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.869

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.310
 It was there now, it was too late, then 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.259
 You can not pick up speed and 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.600
 we will do it on the other ramp he will 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.160
 the only thing you need is a 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.470
 ramp if you do not have a wide 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.000
 Unfortunately you will not be able to 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.720
 do so let's go here 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.630

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:29.069

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.709

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.310
 working out in Bolivia was legal and 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.239

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.440

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:56.130

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.310

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.069

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.980
 It's complicated, I'm working alone. 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.500
 no bar 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.299

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.160
 What can I do then it's no use 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.280
 I want to sacrifice my personal life 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.590

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.250
