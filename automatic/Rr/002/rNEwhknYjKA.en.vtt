use of turbocharging and direct

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.790 
use of turbocharging and direct
injection<00:00:27.480> creates<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.410> lot<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.680> low-end

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
injection creates a lot of low-end

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.560 
injection creates a lot of low-end
torque<00:00:29.099> which<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.699> important<00:00:30.300> number

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
torque which is that important number

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.359 
torque which is that important number
for<00:00:30.779> getting<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.109> heavy<00:00:31.289> object<00:00:31.529> moving<00:00:32.070> that's

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
for getting a heavy object moving that's

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.009 
for getting a heavy object moving that's
why<00:00:32.550> think<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.449> trainer<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.050> transport<00:00:34.620> truck

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.990 

that<00:00:40.019> low<00:00:40.260> end<00:00:40.440> torque<00:00:40.500> gives<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.489> really

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
that low end torque gives it a really

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.639 
that low end torque gives it a really
responsive<00:00:42.660> feel<00:00:42.840> as<00:00:42.989> soon<00:00:43.110> as<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.320> put<00:00:43.500> your

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
responsive feel as soon as you put your

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.860 
responsive feel as soon as you put your
foot<00:00:43.829> down<00:00:43.860> there's<00:00:44.219> no<00:00:44.370> waiting<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
foot down there's no waiting and the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.889 
foot down there's no waiting and the
handling<00:00:46.170> with<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.850> boxer<00:00:48.270> engine<00:00:48.629> being

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
handling with the the boxer engine being

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.360 
handling with the the boxer engine being
mounted<00:00:49.079> down<00:00:49.440> low<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.800> front<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.280> get

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
mounted down low in the front so you get

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.670 
mounted down low in the front so you get
a<00:00:50.399> lower<00:00:50.610> sense<00:00:51.140> lower<00:00:52.140> center<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.590> gravity

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
a lower sense lower center of gravity

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.990 
a lower sense lower center of gravity
more<00:00:53.460> crisp<00:00:53.730> steering<00:00:54.120> response<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:54.899> on

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
more crisp steering response and so on

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.170 
more crisp steering response and so on
what<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:57.990> like<00:00:58.140> about<00:00:58.220> turbocharged<00:00:59.220> cars<00:00:59.760> and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
what I like about turbocharged cars and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.850 
what I like about turbocharged cars and
I've<00:01:00.240> owned<00:01:00.390> several<00:01:00.930> turbocharged<00:01:01.590> sports

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
I've owned several turbocharged sports

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.260 
I've owned several turbocharged sports
cars<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.250> get<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> performance<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.970> a<00:01:03.060> bigger

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
cars you get the performance of a bigger

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.640 
cars you get the performance of a bigger
engine<00:01:03.480> when<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.840> need<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.410> put<00:01:04.589> your

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
engine when you need it you put your

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.200 
engine when you need it you put your
foot<00:01:04.860> down<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.160> turbocharge<00:01:05.519> your<00:01:05.760> kicks<00:01:06.030> and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
foot down to turbocharge your kicks and

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.370 
foot down to turbocharge your kicks and
you<00:01:06.270> get<00:01:06.390> more<00:01:06.510> power<00:01:06.690> but<00:01:06.960> when<00:01:07.110> you're<00:01:07.229> just

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
you get more power but when you're just

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.530 
you get more power but when you're just
cruising<00:01:07.800> and<00:01:07.890> driving<00:01:08.220> gently<00:01:08.550> it's<00:01:09.390> not

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
cruising and driving gently it's not

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:20.220 
cruising and driving gently it's not
using<00:01:09.870> as<00:01:09.960> much

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.890
