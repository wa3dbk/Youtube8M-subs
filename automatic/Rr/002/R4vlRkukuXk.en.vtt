00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:05.539
 Well folks this first video is to help them to rotate their lg l 80 

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:12.109
 we continue 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:13.499
 good friends 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.970
 now I come to teach you a small tutorial 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.669
 how to do 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.850
 super user root user 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.579
 in him the LG 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.859
 l 80 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.269
 for that the first thing I should do 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:29.769
 it's anger 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.230
 the applications 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.230
 go to the settings 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.940
 and here in the adjustments we are going to general 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.820
 and we are going to 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.150
 about of the phone 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.800
 and then we go to updates center 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.260
 we have to check that our cell phone is updated, we're going 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.230
 in software update 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.200
 and we check 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.010
 an update 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.430
 well already once verified that 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.170
 then we will go back 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.010
 and we're going to go 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.490
 where says 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.630
 software information 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.820
 and once here 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.120
 we'll see 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.150
 we do not go to 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.940
 compilation number 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.240
 We have 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.299
 several clicks 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.480
 about him and he will appear 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.540
 a small 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.320
 as well as this strip 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.340
 it says it's not necessary you already is 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.660
 developer will come out that you are a developer, as I am, that's why I appear 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.590
 this 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.480
 well once this is done 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.220
 we go back 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.779
 we will see a new menu called developer options 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:11.379
 we have to enter 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.019
 it appears 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.119
 this window 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:19.989
 developer options, and we'll activate it 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.989
 can cause your device and applications to be damaged 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.919
 they work badly, we give in accepting 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.299
 and here we go down 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.229
 in debug usb 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.089
 we activate it 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:42.859
 then we accept 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:49.489
 to allow debugging 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.519
 once this 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.180
 we connect our cell phone to the computer and if we do not have the drivers 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.869
 the 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:03:00.379
 we propose in this part where it says lg software 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.600
 and we press them 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.099
 in the key that is up here that looks like the little arrow 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.609
 is 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.479
 will begin to install 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:13.809
 once 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:17.399
 I miss all this 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:21.359
 in the computer should appear 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.579
 well with the name 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:24.659
 of 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:25.919
 our cell phone 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.559
 you can see the 2 memories 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:33.269
 I miss this 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.499
 it's all there is to do on the phone 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.129
 then the softwares are these 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.269
 well then what you have to do 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.609
 it is first 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:44.859
 open 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.459
 this application is the one that must be opened first 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.169
 with double clik 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.729
 we will leave that we give permissions we give that if 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:57.769
 this will open 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.809
 blue window we are going to give 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:03.579
 the letter Y 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.429
 Y 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:06.809
 we give him enter 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:09.799
 then again 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.999
 And and enter 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:15.209
 after 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.620
 one more time Y and enter 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.509
 YES 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.169
 then it will look like this we are going to give 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.789
 following 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.900
 let's give us this window will appear immediately 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.749
 we install it 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:33.580
 and we give in finalize 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.210
 and only the application will be closed 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.020
 after the next 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.860
 you have to decompress it 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.069
 we give in extract here 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:51.210
 and we will have the folder after we go to the folder and we open 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.960
 The first thing to do is 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.860
 remember that the cell phone is already connected 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.740
 in debug mode 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.409
 to the computer. Well first you have to double click on this 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:05.749
 and then to the 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:07.289
 lower part 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.180
 we will be opened 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.029
 and here 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:16.249
 we press enter 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:17.379
 i 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:19.759
 will begin to load about 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.129
 few dots 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:25.779
 if you do not get to load the points you have to close the program for that you have to close 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:30.370
 if it is minimized and the second time it is closed 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.690
 and then you have to 'start over' give enter and you should start loading the 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.860
 points these points and they take a good time but do not despair 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.990
 why 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.830
 is almost finished 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.749
 that the last steps 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:47.379
 after 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:51.089
 of waiting we will appear all the information of the cell 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:52.560
 how do you hear it here 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.770
 they mark you the cell phone brand 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.089
 all that 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:58.020
 good once here 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.879
 we are going to give you enter 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:04.860
 but for that our cell phone will be put on this screen 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.449
 so we should not be scared because it's normal 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:11.249
 once 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:15.909
 that we gave him enter begin to load information 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.510
 and do not discount, wait until almost 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.210
 finished 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.180
 once 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.460
 come out again 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.749
 press enter when pressing it our 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:30.540
 cellular will restart and almost 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.289
 we will have our cell phone with root 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:40.289
 only one application will need to be downloaded 

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:46.309
 good once on the cell phone 

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:53.039
 we went to the play store 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:55.360
 once in the 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.249
 we are looking for the super application 

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:02.800
 super his 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.460
 which is this 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.820
 and we will install 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.469
 I already have it but you install it 

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:15.960
 when installing it 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.969
 we will find the application open 

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:24.610
 and will ask 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.399
 what do we want 

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:28.550
 we put the normal and then 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.300
 I think it will ask you not to restart and when you restart 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.539
 it will come out for the applications as you see here on my cell phone 

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:41.210
 I hope and I will serve you 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.889
 Thank you
