00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.140

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.870
 releases of the month of February and March 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.330
 of the new story clear concept that more 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.049
 once I freaked out when I received the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.330
 box gives new concept and I was very 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.980
 very excited when I saw so many books 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.369
 inside the box 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.760
 those super obsessive people who do 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.310
 confirmation 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.160
 ok let's khalifa for the book and then 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.410

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.809
 have been with the books for 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:39.510
 he stay will show is the violent of 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.430
 March that most enchanted me what else 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.160
 He drew attention and made me am 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.610
 Statin book was very cover design 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.230
 well done and the plot it seems to be 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.850
 those surrounding frames that make 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.280
 with which the reader wants to devour the book 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.899
 next book by an author who is 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.930
 recent in the new concept the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.970
 He is very well made and I 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.110
 enchanted in this book was the question of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.450
 synopsis 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.360
 she has a subscriber to that book she 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.210
 It's kind of a synopsis queen comes to 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.450
 curiosity and the plot to be the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.140
 has characters characters dogs 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.850
 Who will somehow stay with you? 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:31.110
 throughout the year 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:38.720
 My love, my love, I'm just writing. 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:41.340
 because I thought he was apparently 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.380
 interesting I still do not know 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.540
 so know that you are now not seen 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.509
 Your book I received on Friday then 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.040
 I know absolutely nothing about 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.930
 none of the darkness 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.540
 I intended to make a video with the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.030
 readers of the month but what I can 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.340
 show you now in the video talk 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.430
 it is certainly the recordings of the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.799
 books I each which I hope 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:12.180
 each one okay at the reception of the chicken 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.220
 on the hunt observes 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.720
 everybody knows 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.630
 there is no mystery novelty 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.670
 suspense I love is also a detective 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.770
 so I love celso in love with 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.460
 mystery and do not want do 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.530
 investigative journalism do not know why 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.330
 but only to emerge the opportunity right 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.870
 perhaps here for some years working on 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.610
 July on the levels that the rain will know 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.890
 good hunting I have not read any 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.540
 I have already requested some books 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.790
 books but I've never had time to 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.490
 reading tap will have to put up with the concept 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.280
 released achieved already asked because I 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.680
 I know when I start reading a book 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.020
 that some series the book that is of a 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.150
 author that I personally dislike not 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.190
 want to check the next frames then 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.550
 I already asked to leave it here. 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.930
 waiting for his time in search of a 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.920
 happy ending 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.290
 It's a book that has a striking cover 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.860
 the first thing when he covers this 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.080
 The first thing I felt was sadness. 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.610
 the plot seems to be very sad but 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.350
 also owe their good essence 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.660
 That's why I'm free to 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.959
 First time is not from our first 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.330
 I am your book by the cover and 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.060
 seems a very exciting story 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:34.040
 then this is definitely in the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:36.500
 list of readings that are priorities 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:42.110
 so it's worth checking 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:45.650
 the storm I did not like this much 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:50.030
 cover as our previous covers. 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.769
 plot looks good just missing the the 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.700
 plots to be good because that is the 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.830
 truth 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.680
 every day I have a little piece that stops 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:02.269
 be good if you only know but in this book 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:05.360
 It's good when you decide to read 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.549
 attached to the book I requested because I 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.290
 I was very curious about the book just to 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.230
 the right call also that book it 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.390
 is 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.060
 I do not know, it seems to be fun and 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.549
 same time full of things 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.919
 interesting to visit one of the 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.599
 most awaited releases 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.060
 I was crazy to receive this book. 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.660
 very very much and when I opened the 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.520
 Cashier 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.020
 concept was probably one of the 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.710
 the first books I started to 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.720
 look what was the hot morning book 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.880
 I'm passionate about writing in that 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.560
 now she is fantastic it is fun 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.570
 It's how I can tell she knows how to mix 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.020
 all the elements we saw a plot 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:51.680
 do not leave it all too clichÃ© too much 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.210
 You can even measure all your feelings. 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.880
 I 'm very anxious to check out the 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:00.560
 and yes about aid will be one of the 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:03.140
 My next readings did not like the 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.440
 I cover the other side 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:09.320
 I really do not know, maybe I'm different. 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.030
 but I did not like the cover it combines 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.290
 last book of the most important at the 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.690
 of the animals 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.140
 the book leaves more it already has a 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.720
 differential to the cover it does for me 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:23.360
 I love it when you watched today it will be very 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.390
 Good and he's all colorful I adore 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.290
 things so beautiful cute and then will 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.550
 to hit 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:33.020
 Yes, I wanted to tighten. 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:36.320
 this book called Rebuilding Life 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.380
 after the loss seems to be extremely 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.670
 start reading this book at 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.370
 from Monday 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.050
 I have many many expectations made 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.520
 the topic is not I hope not 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.610
 to disappoint 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.330
 and I'm just in love with the cover and flora 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.830
 what a noise 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.310
 Talking now about the animals every book came 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.100
 with the marker to want to know everything 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.930
 good 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.180
 the morning book came with a notepad 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.790
 of notes and I'm so in love 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:14.300
 for that little one there is only one thing 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:16.250
 Funny came with a keychain too 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.050
 a washcloth when in reality she 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:24.169
 comes in flower shape 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:27.110
 so when you do it, everything will stay 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:31.490
 March alert came with the bag very much 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:37.490

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:39.770

 The woman passes by and everything and the 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:46.520
 they are excellent 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:49.190
 It's good that you've already destroyed a six 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.289
 bags of so much weight put but I 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.840
 I promise you have a special affection for this 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:56.509
 and did not destroy the 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.150
 these people are for the books received 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:02.569

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.340
 do you know that I've changed the video? 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:06.949
 the scenery I do not know I thought 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:10.099
 it would be better to specify if the 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:11.240
 From today the video and yes I go 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:14.090

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.240

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.039
 probably until the middle of the week 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.080

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:25.970

 Seeing bookshop tur and to demand is 

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:39.199
 advances from the video what I like most 

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:42.139
 software notebooks have some that 

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:43.969
 person talks too much more and you 're 

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:45.889

00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:52.759
 So you need to know if you want a 

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:54.409
 A simple and fast simple 

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:57.819
