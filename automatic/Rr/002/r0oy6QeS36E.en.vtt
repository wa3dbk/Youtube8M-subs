00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.130
 the importance of fractionation of 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.560
 feeding one of the points is because eating 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.510
 every three to four hour stimulus 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.240
 we call it the gene that is ours 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.590
 natural caloric expenditure favors up to 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.199
 weight loss 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.119
 on the contrary, it is also valid if 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.650
 You stay too long without eating this. 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.289
 often even causes you to 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.239
 save calories and save burn 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.190
 and can gain weight 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.809
 another important factor of eating each 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.030
 three hours is because the food 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.250
 he is a protector of the gastric mucosa 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.000
 another fact that we also have to take into 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.950
 consideration is that prolonged fasting 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.629
 this is proven even you have to 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.230
 release of a hormone called 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.640
 cortisol among some other actions he 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.690
 stimulates the deposit of fat in the region 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.000
 waist 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.550
 apart from what you eat the food 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.980
 correct in these intervals leads to 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.439
 formation of a neurotransmitter of good 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.369
 being called serotonin the long 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.159
 fasting period 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.409
 you may have a deficit of attention 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.360
 with less energy and in a bad mood 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.189
 we have to pay attention to what they ate 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.990
 these first point intervals that do not 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.060
 should simply be a source of 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.130
 calories and yes of nutrients 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.030

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.080
 intervals both morning and
