this daily it's not a daily shampoo

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.390 
this daily it's not a daily shampoo
because<00:06:01.099> it's<00:06:01.370> very<00:06:01.639> drying<00:06:02.270> it's<00:06:02.840> a<00:06:03.830> shampoo

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
because it's very drying it's a shampoo

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.430

for<00:06:04.669> those<00:06:04.849> who<00:06:05.030> have<00:06:05.240> thin<00:06:05.509> hair<00:06:05.539> and<00:06:06.080> want

their hair to grow thicker I think it's

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:09.820 
their hair to grow thicker I think it's
just<00:06:08.479> depends<00:06:08.900> on<00:06:09.020> certain<00:06:09.169> people<00:06:09.470> to<00:06:09.500> might
