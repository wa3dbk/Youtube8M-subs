00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
ok very first thing that happens is by

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.049 
ok very first thing that happens is by
the<00:00:37.260> valve<00:00:37.620> covers<00:00:43.280> it<00:00:44.280> comes<00:00:44.670> with<00:00:44.879> these

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the valve covers it comes with these

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.630 
the valve covers it comes with these
little<00:00:45.270> baffles<00:00:48.829> that<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.980> have<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.280> put<00:00:50.460> in

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
little baffles that you have to put in

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.119 
little baffles that you have to put in
so<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> PVC<00:00:51.539> doesn't<00:00:51.960> suck<00:00:52.260> all<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.559> oil<00:00:52.920> out

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
so the PVC doesn't suck all the oil out

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.100 
so the PVC doesn't suck all the oil out
of<00:00:53.190> your<00:00:53.370> motor<00:00:53.550> going<00:00:53.789> across<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.270> lake<00:00:54.480> ok

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
of your motor going across the lake ok

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.319 
of your motor going across the lake ok
so<00:00:55.620> without<00:00:55.890> them<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:56.670> makes<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.210> a

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
so without them it just makes it a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.740 
so without them it just makes it a
vacuum<00:00:57.750> cleaner<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.680> rockers<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
vacuum cleaner to one of the rockers and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.740 
vacuum cleaner to one of the rockers and
sucks<00:01:00.750> away<00:01:00.899> all<00:01:00.989> your<00:01:01.289> oil<00:01:02.359> next<00:01:03.359> thing<00:01:03.629> it

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
sucks away all your oil next thing it

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.830 
sucks away all your oil next thing it
