relatively slow shutter speed so you

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:06.679 
relatively slow shutter speed so you
going<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.909> want<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> make<00:01:06.210> sure<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.509> your

support base and may wealth and be worth
considering<00:01:15.149> using<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.600> tripod<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.229> know<00:01:17.159> they

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:17.249 
considering using the tripod I know they

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:18.289 
considering using the tripod I know they
can<00:01:17.399> be<00:01:17.429> bulky<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.969> a<00:01:17.999> little<00:01:18.179> bit

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
can be bulky and a little bit

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.940 
can be bulky and a little bit
time-consuming<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:19.020> settle<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.770> worth

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
time-consuming to settle but it's worth

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.859 
time-consuming to settle but it's worth
it<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.219> the<00:01:20.249> end<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.390> we'll<00:01:21.539> just<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:21.749> a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
it in the end and so we'll just have a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.569 
it in the end and so we'll just have a
quick<00:01:22.020> look<00:01:22.079> at<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.499> mold<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.039> to<00:01:23.310> see<00:01:23.460> what

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
quick look at this mold and to see what

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:24.950 
quick look at this mold and to see what
options<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:23.999> we<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.299> gotten<00:01:24.539> in<00:01:24.659> terms<00:01:24.780> of

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
options that we have gotten in terms of

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.760 
options that we have gotten in terms of
settings<00:01:25.289> we<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.409> change<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:27.469> we'll<00:01:28.469> move<00:01:28.619> on

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
settings we can change and we'll move on

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.859 
settings we can change and we'll move on
to<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.009> next<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.369> which<00:01:29.609> is<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.060> mold

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
to the next one which is the mold

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.289 
to the next one which is the mold
whereby<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.799> can<00:01:32.009> force<00:01:32.609> the<00:01:32.789> flash<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.210> be

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
whereby you can force the flash to be

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.639 
whereby you can force the flash to be
off<00:01:35.450> okay<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:36.749> we<00:01:36.869> are<00:01:36.899> with<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.319> camera

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
something you can really go into that

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.220 
something you can really go into that
often<00:03:02.819> okay<00:03:03.819> so<00:03:03.880> what<00:03:04.269> I'll<00:03:04.390> do<00:03:04.569> now<00:03:04.780> is<00:03:05.019> I'll

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
often okay so what I'll do now is I'll

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.229 
often okay so what I'll do now is I'll
just<00:03:05.290> try<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:05.799> set<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.130> up<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:06.459> we<00:03:06.610> can<00:03:06.819> get<00:03:07.120> the

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
just try and set it up so we can get the

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.860 
just try and set it up so we can get the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
camera to pop the internal flash up and

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.210 
camera to pop the internal flash up and
fire<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.900> couple<00:03:11.080> of<00:03:11.230> pre<00:03:11.470> flashes<00:03:11.860> offered<00:03:12.130> to

the<00:03:16.330> camera<00:03:16.599> to<00:03:16.720> focus<00:03:20.580> okay<00:03:21.580> here<00:03:21.970> we<00:03:22.030> go<00:03:22.150> just

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
the camera to focus okay here we go just

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.479 
the camera to focus okay here we go just
show<00:03:22.870> an<00:03:22.989> example<00:03:23.080> of<00:03:23.470> one<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.769> built-in

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.120 
is a very dark scene in front and it's
point<00:03:48.220> three<00:03:49.000> of<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.150> second<00:03:49.540> so<00:03:49.630> it's<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.810> really

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
point three of a second so it's a really

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.860 
point three of a second so it's a really
slow<00:03:51.130> or<00:03:51.459> consider<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.239> swat<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.540> slower

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
slow or consider the swat a slower

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.759 
slow or consider the swat a slower
shutter<00:03:53.260> speed<00:03:58.019> that<00:03:59.019> we've<00:03:59.170> got<00:03:59.380> there

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
shutter speed that we've got there

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.440 
shutter speed that we've got there
and<00:04:00.130> then<00:04:00.370> it<00:04:00.459> will<00:04:00.579> also<00:04:00.850> fire<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.269> flash

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
and then it will also fire the flash

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.720 
and then it will also fire the flash
during<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.840> exposure<00:04:02.200> so<00:04:02.799> it<00:04:03.280> might<00:04:03.459> will<00:04:03.609> be

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
during the exposure so it might will be

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.099 
during the exposure so it might will be
worthwhile<00:04:03.880> in<00:04:04.239> your<00:04:04.359> subject<00:04:04.630> if<00:04:04.959> you're
