00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:05.750
 in this video 2 we will learn how to correctly create the cover of our photobook 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.690
 class only 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.030
 then we'll show you correctly how you're a photobook 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:14.749
 Ok, let's go to the debut. 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:16.820
 Click on the photo book 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.659
 I'll choose the photobook class 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.929
 Botero landscape large size 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.399
 what to expect from blocking the layouts I usually use with a nearly 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:28.899
 almost 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.869
 I'll present a folder for my sources 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.270
 what are you already selecting and shoes 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.470
 I'm going to click on advanced options because I wanted exactly 20 pages one 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.090
 photo liter 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.030
 very well 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.170
 I will use the automatic color correction 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.460
 that involved the layout 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.910
 creating the simple non-book 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.649
 twenty pages we can post here 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.910
 we have up to 20 pages 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.980
 now that I'm going to select a photo for the cover 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.390
 the difference of having chosen just this the book-book of the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.360
 introduction 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.680
 have option 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.320
 - photo books 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.880
 ian mcshane bookmark with cet 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.740
 his classic allows me to adjust the card to be centered foto ap 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.680
 after the carp window 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.270
 It's very interesting about the saints. 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.940
 new bodies appear newspaper of the box I want 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.300
 or I can simply make it 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.620
 like lack of critical background right mouse button to appear and cement 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.150
 defined as for fun 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.140
 when you have a photo and I took my hands remembering that the book 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.170
 class and click on three colors mayor to dark blue the red 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.310
 the scandal should also be released 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.100
 It's very cool, do not worry. 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.509
 instead of the orange sharkboy we're seeing that would cover would stay 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.580
 a black border the dark blue the red 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.570
 this advantage I want a peaceful and exclusive future with this 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.780
 classic photo books tool 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.330
 that way once you open your book, the whole photo will appear 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.459
 through the window you of that lack in the middle if you click on this option 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:20.329
 missing books that other models you can also build a patient 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.329
 however if you do not have this window option 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:26.209
 What's going to happen? 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.040
 your photo will be reduced to the size of the window 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:33.679
 I'm tri timber championship just to demonstrate 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:39.939
 jack advanced options is already ok everything in the layout you see that already changed 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.939
 the layout I'm going to put the same photo on the cover 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.659
 ready here I no longer have a base 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:48.529
 to create the 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:53.009
 correctly the photo of the cover of a booklet with the cet so much is that what 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:54.419
 will happen 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:58.189
 any photo you put here even if you put the photo with 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.049
 backgrounds 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.389
 as soon as she was arrested 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:07.079
 automatically it will be reduced that cimed photo you chose will be 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.259
 reduced to the size of the window 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:11.689
 so it's just gonna be like this 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.689
 but at home I put all white is the cover of your album 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:18.399
 and your photo that was notified this morning 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:22.159
 I really do not recommend this option because it does not value all the beauty of the 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.089
 patient 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:26.409
 so without breeding a class d photobook 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.439
 The Vatican The Classic Option 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.449
 to you 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:33.139
 ok let's go to the next video
