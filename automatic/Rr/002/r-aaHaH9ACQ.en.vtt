the<00:00:33.809> way<00:00:33.930> through<00:00:34.230> not<00:00:34.920> recording<00:00:35.489> just

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the way through not recording just

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.660 
the way through not recording just
practicing<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:37.700> it<00:00:38.700> was<00:00:39.180> not<00:00:39.450> enjoyable<00:00:40.670> and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
practicing and it was not enjoyable and

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.560 
practicing and it was not enjoyable and
if<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.750> was<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> refresher<00:00:43.620> course<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.879> if

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
if that was a refresher course and if

if that was a refresher course and if
recording<00:00:46.530> goes<00:00:46.710> exactly<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.340> same<00:00:47.579> then

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
recording goes exactly the same then

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.580 
recording goes exactly the same then
this<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.329> not<00:00:48.510> going<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> very<00:00:49.289> fun

circuit<00:02:42.820> hopefully<00:02:43.600> will<00:02:43.780> be<00:02:43.930> taken<00:02:44.320> out<00:02:44.440> in

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
circuit hopefully will be taken out in

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
circuit hopefully will be taken out in
one<00:02:44.890> video<00:02:46.260> major<00:02:47.260> circus<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:49.920> world<00:02:50.920> circuit

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
one video major circus and world circuit

00:02:51.490 --> 00:03:03.680 
one video major circus and world circuit
however<00:02:51.760> oh<00:02:53.130> boy

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:12.660 

yeah<00:03:04.690> bon<00:03:04.930> Kaiser<00:03:05.200> means<00:03:05.530> business<00:03:05.980> now<00:03:11.670> also

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
yeah bon Kaiser means business now also

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.060 
yeah bon Kaiser means business now also
one<00:03:12.850> thing<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.180> find<00:03:16.020> that<00:03:17.020> makes<00:03:17.290> this<00:03:17.530> so<00:03:17.860> much

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
one thing I find that makes this so much

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.100 
one thing I find that makes this so much
easier<00:03:18.610> is<00:03:18.820> uh<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:21.040> take<00:03:21.250> everything<00:03:21.790> slow<00:03:22.780> and

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
easier is uh to take everything slow and

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.670 
easier is uh to take everything slow and
steady

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
steady

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:35.160 
steady
a<00:03:32.580> perfect<00:03:33.580> example<00:03:33.760> of<00:03:34.330> someone<00:03:34.630> you<00:03:34.870> need<00:03:35.050> to

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
a perfect example of someone you need to

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:50.340 
a perfect example of someone you need to
take<00:03:35.380> slow<00:03:35.740> and<00:03:36.130> steady<00:03:36.460> is<00:03:36.790> bear<00:03:37.660> hugger<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:50.080> I

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
take slow and steady is bear hugger so I

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.290 
take slow and steady is bear hugger so I
don't<00:03:50.680> care<00:03:50.980> anymore<00:03:51.280> whether<00:03:51.640> I<00:03:51.760> knock<00:03:52.090> these

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
don't care anymore whether I knock these

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.980 
don't care anymore whether I knock these
guys<00:03:52.360> out<00:03:52.900> around<00:03:53.380> 1:00<00:03:53.770> or<00:03:54.310> not<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:55.780> thing

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
guys out around 1:00 or not the thing

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.660 
guys out around 1:00 or not the thing
about<00:03:56.170> title<00:03:56.500> defense<00:03:56.770> is<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.250> should<00:03:57.430> feel

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.390 

I'm<00:04:09.060> not<00:04:09.270> looking<00:04:09.569> forward<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.190> piston<00:04:11.190> honda
