00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
speakers and all the 12 pin dock

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.899 
speakers and all the 12 pin dock
connector<00:02:01.649> at<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.799> 21<00:02:02.189> pin<00:02:02.340> whatever<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.790> is

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
connector at the 21 pin whatever it is

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.590 
connector at the 21 pin whatever it is
is<00:02:03.450> all<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.960> same<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.670> that<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.509> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
is all the same so that that is the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.169 
is all the same so that that is the
hardware<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:08.369> there<00:02:08.550> actually<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:09.000> no

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
hardware and there actually is no

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.540 
hardware and there actually is no
physical<00:02:09.500> difference<00:02:10.500> between<00:02:10.920> these<00:02:11.220> two

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
physical difference between these two

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.500 
physical difference between these two
phones

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
phones

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.759 
phones
okay<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:14.599> now<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.810> we<00:02:14.989> looked<00:02:15.200> at<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.440> design

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
okay so now that we looked at the design

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.610 
okay so now that we looked at the design
we<00:02:15.980> saw<00:02:16.159> the<00:02:16.220> designs<00:02:16.849> very<00:02:17.299> similar

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
we saw the designs very similar

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.740 
we saw the designs very similar
the<00:02:19.400> next<00:02:19.640> thing<00:02:19.730> Apple<00:02:20.030> really<00:02:20.150> talked<00:02:20.480> about

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
the next thing Apple really talked about

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.589 
the next thing Apple really talked about
was<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:22.069> speed<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.760> download<00:02:23.239> speeds

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
was the speed and the download speeds

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.149 
was the speed and the download speeds
this<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.470> first<00:02:24.680> thing<00:02:24.860> we're<00:02:25.010> going<00:02:25.099> to

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
this so the first thing we're going to

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.350 
this so the first thing we're going to
do<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:25.430> we're<00:02:25.519> going<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.670> test<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:25.970> download

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
do is we're going to test the download

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.399 
do is we're going to test the download
speeds<00:02:26.690> on<00:02:26.930> Wi-Fi<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:28.400> see<00:02:28.640> what<00:02:29.420> the

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
speeds on Wi-Fi to see what the

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:31.720 
speeds on Wi-Fi to see what the
difference<00:02:30.739> really<00:02:30.950> is<00:02:31.159> between<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.610> two

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
difference really is between the two

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.069 
difference really is between the two
phones<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.180> if<00:02:32.299> there<00:02:32.510> is<00:02:32.599> a<00:02:32.629> big<00:02:32.870> difference

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
phones and if there is a big difference

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.839 
phones and if there is a big difference
so<00:02:33.500> I'm<00:02:33.860> just<00:02:34.010> gonna<00:02:34.129> try<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.340> begin<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.670> test

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
so I'm just gonna try to begin the test

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.130 
so I'm just gonna try to begin the test
around<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.239> same<00:02:35.480> time<00:02:37.390> now<00:02:38.390> as<00:02:38.599> it<00:02:38.780> gathers

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
around the same time now as it gathers

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.250 
around the same time now as it gathers
data<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.940> guys<00:02:41.120> if<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:41.780> guys<00:02:41.900> like<00:02:42.140> this

and the download speed is 17 megabits
per<00:03:01.819> second<00:03:02.420> on<00:03:02.750> my<00:03:04.180> iPhone<00:03:05.650> 5<00:03:06.650> or<00:03:06.950> 4s<00:03:07.340> sorry

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
per second on my iPhone 5 or 4s sorry

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.460 
per second on my iPhone 5 or 4s sorry
and<00:03:07.970> it's<00:03:08.390> twelve<00:03:08.780> point<00:03:09.109> seven<00:03:09.440> nine

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
and it's twelve point seven nine

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.380 
and it's twelve point seven nine
megabits<00:03:09.980> per<00:03:10.040> second<00:03:10.489> on<00:03:10.819> my<00:03:12.879> iPhone<00:03:13.879> 4<00:03:14.180> so

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
megabits per second on my iPhone 4 so

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.550 
megabits per second on my iPhone 4 so
the<00:03:14.450> iPhone<00:03:14.720> 4<00:03:14.930> again<00:03:15.109> is<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.290> one<00:03:15.409> on<00:03:15.500> the

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
the iPhone 4 again is the one on the

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.699 
the iPhone 4 again is the one on the
right<00:03:15.769> and<00:03:15.920> it<00:03:16.880> is<00:03:17.120> 0.4<00:03:17.810> 3<00:03:18.109> megabits<00:03:18.590> per

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
right and it is 0.4 3 megabits per

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.220 
right and it is 0.4 3 megabits per
second<00:03:19.010> up<00:03:19.220> on<00:03:19.549> iPhone<00:03:19.880> 4<00:03:20.120> was<00:03:20.239> double<00:03:20.750> that<00:03:20.780> at

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
second up on iPhone 4 was double that at

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.390 
second up on iPhone 4 was double that at
0.8<00:03:21.829> 4<00:03:22.069> megabits<00:03:22.400> per<00:03:22.519> second<00:03:22.970> on<00:03:23.389> the<00:03:23.840> iPhone

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
0.8 4 megabits per second on the iPhone

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.860 
0.8 4 megabits per second on the iPhone
4s<00:03:25.400> so<00:03:25.849> there<00:03:26.000> actually<00:03:26.090> is<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:26.389> big<00:03:26.690> difference

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
4s so there actually is a big difference

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.460 
4s so there actually is a big difference
now<00:03:28.060> don't<00:03:29.060> take<00:03:29.269> these<00:03:29.510> 17<00:03:30.019> megabits<00:03:30.440> per

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
now don't take these 17 megabits per

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.930 
now don't take these 17 megabits per
second<00:03:30.859> and<00:03:30.950> compare<00:03:31.190> it<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.340> someone<00:03:31.579> else's

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
second and compare it to someone else's

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.940 
second and compare it to someone else's
because<00:03:32.150> these<00:03:32.450> do<00:03:32.720> fluctuate<00:03:33.200> depending<00:03:33.620> on

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
because these do fluctuate depending on

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.580 
because these do fluctuate depending on
what<00:03:34.099> network<00:03:34.400> you're<00:03:34.579> on<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:36.230> those<00:03:36.379> are<00:03:36.530> the

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
what network you're on so those are the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.580 
what network you're on so those are the
results<00:03:36.980> over<00:03:37.480> Wi-Fi<00:03:38.480> now<00:03:39.049> let's<00:03:39.319> check<00:03:39.530> the

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
results over Wi-Fi now let's check the

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.449 
results over Wi-Fi now let's check the
results<00:03:39.709> over<00:03:40.280> 3G<00:03:42.069> alright<00:03:43.069> so<00:03:43.190> now<00:03:43.310> that<00:03:43.340> we

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
results over 3G alright so now that we

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.420 
results over 3G alright so now that we
checked<00:03:43.819> out<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.120> Wi-Fi<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:44.780> Bank<00:03:45.019> with<00:03:45.230> my

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
checked out the Wi-Fi and Bank with my

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.580 
checked out the Wi-Fi and Bank with my
3G<00:03:46.430> connection<00:03:46.970> I<00:03:47.090> turned<00:03:47.299> off<00:03:47.480> Wi-Fi<00:03:48.019> and<00:03:48.290> I

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
3G connection I turned off Wi-Fi and I

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.379 
3G connection I turned off Wi-Fi and I
actually<00:03:48.739> activated<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.579> iPhone<00:03:49.940> Forks

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
actually activated the iPhone Forks

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.509 
actually activated the iPhone Forks
before<00:03:50.750> it<00:03:50.810> wasn't<00:03:50.930> activated<00:03:51.470> which<00:03:52.250> is<00:03:52.400> why

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
before it wasn't activated which is why

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:53.800 
before it wasn't activated which is why
there's<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.819> different<00:03:53.180> background<00:03:53.359> I<00:03:53.660> had<00:03:53.750> to

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
there's a different background I had to

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.110 
there's a different background I had to
restore<00:03:54.169> it<00:03:54.319> and<00:03:54.410> everything<00:03:54.829> so<00:03:55.430> no<00:03:55.609> let's

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
restore it and everything so no let's

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.990 
restore it and everything so no let's
open<00:03:56.629> up<00:03:56.870> our<00:03:57.049> speed<00:03:57.319> test<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:57.859> see<00:03:58.519> how<00:03:58.549> it

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
open up our speed test and see how it

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.729 
open up our speed test and see how it
runs<00:03:59.209> on<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.910> iPhone<00:04:02.480> 4s<00:04:02.720> in<00:04:03.109> the<00:04:03.169> iPhone<00:04:03.500> 4

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
runs on the iPhone 4s in the iPhone 4

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.360 
runs on the iPhone 4s in the iPhone 4
and<00:04:03.859> see<00:04:03.949> how<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.099> internet<00:04:04.569> behaves<00:04:05.569> so<00:04:06.410> here

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
and see how the internet behaves so here

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.659 
and see how the internet behaves so here
we<00:04:07.489> are

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
we are

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.610 
we are
um<00:04:07.970> you<00:04:08.599> know<00:04:08.690> just<00:04:08.810> loading<00:04:09.169> everything<00:04:09.260> up

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
um you know just loading everything up

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.140 
um you know just loading everything up
no<00:04:10.040> it<00:04:10.400> would<00:04:10.519> be<00:04:10.549> interesting<00:04:10.790> to<00:04:11.000> see<00:04:11.120> the

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
no it would be interesting to see the

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.699 
no it would be interesting to see the
results<00:04:11.329> I've<00:04:11.660> had<00:04:11.810> mixed<00:04:12.019> results<00:04:12.230> with<00:04:12.500> this

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
results I've had mixed results with this

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.069 
results I've had mixed results with this
actually<00:04:13.220> so<00:04:16.389> from<00:04:17.389> what<00:04:17.539> you<00:04:17.660> can<00:04:17.780> see<00:04:17.959> it

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
actually so from what you can see it

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.009 
actually so from what you can see it
looks<00:04:18.199> pretty<00:04:18.709> similar<00:04:19.280> on<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.180> download<00:04:20.810> on

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
looks pretty similar on the download on

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.959 
looks pretty similar on the download on
3G<00:04:21.620> which<00:04:22.159> kind<00:04:22.400> of<00:04:22.490> surprised<00:04:22.760> me<00:04:22.909> because

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:22.969 
3G which kind of surprised me because

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:25.510 
3G which kind of surprised me because
Apple<00:04:23.539> talked<00:04:23.750> about<00:04:23.990> it<00:04:24.080> being<00:04:24.229> better<00:04:24.469> on

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
Apple talked about it being better on

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.279 
Apple talked about it being better on
iPhone<00:04:26.470> 4s<00:04:27.470> and<00:04:27.620> in<00:04:28.220> reality<00:04:29.080> it's<00:04:30.080> actually

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
iPhone 4s and in reality it's actually

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.100 
iPhone 4s and in reality it's actually
point<00:04:30.740> zero<00:04:31.039> nine<00:04:31.280> worse<00:04:31.849> right<00:04:32.270> now<00:04:32.449> no<00:04:33.080> I

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
point zero nine worse right now no I

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.210 
point zero nine worse right now no I
don't<00:04:33.349> know<00:04:33.410> if<00:04:33.500> this<00:04:33.650> has<00:04:33.770> anything<00:04:34.009> to<00:04:34.129> do

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
don't know if this has anything to do

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.589 
don't know if this has anything to do
with<00:04:34.250> being<00:04:34.520> so<00:04:34.729> close<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:34.970> another<00:04:35.240> phone

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
with being so close to another phone

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.270 
with being so close to another phone
maybe<00:04:35.960> but<00:04:36.680> they're<00:04:36.830> they're<00:04:37.039> getting<00:04:37.220> the

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
maybe but they're they're getting the

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.680 
maybe but they're they're getting the
same<00:04:37.490> signal<00:04:37.909> right<00:04:38.060> next<00:04:38.360> to<00:04:38.449> each<00:04:38.539> other

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
same signal right next to each other

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.749 
same signal right next to each other
nothing<00:04:39.199> different<00:04:39.409> and<00:04:39.830> they<00:04:40.400> should<00:04:40.639> be

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 
nothing different and they should be

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.029 
nothing different and they should be
getting<00:04:40.909> pretty<00:04:41.270> much<00:04:41.360> you<00:04:42.139> know<00:04:42.259> a<00:04:42.470> fair

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
getting pretty much you know a fair

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.309 
getting pretty much you know a fair
signal<00:04:43.460> strength<00:04:43.729> and<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.750> results<00:04:45.169> actually

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:45.319 
signal strength and the results actually

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.559 
signal strength and the results actually
are<00:04:45.770> better<00:04:46.009> on<00:04:46.159> the<00:04:46.250> iPhone<00:04:46.669> 4<00:04:46.970> surprisingly

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 
are better on the iPhone 4 surprisingly

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.140 
are better on the iPhone 4 surprisingly
enough<00:04:47.870> so<00:04:48.550> for<00:04:49.550> all<00:04:49.639> those<00:04:49.759> people<00:04:49.819> out<00:04:50.120> there

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
enough so for all those people out there

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.820 
enough so for all those people out there
that<00:04:50.389> think<00:04:50.449> that<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:50.810> iPhone<00:04:51.139> 4s<00:04:51.379> has<00:04:51.620> better

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
that think that the iPhone 4s has better

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.999 
that think that the iPhone 4s has better
download<00:04:52.759> speeds<00:04:53.030> am<00:04:53.509> I<00:04:53.750> gonna<00:04:54.620> have<00:04:54.830> to<00:04:54.889> go

out<00:04:55.129> on<00:04:55.220> a<00:04:55.280> limb<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:55.580> say<00:04:55.669> the<00:04:55.849> Apple<00:04:56.120> was

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
out on a limb and say the Apple was

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.330 
out on a limb and say the Apple was
talking<00:04:56.509> about<00:04:56.569> the<00:04:57.020> stronger<00:04:57.590> Wi-Fi<00:04:58.039> card

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
talking about the stronger Wi-Fi card

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.559 
talking about the stronger Wi-Fi card
rather<00:04:58.940> than<00:04:59.210> the<00:04:59.389> actual<00:04:59.539> 3G<00:05:00.229> speeds<00:05:00.590> so<00:05:01.280> that

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
rather than the actual 3G speeds so that

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.200 
rather than the actual 3G speeds so that
is<00:05:02.569> a<00:05:02.599> you<00:05:03.199> know<00:05:04.130> something<00:05:04.580> I<00:05:04.669> just<00:05:04.759> saw<00:05:05.000> here

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
is a you know something I just saw here

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.899 
is a you know something I just saw here
and<00:05:05.330> I've<00:05:05.419> seen<00:05:05.659> kind<00:05:05.960> of<00:05:06.069> repetitively<00:05:07.069> in<00:05:07.669> my

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
and I've seen kind of repetitively in my

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:12.760 
and I've seen kind of repetitively in my
tests<00:05:08.240> on<00:05:09.020> my<00:05:09.889> iPhones<00:05:10.870> so<00:05:11.870> now<00:05:12.020> on<00:05:12.139> our<00:05:12.319> camera

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
tests on my iPhones so now on our camera

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.559 
tests on my iPhones so now on our camera
test<00:05:13.009> and<00:05:13.250> on<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:13.729> Left<00:05:13.940> we<00:05:14.060> have<00:05:14.090> our<00:05:14.210> iPhone

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:14.569 
test and on the Left we have our iPhone

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.300 
test and on the Left we have our iPhone
4s<00:05:14.870> camera<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:15.680> on<00:05:15.770> the<00:05:15.860> right<00:05:16.009> we<00:05:16.130> have<00:05:16.159> the

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
iPhone 4 now here you can see the color

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.260 
iPhone 4 now here you can see the color
is<00:05:18.979> a<00:05:19.009> little<00:05:19.039> bit<00:05:19.250> more<00:05:19.370> clear<00:05:19.669> on<00:05:19.699> the<00:05:19.849> iPhone

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
is a little bit more clear on the iPhone

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.320 
is a little bit more clear on the iPhone
4s<00:05:20.509> than<00:05:21.319> on<00:05:21.469> the<00:05:21.620> iPhone<00:05:21.979> 4<00:05:22.370> with<00:05:22.969> actual

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
4s than on the iPhone 4 with actual

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.999 
4s than on the iPhone 4 with actual
quality<00:05:23.690> is<00:05:23.810> about<00:05:24.020> the<00:05:24.169> same<00:05:24.409> so<00:05:24.620> I<00:05:24.650> have<00:05:24.830> got

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:25.009 
quality is about the same so I have got

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.409 
quality is about the same so I have got
a<00:05:25.039> slight<00:05:25.340> advantage<00:05:25.460> to<00:05:25.819> the<00:05:25.909> iPhone<00:05:26.240> 4s<00:05:28.419> the

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
a slight advantage to the iPhone 4s the

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.899 
a slight advantage to the iPhone 4s the
final<00:05:29.780> toss<00:05:29.990> between<00:05:30.289> the<00:05:30.560> iPhone<00:05:30.830> 4s<00:05:31.099> and<00:05:31.520> the

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:31.909 
final toss between the iPhone 4s and the

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:34.300 
final toss between the iPhone 4s and the
iPhone<00:05:32.719> 4<00:05:33.050> is<00:05:33.289> the<00:05:33.620> difference<00:05:33.889> between<00:05:33.919> voice

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
iPhone 4 is the difference between voice

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.510 
iPhone 4 is the difference between voice
control<00:05:34.729> in<00:05:34.880> Siri<00:05:35.240> now<00:05:35.979> this<00:05:36.979> can<00:05:37.130> go<00:05:37.219> out<00:05:37.340> then

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
control in Siri now this can go out then

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.089 
control in Siri now this can go out then
say<00:05:37.759> the<00:05:37.909> iPhone<00:05:38.210> 4s<00:05:38.419> clearly<00:05:38.990> wins<00:05:39.199> this<00:05:39.530> but

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
say the iPhone 4s clearly wins this but

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:41.350 
say the iPhone 4s clearly wins this but
it's<00:05:40.250> a<00:05:40.340> matter<00:05:40.520> of<00:05:40.610> will<00:05:40.880> you<00:05:41.029> use<00:05:41.210> this

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
it's a matter of will you use this

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
iPhone 4s was just slightly better I

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.450 
iPhone 4s was just slightly better I
didn't<00:06:44.720> show<00:06:44.900> you<00:06:44.960> guys<00:06:45.200> the<00:06:45.410> speed<00:06:45.770> behind<00:06:45.919> it

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
didn't show you guys the speed behind it

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.570 
didn't show you guys the speed behind it
hey<00:06:46.730> when<00:06:47.240> I<00:06:47.270> booted<00:06:47.660> him<00:06:47.810> up<00:06:48.020> the<00:06:49.010> iPhone<00:06:49.340> 4s

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
hey when I booted him up the iPhone 4s

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.000 
hey when I booted him up the iPhone 4s
started<00:06:50.360> up<00:06:50.450> two<00:06:50.630> seconds<00:06:50.990> faster<00:06:51.410> and<00:06:51.710> it

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
started up two seconds faster and it

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.370 
started up two seconds faster and it
runs<00:06:52.220> a<00:06:52.340> you<00:06:53.270> know<00:06:53.360> more<00:06:53.990> intense

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
runs a you know more intense

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.830 
runs a you know more intense
applications<00:06:55.040> a<00:06:55.190> little<00:06:55.490> bit<00:06:55.610> smoother<00:06:56.120> but

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 
applications a little bit smoother but

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.840 
applications a little bit smoother but
other<00:06:57.350> than<00:06:57.650> that<00:06:57.710> there<00:06:58.400> wasn't<00:06:58.639> much

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:58.850 
other than that there wasn't much

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.730 
other than that there wasn't much
difference<00:06:59.150> between<00:06:59.360> the<00:06:59.450> actual<00:06:59.750> speed<00:07:00.500> of

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740 
difference between the actual speed of

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.490 
difference between the actual speed of
the<00:07:00.830> processors<00:07:01.430> in<00:07:01.639> my<00:07:01.910> opinion<00:07:02.360> and<00:07:03.230> then

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.500 
the processors in my opinion and then

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.860 
the processors in my opinion and then
the<00:07:04.310> download<00:07:04.639> speeds<00:07:05.150> were<00:07:05.300> only<00:07:05.450> better<00:07:05.690> on

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
the download speeds were only better on

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.500 
the download speeds were only better on
Wi-Fi<00:07:06.230> so<00:07:06.470> you<00:07:07.340> know<00:07:07.400> if<00:07:07.669> you<00:07:07.940> have<00:07:08.060> an<00:07:08.150> upgrade

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:08.510 
Wi-Fi so you know if you have an upgrade

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.510 
Wi-Fi so you know if you have an upgrade
you<00:07:08.750> know<00:07:09.139> yeah<00:07:09.380> the<00:07:09.560> forest<00:07:09.889> is<00:07:10.040> definitely

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
you know yeah the forest is definitely

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.469 
you know yeah the forest is definitely
better<00:07:10.700> but<00:07:11.000> is<00:07:11.810> it<00:07:11.990> worth<00:07:12.229> $100<00:07:13.030> you<00:07:14.030> know<00:07:14.180> I

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 
better but is it worth $100 you know I

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:17.500 
better but is it worth $100 you know I
don't<00:07:15.080> know<00:07:15.229> I<00:07:15.260> mean<00:07:15.580> it<00:07:16.580> will<00:07:16.910> probably<00:07:17.150> be

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:17.510 
don't know I mean it will probably be

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.040 
don't know I mean it will probably be
you<00:07:18.050> know<00:07:18.110> last<00:07:18.860> longer<00:07:19.250> you<00:07:19.430> know<00:07:19.669> be<00:07:19.940> a<00:07:20.510> newer

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.050 
you know last longer you know be a newer

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.080 
you know last longer you know be a newer
phone<00:07:21.410> where<00:07:21.740> I<00:07:21.770> can<00:07:22.010> run<00:07:22.160> newer<00:07:22.400> firmware<00:07:22.700> for

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.090 
phone where I can run newer firmware for

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.560 
phone where I can run newer firmware for
a<00:07:23.150> longer<00:07:23.419> time<00:07:23.600> for<00:07:23.870> example<00:07:24.290> the<00:07:24.350> iPhone<00:07:24.710> 3G

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:25.570 
a longer time for example the iPhone 3G

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.120 
a longer time for example the iPhone 3G
no<00:07:26.570> longer<00:07:26.990> runs<00:07:27.320> the<00:07:27.650> newest<00:07:27.889> operating

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:28.130 
no longer runs the newest operating

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.710 
no longer runs the newest operating
system<00:07:28.490> but<00:07:28.580> the<00:07:28.669> 3GS<00:07:29.060> still<00:07:29.389> runs<00:07:29.600> iOS<00:07:29.750> 5<00:07:30.229> so<00:07:31.010> I

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:31.720 
system but the 3GS still runs iOS 5 so I

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.969 
system but the 3GS still runs iOS 5 so I
guess<00:07:32.720> in<00:07:32.900> my<00:07:33.050> my<00:07:33.260> answer<00:07:33.500> is<00:07:33.620> if<00:07:33.740> you<00:07:33.800> have<00:07:33.919> the

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:33.979 
guess in my my answer is if you have the

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:35.620 
guess in my my answer is if you have the
opportunity<00:07:34.400> to<00:07:34.490> get<00:07:34.550> the<00:07:34.669> iPhone<00:07:34.790> for<00:07:35.150> us<00:07:35.300> get

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:35.630 
opportunity to get the iPhone for us get

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.450 
opportunity to get the iPhone for us get
it<00:07:35.810> otherwise<00:07:36.260> the<00:07:36.470> iPhone<00:07:36.770> 4<00:07:37.010> is<00:07:37.100> just<00:07:37.340> as

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:37.460 
it otherwise the iPhone 4 is just as

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.740 
it otherwise the iPhone 4 is just as
good<00:07:37.610> and<00:07:37.850> I<00:07:37.880> think<00:07:37.940> it'd<00:07:38.120> be<00:07:38.150> just<00:07:38.240> as<00:07:38.479> happy

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:38.750 
good and I think it'd be just as happy

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.219 
good and I think it'd be just as happy
with<00:07:38.780> that<00:07:39.020> phone<00:07:39.290> so<00:07:39.979> again<00:07:40.970> if<00:07:41.960> you<00:07:42.080> liked
