depot and I brought a piece of the
tubing<00:00:05.160> with<00:00:05.370> me<00:00:07.849> and<00:00:08.870> what<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:09.900> got<00:00:10.260> there<00:00:10.950> was

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
tubing with me and what I got there was

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.430 
tubing with me and what I got there was
this<00:00:12.030> little<00:00:12.240> deal<00:00:12.540> right<00:00:12.750> here<00:00:12.780> it's<00:00:13.200> kind<00:00:13.380> of

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
this little deal right here it's kind of

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.950 
this little deal right here it's kind of
big<00:00:13.679> but<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.219> fit<00:00:14.519> perfectly<00:00:15.089> all<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.750> reason

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
big but it fit perfectly all the reason

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.420 
big but it fit perfectly all the reason
it<00:00:16.049> fit<00:00:16.199> perfectly<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.890> because<00:00:17.250> it's

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
it fit perfectly is because it's

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.570 
it fit perfectly is because it's
threaded<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.050> inside<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:20.039> what<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.310> have<00:00:20.460> to

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
threaded on the inside so what I have to

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:32.440 
threaded on the inside so what I have to
do<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:21.320> attach<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.600> guess<00:00:24.600> one<00:00:25.050> part

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.990 

that's<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.630> somewhere<00:00:33.980> maybe<00:00:34.980> along<00:00:35.340> here

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
that's just somewhere maybe along here

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.690 
that's just somewhere maybe along here
and<00:00:36.590> what<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.770> going<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.370> control

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
and what this is going to do is control

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.549 
and what this is going to do is control
the<00:00:38.879> flow<00:00:39.829> with<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:40.860> little<00:00:41.250> knob<00:00:42.500> see<00:00:43.500> you

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
the flow with this little knob see you

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:53.479 
the flow with this little knob see you
don't<00:00:43.680> know<00:00:45.950> it<00:00:46.950> sounds<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:50.840> Matt<00:00:52.489> but

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
return on this level as use i guess like

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.230 
return on this level as use i guess like
halfway<00:02:23.370> open<00:02:24.030> go<00:02:24.840> all<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.320> way<00:02:25.350> up<00:02:25.650> here<00:02:25.920> and

that's the return and the water and a
pakistan<00:02:31.050> was<00:02:31.230> level<00:02:31.560> also<00:02:33.770> so<00:02:34.770> i'm<00:02:35.459> basically

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
pakistan was level also so i'm basically

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.930 
pakistan was level also so i'm basically
done<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.420> mean<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.470> took<00:02:37.530> me<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.830> week<00:02:37.980> but<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.670> got

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
done I mean I took me a week but I got

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.720 
done I mean I took me a week but I got
it<00:02:39.060> done<00:02:39.090> it's<00:02:39.990> not<00:02:40.110> as<00:02:40.260> much<00:02:40.410> pressure<00:02:40.950> as<00:02:41.160> I

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
it done it's not as much pressure as I

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.060 
it done it's not as much pressure as I
thought<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.900> would<00:02:42.930> be<00:02:43.110> but<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.350> think<00:02:43.410> that's

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
thought it would be but I think that's

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.070 
thought it would be but I think that's
pretty<00:02:44.280> normal<00:02:45.709> and<00:02:46.709> what's<00:02:46.980> coming<00:02:47.340> here<00:02:48.080> so

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
pretty normal and what's coming here so

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.540 
pretty normal and what's coming here so
I<00:02:49.110> guess<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.440> got<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.590> kind<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.160> stick<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.430> in

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
I guess I got to kind of stick that in

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.280 
I guess I got to kind of stick that in
order<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.120> won't<00:02:51.269> be<00:02:51.420> too<00:02:51.450> much<00:02:51.660> sound<00:02:52.050> let

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
order so it won't be too much sound let

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.759 
order so it won't be too much sound let
me<00:02:52.350> see<00:02:52.410> if<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.530> could<00:02:52.590> turn<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.830> light<00:02:52.950> on

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
me see if I could turn the light on

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.810 
me see if I could turn the light on
maybe<00:02:55.769> stick<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.100> into<00:02:56.220> water<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:56.580> make

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
maybe stick that into water so make

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.940 
maybe stick that into water so make
lunch<00:02:57.030> sound<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:59.959> so<00:03:00.959> now<00:03:01.260> I'm<00:03:01.560> going<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.769> put

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
pounds of rubble from some guy that

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.770 
pounds of rubble from some guy that
lives<00:04:08.250> on<00:04:08.430> like<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.090> next<00:04:09.300> town<00:04:09.390> over<00:04:09.450> for

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
lives on like the next town over for

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.190 
lives on like the next town over for
like<00:04:10.100> twenty<00:04:11.100> dollars<00:04:11.489> that's<00:04:12.480> just<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:13.050> add

more rock and I have to get a basket
from<00:04:14.940> I<00:04:15.680> think<00:04:16.680> target<00:04:16.950> just<00:04:17.580> to<00:04:17.640> keep

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
from I think target just to keep

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.729 
from I think target just to keep
everything<00:04:17.910> together<00:04:18.209> because<00:04:19.140> my<00:04:19.290> proteins

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
everything together because my proteins

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.909 
everything together because my proteins
can<00:04:19.859> run<00:04:20.010> aside<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:21.330> then<00:04:21.540> there<00:04:21.870> is<00:04:22.080> my

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
can run aside and then there is my

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.140 
can run aside and then there is my
return<00:04:25.919> pump<00:04:26.190> there's<00:04:26.460> that's<00:04:26.729> a<00:04:26.820> chocolate

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
return pump there's that's a chocolate

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.640 
return pump there's that's a chocolate
chip<00:04:27.270> starfish<00:04:27.630> on<00:04:27.780> there<00:04:27.930> too<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.290> had<00:04:28.530> him

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
chip starfish on there too I had him

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.440 
chip starfish on there too I had him
inside<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:28.890> main<00:04:29.160> tank<00:04:29.430> he<00:04:30.060> was<00:04:30.150> in<00:04:30.240> there<00:04:30.300> for

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
inside the main tank he was in there for

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.170 
inside the main tank he was in there for
two<00:04:30.600> days<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:31.100> 83<00:04:32.100> snails<00:04:32.370> as<00:04:32.640> my<00:04:32.850> mistake<00:04:33.150> not

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
two days and 83 snails as my mistake not

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.240 
two days and 83 snails as my mistake not
doing<00:04:33.479> any<00:04:33.630> research<00:04:33.930> before<00:04:34.410> put<00:04:35.040> him<00:04:35.190> in

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250
