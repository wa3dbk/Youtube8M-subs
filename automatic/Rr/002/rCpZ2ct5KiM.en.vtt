Bosley<00:01:27.630> ship<00:01:27.900> would<00:01:28.049> be<00:01:28.200> applying<00:01:28.409> Jay

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
Bosley ship would be applying Jay

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.460 
Bosley ship would be applying Jay
Garrick<00:01:28.950> or<00:01:29.520> did<00:01:29.790> they<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.570> I've<00:01:31.140> seen<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
Garrick or did they so I've seen a

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.590 
Garrick or did they so I've seen a
theory<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.009> basically<00:01:32.520> says<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:32.909> having

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
theory that basically says that having

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.660 
theory that basically says that having
Mark<00:01:33.930> Hamill<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.650> Amanda<00:01:35.100> pays<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.520> John

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
Mark Hamill and Amanda pays and John

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.429 
Mark Hamill and Amanda pays and John
grizzly<00:01:35.880> ship<00:01:36.210> as<00:01:36.420> their<00:01:36.630> characters<00:01:37.020> from

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
grizzly ship as their characters from

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.219 
grizzly ship as their characters from
that<00:01:37.710> original<00:01:37.890> 90<00:01:38.400> show<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.479> show<00:01:39.659> it

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
that original 90 show on on this show it

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.609 
that original 90 show on on this show it
means<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.890> basically<00:01:41.630> it<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:43.500> very

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
means that basically it it's very

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.289 
means that basically it it's very
complicated<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.340> if<00:01:44.549> friend<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.060> was<00:01:45.180> like

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
complicated but if friend and I was like

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.639 
complicated but if friend and I was like
the<00:01:45.420> new<00:01:45.509> 52<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.930> everything<00:01:46.229> involved<00:01:46.560> with

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the new 52 and everything involved with

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.969 
the new 52 and everything involved with
the<00:01:46.710> comment<00:01:47.100> comics<00:01:47.930> there<00:01:48.930> goes<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.439> that

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
the comment comics there goes that that

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.609 
the comment comics there goes that that
universe<00:01:50.610> was<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.360> original<00:01:51.530> kind<00:01:52.530> of

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
universe was like the original kind of

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.350 
universe was like the original kind of
universal<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.159> was<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:54.119> was<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
universal it was like that it was the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.420 
universal it was like that it was the
pre<00:01:54.630> new<00:01:54.899> 52<00:01:55.290> universe<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.920> add<00:01:56.250> this

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
pre new 52 universe and add this

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.130 
pre new 52 universe and add this
universes<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.000> new<00:01:57.090> 52<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.600> flashpoint

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
universes in new 52 like flashpoint

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.499 
universes in new 52 like flashpoint
happened<00:01:58.530> with<00:01:58.950> john<00:01:59.159> leslie<00:01:59.340> ships<00:01:59.729> flash

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
happened with john leslie ships flash

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.899 
happened with john leslie ships flash
like<00:02:01.110> at<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.320> short<00:02:01.530> one<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:02.219> like<00:02:02.460> 20<00:02:02.880> years

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
like at the short one in like 20 years

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.310 
like at the short one in like 20 years
from<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.420> future<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.110> shows

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
from the future of like that shows

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.350 
from the future of like that shows
timeline<00:02:04.680> dominoes<00:02:05.610> they<00:02:05.790> shipped<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.180> all

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
timeline dominoes they shipped it all

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.180 
timeline dominoes they shipped it all
the<00:02:06.899> flashpoint<00:02:07.200> stuff<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:07.979> try<00:02:08.129> to

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
the flashpoint stuff and like try to

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.130 
the flashpoint stuff and like try to
save<00:02:08.340> his<00:02:08.429> mom<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.789> all<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.239> all<00:02:09.929> that

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
save his mom and all that and all that

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.639 
save his mom and all that and all that
crap

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
crap

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.009 
crap
and<00:02:11.610> then<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:12.060> got<00:02:12.180> reboot<00:02:12.510> into<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.810> new<00:02:12.900> 52

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
and then it got reboot into the new 52

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.559 
and then it got reboot into the new 52
so<00:02:13.739> that's<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.519> theory<00:02:14.730> here<00:02:15.030> with<00:02:15.450> that

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
so that's the theory here with that

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.179 
so that's the theory here with that
theory<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.379> lot<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.709> actually<00:02:17.040> think

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
theory that a lot of you actually think

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.250 
theory that a lot of you actually think
happens<00:02:17.579> and<00:02:17.730> i<00:02:17.790> canna<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.780> kind<00:02:19.049> of<00:02:19.110> makes

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
happens and i canna it kind of makes

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.289 
happens and i canna it kind of makes
sense<00:02:19.470> anything<00:02:20.099> i<00:02:20.280> think<00:02:20.549> one<00:02:21.060> exactly

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
sense anything i think one exactly

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.119 
sense anything i think one exactly
senses<00:02:21.840> who<00:02:21.930> would<00:02:22.560> just<00:02:22.739> kind<00:02:22.799> of<00:02:22.890> be<00:02:23.010> like

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
senses who would just kind of be like

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.190 
senses who would just kind of be like
the<00:02:23.730> show<00:02:23.970> there's<00:02:24.299> like<00:02:24.420> it's<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.659> reboot<00:02:25.019> of<00:02:25.110> a

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
the show there's like it's a reboot of a

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.050 
the show there's like it's a reboot of a
show<00:02:25.409> and<00:02:25.739> then<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:26.430> would<00:02:26.579> be<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> very<00:02:26.819> cool

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
show and then this would be a very cool

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.059 
show and then this would be a very cool
way<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.239> kind<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.900> explaining<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.439> the<00:02:28.799> same<00:02:28.980> of

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
way of kind of explaining it the same of

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.530 
way of kind of explaining it the same of
the<00:02:29.129> x-men<00:02:29.310> these<00:02:29.700> features<00:02:30.030> past<00:02:30.209> kind<00:02:30.480> of

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
the x-men these features past kind of

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.690 
the x-men these features past kind of
reboots<00:02:30.870> everything<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:32.310> really<00:02:32.459> cool

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
reboots everything and it's really cool

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.520 
reboots everything and it's really cool
there's<00:02:33.150> just<00:02:33.390> no<00:02:33.720> way<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:33.959> can<00:02:34.260> think<00:02:34.409> of

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
there's just no way I can think of

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.589 
there's just no way I can think of
they'd<00:02:34.890> ever<00:02:35.069> be<00:02:35.310> able<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.579> prove<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.970> but<00:02:36.480> back

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
they'd ever be able to prove it but back

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.750 
they'd ever be able to prove it but back
to<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:36.780> whole<00:02:36.930> Jay<00:02:37.079> Garrick<00:02:37.739> thing<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.159> lot<00:02:38.700> of

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
to the whole Jay Garrick thing a lot of

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.729 
to the whole Jay Garrick thing a lot of
people<00:02:38.849> theorize<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:39.480> because<00:02:39.810> like<00:02:40.530> being

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
people theorize this because like being

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:41.899 
people theorize this because like being
just<00:02:40.920> kind<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.129> hope<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.370> at<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.760> beginning

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
just kind of hope that at the beginning

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.990 
just kind of hope that at the beginning
that<00:02:42.329> he<00:02:42.720> would<00:02:43.139> be<00:02:43.260> Jay<00:02:43.440> Garrick<00:02:43.769> but<00:02:44.459> we're

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
that he would be Jay Garrick but we're

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.449 
that he would be Jay Garrick but we're
disappointed<00:02:45.329> when<00:02:45.750> he<00:02:45.780> wasn't<00:02:46.250> but<00:02:47.250> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
disappointed when he wasn't but the

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.520 
disappointed when he wasn't but the
question<00:02:47.879> has<00:02:48.030> come<00:02:48.120> up<00:02:48.269> does<00:02:48.659> he<00:02:48.840> have<00:02:48.870> powers

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
question has come up does he have powers

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.990 
question has come up does he have powers
and<00:02:49.769> I<00:02:50.400> think<00:02:50.459> there<00:02:50.730> have<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:50.849> few

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
and I think there have a few

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.309 
and I think there have a few
possibilities<00:02:51.359> of<00:02:51.599> what<00:02:51.720> could<00:02:51.780> happen<00:02:52.049> to

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
possibilities of what could happen to

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.619 
possibilities of what could happen to
this<00:02:52.530> number<00:02:53.370> one<00:02:53.549> he<00:02:53.730> has<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.849> flash<00:02:54.150> ring<00:02:54.389> so

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
this number one he has a flash ring so

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:55.940 
this number one he has a flash ring so
when<00:02:54.810> Barry's<00:02:55.079> mom<00:02:55.230> was<00:02:55.500> getting<00:02:55.620> attacked

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
when Barry's mom was getting attacked

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.619 
when Barry's mom was getting attacked
and<00:02:56.069> everything<00:02:56.459> he<00:02:56.909> wasn't<00:02:57.209> doing<00:02:57.269> anything

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
and everything he wasn't doing anything

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.599 
and everything he wasn't doing anything
like<00:02:57.870> he<00:02:58.019> was<00:02:58.139> just<00:02:58.319> not<00:02:58.769> doing<00:02:59.220> anything<00:02:59.400> a

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
like he was just not doing anything a

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.309 
like he was just not doing anything a
few<00:02:59.790> powers<00:03:00.150> then<00:03:00.389> he<00:03:00.750> clearly<00:03:01.079> would<00:03:01.260> have

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
few powers then he clearly would have

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.890 
few powers then he clearly would have
just<00:03:01.530> spent<00:03:02.040> in<00:03:02.189> there<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.609> like<00:03:03.120> save<00:03:03.389> his

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
just spent in there and like save his

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.050 
just spent in there and like save his
wife<00:03:03.930> because<00:03:04.680> like<00:03:05.010> obviously<00:03:05.670> that's<00:03:05.909> what

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
wife because like obviously that's what

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.729 
wife because like obviously that's what
you<00:03:06.209> would<00:03:06.359> do<00:03:06.510> if<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.840> hide<00:03:07.049> it<00:03:07.079> super<00:03:07.439> powers

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
you would do if you hide it super powers

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.500 
you would do if you hide it super powers
but<00:03:08.159> if<00:03:08.220> he<00:03:08.280> had<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.400> flash<00:03:08.609> ring<00:03:08.849> that<00:03:09.299> mean

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
but if he had a flash ring that mean

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.940 
but if he had a flash ring that mean
that<00:03:09.540> he<00:03:09.659> isn't<00:03:09.930> doesn't<00:03:10.349> just<00:03:10.500> always<00:03:10.650> have

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
that he isn't doesn't just always have

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.530 
that he isn't doesn't just always have
on<00:03:11.189> them<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.489> that<00:03:11.879> maybe<00:03:12.060> it's<00:03:12.269> in<00:03:12.359> like<00:03:12.480> a

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
on them and that maybe it's in like a

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.640 
on them and that maybe it's in like a
different<00:03:12.780> room<00:03:12.870> or<00:03:12.989> something<00:03:13.139> or<00:03:13.409> he<00:03:13.530> just

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
different room or something or he just

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.800 
different room or something or he just
hasn't<00:03:13.829> had<00:03:14.099> it<00:03:14.340> on<00:03:14.459> him<00:03:14.639> right<00:03:14.760> now<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.209> that

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
hasn't had it on him right now and that

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.210 
hasn't had it on him right now and that
it's<00:03:16.079> somewhere<00:03:16.290> else<00:03:16.470> meaning<00:03:16.859> he's<00:03:17.069> not

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
it's somewhere else meaning he's not

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.710 
it's somewhere else meaning he's not
able<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.579> go<00:03:17.699> off<00:03:17.879> speedster<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.510> if<00:03:18.629> he

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
able to go off speedster and if he

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.920 
able to go off speedster and if he
leaves<00:03:19.019> Barry<00:03:19.470> there<00:03:19.910> then<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.510> know<00:03:21.629> who

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
leaves Barry there then you know who

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.629 
leaves Barry there then you know who
knows<00:03:22.109> what<00:03:22.290> could<00:03:22.379> happen<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:23.129> that's<00:03:23.519> you

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
knows what could happen so that's you

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.400 
knows what could happen so that's you
wouldn't<00:03:23.849> be<00:03:23.910> able<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.150> use<00:03:24.239> super<00:03:24.449> cars<00:03:24.629> and

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
wouldn't be able to use super cars and

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.930 
wouldn't be able to use super cars and
because<00:03:25.739> of<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:25.949> mid-season<00:03:26.190> finale<00:03:26.370> we<00:03:26.760> do

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
because of the mid-season finale we do

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.149 
because of the mid-season finale we do
know<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.120> flash<00:03:27.480> rooms<00:03:27.750> who<00:03:27.840> exist<00:03:28.470> number

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
know that flash rooms who exist number

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.530 
know that flash rooms who exist number
two<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.489> particle<00:03:29.819> accelerator<00:03:29.879> so

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
two is the particle accelerator so

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.140 
two is the particle accelerator so
here's<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.870> thing<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.980> seems<00:03:32.280> like<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.819> Speed

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
here's the thing it seems like the Speed

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.780 
here's the thing it seems like the Speed
Force<00:03:33.180> is<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:34.769> liteon<00:03:35.099> like<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.519> lightning

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
Force is the liteon like the lightning

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.789 
Force is the liteon like the lightning
it's<00:03:36.150> special<00:03:36.780> lightning<00:03:37.169> it's<00:03:37.349> the<00:03:37.530> Speed

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
it's special lightning it's the Speed

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.839 
it's special lightning it's the Speed
Force<00:03:37.829> so<00:03:38.819> I<00:03:39.919> jamas<00:03:40.919> a<00:03:41.040> ship<00:03:41.190> like<00:03:41.400> hang<00:03:41.699> on

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
Force so I jamas a ship like hang on

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.580 
Force so I jamas a ship like hang on
we've<00:03:42.090> had<00:03:42.329> it<00:03:42.449> been<00:03:42.540> struck<00:03:42.840> in<00:03:42.870> by<00:03:43.079> it<00:03:43.139> to<00:03:43.560> be

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
we've had it been struck in by it to be

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.589 
we've had it been struck in by it to be
a<00:03:43.829> speedster<00:03:44.430> at<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.060> same<00:03:45.209> time<00:03:45.359> though

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
a speedster at the same time though

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.210 
a speedster at the same time though
they're<00:03:46.019> been<00:03:46.229> on<00:03:46.319> like<00:03:46.620> a<00:03:46.650> lot<00:03:46.859> of<00:03:46.949> villains

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
they're been on like a lot of villains

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.240 
they're been on like a lot of villains
like<00:03:47.370> girder<00:03:47.639> and<00:03:47.790> like<00:03:48.780> heat<00:03:49.379> way<00:03:49.530> that<00:03:50.069> heat

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
like girder and like heat way that heat

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.800 
like girder and like heat way that heat
wave<00:03:50.400> don't<00:03:50.609> playing<00:03:50.849> actually<00:03:51.180> because<00:03:51.479> it

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
wave don't playing actually because it

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.479 
wave don't playing actually because it
isn't<00:03:52.049> all<00:03:52.680> right<00:03:52.769> but<00:03:53.069> there's<00:03:53.159> been<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.340> lot

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
isn't all right but there's been a lot

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.610 
isn't all right but there's been a lot
of<00:03:53.519> heroes<00:03:53.909> and<00:03:54.000> villains<00:03:54.239> like<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:55.019> know<00:03:55.109> a

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
of heroes and villains like you know a

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.250 
of heroes and villains like you know a
girder<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:56.699> firestorm<00:03:57.269> that<00:03:57.540> have<00:03:58.049> gotten

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
girder and firestorm that have gotten

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.170 
girder and firestorm that have gotten
powers<00:03:58.799> without<00:03:59.190> actually<00:03:59.699> having<00:03:59.819> to<00:04:00.000> be

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
powers without actually having to be

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.819 
powers without actually having to be
struggling<00:04:00.690> by<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:00.959> Speed<00:04:01.500> Force<00:04:01.530> Lightning

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
struggling by the Speed Force Lightning

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.860 
struggling by the Speed Force Lightning
because<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.340> whole<00:04:02.489> premise<00:04:02.699> of<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.659> flash

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
because the whole premise of the flash

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.979 
because the whole premise of the flash
show<00:04:04.229> so<00:04:04.799> the<00:04:05.519> thought<00:04:05.669> being<00:04:05.909> what<00:04:06.540> if<00:04:06.659> you

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
show so the thought being what if you

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.449 
show so the thought being what if you
want<00:04:07.169> to<00:04:07.229> hit<00:04:07.379> the<00:04:07.530> power<00:04:07.709> he<00:04:07.859> just<00:04:08.010> got<00:04:08.099> most

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
want to hit the power he just got most

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.189 
want to hit the power he just got most
super<00:04:08.699> speed<00:04:08.940> it's<00:04:09.150> not<00:04:09.299> the<00:04:09.510> Speed<00:04:09.750> Force<00:04:09.780> or

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
super speed it's not the Speed Force or

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.530 
super speed it's not the Speed Force or
anything<00:04:10.500> it's<00:04:10.949> just<00:04:11.099> super<00:04:11.669> speed<00:04:11.909> I<00:04:12.120> think

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
anything it's just super speed I think

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.789 
anything it's just super speed I think
that<00:04:12.629> would<00:04:12.840> be<00:04:12.900> very<00:04:12.930> interesting<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.769> I

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
that would be very interesting and I

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.949 
that would be very interesting and I
think<00:04:13.829> that<00:04:14.099> would<00:04:14.250> kind<00:04:14.489> of<00:04:14.840> break<00:04:15.840> the

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
think that would kind of break the

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.140 
think that would kind of break the
character<00:04:16.289> why<00:04:16.560> not<00:04:16.739> having<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.579> speedster<00:04:17.970> not

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
character why not having a speedster not

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.180 
character why not having a speedster not
powered<00:04:18.389> by<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.510> Speed<00:04:18.779> Force<00:04:18.919> by<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:19.979> same

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
powered by the Speed Force by the same

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.379 
powered by the Speed Force by the same
time<00:04:20.340> I<00:04:20.370> think<00:04:20.489> that<00:04:20.760> would<00:04:20.880> be<00:04:20.969> a<00:04:21.000> really<00:04:21.209> good

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
time I think that would be a really good

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.129 
time I think that would be a really good
way<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.989> explain<00:04:22.380> everything<00:04:22.909> number<00:04:23.909> three

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
way to explain everything number three

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.980 
way to explain everything number three
it<00:04:24.199> is<00:04:24.319> yet<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.740> be<00:04:24.770> revealed<00:04:25.550> like<00:04:26.479> he's<00:04:26.719> yet

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
it is yet to be revealed like he's yet

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.080 
it is yet to be revealed like he's yet
to<00:04:27.020> receive<00:04:27.439> them<00:04:27.590> pretty<00:04:27.860> much<00:04:27.979> so<00:04:28.669> it<00:04:28.879> could

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
to receive them pretty much so it could

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.760 
to receive them pretty much so it could

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
I'm Nora Allen it seems like it could be

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.950

a thing where he's like forced into

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.050 
a thing where he's like forced into
hiding<00:04:39.110> he<00:04:39.710> changes<00:04:40.129> his<00:04:40.159> name<00:04:40.279> to<00:04:40.490> like<00:04:40.789> Jay

00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:43.879 
Garrick and then he like if it receives

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.059 
Garrick and then he like if it receives
powers<00:04:44.240> when<00:04:44.419> I<00:04:44.449> is<00:04:44.870> jay<00:04:45.169> garrick<00:04:45.499> or<00:04:45.650> there's

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:46.069 
powers when I is jay garrick or there's

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:47.649 
powers when I is jay garrick or there's
a<00:04:46.129> theory<00:04:46.400> that<00:04:46.460> Henry<00:04:47.090> Allen<00:04:47.120> has<00:04:47.389> a<00:04:47.419> fake

00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:47.659 
a theory that Henry Allen has a fake

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:49.719 
a theory that Henry Allen has a fake
name<00:04:47.870> and<00:04:48.110> his<00:04:48.229> real<00:04:48.379> name<00:04:48.560> is<00:04:48.680> Jay<00:04:48.889> Garrick<00:04:49.249> so

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
name and his real name is Jay Garrick so

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.519 
name and his real name is Jay Garrick so
those<00:04:50.330> are<00:04:50.509> just<00:04:50.599> got<00:04:50.840> all<00:04:50.960> possibilities

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:51.529 
those are just got all possibilities

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:53.320 
those are just got all possibilities
there<00:04:51.710> which<00:04:52.279> one<00:04:52.430> do<00:04:52.550> you<00:04:52.879> think<00:04:52.909> is<00:04:53.240> more

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
there which one do you think is more

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.450 
there which one do you think is more
accurate<00:04:53.509> and<00:04:53.900> do<00:04:54.199> you<00:04:54.289> think<00:04:54.319> that<00:04:54.590> Henry

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
accurate and do you think that Henry

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.369 
accurate and do you think that Henry
Allen<00:04:55.490> could<00:04:56.180> turn<00:04:56.330> out<00:04:56.360> to<00:04:56.479> be<00:04:56.719> Jay<00:04:56.930> Garrick<00:04:57.199> I

00:04:57.369 --> 00:04:57.379 
Allen could turn out to be Jay Garrick I

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.040 
Allen could turn out to be Jay Garrick I
more<00:04:58.009> than<00:04:58.069> hope<00:04:58.400> so<00:04:58.699> that<00:04:59.029> he<00:04:59.150> does<00:04:59.330> I<00:04:59.509> feel

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
more than hope so that he does I feel

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.899 
more than hope so that he does I feel
like<00:05:00.110> it<00:05:00.319> could<00:05:00.620> happen<00:05:00.800> I<00:05:01.129> feel<00:05:01.610> I<00:05:01.669> could<00:05:01.729> be

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
like it could happen I feel I could be

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.059 
like it could happen I feel I could be
insane<00:05:02.270> if<00:05:02.300> it<00:05:02.539> did<00:05:02.719> I<00:05:02.900> think<00:05:03.229> really<00:05:03.650> awesome

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:04.069 
insane if it did I think really awesome

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.760 
insane if it did I think really awesome
I<00:05:04.250> just<00:05:04.699> kind<00:05:04.849> of<00:05:04.939> think<00:05:05.180> that<00:05:05.360> they<00:05:06.319> have<00:05:06.349> to

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
I just kind of think that they have to

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.730 
I just kind of think that they have to
set<00:05:07.520> it<00:05:07.639> up<00:05:07.699> a<00:05:07.819> lot<00:05:07.909> more<00:05:08.120> first<00:05:08.629> if<00:05:09.500> you
