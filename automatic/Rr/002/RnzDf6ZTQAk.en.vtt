 hello people come today to bring to you 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.360
 a game that I bought by indication of 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.810
 my friend bob 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.630
 I paid in 4 smooth installments of 64 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.340
 soft cents and I'll see now if my 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.529
 buy was worth it 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.939
 he told me that it is a simulator of the most 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.970
 high quality 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.759
 but then you ask me this simulator 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.780
 It's good for adolfo what he has to 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.600
 to offer 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.079
 and I answer you countless hours of 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.399
 fun and joy words of bob 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.160
 So let's start, but what the fuck is this? 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.539
 do not tell me this is the main menu 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.969
 every song 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.180
 the slutty later tells me goin ' 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.180
 sucking the gardener's simulator 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.160
 I live in the garden of enem the fuck is the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.989
 same thing as wanting to sell a karaoke 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.780
 to fred mercury 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.270
 let's not jump to conclusions 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.240
 the game can still be good at least 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.920
 we still have a green background where I can 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.920
 put on a cat party 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.650
 reading this here is a powerful and 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.660
 accurate simulator of the gardener's choice 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.630
 of the various machines below 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.880
 these indecipherable codes there 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.040
 underneath are machine names 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.950
 oh my god the sky is many options 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.290
 to choose a bitch who gave birth is a lot 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.280
 indecision for single player 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.920
 let's see campari das master where I know 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.160
 campari is an alcoholic beverage 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.120
 This attic dart must be in 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.479
 Arabic 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.160
 chimera cut e ac milan and it seems that 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.950
 gave the name of cartoon drawing 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.100
 network for grass cutting machines at 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.040
 What the hell is going on with the matic fifa? 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.590
 maybe help me on this journey to 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.379
 kiel tomato chose you 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.580
 What the fuck is the fanatic photo? 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.739
 is broken 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.360
 bitch who gave birth to this game can only be 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:23.980
 and oka paribas master 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.980
 hockenheim would say broken too 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.569
 The magnifying glass looks like we have a survivor. 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.520
 of war with us people 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.130
 Let's discourage this grass with 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.260
 powerful courtyards bright but before 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.890
 we have to read the instructions 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.450
 press m to start the engine m release 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.790
 turn off the engine 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.130
 visibly is a bit complicated but 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.940
 nothing that a bright mind like nimbly 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.340
 can not remember then let's create 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.360
 a new map 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.400
 the fucking shit what a beautiful thing to see 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.650
 what an exuberant scenery with a wealth 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.650
 so beautiful of fauna and flora 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.800
 and there we are determined to fulfill a 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.290
 goal given by the gods of Olympus 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.390
 I just hope the strong light dim 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.120
 of itself does not disturb us in this 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.890
 our journey and that the noise of the engine 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.379
 do not leave me permanently deaf 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.930
 barn and visible from the background awaits us 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.970
 and here we are already half gone 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.530
 path on this path of danger and 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.540
 adventures in size 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.250
 Look how he teleports from 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.660
 left to right 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:39.170
 majestic and our hero is about to 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.010
 complete your mission success and one more 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.260
 The day was saved thanks to the gardener. 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.099
 superpowerful and the payment still in a 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.799
 sandwich 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:53.500
 this should be a simulator of slave to 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.500
 bob will take in the middle of the middle was you 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.739

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.440
 because it does not make the 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.180
 difference since we will all die 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.349
 Three days from now 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.349
