00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
various videos I'm a pretty big fan of

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.729 
various videos I'm a pretty big fan of
really<00:00:34.699> write<00:00:34.879> stuff<00:00:35.210> I<00:00:35.449> have<00:00:36.079> some<00:00:36.260> tripods

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
really write stuff I have some tripods

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.160 
really write stuff I have some tripods
and<00:00:36.920> have<00:00:37.070> various<00:00:37.399> heads<00:00:37.670> of<00:00:37.820> this<00:00:37.969> so<00:00:38.300> when<00:00:39.140> I

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
and have various heads of this so when I

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.660 
and have various heads of this so when I
needed<00:00:39.469> a<00:00:39.559> gimbal<00:00:39.829> head<00:00:40.010> it<00:00:40.129> only<00:00:40.250> made<00:00:40.430> sense

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
needed a gimbal head it only made sense

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.520 
needed a gimbal head it only made sense
to<00:00:40.850> grab<00:00:41.120> one<00:00:41.600> of<00:00:41.719> theirs<00:00:41.899> so<00:00:42.079> I<00:00:42.140> can<00:00:42.320> integrate

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
to grab one of theirs so I can integrate

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.529 
to grab one of theirs so I can integrate
it<00:00:42.890> into<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:43.699> equipment<00:00:43.940> that<00:00:44.180> I<00:00:44.270> already<00:00:44.420> own

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
it into the equipment that I already own

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.810 
it into the equipment that I already own
so<00:00:45.020> let's<00:00:45.320> just<00:00:46.309> run<00:00:46.519> through<00:00:47.559> this<00:00:48.820> the

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
so let's just run through this the

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.340 
so let's just run through this the
gimbal<00:00:50.180> head<00:00:50.300> is<00:00:50.390> available<00:00:50.840> in<00:00:50.930> two<00:00:51.109> versions

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
gimbal head is available in two versions

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.049 
gimbal head is available in two versions
really<00:00:51.800> this<00:00:51.920> is<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.190> side<00:00:52.460> mount<00:00:52.789> version

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
really this is the side mount version

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.759 
really this is the side mount version
and<00:00:53.510> they<00:00:53.600> have<00:00:53.750> another<00:00:54.019> version<00:00:54.289> which<00:00:54.590> is

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
and they have another version which is

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.500 
and they have another version which is
the<00:00:54.920> same<00:00:55.129> bit<00:00:55.399> here<00:00:55.609> but<00:00:55.760> it<00:00:55.879> has<00:00:55.969> a<00:00:56.000> cradle

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
the same bit here but it has a cradle

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.630 
the same bit here but it has a cradle
that<00:00:56.539> comes<00:00:56.870> down<00:00:57.109> as<00:00:57.289> well<00:00:57.469> so<00:00:57.769> you<00:00:58.550> can

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
that comes down as well so you can

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.220 
that comes down as well so you can
actually<00:00:58.820> cut<00:00:59.300> the<00:00:59.449> lens<00:00:59.629> from<00:00:59.839> the<00:00:59.899> bottom

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
actually cut the lens from the bottom

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.729 
actually cut the lens from the bottom
here<00:01:01.179> personally<00:01:02.179> I<00:01:02.510> don't<00:01:02.899> mind<00:01:03.170> having<00:01:03.559> a

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
here personally I don't mind having a

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.770 
here personally I don't mind having a
side<00:01:03.980> mount<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:04.460> I<00:01:04.519> like<00:01:04.910> the<00:01:05.120> weight<00:01:05.330> saving

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
side mount and I like the weight saving

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.950 
side mount and I like the weight saving
and<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:05.960> bulk<00:01:06.170> saving<00:01:06.620> so<00:01:07.360> this<00:01:08.360> is<00:01:08.570> going<00:01:08.900> to

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
and the bulk saving so this is going to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.750 
and the bulk saving so this is going to
work<00:01:08.990> out<00:01:09.230> just<00:01:09.290> fine<00:01:09.530> for<00:01:09.710> me<00:01:10.010> I<00:01:10.190> decided<00:01:10.520> to

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
work out just fine for me I decided to

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.000 
work out just fine for me I decided to
get<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:10.970> 80<00:01:11.150> ml<00:01:11.480> clamp<00:01:11.960> on<00:01:12.170> here<00:01:12.470> so<00:01:12.980> that

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
get the 80 ml clamp on here so that

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.870 
get the 80 ml clamp on here so that
you've<00:01:13.220> got<00:01:13.340> a<00:01:13.370> little<00:01:13.520> bit<00:01:13.700> more

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
you've got a little bit more

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.340 
you've got a little bit more
fore-and-aft<00:01:14.480> movement<00:01:14.990> when<00:01:15.110> you're<00:01:15.200> trying

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
fore-and-aft movement when you're trying

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.190 
fore-and-aft movement when you're trying
to<00:01:15.440> balance<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.920> lens<00:01:16.100> out<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:17.200> basically

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
to balance the lens out and basically

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.160 
to balance the lens out and basically
the<00:01:19.010> gimble<00:01:19.400> head<00:01:19.520> itself<00:01:19.790> is<00:01:20.150> made<00:01:20.780> up<00:01:20.900> of<00:01:20.990> two

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
the gimble head itself is made up of two

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.670 
the gimble head itself is made up of two
parts<00:01:21.380> we<00:01:21.650> have<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.920> 0<00:01:22.460> 2<00:01:22.690> HB<00:01:23.690> which<00:01:24.290> is<00:01:24.470> the

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
parts we have the 0 2 HB which is the

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.620 
parts we have the 0 2 HB which is the
horizontal<00:01:25.270> base<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:27.860> 0<00:01:28.160> 2<00:01:28.250> VA<00:01:29.030> which<00:01:29.450> is

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
horizontal base and the 0 2 VA which is

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.400 
horizontal base and the 0 2 VA which is
the<00:01:29.870> vertical<00:01:30.200> arm<00:01:30.470> so<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:31.730> all<00:01:31.880> comes<00:01:32.090> apart

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
the vertical arm so it all comes apart

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.550 
the vertical arm so it all comes apart
this<00:01:33.410> but<00:01:33.620> just<00:01:33.800> slides<00:01:34.040> right<00:01:34.160> off<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:35.560> you

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
this but just slides right off and you

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.250 
this but just slides right off and you
can<00:01:36.740> actually<00:01:37.130> for<00:01:37.340> storage<00:01:38.080> turn<00:01:39.080> this

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
can actually for storage turn this

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.560 
can actually for storage turn this
around<00:01:41.350> clamp<00:01:42.350> this<00:01:42.500> on<00:01:42.710> there<00:01:43.010> and<00:01:43.220> then<00:01:44.120> if<00:01:44.420> I

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
around clamp this on there and then if I

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.960 
around clamp this on there and then if I
pop<00:01:44.780> this<00:01:44.960> off<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.260> tripod<00:01:45.710> you<00:01:46.550> can<00:01:46.580> see

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
pop this off the tripod you can see

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.940 
pop this off the tripod you can see
that's<00:01:47.720> a<00:01:47.870> pretty<00:01:47.990> neat<00:01:48.230> little<00:01:48.350> package<00:01:48.830> and

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
that's a pretty neat little package and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.800 
that's a pretty neat little package and
that's<00:01:49.070> that's<00:01:49.550> easy<00:01:49.940> enough<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.270> store<00:01:50.600> way

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
that's that's easy enough to store way

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.690 
that's that's easy enough to store way
in<00:01:50.930> your<00:01:51.050> bag<00:01:51.230> if<00:01:51.440> you're<00:01:51.530> traveling<00:01:52.430> with<00:01:52.550> it

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
in your bag if you're traveling with it

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.080 
in your bag if you're traveling with it
so<00:01:53.080> you'll<00:01:54.080> see<00:01:54.260> actually<00:01:54.770> I've<00:01:54.890> also<00:01:55.070> got<00:01:55.490> the

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
so you'll see actually I've also got the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.370 
so you'll see actually I've also got the
series<00:01:56.630> 2<00:01:56.900> leveling<00:01:57.710> base<00:01:57.920> on<00:01:58.280> my<00:01:58.690> TVC<00:01:59.690> 24l

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
series 2 leveling base on my TVC 24l

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.310 
series 2 leveling base on my TVC 24l
tripod<00:02:00.890> here<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:01.630> I'll<00:02:02.630> show<00:02:02.840> you<00:02:02.930> this<00:02:03.080> while

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
tripod here so I'll show you this while

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.290 
tripod here so I'll show you this while
I've<00:02:03.410> got<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.650> head<00:02:03.740> off<00:02:04.000> basically<00:02:05.000> with

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
I've got the head off basically with

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.490 
I've got the head off basically with
this<00:02:06.040> we<00:02:07.040> got<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.220> 15<00:02:08.090> degree<00:02:08.239> movement<00:02:08.690> in<00:02:09.020> all

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
this we got a 15 degree movement in all

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.349 
this we got a 15 degree movement in all
directions<00:02:09.649> by<00:02:10.219> just<00:02:10.459> rotating<00:02:10.670> this<00:02:11.090> collar

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:11.359 
directions by just rotating this collar

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:13.690 
directions by just rotating this collar
a<00:02:11.450> little<00:02:11.510> bit<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:12.079> you<00:02:12.950> can<00:02:12.980> level<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.519> out

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
a little bit so you can level it out

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.370 
a little bit so you can level it out
really<00:02:14.030> easily<00:02:14.299> when<00:02:14.629> you<00:02:14.689> set<00:02:14.900> your<00:02:14.930> tribe

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
really easily when you set your tribe

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.740 
really easily when you set your tribe
and<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:18.020> means<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:19.180> when<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.270> clamp<00:02:20.570> the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
and that means that when you clamp the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.000 
and that means that when you clamp the
head<00:02:20.930> on<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:22.270> you're<00:02:23.270> panning<00:02:23.690> with<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:24.080> with

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
head on and you're panning with the with

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.410 
head on and you're panning with the with
the<00:02:25.100> gimbal<00:02:25.460> that<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:25.910> can<00:02:26.090> be<00:02:26.210> sure<00:02:26.240> that

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
the gimbal that you can be sure that

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.660 
the gimbal that you can be sure that
this<00:02:26.720> is<00:02:26.780> flat<00:02:27.740> when<00:02:27.920> it's<00:02:28.040> panning<00:02:28.400> right

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
this is flat when it's panning right

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.890 
this is flat when it's panning right
away<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:29.110> it's<00:02:30.110> actually<00:02:31.210> almost<00:02:32.210> a<00:02:32.540> necessity

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
away so it's actually almost a necessity

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.450 
away so it's actually almost a necessity
I<00:02:33.200> would<00:02:33.440> say<00:02:33.620> if<00:02:33.740> you're<00:02:33.860> using<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.160> gimbal

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
I would say if you're using a gimbal

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.770 
I would say if you're using a gimbal
head<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.850> have<00:02:34.970> some<00:02:35.210> sort<00:02:35.390> of<00:02:35.420> leveling

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
head is to have some sort of leveling

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.700 
head is to have some sort of leveling
base<00:02:35.960> otherwise<00:02:36.320> you're<00:02:36.500> going<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.650> be

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
base otherwise you're going to be

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.400 
base otherwise you're going to be
fiddling<00:02:37.280> with<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.520> legs<00:02:37.930> for<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:38.960> really<00:02:39.260> long

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
fiddling with the legs for a really long

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.800 
fiddling with the legs for a really long
time<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.130> let's<00:02:41.060> pop<00:02:41.240> this<00:02:41.480> back<00:02:41.750> off<00:02:43.810> slide

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
time so let's pop this back off slide

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.390 
time so let's pop this back off slide
this<00:02:45.020> on<00:02:45.290> like<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:45.740> and<00:02:45.950> then<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.190> just

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
this on like that and then you just

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.400 
this on like that and then you just
clamp<00:02:46.640> it<00:02:46.760> up<00:02:46.910> with<00:02:47.030> this<00:02:47.180> knob<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:48.260> other

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
clamp it up with this knob the other

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.810 
clamp it up with this knob the other
knob<00:02:48.620> on<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.800> end<00:02:48.890> here<00:02:49.190> obviously<00:02:49.430> this

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
knob on the end here obviously this

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.070 
knob on the end here obviously this
locks<00:02:50.150> in<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:52.000> circular<00:02:53.000> rotation<00:02:53.900> right

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
locks in the circular rotation right

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.010 
locks in the circular rotation right
there<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:55.030> yeah<00:02:56.030> it's<00:02:56.180> really<00:02:56.270> easy<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.720> use<00:02:56.990> I

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
there and yeah it's really easy to use I

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.570 
there and yeah it's really easy to use I
mean<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.380> slide<00:02:57.710> this<00:02:57.920> in<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.250> out<00:02:58.340> so<00:02:58.520> you

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
mean you slide this in and out so you

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.170 
mean you slide this in and out so you
can<00:02:58.760> line<00:02:58.970> up<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.390> body<00:03:00.320> on<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.500> lens<00:03:01.180> we've

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
can line up the body on the lens we've

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.820 
can line up the body on the lens we've
got<00:03:02.300> this<00:03:02.390> nice<00:03:02.630> big<00:03:02.660> knob<00:03:03.170> on<00:03:03.350> here<00:03:03.620> which

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
got this nice big knob on here which

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.850 
got this nice big knob on here which
locks<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:05.510> lens<00:03:05.720> in<00:03:05.930> place<00:03:05.960> ok<00:03:06.590> let<00:03:06.770> me<00:03:06.800> just

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
locks the lens in place ok let me just

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.250 
locks the lens in place ok let me just
go<00:03:07.100> ahead<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.370> grab<00:03:07.520> a<00:03:07.550> lens<00:03:07.880> real<00:03:08.120> quick

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.600 

right<00:03:12.260> here<00:03:12.440> I<00:03:12.470> just<00:03:12.530> have<00:03:12.740> a<00:03:14.170> 302<00:03:15.170> 8<00:03:15.610> bit

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
right here I just have a 302 8 bit

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.950 
right here I just have a 302 8 bit
obviously<00:03:16.910> everything<00:03:17.210> works<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.540> same<00:03:17.750> with

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
obviously everything works the same with

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.980 
obviously everything works the same with
with<00:03:18.470> bigger<00:03:18.680> lenses<00:03:19.100> so<00:03:19.630> we'll<00:03:20.630> spin<00:03:20.810> this

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
with bigger lenses so we'll spin this

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.160 
with bigger lenses so we'll spin this
round<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.500> they<00:03:22.310> you<00:03:23.000> loosen<00:03:23.390> this<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.870> then

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
round and they you loosen this and then

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
round and they you loosen this and then
you've<00:03:24.320> got<00:03:24.470> your<00:03:25.270> vertical<00:03:26.270> tilt<00:03:26.570> like<00:03:26.810> that

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
you've got your vertical tilt like that

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.410 
you've got your vertical tilt like that
and<00:03:28.190> obviously<00:03:28.400> as<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.850> said<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.150> can<00:03:29.300> move

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
and obviously as I said you can move

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.630 
and obviously as I said you can move
this<00:03:29.630> in<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:29.870> out<00:03:29.990> to<00:03:30.200> line<00:03:31.010> this<00:03:31.190> up<00:03:31.400> with<00:03:31.430> the

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
this in and out to line this up with the

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.380 
this in and out to line this up with the
center<00:03:31.880> there<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:33.040> yeah<00:03:34.040> I<00:03:34.070> mean<00:03:34.310> as<00:03:34.550> I<00:03:34.820> with

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
center there so yeah I mean as I with

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.840 
center there so yeah I mean as I with
everything<00:03:35.780> from<00:03:35.900> really<00:03:36.170> right<00:03:36.320> stuff<00:03:36.590> it's

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
everything from really right stuff it's

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.910 
everything from really right stuff it's
incredibly<00:03:37.850> well<00:03:38.000> finished<00:03:38.510> it<00:03:39.290> just<00:03:39.500> fits

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
incredibly well finished it just fits

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.010 
incredibly well finished it just fits
together<00:03:40.100> perfectly<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:41.870> really

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
together perfectly and it really

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.240 
together perfectly and it really
complements<00:03:42.650> all<00:03:42.770> the<00:03:42.860> rest<00:03:43.040> of<00:03:43.160> their

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
complements all the rest of their

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.830 
complements all the rest of their
equipment<00:03:43.490> their<00:03:43.760> tripods<00:03:44.270> and<00:03:44.480> leveling

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
equipment their tripods and leveling

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.650 
equipment their tripods and leveling
bases<00:03:45.410> and<00:03:45.560> things<00:03:45.680> like<00:03:45.830> that<00:03:45.890> so<00:03:46.220> um<00:03:47.090> yeah

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
bases and things like that so um yeah

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.240 
bases and things like that so um yeah
I've<00:03:47.750> been<00:03:47.930> really<00:03:48.170> really<00:03:48.440> impressed<00:03:49.130> with

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
I've been really really impressed with
