00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.340
 Now you put the quarterback 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.100
 He gets the balls first 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.280
 and then had to distribute on his long journey to the test winner 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.389
 but a quarterback must be able to do more than throw 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.699
 he determines together with the coach the new move and directs that 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.300
 There he will announce the new strategy 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.929
 because even the defense knows that the front is the control center is trying 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:24.189
 to disturb her 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:25.420
 despite this pressure 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.599
 his portrait that sometimes keep the overview 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.699
 the captain should also be able to play all other positions 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.400
 so that he can help his teammates if necessary and 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.940
 can use 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.280
 so coordinated with every other game to be successful 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.080
 H 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.090
 7 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.070
 John Elkann new quarterback finally succeed but not 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.670
 A good throw starts with the correct holding of the ball's ring finger and thumb 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.760
 form a clamp around the upper third of the ball 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.110
 the index finger moved as far as possible to the ball played 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.360
 who heroizes the forest 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.130
 Control Cani well with one hand 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.960
 In order for the litter to succeed, it is important between the palm and the ball 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.500
 to leave a small gap 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.460
 only in this way is the acceleration and clarification of the case through the fingers 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.310
 controlled and not braked by the palm 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.630
 four of the throwing hand are grouped around the ball 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.630
 that gives the best stop 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.719
 very soon, it will now be behind the ear and head over to the front 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:35.800
 hurled 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.190
 This is part of the throwing technique most coaches use 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.690
 focus 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.040
 a good throw but operated in the legs 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.040
 With one step towards his goal, the quarterback takes the throw with him 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.670
 A second step publishers put their weight forward in the litter 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.380
 the transmission of power from the feet to the limb 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.210
 The legs help turn in throw direction 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.920
 Shoulder and limb Follow only as a conclusion Parts of this whole body 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.440
 technology 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.660
 in the basic position, the feet are about shoulder width 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.469
 the air is still closed 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:11.700
 the ball will be with both hands 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.529
 held in front of the chest 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.100
 the quarterback is holding his back straight 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.939
 This allows them a clear view of his teammates 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.010
 with a step the throw direction that with the quarterback his hip 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:23.659
 the shoulder 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.949
 follows a time lag to whom no pronounced trunk muscles 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:32.989
 Only at the last part of the movement is the ball involved in what arms ball 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.240
 are thrown forward 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.240
 the throwing hand child down to the hips 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:41.929
 Romain's throw off position uses the quarterback one 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:43.200
 so-called job way 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.209
 He moves from the Center VAAC with four quick steps 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.869
 short backward step with the trunks legs 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:52.169
 more extensive since the step with the limb when crossing with the stemmbar 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.549
 a brake with the limb leg 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.810
 then follows the complete throwing motion 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.810
 initiated by the step towards the goal 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:06.759
 once again 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:09.759
 Backwards Crossing Brakes Wharf 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:30.259
 Throwing is the most complex tech with the ban of Hal supposedly frequent 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:31.839
 be executed 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:34.829
 This exercise bomb animal too much opportunity 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.829
 two players with one ball face each other 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:41.939
 the distance can be varied at will but not at the beginning 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.019
 to be too big 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.529
 it is now thrown back and forth 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:48.979
 This exercise allows for many players in a short time 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:49.689
 throws 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.779
 Therefore, it is ideal for the journey with the specific 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:53.949
 warming 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:57.069
 You can also do all the exercises of the following litter school here 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.159
 but even with a single ball, this exercise can be effective 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.329
 To run 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.149
 the ball now zigzags through the group 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:09.949
 a group of six is ​​the deal but if need be, the exercise can be done with more 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.759
 Players are performed 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:12.559
 Naturally 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:14.939
 now arise smaller waiting times 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.590
 but still every player can do enough throws 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.800
 because not only the movement but also the accuracy of the throw 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.110
 Those trained in the catches are to give the throwers a goal 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.620
 so the throw is forced to throw accurately and not just the ball and 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.620
 Let her walk 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.080
 In college, we break the castle movement into separate stages 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.500
 this helps to learn and allows individual movement Skylab even single 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.699
 We start back in the final phase in which the ball is the ball 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.699
 injured arm over the head injured 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.310
 In the whole exhibition, two players are a maximum of three meters away 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.300
 hold each other up 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.300
 The final phase of the throw is carried out 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:22.949
 The ball is turned on by looking up the wrist 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.939
 set in rotation and the arm ends the throwing movement first appearances 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:33.659
 This is a good exercise for players whose balls do not vote correctly 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:36.659
 her wrist remains too passive 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:44.050
 next we take the complete arm movement of the litter 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.050
 the ball is hurled overhead from behind the goal 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.979
 in the known comparison, this part movement is carried out 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:54.679
 the position of the players remains frontal the feet parallel 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.210
 the final phase of the litter follows this exercise seamlessly 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.369
 the decisive factor is the high position of the elbow when throwing 

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:05.249
 This allows an effective transmission of the force 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:08.270
 from the hull on the bath 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.840
 In the next step, they bring this power from Rome into the United States 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.840
 throwing motion 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.499
 The players are now no longer frontal but temporally to each other 

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:27.759
 With a small step on the partner to become more accurate hosts 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.279
 provided 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:31.389
 more important is that this step 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:34.389
 the opening of the hip in throw direction initiates 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:42.139
 Only now can the different force parts of each body part 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.199
 coordinated in the same direction, a powerful and accurate throw 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:48.860
 is the consequence 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.120
 on which one exercises the throwing motion on both knees one the 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.069
 Transfer of the upper body 

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:57.030
 while one can avoid standing in this shipment 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.509
 you have to use it on your knees to develop strength 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:04.819
 Players who can only implement their throws with arm strength can be said to use the 

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:07.050
 Get used to the hip at the thought 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.449
 even more noticeable is this effect when throws on only one knee 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:11.539
 be executed 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:14.539
 and the limb knee is set up 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.100
 If you switch to the other knee you get a position that the litter attitude 

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:34.349
 resembling him 

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:36.639
 the stember of a diagonal to the throw 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:39.719
 and that was located on the leg below and behind the body 

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:43.050
 What is missing is the choice from the stand 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.589
 This forces too loose and very clean castle movements in the upper body 

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.699
 after Elise s but then necessary improvements before termination 

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:51.659
 to test in the game
