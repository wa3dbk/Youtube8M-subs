tone it had and also the roots were

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.570 
tone it had and also the roots were
going<00:01:06.689> out<00:01:06.780> very<00:01:07.229> noticeably<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.159> wanted<00:01:08.460> to

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
going out very noticeably so I wanted to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.910

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.590 

so<00:01:12.920> first<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:13.250> want<00:01:13.400> to<00:01:13.490> mix<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.910> color<00:01:14.240> with

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
so first you want to mix the color with

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.180 
so first you want to mix the color with
the<00:01:14.780> developer<00:01:15.410> in<00:01:15.620> the<00:01:15.740> bowl<00:01:15.950> that's

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
the developer in the bowl that's

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.460 
the developer in the bowl that's
provided<00:01:16.790> in<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.030> kit<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.540> make<00:01:18.140> sure<00:01:18.290> that

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
provided in the kit and make sure that

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.800 
provided in the kit and make sure that
you<00:01:18.590> stir<00:01:18.920> this<00:01:19.220> combination<00:01:19.850> really<00:01:20.300> well<00:01:20.510> so

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
you stir this combination really well so

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.360 
you stir this combination really well so
that<00:01:20.930> you'll<00:01:21.050> get<00:01:21.200> a<00:01:21.230> very<00:01:21.590> even<00:01:22.010> color<00:01:22.340> result

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.950 

it's<00:01:29.370> much<00:01:29.640> easier<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.210> work<00:01:30.300> with<00:01:30.360> smaller

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
it's much easier to work with smaller

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.200 
it's much easier to work with smaller
sections<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.710> hair<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.370> divided<00:01:32.940> it<00:01:33.030> into

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
sections of hair so I divided it into

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.510 
sections of hair so I divided it into
four<00:01:33.360> parts<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.350> use<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.710> provided<00:01:34.890> clips

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520

four parts and use the provided clips
from<00:01:35.760> the<00:01:35.820> set<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.630> pin<00:01:36.900> them<00:01:37.050> out<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.230> the<00:01:37.410> way

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.440 

the<00:01:41.010> provided<00:01:41.460> cape<00:01:41.730> will<00:01:41.910> protect<00:01:42.270> your

working<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.860> section<00:02:02.310> by<00:02:02.370> section<00:02:02.660> you<00:02:03.660> want

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
working it section by section you want

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.780 
working it section by section you want
to<00:02:03.900> be<00:02:03.990> sure<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.320> apply<00:02:04.560> enough<00:02:05.070> product<00:02:05.430> onto

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
to be sure to apply enough product onto

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.630 
to be sure to apply enough product onto
the<00:02:06.000> roots<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.420> soak<00:02:06.660> them<00:02:06.930> very<00:02:07.140> thoroughly

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
the roots to soak them very thoroughly

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.130 
the roots to soak them very thoroughly
this<00:02:08.640> process<00:02:09.090> will<00:02:09.270> probably<00:02:09.720> take<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:10.020> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
this process will probably take you the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.720 
this process will probably take you the
longest<00:02:10.530> amount<00:02:10.710> of<00:02:10.890> time<00:02:10.950> but<00:02:11.460> it<00:02:11.580> also

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
longest amount of time but it also

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.970 
longest amount of time but it also
ensures<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.330> very<00:02:12.780> even<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.260> professional

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
ensures a very even and professional

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:33.690 
ensures a very even and professional
looking<00:02:14.310> result

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.920 

this<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:34.850> what<00:02:35.000> your<00:02:35.120> route<00:02:35.270> should<00:02:35.450> look<00:02:35.690> like

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.040 
kind of like a blue under base a much
warmer<00:04:23.500> richer<00:04:24.500> Brown<00:04:25.419> so<00:04:26.419> this<00:04:26.570> is<00:04:26.599> just<00:04:26.840> in

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050

daylight

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.050 

well<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:32.960> I<00:04:33.020> do<00:04:33.080> think<00:04:33.470> it's<00:04:33.590> quite<00:04:33.770> even<00:04:34.310> like

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
well and I do think it's quite even like

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.460 
well and I do think it's quite even like
you<00:04:35.270> can't<00:04:35.509> see<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.870> roots<00:04:36.050> anymore<00:04:38.440> so<00:04:39.440> I

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
you can't see the roots anymore so I

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.200 
you can't see the roots anymore so I
don't<00:04:39.680> have<00:04:39.800> any<00:04:39.919> like<00:04:40.220> roots<00:04:40.699> growing<00:04:41.000> out

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
don't have any like roots growing out

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.719 
don't have any like roots growing out

gonna be empty but it looks like this

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.409 
gonna be empty but it looks like this
and<00:06:39.940> then<00:06:40.150> inside<00:06:40.720> you<00:06:41.229> have<00:06:41.470> to<00:06:42.430> there's<00:06:43.270> like

a developer and the actual color and
from<00:06:47.139> me<00:06:47.349> I<00:06:47.620> don't<00:06:47.860> know<00:06:47.949> if<00:06:48.009> this<00:06:48.070> is<00:06:48.130> with<00:06:48.340> all

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 
from me I don't know if this is with all

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.899 
from me I don't know if this is with all
I<00:06:48.550> think<00:06:48.940> it<00:06:49.060> is<00:06:49.090> though<00:06:49.449> you<00:06:50.440> get<00:06:50.650> two<00:06:51.009> of<00:06:51.039> like

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:51.909 
I think it is though you get two of like

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:53.600 
I think it is though you get two of like
you<00:06:52.030> get<00:06:52.180> I<00:06:52.360> got<00:06:52.539> one<00:06:52.750> for<00:06:52.780> the<00:06:53.080> roots

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
you get I got one for the roots

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.409 
you get I got one for the roots
specifically<00:06:54.610> formulated<00:06:54.820> for<00:06:55.120> the<00:06:55.300> roots

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:55.419 
specifically formulated for the roots

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:57.960 
specifically formulated for the roots
and<00:06:55.570> one<00:06:55.780> specifically<00:06:56.590> formulated<00:06:56.889> for<00:06:57.280> the

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:57.970 
and one specifically formulated for the

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.990 
and one specifically formulated for the
ends<00:06:58.560> so<00:06:59.560> for<00:07:00.009> me<00:07:00.099> that<00:07:00.130> was<00:07:00.400> really<00:07:00.669> handy

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
ends so for me that was really handy

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.939 
ends so for me that was really handy
because<00:07:01.030> usually<00:07:01.449> when<00:07:02.349> I<00:07:02.409> get<00:07:02.710> by<00:07:02.889> the

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:02.949 
because usually when I get by the

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:05.100 
because usually when I get by the
drugstore<00:07:03.280> ones<00:07:03.699> one<00:07:04.030> bottle<00:07:04.449> isn't<00:07:04.659> enough

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
drugstore ones one bottle isn't enough

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.270 
drugstore ones one bottle isn't enough
for<00:07:05.289> me<00:07:05.380> so<00:07:05.500> I<00:07:05.560> actually<00:07:05.770> have<00:07:06.009> to<00:07:06.130> buy<00:07:06.250> two

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 
for me so I actually have to buy two

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.310 
for me so I actually have to buy two
anyway<00:07:06.940> so<00:07:07.000> it<00:07:07.360> ends<00:07:07.630> up<00:07:07.690> kind<00:07:07.960> of<00:07:08.080> being

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320 
anyway so it ends up kind of being

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.899 
anyway so it ends up kind of being
expensive<00:07:08.710> overall<00:07:09.310> I'm<00:07:09.430> pretty<00:07:09.550> pleased

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:09.909 
expensive overall I'm pretty pleased

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:11.939
