00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.009
 hello friends friends speak to you more 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.839
 lombillo here again today I 'm going to 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.809
 bring another new video of how to make a 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.599
 color visor your phone galaxy samsung 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.699
 galaxy s3 sorry this is not going to erase you 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.839
 your phone information only you 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.060
 will help if the phone is 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.890
 happening slow you are being used 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.330
 the batteries is consumed very fast 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.140
 this will help all the systems 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.359
 internal to gamÃ³n restart and start the 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.339
 common again cool so it's going to 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.900
 work the phone better again 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.119
 is going to erase your information 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.230
 what do you have recorded on the phone like 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.760
 photos contacts and so on 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.520
 so the first thing we have to do 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.020
 is 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.020
 turn off your phone 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.150
 power of 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.150
 those that turn off the new garden for 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.980
 make the phone work better and run 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.559
 better when I finish doing this and 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.550
 will not erase the information that has 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.550
 recorded on the phone 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.590
 even though 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.770
 first thing you have to do is 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.780
 press the power 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.359
 and the volume button upwards the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.399
 three at the same time ok 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.789
 so let's do this I do not know if you can see 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.789
 there 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.840
 remember at the same time and let's 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.240
 follow 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.359
 as you can see already a little ahead 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.469
 video because sometimes it takes a little bit 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.869
 as I have the phone to reuters 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.700
 accompany mentions this screen of 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.920
 I change a little but the options go 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.539
 to be the same so the option that 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.539
 you have to select 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.240
 here 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.030
 in the first reboot system now or in 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.400
 other times he will say reboot 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.890
 bootloader that is basically the same 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.630
 you give the power option which is the ok 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:08.350
 or home that also serves as ok the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.350
 button that is there 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.160
 and let's see why 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.770
 the phone is going to reset without erasing 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.870
 the information that you have already saved in 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.340
 the very important phone that is left 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.340
 clear so nobody is scared 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.750
 it's going to take a little while to turn on 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.880
 new the phone but 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.520
 since everything is starting fresh from 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.950
 new so you give it a couple of seconds 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.560
 and the telephone 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.450
 is going to turn on normal again and I'm going to 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.440
 leave the video recording so they can see 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.180
 than nothing 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.360
 information that I already had saved 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.500
 deleted 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.150
