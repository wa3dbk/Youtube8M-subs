00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.680
 last purchases made by the page 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.570
 yesterday's web so if you're interested 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.040
 stay good first I wanted 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.250
 comment is that I changed the 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.500
 location where he praised because ultimate 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.939
 Well, we're almost in winter 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.939
 autumn-winter and it's very cloudy 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.070
 then I have put artificial light and 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.679
 Well, I still have to do some 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.169
 improvements but good for now do this 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.179
 new scenario let's say and also 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:34.199
 comments that I am recording with a 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.820
 new camera is the 3200 nikon that does not 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.129
 I know if you have seen some compaÃ±eras 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.680
 bloggers who participated in an event 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.600
 from nikon and we are testing this camera 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.190
 I have already tried for photos and the truth 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.870
 I liked it a lot and I noticed a lot 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.250
 difference with my old SLR and good 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.149
 this is the first video he recorded with 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.329
 she 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.219
 dv if I do not know how to talk is the first video 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.839
 that he recorded with her and well, I do not know how to 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.399
 see how I'm still testing it and 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.050
 you will tell me if I have no difference 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.690
 with previous videos that you record with me 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.030
 camera so nothing nothing more to add 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.010
 The first thing I'm going to teach you is going to 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.090
 be two tests the first one is the brand 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.729
 sindh to full 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.729
 it's a vanilla tea it's a black tea with 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.649
 Vanilla flavor really this tea does not 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.799
 he said nothing because he asks me black 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.560
 with a touch of super subtle vanilla that 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.000
 almost almost not notice then to me 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.200
 It looks just like any other tea that 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.610
 we can find in any 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.850
 supermarket then with this no 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.679
 I would repeat this tea contains 25 bags 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.700
 individual that I will teach you to 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:36.359
 next is the brand cup is a 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.359
 organic chain 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.420
 This contains 20 bags too 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.610
 individual and good left me 3 me 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.190
 I love it, it seems like a super chai tea 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.200
 intense and has a very intense flavor 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.600
 as I tell you more even than that of 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.130
 starbucks and it tastes great 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.530
 I do not know I like it very much and surely 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.470
 I will repeat with him following with meets 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.700
 things that are eaten let's say I teach you 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.800
 these multivitamins that are like 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.630
 Gummy bears look great 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.820
 because that way you do not forget to take them 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.270
 which are very much like bears of 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.690
 rubber 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.930
 this the brand I do not know if the rumbers are 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.540
 Flame v / s multivitamin 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.760
 also in the 60 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.189
 little bears so they take two a day 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.560
 gives you for about 30 days and good has a 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.599
 taste water and I know the bauble is like that 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.890
 like rubber puts that is good for 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.469
 teeth so I guess not 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.420
 they will have sugar and good milk walk the 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:37.359
 I recommend I continue with things from 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.629
 makeup I bought two sponges 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:42.519
 more of these real techniques I do not know 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.260
 if they are the fourth to the fifth 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.120
 I buy because they are a lot for courses 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.549
 of automaquillaje and so on for not 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.010
 have ten beauty blend is that they are more 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.750
 faces because they make me the same solution 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.189
 the material is very similar to the same 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.200
 I like the egg shape of the 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.090
 habit and blender but come on is that these 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.950
 are worth less than half, so in 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.439
 I will keep buying it and I recommend it 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.860
 now I show you two brushes the first 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.620
 is the get works of him 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.830
 it's from the range it's cheap it costs a 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.620
 dollar and a half does not convince me 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.140
 because I see it very very very small 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.270
 too small for what is the 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.770
 corrector at best for lips or for 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.660
 put the corrector for example in days 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.160
 like the one who has a more pretty lipstick 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.200
 marked if I put a concealer by 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.610
 around to mark it even more so 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.460
 for that yes but for the corrector of the 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.160
 I think it seems too small 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:35.010
 now I show you this fan brush 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.170
 ecotur this this brand I like a lot 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.730
 because good has the bamboo handle the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.970
 Synthetic hair but it is a super hair 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.010
 soft is let's look like natural hair and 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.650
 Well, this brush I like for 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.350
 remove dust that may fall on us 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.540
 cheekbone of the shadows or to be able to put 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.950
 Illuminator very blurry or 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.020
 even the contour of very shape 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.130
 blurred and good because I wanted to 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.250
 make me with a brush of this type 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.950
 better because I had a plastic one and still 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.050
 well I liked it but well this one has a 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.000
 very good looking to finish I bought 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.160
 these strips clean by the clean face 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.060
 no scripts are my strips clean but 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.500
 favorites 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.390
 if it's the first time you place an order 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.550
 Yesterday or the first time to ask 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.030
 in the section above trailers or free 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.860
 I do not know how it's called now they cost 50 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.300
 cents if I already asked is more times 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.940
 Like me, I do not know how many 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.040
 They cost 3 dollars and 33 strips so 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.870
 one dollar goes out each strip and I continue 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.940
 buying them again and again because they do not 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.790
 they found no strip that would leave me so 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.960
 so clean the nose is the truth 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.849
 that removes dirt quite well 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.469
 as you know yesterday's page 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.029
 in some detail and well then in this 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:40.649
 case has been an eraser what 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:43.199
 Well, I 'm not going to use it much because 

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:45.119
 I have a child but good today is not bad 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.889

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:48.419

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.459

 exceeds $ 40 that although not 

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:55.649
 You can also find a code 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.599
