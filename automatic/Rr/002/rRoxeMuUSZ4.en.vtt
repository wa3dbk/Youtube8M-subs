content<00:02:45.209> on<00:02:45.299> YouTube<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:45.930> believe<00:02:46.170> YouTube

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
content on YouTube and I believe YouTube

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.860 
content on YouTube and I believe YouTube
is<00:02:46.680> actually<00:02:46.799> attempting<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.760> censor<00:02:48.299> content

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
is actually attempting to censor content

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.180 
is actually attempting to censor content
that<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:50.180> against<00:02:51.180> religion<00:02:51.690> against<00:02:52.319> gay

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
that is against religion against gay

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.880 
that is against religion against gay
marriage<00:02:53.459> against<00:02:54.150> Christianity<00:02:54.890> against

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890

entropy<00:02:56.760> against<00:02:57.090> science<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.900> guess<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.319> for

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
entropy against science I guess to for

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.650 
entropy against science I guess to for
that<00:02:59.129> matter<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.760> they're<00:02:59.970> removing<00:03:00.390> videos

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
that matter and they're removing videos

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.199 
that matter and they're removing videos
because<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.110> doesn't<00:03:01.410> fit<00:03:01.709> their<00:03:02.099> their<00:03:02.670> idea

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
because it doesn't fit their their idea

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.970 
because it doesn't fit their their idea
of<00:03:03.299> what<00:03:03.540> classifies<00:03:04.290> as<00:03:04.500> entertainment

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
of what classifies as entertainment

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.789 
of what classifies as entertainment
that's<00:03:05.400> my<00:03:05.790> first<00:03:06.090> speculation<00:03:07.049> my<00:03:07.410> second

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
that's my first speculation my second

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.380 
that's my first speculation my second
speculation<00:03:08.340> is<00:03:08.459> this<00:03:08.610> could<00:03:08.849> be<00:03:08.879> a<00:03:09.000> glitch

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
speculation is this could be a glitch

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.690 
speculation is this could be a glitch
and<00:03:09.599> by<00:03:09.720> glitch<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.200> mean<00:03:10.410> people<00:03:11.040> who<00:03:11.250> fault

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
and by glitch I mean people who fault

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.819 
and by glitch I mean people who fault
flag<00:03:12.030> or<00:03:12.269> maybe<00:03:12.420> flagged<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.110> video<00:03:13.319> once<00:03:13.650> or

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
flag or maybe flagged a video once or

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.430 
flag or maybe flagged a video once or
twice<00:03:14.150> for<00:03:15.150> some<00:03:15.329> reason<00:03:15.660> all<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:16.140> sudden

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
twice for some reason all of a sudden

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.930 
twice for some reason all of a sudden
the<00:03:16.560> videos<00:03:16.829> that<00:03:17.040> have<00:03:17.130> been<00:03:17.160> false<00:03:17.579> flagged

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
the videos that have been false flagged

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.670 
the videos that have been false flagged
or<00:03:18.180> even<00:03:18.389> flagged<00:03:18.630> once<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.290> have<00:03:19.530> been

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
or even flagged once that have been

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.740 
or even flagged once that have been
fault<00:03:19.950> or<00:03:20.160> somehow<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.910> videos<00:03:21.209> are<00:03:21.359> being

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
fault or somehow the videos are being

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.509 
fault or somehow the videos are being
randomly<00:03:22.290> removed<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.010> reason<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.310> say

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
randomly removed and the reason I say

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.670 
randomly removed and the reason I say
that<00:03:23.549> is<00:03:23.700> because<00:03:23.819> about<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.870> year<00:03:25.230> ago<00:03:25.350> there

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
that is because about a year ago there

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.400 
that is because about a year ago there

some<00:04:37.740> type<00:04:38.100> of<00:04:38.130> issue<00:04:38.730> within<00:04:39.540> YouTube's

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
some type of issue within YouTube's

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.930 
some type of issue within YouTube's
interface<00:04:40.500> which<00:04:40.740> allowed<00:04:40.980> people<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.400> report

exploit it could be a glitch on youtubes

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.280 
exploit it could be a glitch on youtubes
side<00:05:29.250> where<00:05:29.460> someone<00:05:29.730> can<00:05:29.880> easily<00:05:30.870> just<00:05:31.050> flag

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
side where someone can easily just flag

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.990 
side where someone can easily just flag
a<00:05:31.320> video<00:05:31.680> that<00:05:31.860> they<00:05:31.980> may<00:05:32.130> not<00:05:32.310> like<00:05:32.520> and<00:05:32.790> get<00:05:32.970> a

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
a video that they may not like and get a

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.740 
a video that they may not like and get a
video<00:05:33.270> removed<00:05:33.570> falsely<00:05:34.230> that's<00:05:34.860> my<00:05:35.130> guess

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
video removed falsely that's my guess

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.420 
video removed falsely that's my guess
but<00:05:36.750> I<00:05:36.810> really<00:05:37.110> think<00:05:37.320> it<00:05:37.590> really<00:05:38.130> could<00:05:38.370> be

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
but I really think it really could be

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.430 
but I really think it really could be
that<00:05:38.790> YouTube<00:05:39.180> is<00:05:39.270> really<00:05:39.330> trying<00:05:39.810> to<00:05:39.960> censor

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
that YouTube is really trying to censor

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.530 
that YouTube is really trying to censor
videos<00:05:41.040> and<00:05:41.400> they've<00:05:41.669> been<00:05:41.880> known<00:05:41.910> to<00:05:42.120> do<00:05:42.419> this

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540
