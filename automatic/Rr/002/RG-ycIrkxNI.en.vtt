00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
kinds of stuff and someone I think it

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.789 
kinds of stuff and someone I think it
might<00:01:47.850> probably<00:01:48.119> was<00:01:48.390> beyond<00:01:48.750> kind<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.590> named

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
might probably was beyond kind of named

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.969 
might probably was beyond kind of named
it<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:49.979> time<00:01:50.340> Tony<00:01:50.700> Hawk<00:01:50.909> set<00:01:51.180> up<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.979> that's

it the time Tony Hawk set up and that's

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.179 
it the time Tony Hawk set up and that's
a<00:01:53.220> reason<00:01:53.430> why<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:54.030> called<00:01:54.210> Tony<00:01:54.540> Hawk

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
a reason why this is called Tony Hawk

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.030 
a reason why this is called Tony Hawk
next<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.399> Leon<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.329> Leon<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.439> basically<00:01:58.860> one

next is Leon and Leon is basically one

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.149 
next is Leon and Leon is basically one
of<00:01:59.130> my<00:01:59.280> favorite<00:02:00.000> films<00:02:00.469> about<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.530> French

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
of my favorite films about a French

better<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:43.240> better<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.750> use<00:02:43.990> and<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:45.010> next

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
better and better to use and the next

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.010 
better and better to use and the next
I've<00:02:45.340> got<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.550> Rambo<00:02:45.940> class<00:02:46.209> because<00:02:46.840> every

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
I've got the Rambo class because every

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.760 
I've got the Rambo class because every
time<00:02:47.050> I<00:02:47.230> thing<00:02:48.040> called<00:02:48.280> Rambo<00:02:48.640> I<00:02:48.820> think<00:02:49.450> of

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
time I thing called Rambo I think of

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.920 
time I thing called Rambo I think of
someone<00:02:50.770> with<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.370> huge<00:02:51.700> machine<00:02:52.030> gun<00:02:52.270> some

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
someone with a huge machine gun some

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.699 
someone with a huge machine gun some
RPGs<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:54.209> you<00:02:55.209> know<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:55.570> scavenger<00:02:56.500> para

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
RPGs and you know and scavenger para

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.540 
RPGs and you know and scavenger para
panic<00:02:57.100> but<00:02:57.670> yeah<00:02:58.630> this<00:02:59.020> every<00:02:59.680> time<00:02:59.830> I<00:02:59.950> think

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
panic but yeah this every time I think

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.400 
panic but yeah this every time I think
of<00:03:00.700> Rambo<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.240> think<00:03:01.480> of<00:03:01.600> a<00:03:01.720> move<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:02.110> huge

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
of Rambo I think of a move a huge

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.860 
of Rambo I think of a move a huge
massive<00:03:03.010> gun<00:03:03.280> shooting<00:03:04.060> loads<00:03:04.330> of<00:03:04.540> bullets

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
massive gun shooting loads of bullets

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.020 
massive gun shooting loads of bullets
and<00:03:05.080> this<00:03:05.740> is<00:03:05.860> why<00:03:06.010> it's<00:03:06.070> called<00:03:06.400> Rambo<00:03:06.820> and

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
and this is why it's called Rambo and

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.449 
and this is why it's called Rambo and
the<00:03:07.570> next<00:03:07.840> one<00:03:08.080> this<00:03:08.890> is<00:03:08.950> probably<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.370> most

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
the next one this is probably the most

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.850 
the next one this is probably the most
important<00:03:10.150> cloth<00:03:10.420> because<00:03:10.690> I<00:03:10.810> think<00:03:11.230> everyone

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
important cloth because I think everyone

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.710 
important cloth because I think everyone
everyone<00:03:12.760> needs<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:12.970> have<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:13.209> class<00:03:13.450> and
