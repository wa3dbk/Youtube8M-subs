00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
but hopefully they look a little bit

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.750 
but hopefully they look a little bit
better<00:00:51.720> than<00:00:51.989> normal<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.040> the<00:00:53.129> makeup<00:00:53.430> artist

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
better than normal and the makeup artist

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.180 
better than normal and the makeup artist
that<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.089> had<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.720> shoe<00:00:54.900> actually<00:00:55.470> put<00:00:56.040> on

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
that I had that the shoe actually put on

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.369 
that I had that the shoe actually put on
false<00:00:56.430> individual<00:00:57.150> lashes<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.690> my<00:00:57.809> eyes<00:00:57.960> and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
false individual lashes on my eyes and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.020 
false individual lashes on my eyes and
that's<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> first<00:00:59.339> time<00:00:59.460> I've<00:00:59.579> ever<00:00:59.730> worn

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
that's the first time I've ever worn

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.759 
that's the first time I've ever worn
them<00:01:00.269> and<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.510> really<00:01:00.960> love<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.290> way<00:01:01.320> they<00:01:01.500> look

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
them and I really love the way they look

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.560 
them and I really love the way they look
I<00:01:01.920> think<00:01:01.980> they<00:01:02.190> were<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.550> pretty<00:01:02.820> natural<00:01:03.420> but

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
I think they were so pretty natural but

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.240 
I think they were so pretty natural but
definitely<00:01:03.930> opened<00:01:04.379> my<00:01:04.409> eyes<00:01:04.589> up<00:01:04.830> at<00:01:04.979> me<00:01:05.100> then

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
definitely opened my eyes up at me then

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.730 
definitely opened my eyes up at me then
look<00:01:05.460> even<00:01:06.210> better<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:06.990> definitely<00:01:07.290> am<00:01:07.590> now

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
look even better so I definitely am now

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.770

going<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.220> into<00:01:08.640> those<00:01:08.820> false<00:01:09.119> individual

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
going to be into those false individual

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.750 
going to be into those false individual
lashes<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.830> actually<00:01:11.010> got<00:01:11.310> home<00:01:11.520> from<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
lashes and I actually got home from the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.539 
lashes and I actually got home from the
shoot<00:01:12.030> really<00:01:12.240> late<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.720> then<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.740> took<00:01:14.220> all<00:01:14.520> my

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
shoot really late and then I took all my

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.280 
shoot really late and then I took all my
face<00:01:14.820> makeup<00:01:15.119> off<00:01:15.299> took<00:01:15.630> my<00:01:15.750> hair<00:01:15.930> down<00:01:16.110> all

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.660 
face makeup off took my hair down all
that<00:01:16.380> kind<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.619> stuff<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.070> then<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.280> noticed

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
that kind of stuff and then I noticed

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.270 
that kind of stuff and then I noticed
the<00:01:17.790> lashes<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.540> we're<00:01:18.720> intact<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.799> decided

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the lashes so we're intact so I decided

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.950 
the lashes so we're intact so I decided
just<00:01:20.400> like<00:01:20.729> keep<00:01:20.939> them<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.600> see<00:01:21.840> what

today<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.210> woke<00:01:24.600> up<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.990> they<00:01:25.560> still<00:01:25.830> look

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
today I woke up and they still look

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.560 
today I woke up and they still look
great<00:01:26.009> none<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.580> them<00:01:26.670> had<00:01:26.850> fallen<00:01:27.030> out<00:01:27.330> they

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
great none of them had fallen out they

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.789 
great none of them had fallen out they
didn't<00:01:27.810> seem<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.020> they're<00:01:28.170> pulling<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.680> my

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
didn't seem like they're pulling on my

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.010 
didn't seem like they're pulling on my
eyes<00:01:29.070> or<00:01:29.369> anything<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.450> just<00:01:30.600> went<00:01:30.960> ahead

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
eyes or anything so I just went ahead

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.660 
eyes or anything so I just went ahead
and<00:01:31.140> did<00:01:31.320> my<00:01:31.409> makeup<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.920> kept<00:01:32.100> them<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.340> and

and did my makeup and kept them on and
they<00:01:32.850> still<00:01:33.090> look<00:01:33.240> great<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.810> think

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
they still look great so I think

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.230 
individual ones at least for like a few
days<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:45.070> I<00:01:45.100> might<00:01:45.340> do<00:01:45.609> a<00:01:45.640> video<00:01:45.909> about<00:01:46.090> that

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.969 
days so I might do a video about that
and<00:01:46.659> see<00:01:47.229> how<00:01:47.319> that<00:01:47.380> works<00:01:47.619> out<00:01:47.740> for<00:01:47.920> me

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
and see how that works out for me

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.590 
and see how that works out for me
because<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:48.520> far<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:48.909> ones<00:01:49.090> that<00:01:49.210> I<00:01:49.240> have<00:01:49.420> on

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
because so far the ones that I have on

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.809 
because so far the ones that I have on
right<00:01:49.780> now<00:01:49.840> still<00:01:50.710> have<00:01:50.950> lasted<00:01:51.429> and<00:01:51.549> I<00:01:51.640> think

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
right now still have lasted and I think

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.309 
right now still have lasted and I think
they<00:01:51.909> still<00:01:52.149> look<00:01:52.329> pretty<00:01:52.359> good<00:01:52.780> so<00:01:53.110> that's

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
they still look pretty good so that's

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.279 
they still look pretty good so that's
that<00:01:54.069> a<00:01:54.310> little<00:01:54.520> random<00:01:54.969> ramble<00:01:55.539> aside<00:01:55.869> from

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.020 
online or something but I would
recommend<00:04:41.220> going<00:04:41.340> into<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.700> store<00:04:41.910> and

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
recommend going into the store and

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.670 
recommend going into the store and
trying<00:04:42.210> them<00:04:42.330> on<00:04:42.539> because<00:04:42.780> they're<00:04:43.380> very<00:04:43.560> very

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
trying them on because they're very very

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.379 
trying them on because they're very very
stretchy<00:04:43.979> I<00:04:44.130> think<00:04:44.460> it<00:04:44.550> might<00:04:44.700> surprise<00:04:45.000> you

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389

but<00:04:46.200> I<00:04:46.260> feel<00:04:46.380> like<00:04:46.470> you<00:04:46.620> could<00:04:46.770> kind<00:04:46.979> of<00:04:47.010> go

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
but I feel like you could kind of go

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.640 
but I feel like you could kind of go
down<00:04:47.160> a<00:04:47.370> style<00:04:47.850> like<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.300> size<00:04:48.570> of<00:04:48.840> these<00:04:48.960> so<00:04:49.620> I

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650

to be not who they said they were and it

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.840
