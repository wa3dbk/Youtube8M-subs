tools it is called the mophie juice pack
powerstation<00:00:06.649> here's<00:00:07.649> how<00:00:07.770> it<00:00:07.859> works

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
powerstation here's how it works

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.000 
powerstation here's how it works
basically<00:00:08.429> this<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.300> battery<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.139> that

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
basically this is a battery and that

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.520 
basically this is a battery and that
battery<00:00:11.490> can<00:00:11.670> be<00:00:11.700> used<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.120> recharge<00:00:12.840> anything

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
battery can be used to recharge anything

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.440 
battery can be used to recharge anything
that<00:00:13.679> recharges<00:00:14.099> through<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> USB<00:00:14.670> connection

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
that recharges through a USB connection

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.779 
that recharges through a USB connection
so<00:00:16.199> here's<00:00:16.410> way<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.590> works<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:17.130> simply<00:00:17.460> plug

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
so here's way it works you simply plug

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.120 
so here's way it works you simply plug
in<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.210> microUSB<00:00:18.990> using<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.410> attack<00:00:19.680> using

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
in the microUSB using the attack using

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.730 
in the microUSB using the attack using
the<00:00:20.250> included<00:00:21.029> court<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.660> then<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.410> put<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
the included court and then you put the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.590 
the included court and then you put the
other<00:00:22.890> end<00:00:23.189> into<00:00:23.400> your<00:00:23.550> computer<00:00:23.670> or<00:00:24.269> into<00:00:24.570> a

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
other end into your computer or into a

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.380 
other end into your computer or into a
USB<00:00:24.869> wall<00:00:25.230> charger<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.670> charges<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.180> up

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
USB wall charger and it charges it up

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.259 
USB wall charger and it charges it up
then<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.260> unit<00:00:28.500> can<00:00:28.859> be<00:00:28.980> used<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.490> recharge

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
then this unit can be used to recharge

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.720 
then this unit can be used to recharge
items<00:00:30.779> multiple<00:00:31.740> times<00:00:31.949> see<00:00:32.219> how<00:00:32.309> that's<00:00:32.520> got

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
items multiple times see how that's got

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.040 
items multiple times see how that's got
four<00:00:32.940> little<00:00:33.149> lights<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.540> there<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.719> means

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
four little lights on there that means

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.319 
four little lights on there that means
