00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:04.490 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.909 

in<00:00:05.490> this<00:00:06.299> case<00:00:06.540> we're<00:00:06.839> gonna<00:00:06.960> be<00:00:07.140> using<00:00:07.350> diet

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
in this case we're gonna be using diet

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.970 
in this case we're gonna be using diet
flow<00:00:08.220> as<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.580> sealant<00:00:09.510> material<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:10.469> just

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
flow as a sealant material and just

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.830 
flow as a sealant material and just
about<00:00:11.190> every<00:00:11.429> dentist<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:11.910> talked<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.420> has

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
about every dentist that I talked to has

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.320 
about every dentist that I talked to has
switched<00:00:13.170> from<00:00:13.320> using<00:00:13.610> sealant<00:00:14.610> material<00:00:14.639> for

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
switched from using sealant material for

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.470 
switched from using sealant material for
sealants<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.170> flowable<00:00:16.800> composite<00:00:17.180> years<00:00:18.180> ago

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
sealants to flowable composite years ago

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.320 
sealants to flowable composite years ago
and<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.920> pretty<00:00:20.160> natural<00:00:20.520> use<00:00:21.060> for

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
and so this is a pretty natural use for

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.540 
and so this is a pretty natural use for
the<00:00:21.420> diet<00:00:21.779> flow<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.560> be<00:00:22.680> able<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.920> use<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.400> as<00:00:23.519> a

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
the diet flow to be able to use it as a

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.189 
the diet flow to be able to use it as a
sealant<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.359> can<00:00:24.539> see<00:00:24.689> I'm<00:00:24.810> using<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
sealant and you can see I'm using a

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.200 
sealant and you can see I'm using a
small<00:00:25.529> round<00:00:25.560> bur<00:00:26.070> here<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.910> just<00:00:27.060> a

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
small round bur here this is just a

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.320 
small round bur here this is just a
personal<00:00:27.599> choice<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.529> use<00:00:28.710> 1/4<00:00:29.490> round<00:00:29.880> bur<00:00:30.150> to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
personal choice to use 1/4 round bur to

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330 
personal choice to use 1/4 round bur to
clean<00:00:30.599> out<00:00:30.750> these<00:00:30.929> grooves<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.679> can<00:00:31.980> use<00:00:32.130> air

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
clean out these grooves you can use air

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.670 
clean out these grooves you can use air
abrasion<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.510> small<00:00:33.989> burr

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
abrasion a small burr

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.069 
abrasion a small burr
if<00:00:34.739> you're<00:00:34.950> just<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.730> use<00:00:35.910> pumice<00:00:36.390> make

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
if you're just going to use pumice make

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.500 
if you're just going to use pumice make
sure<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.590> non-fluoridated<00:00:38.340> pumice<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.390> it

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
sure it's a non-fluoridated pumice so it

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.030 
sure it's a non-fluoridated pumice so it
doesn't<00:00:39.809> interfere<00:00:39.989> with<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.410> bonding

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
doesn't interfere with the bonding

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.250 
doesn't interfere with the bonding
protocol<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:41.879> whatever<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.750> want<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.140> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
protocol but whatever you want to do to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.229 
protocol but whatever you want to do to
clean<00:00:43.469> out<00:00:43.620> these<00:00:43.800> grooves<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.550> fine<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.030> just

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
clean out these grooves is fine I just

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.600 
clean out these grooves is fine I just
find<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.809> by<00:00:45.989> opening<00:00:46.500> them<00:00:46.920> up<00:00:47.100> I'm<00:00:47.340> going

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
find that by opening them up I'm going

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.880 
find that by opening them up I'm going
to<00:00:47.730> get<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> little<00:00:48.239> bigger<00:00:48.809> bulk<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.649> diet

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
to get a little bigger bulk of the diet

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.130 
to get a little bigger bulk of the diet
flow<00:00:50.280> going<00:00:50.670> down<00:00:50.850> into<00:00:51.149> these<00:00:51.270> grooves<00:00:51.629> but

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
flow going down into these grooves but

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.450 
flow going down into these grooves but
we're<00:00:52.320> also<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:52.860> some<00:00:52.920> uncut

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
we're also going to have some uncut

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.700 
we're also going to have some uncut
enamel<00:00:54.030> that's<00:00:54.300> not<00:00:54.570> touched<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.350> those

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
enamel that's not touched in those

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.470 
enamel that's not touched in those
grooves<00:00:56.039> when<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.760> quarter<00:00:57.090> round<00:00:57.239> bur

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
grooves when the the quarter round bur

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.029 
grooves when the the quarter round bur
goes<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> depths<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.440> those<00:00:58.590> grooves<00:00:58.920> so

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
goes to the depths of those grooves so

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.279 
goes to the depths of those grooves so
we're<00:00:59.280> going<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.640> use<00:00:59.850> an<00:01:00.149> acid<00:01:00.629> etch<00:01:00.780> here<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
we're going to use an acid etch here and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.170 
we're going to use an acid etch here and
you're<00:01:01.530> going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.070> see<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.059> going

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
you're going to see that this is going

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.000 
you're going to see that this is going
to<00:01:03.239> be<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.480> one<00:01:03.690> time<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.199> are<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.920> to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
to be the one time that we are going to

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.730 
to be the one time that we are going to
etch<00:01:05.250> when<00:01:05.880> using<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.390> diad<00:01:06.810> flow<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.530> that's

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
etch when using the diad flow and that's

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.380 
etch when using the diad flow and that's
gonna<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:08.130> when<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.400> need<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.700> diet<00:01:09.030> flow<00:01:09.330> to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
gonna be when we need the diet flow to

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.380 
gonna be when we need the diet flow to
Bond<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.900> some<00:01:10.080> uncut<00:01:10.680> enamel<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.610> anytime<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
Bond to some uncut enamel so anytime the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.960 
Bond to some uncut enamel so anytime the
enamel<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.930> cut<00:01:13.260> or<00:01:13.500> anytime<00:01:13.979> we<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.490> exposed

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
enamel is cut or anytime we have exposed

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.510 
enamel is cut or anytime we have exposed
dentin<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.840> diet<00:01:16.200> flow<00:01:16.530> because<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.100> its<00:01:17.250> self

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
dentin the diet flow because of its self

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.090 
dentin the diet flow because of its self
adhering<00:01:17.909> properties<00:01:18.570> will<00:01:18.990> bond<00:01:19.290> directly

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
adhering properties will bond directly

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.980 
adhering properties will bond directly
to<00:01:20.340> those<00:01:20.490> different<00:01:20.970> two<00:01:21.150> structures<00:01:21.720> but

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
to those different two structures but

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.380 
to those different two structures but
when<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.530> uncut<00:01:23.250> enamel<00:01:23.850> we're<00:01:24.060> gonna<00:01:24.150> go

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
when we have uncut enamel we're gonna go

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.719 
when we have uncut enamel we're gonna go
ahead<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.780> place<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.100> phosphoric<00:01:26.100> acid<00:01:26.580> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
ahead and place a phosphoric acid and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.600 
ahead and place a phosphoric acid and
leave<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.299> place<00:01:27.600> for<00:01:27.890> 15<00:01:28.890> seconds<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
leave it in place for 15 seconds on the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.700 
leave it in place for 15 seconds on the
uncut<00:01:30.060> enamel<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.750> then<00:01:31.110> rinse<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.530> all<00:01:31.680> off

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
uncut enamel and then rinse it all off

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.920 
uncut enamel and then rinse it all off
so<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.400> etch<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.909> getting<00:01:33.360> down<00:01:33.540> into<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
so the etch is getting down into the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.780 
so the etch is getting down into the
grooves<00:01:34.259> as<00:01:34.439> well<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:35.040> more<00:01:35.250> importantly

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
grooves as well but more importantly

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.060 
grooves as well but more importantly
it's<00:01:36.000> getting<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.659> adjacent<00:01:37.530> uncut

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
it's getting on the adjacent uncut

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.560 
it's getting on the adjacent uncut
enamel<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:38.939> gonna<00:01:39.060> provide<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
enamel and it's gonna provide the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.260 
enamel and it's gonna provide the
highest<00:01:40.020> bond<00:01:40.500> strength<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:41.189> us<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.240> we

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
highest bond strength for us so that we

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.149 
highest bond strength for us so that we
know<00:01:42.509> everything's<00:01:43.049> gonna<00:01:43.229> stay<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.920> place

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
know everything's gonna stay in place

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.280 
know everything's gonna stay in place
once<00:01:44.460> we've<00:01:44.640> cured<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.149> into<00:01:45.360> place<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.960> again

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
once we've cured it into place and again

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.499 
once we've cured it into place and again
using<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.799> enclosed<00:01:47.280> tip<00:01:47.670> I've<00:01:48.119> got<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
using the enclosed tip I've got the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.560 
using the enclosed tip I've got the
shade<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:49.140> two<00:01:49.200> diet<00:01:50.070> flow<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.880> I'm<00:01:51.030> squirting

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
shade a two diet flow and I'm squirting

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.090 
shade a two diet flow and I'm squirting
it<00:01:51.659> into<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.020> first<00:01:52.290> sealant<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.920> then

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
it into that first sealant and then

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.889 
it into that first sealant and then
you're<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.369> using<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.939> brush<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.630> kind<00:01:54.840> of

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
you're just using the brush to kind of

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.289 
you're just using the brush to kind of
take<00:01:55.140> off<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.560> excess<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.490> that's<00:01:56.729> important

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
take off the excess and that's important

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.690 
take off the excess and that's important
because<00:01:57.420> as<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.960> know<00:01:58.439> whether<00:01:58.920> you're<00:01:59.130> doing

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
because as you know whether you're doing

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.399 
because as you know whether you're doing
the<00:01:59.820> sealants<00:02:00.329> or<00:02:00.509> one<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.750> your<00:02:00.869> assistants

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the sealants or one of your assistants

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.260 
the sealants or one of your assistants
is<00:02:01.680> doing<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.280> sealants<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.939> rookie

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
is doing the sealants one of the rookie

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.569 
is doing the sealants one of the rookie
mistakes<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.200> leave<00:02:04.530> them<00:02:04.740> way<00:02:05.070> too<00:02:05.100> high

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
mistakes is to leave them way too high

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.310 
mistakes is to leave them way too high
in<00:02:05.729> occlusion<00:02:06.270> because<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.750> forgot<00:02:07.049> that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
in occlusion because you forgot that

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.589 
in occlusion because you forgot that
you're<00:02:07.469> not<00:02:07.590> doing<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.039> real<00:02:08.390> restoration<00:02:09.390> per

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
you're not doing a real restoration per

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.449 
you're not doing a real restoration per
se<00:02:09.869> you're<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.349> filling<00:02:10.739> up<00:02:10.830> those<00:02:11.039> grooves

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
se you're just filling up those grooves

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.340 
se you're just filling up those grooves
and<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:12.360> don't<00:02:12.569> need<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.959> too

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
and you don't need it too

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.380 
and you don't need it too
and<00:02:13.440> onto<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.860> occlusal<00:02:14.340> surface<00:02:14.820> so<00:02:15.120> in

and onto the occlusal surface so in

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.620 
and onto the occlusal surface so in
addition<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:16.190> agitating<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.340> diet<00:02:17.700> flow<00:02:18.030> into

addition to agitating the diet flow into

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.080 
addition to agitating the diet flow into
the<00:02:18.750> two<00:02:18.930> structure<00:02:19.470> for<00:02:19.740> 15<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.340> 20<00:02:20.370> seconds

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
the two structure for 15 to 20 seconds

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.120 
the two structure for 15 to 20 seconds
the<00:02:21.420> brush<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.840> really<00:02:21.870> helping<00:02:22.590> me<00:02:22.740> remove

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
the brush is really helping me remove

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.700 
the brush is really helping me remove
all<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.820> excess<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.840> may<00:02:25.050> have<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.620> you

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
all the excess that you may have and you

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.590 
all the excess that you may have and you
may<00:02:25.830> have<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.370> adjust<00:02:26.850> off<00:02:27.060> later<00:02:27.390> and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
may have to it adjust off later and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.090 
may have to it adjust off later and
that's<00:02:27.840> definitely<00:02:28.050> one<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.590> things<00:02:28.860> that

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
that's definitely one of the things that

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.410 
that's definitely one of the things that
I've<00:02:29.220> noticed<00:02:29.460> when<00:02:29.880> I've<00:02:30.000> taught<00:02:30.240> my

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
I've noticed when I've taught my

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.060 
I've noticed when I've taught my
assistants<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.170> do<00:02:31.290> sealants<00:02:31.770> one<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.010> the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
assistants to do sealants one of the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.950 
assistants to do sealants one of the
mistakes<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.610> they<00:02:32.760> make<00:02:33.120> because<00:02:33.600> this<00:02:33.780> is

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
mistakes that they make because this is

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.830 
mistakes that they make because this is
a<00:02:33.990> shade<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.800> -<00:02:34.860> we're<00:02:35.310> gonna<00:02:35.400> cure<00:02:35.820> this<00:02:36.000> for<00:02:36.420> 20

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
a shade a - we're gonna cure this for 20

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.050 
a shade a - we're gonna cure this for 20
seconds<00:02:37.230> here<00:02:37.410> with<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.130> curing<00:02:38.550> light<00:02:38.730> and

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
seconds here with the curing light and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.480 
seconds here with the curing light and
then<00:02:39.660> we're<00:02:40.200> done<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.500> mean<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:41.100> really<00:02:41.340> look

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
then we're done I mean you really look

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.100 
then we're done I mean you really look
at<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.700> thickness<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.240> this<00:02:42.390> layer<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.990> it's

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
at the thickness of this layer and it's

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.930 
at the thickness of this layer and it's
about<00:02:43.260> half<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.710> millimeter<00:02:43.920> down<00:02:44.520> into<00:02:44.850> the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
about half a millimeter down into the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.670 
about half a millimeter down into the
groove<00:02:45.150> where<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.480> use<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.080> quarter<00:02:46.440> round

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
groove where I use that quarter round

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.440 
groove where I use that quarter round
bur<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.160> we're<00:02:47.310> going<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.520> cure<00:02:47.790> this<00:02:47.910> for<00:02:48.150> 20

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
bur so we're going to cure this for 20

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.150 
bur so we're going to cure this for 20
seconds<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:48.990> that<00:02:49.140> sealant<00:02:49.620> is<00:02:49.740> going<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.070> be

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
seconds and that sealant is going to be

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.860 
seconds and that sealant is going to be
completely<00:02:50.640> cured<00:02:51.060> it's<00:02:51.300> going<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.540> be<00:02:51.660> done

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
completely cured it's going to be done

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.750 
completely cured it's going to be done
now<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.230> might<00:02:52.470> ask<00:02:52.500> well<00:02:53.100> why<00:02:53.310> didn't<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.580> do

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
now you might ask well why didn't you do

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.520 
now you might ask well why didn't you do
all<00:02:53.940> three<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.510> these<00:02:54.630> sealants<00:02:55.110> at<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.320> same

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
all three of these sealants at the same

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.290 
all three of these sealants at the same
time<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.040> that's<00:02:56.160> actually<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.910> really<00:02:57.000> good

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
time and that's actually a really good

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.420 
time and that's actually a really good
question<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.530> reason<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.040> we've<00:02:59.280> got

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
question and the reason is we've got

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.370 
question and the reason is we've got
some<00:02:59.460> pretty<00:02:59.940> powerful<00:03:00.420> lights<00:03:00.960> that<00:03:01.230> we've

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
some pretty powerful lights that we've

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.200 
some pretty powerful lights that we've
set<00:03:01.620> up<00:03:01.650> next<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.280> patient<00:03:02.700> here<00:03:02.880> because

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
set up next to the patient here because

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.270 
set up next to the patient here because
we're<00:03:03.480> filming<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:04.170> for<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.680> watch<00:03:04.920> and

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
we're filming this for you to watch and

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.330 
we're filming this for you to watch and
my<00:03:05.520> concern<00:03:06.180> was<00:03:06.600> that<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.900> diet<00:03:07.290> flow<00:03:07.680> might

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
my concern was that the diet flow might

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.520 
my concern was that the diet flow might
actually<00:03:08.850> set<00:03:09.150> before<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.540> had<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.780> chance<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.350> go

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
actually set before I had a chance to go

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.520 
actually set before I had a chance to go
in<00:03:10.740> with<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.070> brush<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.670> fit<00:03:12.570> it<00:03:12.690> out<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.140> if

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
in with the brush and fit it out and if

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.710 
in with the brush and fit it out and if
we<00:03:13.650> did<00:03:13.800> not<00:03:13.950> have<00:03:14.190> these<00:03:14.400> powerful<00:03:14.820> filming

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
we did not have these powerful filming

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.660 
we did not have these powerful filming
lights<00:03:15.930> shining<00:03:16.290> at<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.530> patient<00:03:17.100> or<00:03:17.310> if<00:03:17.550> you

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
lights shining at the patient or if you

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.730 
lights shining at the patient or if you
took<00:03:17.850> your<00:03:18.090> overhead<00:03:18.750> operatory<00:03:19.290> light<00:03:19.530> and

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
took your overhead operatory light and

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.740 
took your overhead operatory light and
just<00:03:20.070> turned<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.460> away<00:03:20.760> from<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.180> patient<00:03:21.630> you

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
just turned it away from the patient you

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.720 
just turned it away from the patient you
can<00:03:21.930> certainly<00:03:22.410> save<00:03:22.770> a<00:03:22.800> lot<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.070> time<00:03:23.340> by

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
can certainly save a lot of time by

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.330 
can certainly save a lot of time by
going<00:03:24.420> in<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:24.870> taking<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.350> diet<00:03:25.680> flow<00:03:25.980> and

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
going in and taking the diet flow and

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.730 
going in and taking the diet flow and
placing<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.090> into<00:03:27.270> all<00:03:27.540> three<00:03:28.170> of<00:03:28.290> these<00:03:28.470> teeth

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
placing it into all three of these teeth

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.010 
placing it into all three of these teeth
so<00:03:28.980> that<00:03:29.070> we're<00:03:29.310> doing<00:03:29.850> sealants<00:03:30.480> on<00:03:30.630> them<00:03:30.840> at

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
so that we're doing sealants on them at

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.810 
so that we're doing sealants on them at
the<00:03:31.470> same<00:03:31.710> time<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.190> then<00:03:32.280> going<00:03:32.610> through

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
the same time and then going through

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.940 
the same time and then going through
with<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.060> brush<00:03:33.330> and<00:03:33.720> thinning<00:03:34.410> all<00:03:34.530> three<00:03:34.860> of

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
with the brush and thinning all three of

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.350 
with the brush and thinning all three of
them<00:03:35.070> out<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.280> then<00:03:35.640> curing<00:03:36.090> them<00:03:36.240> in

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
them out and then curing them in

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.940 
them out and then curing them in
succession<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.350> would<00:03:37.470> actually<00:03:37.770> make

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
succession and that would actually make

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.860 
succession and that would actually make
a<00:03:37.980> lot<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.250> sense<00:03:38.550> and<00:03:38.940> make<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:39.300> procedure<00:03:39.750> a

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
a lot of sense and make this procedure a

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.960 
a lot of sense and make this procedure a
lot<00:03:39.990> more<00:03:40.440> efficient<00:03:40.980> but<00:03:41.130> because<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.790> high

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
lot more efficient but because the high

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.330 
lot more efficient but because the high
powered<00:03:42.390> lights<00:03:42.600> we've<00:03:42.870> got<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:43.590> I'm<00:03:44.040> doing

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
powered lights we've got and I'm doing

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.460 
powered lights we've got and I'm doing
these<00:03:44.430> teeth<00:03:44.700> individually<00:03:45.450> which<00:03:46.110> is<00:03:46.260> fine

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
these teeth individually which is fine

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.690 
these teeth individually which is fine
you<00:03:46.500> can<00:03:46.710> choose<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.190> do<00:03:47.310> them<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.430> way

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
you can choose to do them that way

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.940 
you can choose to do them that way
yourself<00:03:48.150> if<00:03:48.480> you're<00:03:48.630> not<00:03:48.660> in<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.960> hurry<00:03:49.170> the

this is a dull 7408 bird just being run

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.860 
this is a dull 7408 bird just being run
over<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.919> groove<00:04:52.250> this<00:04:52.939> is<00:04:53.150> being<00:04:53.360> used<00:04:53.449> once

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
over the groove this is being used once

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.779 
over the groove this is being used once
more<00:04:54.169> to<00:04:54.439> make<00:04:54.590> sure<00:04:54.830> that<00:04:55.129> we<00:04:55.280> don't<00:04:55.430> have<00:04:55.550> any

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
more to make sure that we don't have any

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.550 
more to make sure that we don't have any
rough<00:04:56.030> areas<00:04:56.449> for<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.870> patient's<00:04:57.289> tongue

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
rough areas for the patient's tongue

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.529 
rough areas for the patient's tongue
where<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.430> sealant<00:04:58.849> and<00:04:58.969> the<00:04:59.060> tooth<00:04:59.270> come

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
where the sealant and the tooth come

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.300 
where the sealant and the tooth come
together<00:04:59.690> the<00:05:00.319> tip<00:05:00.469> of<00:05:00.590> that<00:05:00.620> bird<00:05:00.949> is<00:05:01.099> big

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
together the tip of that bird is big

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.339 
together the tip of that bird is big
enough<00:05:01.580> where<00:05:02.090> it<00:05:02.360> can't<00:05:02.690> even<00:05:02.780> reach<00:05:03.080> down

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349 
enough where it can't even reach down

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:05.709 
enough where it can't even reach down
into<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.620> grooves<00:05:04.180> anywhere<00:05:05.180> where<00:05:05.449> I<00:05:05.479> was

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:05.719 
into the grooves anywhere where I was

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:07.629 
into the grooves anywhere where I was
with<00:05:05.900> the<00:05:06.020> quarter<00:05:06.379> round<00:05:06.560> bur<00:05:06.860> so<00:05:07.129> you<00:05:07.190> really

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
with the quarter round bur so you really

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.550 
with the quarter round bur so you really
don't<00:05:07.759> have<00:05:07.909> to<00:05:08.180> worry<00:05:08.360> about<00:05:08.419> removing<00:05:09.050> too

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
don't have to worry about removing too

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.619 
don't have to worry about removing too
much<00:05:09.800> of<00:05:09.979> the<00:05:10.069> sealant<00:05:10.490> material<00:05:10.550> when<00:05:11.150> using

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:11.629 
much of the sealant material when using

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:14.170 
much of the sealant material when using
that<00:05:11.780> 7408<00:05:12.710> Burk<00:05:13.159> then<00:05:13.460> have<00:05:13.669> the<00:05:13.789> patient

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
that 7408 Burk then have the patient

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.670 
that 7408 Burk then have the patient
bite<00:05:14.330> together<00:05:14.539> and<00:05:15.050> check<00:05:15.289> the<00:05:15.440> occlusion

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
bite together and check the occlusion

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.680 
bite together and check the occlusion
and<00:05:16.039> we<00:05:16.550> should<00:05:16.729> only<00:05:16.849> see<00:05:17.150> it<00:05:17.240> on<00:05:17.330> the<00:05:17.449> cusp

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
and we should only see it on the cusp

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.019 
and we should only see it on the cusp
tips<00:05:17.930> and<00:05:18.500> the<00:05:18.740> marginal<00:05:19.190> ridges<00:05:19.400> and<00:05:19.819> that's

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:20.029 
tips and the marginal ridges and that's

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:21.700 
tips and the marginal ridges and that's
where<00:05:20.270> we<00:05:20.360> see<00:05:20.599> it<00:05:20.750> so<00:05:21.080> we're<00:05:21.379> gonna<00:05:21.469> go

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
where we see it so we're gonna go

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.550 
where we see it so we're gonna go
straight<00:05:22.159> to<00:05:22.310> the<00:05:22.669> Polish<00:05:23.029> and<00:05:23.300> this<00:05:24.080> is<00:05:24.289> the

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
straight to the Polish and this is the

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.399 
straight to the Polish and this is the
aqua<00:05:25.129> brush<00:05:25.430> that<00:05:25.849> I'm<00:05:26.000> using<00:05:26.240> again<00:05:26.960> no<00:05:27.169> need

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
aqua brush that I'm using again no need

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.320 
aqua brush that I'm using again no need
for<00:05:27.710> polishing<00:05:28.219> paste<00:05:28.400> with<00:05:28.669> this<00:05:28.879> it's<00:05:29.150> got

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
for polishing paste with this it's got

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.869 
for polishing paste with this it's got
the<00:05:29.740> polishing<00:05:30.740> material<00:05:30.889> built<00:05:31.460> into<00:05:31.789> the

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:31.879 
the polishing material built into the

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.029 
the polishing material built into the
bristles<00:05:32.120> and<00:05:32.690> also<00:05:33.289> it<00:05:33.379> does<00:05:33.529> a<00:05:33.560> really<00:05:33.830> good

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
bristles and also it does a really good

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:36.730 
bristles and also it does a really good
job<00:05:34.099> of<00:05:34.520> removing<00:05:34.940> any<00:05:35.419> adjacent<00:05:36.080> diet<00:05:36.440> flow

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
job of removing any adjacent diet flow

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.399 
job of removing any adjacent diet flow
that<00:05:37.310> might<00:05:37.639> be<00:05:37.789> on<00:05:37.940> some<00:05:38.210> uncut<00:05:38.750> enamel<00:05:39.229> that

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
that might be on some uncut enamel that

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:41.950 
that might be on some uncut enamel that
wasn't<00:05:39.770> edged<00:05:40.009> and<00:05:40.610> so<00:05:40.879> we'll<00:05:41.060> go<00:05:41.210> in<00:05:41.449> and<00:05:41.750> dry

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
wasn't edged and so we'll go in and dry

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.659 
wasn't edged and so we'll go in and dry
it<00:05:42.020> off<00:05:42.199> and<00:05:42.229> take<00:05:42.500> a<00:05:42.529> final<00:05:42.860> look<00:05:42.979> at<00:05:43.190> that<00:05:43.400> and

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
it off and take a final look at that and

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.640 
it off and take a final look at that and
again<00:05:44.389> that's<00:05:44.539> a<00:05:44.690> pretty<00:05:44.870> compelling<00:05:45.289> case

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
again that's a pretty compelling case

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.219 
again that's a pretty compelling case
for<00:05:46.009> the<00:05:46.370> shade<00:05:46.610> a2<00:05:46.819> of<00:05:47.029> the<00:05:47.270> diet<00:05:47.629> flow<00:05:47.930> to<00:05:47.990> be

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
for the shade a2 of the diet flow to be

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:50.950 
for the shade a2 of the diet flow to be
kind<00:05:48.500> of<00:05:48.589> the<00:05:48.710> universal<00:05:49.520> shade<00:05:49.849> and<00:05:50.120> you<00:05:50.810> may

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
kind of the universal shade and you may

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.779 
kind of the universal shade and you may
want<00:05:51.169> to<00:05:51.319> pick<00:05:51.500> it<00:05:51.680> it<00:05:51.800> just<00:05:51.979> simply
