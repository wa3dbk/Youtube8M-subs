00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.069
 coach the head is off 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.710
 first the weather in the new year ready 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.570
 for yes guys are enthusiastic 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.130
 as always are that is so now 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.620
 home and sophia that is always 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.250
 perfect field is great the weather is 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.320
 good 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.359
 the food is good so what do you want 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.730
 more and it is now a matter of 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.590
 charge the battery and ensure that we have the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.240
 stand against Oostende 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.859
 you went the nicest one is called 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.660
 an afternoon in their warmth 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.609
 so would this morning even though a session 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.500
 sit on it so good it is 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.759
 not a lazy country it is an issue 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.890
 that should do something beyond the fact that 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.510
 we don't lose much there are only one 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.280
 have been free for a few days then you do 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.960
 not to recover that much 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.969
 but what i notice is that the guys who 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.780
 there are hungry than they want it to be 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.000
 always the basics 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.640
 I saw you again and it was hanging 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.160
 on avoiding ball loss 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.660
 yes that is I sometimes find it a shame 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.410
 that you have to walk as much as you always do 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.239
 but again the ball and the opponent 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.399
 So you have to make sure you get the ball 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.780
 hold much longer that means 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.730
 that you are convinced that you are good 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.440
 a few wrote that he also arrives and 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.449
 otherwise it's just really awful 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.890
 sin and then you have to go again and again 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.930
 fly to raise that ball back 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.490
 continue to buy hands there and that is 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.250
 also the approach of not camp 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.200
 in that first match for the cup in 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.450
 Ostend is coming very quickly 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.460
 yes that is clear we only have one 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.380
 10 days then we have to stand and that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.729
 is a very important competition because 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.990
 I again think it's too short for them 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.210
 became europe 'and have it last year 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.130
 and then another one awaited us 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.810
 semi-final were allowed to come through again 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.100
 is not your voice to the off 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.650
 has proved 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.900
 name in the last period of 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.729
 excellent team but the 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.189
 infirmary is almost empty 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.360
 yes only wengie still and unfortunately they thomas 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.790
 of course with an unpleasant situation 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.049
 remained in Belgium 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.049
 and can have the rest 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.200
 everyone is fit there is even one more 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.720
 added cc telling yes say how is 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.090
 an offside player can also be central to the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.950
 play striker comes from feyenoord 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.550
 I then have the time from euros 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.310
 afterwards 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.170
 and feyenoord is a boy with 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.840
 enormous physical qualities depth 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.550
 without a ball can make a goal has whole 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.530
 had a lot of bad luck at feyenoord and is now 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.150
 Free transfer is ready to become one again 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.550
 and I still believe in it 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.430
 century and so that the missing link can 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.840
 are yes we are going to look this week in this 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.950
 week should make a decision as soon as possible 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.780
 because I also think of the boy 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.070
 that it just keeps on coming but also for it 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.530
 fact that you may have it available 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.450
 for Ostend there is another one 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.060
 cara would stay longer what do you think of it 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.560
 who the contact just yes great kari 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.000
 has shown that he is naturally one 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.070
 incredible reinforcement for in so 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.840
 has been for us and shows it 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.190
 is an excellent defender and I think 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.740
 That is a good thing that the club is one 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.740
 long-term also thinks
