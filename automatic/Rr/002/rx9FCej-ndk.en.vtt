diets<00:03:04.910> in<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.150> past<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.720> had<00:03:05.870> really<00:03:06.170> good

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
weight loss success so I'm hoping that

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.059 
weight loss success so I'm hoping that
I<00:03:10.129> can<00:03:10.790> kind<00:03:10.969> of<00:03:11.030> get<00:03:11.180> myself<00:03:11.360> into<00:03:11.780> ketosis

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
I can kind of get myself into ketosis

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.729 
I can kind of get myself into ketosis
before<00:03:13.069> I<00:03:13.099> go<00:03:13.579> into<00:03:13.610> surgery<00:03:13.969> that<00:03:14.390> way<00:03:14.739> it's

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
before I go into surgery that way it's

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.170 
before I go into surgery that way it's
not<00:03:15.890> such<00:03:16.069> a<00:03:16.159> big<00:03:16.280> shock<00:03:16.549> on<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.819> system

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180
