00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 
the lowest one of the tier but still I

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.140

dominique wilkins and Julius Erving so I

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:15.480 
dominique wilkins and Julius Erving so I
thought<00:06:14.169> that<00:06:14.229> was<00:06:14.439> a<00:06:14.500> pretty<00:06:14.560> good<00:06:14.800> card<00:06:15.159> and

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
thought that was a pretty good card and

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.510 
thought that was a pretty good card and
I'm<00:06:15.819> guessing<00:06:16.300> that<00:06:16.479> this<00:06:16.629> was<00:06:16.930> the<00:06:17.520> probably

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
I'm guessing that this was the probably

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.679 
I'm guessing that this was the probably
the<00:06:18.699> hit<00:06:19.120> of<00:06:19.360> that<00:06:19.779> case<00:06:20.909> or<00:06:21.909> probably<00:06:22.599> the

00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:22.689 
the hit of that case or probably the

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:26.159 
the hit of that case or probably the
Class<00:06:23.589> A<00:06:23.919> level<00:06:24.490> a<00:06:24.639> autograph<00:06:24.999> alright<00:06:25.539> so
