00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
panels one of the worst things is when

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.600 
panels one of the worst things is when
you<00:02:00.180> wait<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.659> line<00:02:00.899> for<00:02:00.930> hours<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:02.430> to

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610
