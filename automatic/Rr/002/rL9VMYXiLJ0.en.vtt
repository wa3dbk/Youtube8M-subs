00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 good girls and guys, these are the 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.100
 ingredients that we are going to use as 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.049
 you see we need milk in this case 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.240
 It is foolish to throw milk 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.670
 we're going to need whipped cream or ice cream 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.720
 of cream in this case is frozen 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.790
 away from the freezer 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.140
 and we're going to need any kind of 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.940
 chocolate in our case we are going to 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.730
 use good kinder but you can 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.920
 use clues you can throw him sneakers 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.920
 the man can you take little things 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.820
 that when crushing and so on 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.230
 rich taste to the golden bati and good 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.570
 you are going to need either a 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.000
 blender blender of these or a robot 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.280
 of these kitchen to make the mixture 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.739
 and that kills everything very well and that 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.020
 proceed this I mix it very well with the 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.990
 rest of ingredients so nothing are going 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.100
 to go on to make the shake since it is 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.100
 that is really good 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.930
 and good as you see here I have my robot 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.129
 let's remove the lid and now we're going to 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.080
 start throwing the ingredients what 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.390
 first you have to throw is the milk 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.610
 that I'm going to make a smoothie for four 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.220
 people so I recommend that you 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.250
 You throw three glasses and a little bit of what 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.610
 good three glasses because really then 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.140
 the rest is going to make the cream and the 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.590
 bars so with three glasses three 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.360
 glasses and a quarter goes well milk if 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.369
 It's cooler from the fridge much better 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.110
 I'm going to take three and a half glasses because 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.330
 It's always better than a little bit and 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.090
 that someone wants to repeat so that they do not 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.850
 I missed and one person I took - so 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.300
 I'm going to take the three and a half glasses of 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.910
 milk 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.720
 and then we're going to add our cream 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:48.380
 frost mounted let's add half a pot 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.160
 as you see here the chamos well within 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.350
 approximately half a boat is worth it 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.940
 brings 500 milliliters and good now comes 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.870
 the rich part that is adding the 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.090
 chocolates 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.830
 we are going to open and cut in 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.320
 of the robot 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.400
 I am going to add 4 bars already thrown two 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.140
 and now and throw these 2 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.920
 I'm going to tell you a secret this little piece 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.920
 I'm going to eat it 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:18.930
 and well I'll show you how it would look 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.110
 you see it like that all the mix and now we're going 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:26.180
 to put the lid do not ever forget about 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.180
 cover well is the little toy 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.340
 Well, once we have it 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.569
 you just have to take the glasses and 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.569
 nothing we are going to serve it 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.090
 and here you have a delicious drink 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.870
 fresh with flavor to your 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.209
 favorite chocolate bar and nothing ideal for 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.190
 refresh a summer afternoon that already 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.200
 It starts to get hot and it shows 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.989
 that you liked the recipe and if 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.610
