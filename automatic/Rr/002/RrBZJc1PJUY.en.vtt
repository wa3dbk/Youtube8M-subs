00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.150
If you listen,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.750
You'll hear the magic rain fall

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.670
Now under the rainbow

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.850
We fly to the sun

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.390
Hear the whisper of wind beneath the blue sky

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.510
We live in miracles every minute of the day

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.550
Rising to become the one that you are dreaming of

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.350
You'll be free to spread your wings

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.430
Your dream takes you anywhere

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.150
Rise and tank a deep breath

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.950
You're leaving the world behind

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.410
To the place you dreamed

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.430
Along the way you light the way

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.530
Everywhere you go

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.470
Let's dance in the wind

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.770
And the birds will be singing along

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.590
Sound of the breeze
And the sparkle of rain

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.170
How beautiful

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:44.610
If you believe the world, you can fly out to the sky

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.670
If you listen,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.690
You hear the stars whispering

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.710
If you remember

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.590
There's magic everywhere

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.850
Drop of rain became a sea
I'm swimming across the sea

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.590
Deep inside my heart I sank
My doubts and my fears

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.050
Take a deep breath again
And follow my heart

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.550
Still looking for

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.610
My story happy ever after

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.690
Everyday the sun will be lighting your way

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.510
And the flowers will bloom as you go

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.430
And in the night

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.590
You hear a lulaby

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.330
The stars shine bright

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:55.930
If your heart believes, you can fly out to the sky

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.570
Everywhere you go

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.490
Let's dance in the wind

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.630
And the birds will be singing along

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.830
Sound of the breeze
And the sparkle of rain

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.830
How beautiful

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:56.010
If you believe the world, you can fly out to the sky
