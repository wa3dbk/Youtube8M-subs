00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.500
 hello everyone how good in the video 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.690
 today I bring you a new coat magnet 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.530
 dopico which is this number 2 which is the 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.500
 star 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.960
 and good as in the previous video that 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.810
 I made the icon I still did not know very well 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.939
 how to record the days of pintauñas I'm going 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.410
 to make one more nail with the first Ivan 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.890
 that came out so you can see the effect 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.560
 what's left 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.800
 I will use the same as always 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.980
 the protective base of kiko for before 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.739
 apply nail polish and then I will use 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.730
 the two pintauñas that I have this I am going to 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.070
 use that is what I'm going to stay 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.330
 as you see here that is already the definitive and 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.970
 I'm going to use this blue for the 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:48.000
 first magnet to take out and so you can see me 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.710
 well the difference between one and the other 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.080
 so I 'm just going to leave you with 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.810
 the video good I'll make two nails 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.309
 the first one will be with the new magnet and 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.500
 the second I will use the other 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.930
 nail polish that is blue and with the magnet 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.579
 what is this day that is the line 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.500
 OK 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.390
 so the first one that I'm going to use is going 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.720
 to be the purple one that is in the end I 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.720
 I will stay 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.210
 you know a layer not too thick 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.610
 that covers well but if it's too much 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.420
 thick then it will cost a lot 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.610
 the effect of the seventh 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.900
 then once applied we take the 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.090
 magnet 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.480
 place on top taking care not to 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.560
 we touch the nail and we leave some between 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.560
 10 or 15 seconds 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.799
 and that would be more or less the drawing and 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.810
 You see, it's not like it's a star 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.810
 perfect they are simply like lines 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.970
 I do not know yet how to place him 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.300
 you see the most crossed lines or not 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.159
 it is not perfect but good is 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.380
 curious to see 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.909
 the end let's say it as it is and 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.020
 Well now let's do the other 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:05.159
 nail with blue and the same one capita 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.159
 not too thick 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.720
 and we apply the magnet 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.630
 Well yes you can if you can see the 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.480
 difference to the ray magnet 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.600
 I would simply make like stripes like this 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.960
 on the side we go horizontal so a little 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.260
 more curved down and the other one a 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.630
 same central point as they go different 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.340
 different stripes on both sides is therefore 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.860
 As you can see here I have lowered it more and 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.630
 there is just one line and small 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.300
 as the point the focal point here more 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.050
 down there is the central point then 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.530
 in each 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.300
 vary the magnet a bit, you can place it 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.940
 according to how you want or further down more 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.440
 up according to where you want it to come out 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.930
 let the focal point and then the rest 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.730
 stripes and the same as the place 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.280
 because how everything goes for the same place 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.959
 no problem 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.750
 good as always once has already 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.569
 finished painting the nails leave them 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.120
 dry very well because if you throw the layer 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.280
 protective that is what would come now 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.590
 you can move what is magnetized 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.290
 and it will stay as blurry so 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.300
 let it dry for a long time and already a 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.260
 so that then put a protective layer 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.670
 on top of the nail and thus it will hold you more 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.030
 well, nothing else, this is the new 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.890
 video about the magnetic nail polish 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.930
 kiko and the new magnet that they have taken that 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.640
 it exists from here and I do not expect anything 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.120
 liked the video is not in the next 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.120
 see you later
