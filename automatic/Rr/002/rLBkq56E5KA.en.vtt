do you know you can actually use just
two<00:00:04.300> threads<00:00:04.720> in<00:00:05.020> the<00:00:05.140> serger<00:00:05.560> you<00:00:05.770> get<00:00:06.280> a<00:00:06.520> two

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:06.580 
two threads in the serger you get a two

two threads in the serger you get a two
thread<00:00:07.330> overlock<00:00:07.900> a<00:00:08.200> two<00:00:08.500> thread<00:00:08.860> wrapped

thread overlock a two thread wrapped
edge<00:00:09.730> or<00:00:10.089> a<00:00:10.360> 2<00:00:10.749> thread<00:00:11.349> rolled<00:00:12.129> hem<00:00:12.429> which

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:12.879 
edge or a 2 thread rolled hem which

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.150 
edge or a 2 thread rolled hem which
means<00:00:13.120> you're<00:00:13.389> using<00:00:13.809> one<00:00:14.379> spool<00:00:14.740> less<00:00:14.980> of

means you're using one spool less of
thread<00:00:15.429> and<00:00:15.610> it<00:00:15.700> actually<00:00:15.820> looks<00:00:16.150> really<00:00:16.240> nice

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
thread and it actually looks really nice

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.900 
thread and it actually looks really nice
it's<00:00:17.170> great<00:00:17.470> for<00:00:17.710> very<00:00:17.949> delicate<00:00:18.340> like

fabrics<00:00:19.480> I<00:00:19.689> actually<00:00:20.349> did<00:00:20.710> a<00:00:20.740> two<00:00:21.009> thread<00:00:21.310> wrap

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
fabrics I actually did a two thread wrap

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.339 
fabrics I actually did a two thread wrap
on<00:00:21.789> this<00:00:21.939> ribbon<00:00:22.359> I<00:00:22.480> wanted<00:00:22.750> it<00:00:22.869> to<00:00:22.960> have<00:00:23.140> this

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
on this ribbon I wanted it to have this

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.800 
on this ribbon I wanted it to have this
green<00:00:23.740> hue<00:00:24.130> to<00:00:24.310> it<00:00:24.339> to<00:00:24.910> match<00:00:25.089> a<00:00:25.240> project<00:00:25.689> I

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
green hue to it to match a project I

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.329 
green hue to it to match a project I
actually<00:00:25.990> got<00:00:26.289> overzealous<00:00:26.890> and<00:00:27.070> did<00:00:27.220> an

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:27.339 
actually got overzealous and did an

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.189 
actually got overzealous and did an
entire<00:00:27.669> extra<00:00:28.000> spool<00:00:28.539> of<00:00:28.660> it<00:00:28.779> so<00:00:28.960> I<00:00:28.990> always

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
entire extra spool of it so I always

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.079 
entire extra spool of it so I always
have<00:00:29.470> it<00:00:29.619> to<00:00:29.769> show<00:00:29.800> but<00:00:30.519> it's<00:00:30.640> really<00:00:30.910> nice

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:31.089 
have it to show but it's really nice

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.060 
have it to show but it's really nice
because<00:00:31.330> there's<00:00:31.660> not<00:00:31.839> that<00:00:31.900> extra<00:00:32.710> thread

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
because there's not that extra thread

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.580 
because there's not that extra thread

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
tucked on the backside so it's just had

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.799 
tucked on the backside so it's just had
two<00:00:35.950> threads<00:00:36.340> that<00:00:36.520> I<00:00:36.610> had<00:00:36.760> to<00:00:36.879> match<00:00:37.059> cuz<00:00:37.660> that

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
two threads that I had to match cuz that

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:39.750 
two threads that I had to match cuz that
was<00:00:37.899> what<00:00:38.110> I<00:00:38.140> was<00:00:38.350> going<00:00:38.590> for<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:39.160> reason<00:00:39.670> we

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
was what I was going for the reason we

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.220 
was what I was going for the reason we
were<00:00:39.850> pointed<00:00:40.239> down<00:00:40.390> here<00:00:40.629> is<00:00:40.719> this<00:00:40.899> is<00:00:41.050> where

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
were pointed down here is this is where

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.170 
were pointed down here is this is where
it<00:00:41.350> store<00:00:41.649> is<00:00:41.890> stored<00:00:42.309> the<00:00:42.550> two<00:00:42.789> thread

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
it store is stored the two thread

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.869

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
want to pick up the white button as you

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.889 
want to pick up the white button as you
pull<00:00:48.699> the<00:00:48.730> white<00:00:49.000> button<00:00:49.359> out<00:00:49.510> from<00:00:49.750> its

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
pull the white button out from its

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.180 
pull the white button out from its
little<00:00:51.000> covered<00:00:52.000> area<00:00:52.390> here<00:00:52.840> this<00:00:53.410> little<00:00:54.010> guy

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
little covered area here this little guy

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.950 
little covered area here this little guy
is<00:00:54.519> what<00:00:54.820> is<00:00:55.000> going<00:00:55.149> to<00:00:55.210> allow<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:55.510> machine<00:00:55.750> to

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
is what is going to allow the machine to

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.290 
is what is going to allow the machine to
think<00:00:56.469> that<00:00:56.680> there's<00:00:56.949> three<00:00:57.250> threads<00:00:57.640> but

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
think that there's three threads but

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.020 
think that there's three threads but
when<00:00:58.690> we<00:00:59.050> only<00:00:59.260> have<00:00:59.800> two<00:01:00.190> now<00:01:00.670> I've<00:01:00.820> gone

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
when we only have two now I've gone

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.500 
when we only have two now I've gone
ahead<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.780> taken<00:01:02.410> off<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.460> foot<00:01:03.789> so<00:01:04.269> I<00:01:04.300> could

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
ahead and taken off the foot so I could

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.120 
ahead and taken off the foot so I could
really<00:01:04.690> show<00:01:04.989> you<00:01:05.050> how<00:01:05.379> and<00:01:05.680> where<00:01:05.860> this<00:01:06.070> is

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
really show you how and where this is

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.039 
really show you how and where this is

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
do is remove my upper looper thread

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.289 
do is remove my upper looper thread
that's<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.409> green<00:01:11.710> one<00:01:11.979> so<00:01:12.640> now<00:01:12.790> I<00:01:12.820> just<00:01:13.000> have

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
our needle thread and the lower looper

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.410 
our needle thread and the lower looper
but<00:01:17.409> once<00:01:17.619> again<00:01:17.799> the<00:01:18.250> machine<00:01:18.430> has<00:01:19.000> to<00:01:19.240> have

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
but once again the machine has to have

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.080 
but once again the machine has to have
something<00:01:19.900> in<00:01:20.110> that<00:01:20.380> upper<00:01:20.710> looper<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.340> catch

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
something in that upper looper to catch

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.980 
something in that upper looper to catch
on<00:01:22.420> this<00:01:23.759> needle<00:01:24.759> so<00:01:25.240> we're<00:01:25.390> gonna<00:01:25.509> take<00:01:25.840> the

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
on this needle so we're gonna take the

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.340 
on this needle so we're gonna take the
unit<00:01:26.350> okay<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:27.040> white<00:01:27.250> button<00:01:27.729> is<00:01:28.119> up<00:01:28.390> there's

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
unit okay the white button is up there's

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.260 
unit okay the white button is up there's
a<00:01:29.409> little<00:01:29.770> groove<00:01:30.159> right<00:01:30.399> up<00:01:30.670> here<00:01:31.000> you<00:01:31.240> just

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
a little groove right up here you just

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.090 
a little groove right up here you just
kind<00:01:31.720> of<00:01:31.930> slide<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:32.470> down<00:01:32.649> there<00:01:32.890> like<00:01:32.920> a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
kind of slide it down there like a

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.530 
kind of slide it down there like a
little<00:01:33.310> knife<00:01:33.579> now<00:01:33.729> it's<00:01:33.939> really<00:01:34.299> loose

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
little knife now it's really loose

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.870 
little knife now it's really loose
that's<00:01:35.229> because<00:01:35.770> when<00:01:36.250> you<00:01:36.399> take<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.850> other

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
that's because when you take the other

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.440 
that's because when you take the other
tip<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:38.290> part<00:01:38.560> that<00:01:38.740> actually<00:01:38.770> is<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.820> kind<00:01:40.329> of

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
tip the part that actually is a kind of

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.660 
tip the part that actually is a kind of
like<00:01:40.600> a<00:01:40.630> little<00:01:40.930> tiny<00:01:41.290> hook<00:01:41.710> you're<00:01:42.549> gonna

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
like a little tiny hook you're gonna

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.200 
like a little tiny hook you're gonna
push<00:01:43.030> it<00:01:43.240> back<00:01:43.659> behind<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:45.009> upper<00:01:45.310> looper<00:01:45.670> so

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
push it back behind the upper looper so

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.990 
push it back behind the upper looper so
it<00:01:46.360> sits<00:01:46.810> in<00:01:47.079> the<00:01:47.320> eye<00:01:47.619> what's<00:01:48.399> gonna<00:01:48.520> happen

lever<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.270> back<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.900> then<00:02:25.560> now<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.010> is

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
lever in the back and then now this is

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.700 
lever in the back and then now this is
set<00:02:26.340> up<00:02:26.400> for<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> wide<00:02:26.970> version<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:28.440> means

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
set up for a wide version that means

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.300 
set up for a wide version that means
that<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.250> needle<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.230> left<00:02:32.070> needle

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
that the needle is in the left needle

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.770 
that the needle is in the left needle
position<00:02:32.880> with<00:02:33.570> just<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:35.240> lower<00:02:36.240> looper

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
position with just the lower looper

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.050 
position with just the lower looper
engaged<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.950> we're<00:02:38.130> able<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.430> stitch<00:02:38.760> no

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
engaged so we're able to stitch no

is<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:42.990> little<00:02:43.320> chart<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:43.860> how<00:02:44.010> we<00:02:44.070> get<00:02:44.280> this

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
is a little chart like how we get this

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.150 
is a little chart like how we get this
all<00:02:44.640> set<00:02:44.940> up<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.570> can<00:02:45.750> actually<00:02:45.990> see<00:02:46.650> what

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
all set up so you can actually see what

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.950 
all set up so you can actually see what
is<00:02:47.310> going<00:02:47.520> on<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.240> let's<00:02:48.450> just<00:02:48.600> see<00:02:48.720> what<00:02:48.870> we

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
is going on so let's just see what we

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.800 
is going on so let's just see what we
have<00:02:49.170> we<00:02:49.200> right<00:02:49.680> now<00:02:49.890> we<00:02:49.950> have<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.760> two<00:02:51.300> thread

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
have we right now we have the two thread

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.900 
have we right now we have the two thread
wrapped<00:02:52.290> edge<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.830> that's<00:02:52.890> because<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.730> goes

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
wrapped edge and that's because it goes

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.910 
wrapped edge and that's because it goes
all<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.210> way<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.750> backside<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.560> tucks

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
all the way to the backside and tucks

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.640 
all the way to the backside and tucks
over<00:02:56.400> here<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:57.120> if<00:02:57.210> we<00:02:57.240> wanted<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:57.690> not<00:02:58.350> have<00:02:58.620> it

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
over here so if we wanted to not have it

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.560 
over here so if we wanted to not have it
go<00:02:58.860> all<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.190> way<00:02:59.280> around<00:02:59.640> which<00:02:59.850> means<00:03:00.120> we

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
go all the way around which means we

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.630 
go all the way around which means we
don't<00:03:00.780> want<00:03:00.960> it<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.260> really<00:03:02.100> take<00:03:02.310> up<00:03:02.460> as<00:03:02.610> much

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
don't want it to really take up as much

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.750 
don't want it to really take up as much

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.450 
thread take your needle thread tension
down<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.630> zero<00:03:07.020> and<00:03:07.590> watch<00:03:07.770> what<00:03:08.010> its<00:03:08.100> gonna<00:03:08.160> do

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
down to zero and watch what its gonna do

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.550 
down to zero and watch what its gonna do
this<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.850> really<00:03:09.330> nice<00:03:09.510> way<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.840> just<00:03:10.260> run<00:03:10.530> a

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
this is a really nice way to just run a

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.640 
this is a really nice way to just run a
nice<00:03:10.890> simple<00:03:11.250> edge<00:03:11.690> along<00:03:12.690> your<00:03:12.960> fabric

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
nice simple edge along your fabric

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.980 
nice simple edge along your fabric
without<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.970> bolt<00:03:15.210> because<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.630> don't<00:03:15.810> have

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
without the bolt because you don't have

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.470 
without the bolt because you don't have
that<00:03:16.170> extra<00:03:16.560> thread<00:03:16.890> in<00:03:17.040> there<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.850> get<00:03:18.180> a

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
that extra thread in there so you get a

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.380 
that extra thread in there so you get a
simple<00:03:19.110> edge<00:03:19.320> with<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:20.580> part<00:03:21.030> on<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.240> back

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
simple edge with that part on the back

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.540 
simple edge with that part on the back
it's<00:03:21.600> not<00:03:21.900> holding<00:03:22.140> anything<00:03:22.500> together<00:03:22.800> so

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
it's not holding anything together so

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.880 
it's not holding anything together so
you<00:03:23.610> definitely<00:03:23.820> we're<00:03:24.570> not<00:03:24.780> sewing<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.560> seam

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
you definitely we're not sewing a seam

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.760 
you definitely we're not sewing a seam
we're<00:03:26.220> only<00:03:26.400> going<00:03:26.880> along<00:03:27.090> an<00:03:27.570> edge<00:03:27.900> now<00:03:28.530> this

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
we're only going along an edge now this

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.430 
we're only going along an edge now this
is<00:03:28.920> actually<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.430> really<00:03:29.820> good<00:03:30.120> option<00:03:30.600> for<00:03:30.630> a

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
is actually a really good option for a

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.320 
is actually a really good option for a
you<00:03:31.980> can<00:03:32.130> actually<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.790> think<00:03:32.910> that<00:03:33.210> you<00:03:33.270> think

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
you can actually I think that you think

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.760 
you can actually I think that you think
you<00:03:33.630> can<00:03:33.780> do<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:34.850> two<00:03:35.850> thread<00:03:36.360> flatlock<00:03:36.900> for<00:03:37.740> a

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
you can do a two thread flatlock for a

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.830 
you can do a two thread flatlock for a
little<00:03:38.040> smoother<00:03:38.760> edge<00:03:38.940> because<00:03:39.300> when<00:03:39.720> you

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
little smoother edge because when you

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.210 
little smoother edge because when you
take<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.500> tension<00:03:40.710> down<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.400> zero<00:03:41.700> oh<00:03:43.220> yeah

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
take the tension down to zero oh yeah

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.670 
take the tension down to zero oh yeah
here<00:03:45.090> we<00:03:45.120> go<00:03:45.270> so<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:45.960> book<00:03:46.110> doesn't<00:03:46.350> even<00:03:46.470> show

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
here we go so the book doesn't even show

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.590 
here we go so the book doesn't even show
you<00:03:46.740> this<00:03:46.950> but<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.580> can<00:03:47.700> do<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.360> thread

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
you this but you can do it to thread

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.360 
you this but you can do it to thread
flatlock<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:49.230> actually<00:03:49.530> one<00:03:49.650> of<00:03:49.680> my<00:03:49.830> favorites

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
flatlock is actually one of my favorites

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.160 
flatlock is actually one of my favorites
and<00:03:50.820> that's<00:03:51.000> just<00:03:51.210> because<00:03:51.390> when<00:03:51.750> we<00:03:51.900> have

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
and that's just because when we have

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.100 
and that's just because when we have
that<00:03:52.290> tension<00:03:53.100> on<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.700> needle<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.390> 0<00:03:54.660> we<00:03:54.930> can

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
that tension on the needle to 0 we can

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.260 
that tension on the needle to 0 we can
flatten<00:03:55.620> that<00:03:55.710> out<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.160> open<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:56.760> then<00:03:57.150> it

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
flatten that out and open and then it

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.790 
flatten that out and open and then it
lays<00:03:57.450> perfectly<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.470> then<00:03:58.590> you're<00:03:58.710> not

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
lays perfectly and then you're not

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.070 
lays perfectly and then you're not
fighting<00:03:59.100> that<00:03:59.400> extra<00:03:59.820> thread<00:04:00.180> trying<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.960> get

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
fighting that extra thread trying to get

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.080 
fighting that extra thread trying to get
it<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.320> nestle<00:04:01.830> down<00:04:02.100> on<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.400> inside<00:04:02.580> which

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
it to nestle down on the inside which

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.210 
it to nestle down on the inside which
normally<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.570> have<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:03.990> do<00:04:04.110> so<00:04:04.650> that<00:04:04.920> is<00:04:05.190> a

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
normally you have to do so that is a

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.250 
normally you have to do so that is a
really<00:04:05.670> pretty<00:04:05.850> option<00:04:06.390> so<00:04:06.750> two<00:04:06.840> thread

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
really pretty option so two thread

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.320 
really pretty option so two thread
conversion<00:04:07.770> uses<00:04:08.220> less<00:04:08.460> thread<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:08.910> only<00:04:09.090> have

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
conversion uses less thread I only have

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.330 
conversion uses less thread I only have
the<00:04:09.480> needle<00:04:09.750> thread<00:04:09.990> and<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.680> lower<00:04:10.710> looper

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
the needle thread and the lower looper

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.980 
the needle thread and the lower looper
your<00:04:11.880> choice<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.360> could<00:04:12.480> do<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.780> right

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
your choice you could do the right

your choice you could do the right
needle<00:04:13.260> it<00:04:13.560> doesn't<00:04:13.830> matter<00:04:13.980> which<00:04:14.160> needle
