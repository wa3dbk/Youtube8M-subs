take<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:25.160> shot<00:02:25.489> of<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.910> gases<00:02:26.780> as<00:02:26.959> they<00:02:27.110> come

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
take a shot of the gases as they come

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.000 
take a shot of the gases as they come
out<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.760> there's<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.940> amp<00:02:29.239> draw<00:02:29.769> there's<00:02:30.769> the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
out and there's the amp draw there's the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.290 
out and there's the amp draw there's the
20<00:02:31.430> volts<00:02:32.440> second<00:02:33.440> foot<00:02:33.560> guest<00:02:34.000> here's<00:02:35.000> our

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
20 volts second foot guest here's our

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.809 
20 volts second foot guest here's our
gas<00:02:35.540> at<00:02:35.900> 0<00:02:36.140> point<00:02:36.590> 6<00:02:37.010> 6<00:02:37.400> amps<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:39.610> there's<00:02:40.610> our

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
gas at 0 point 6 6 amps and there's our

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.500 
gas at 0 point 6 6 amps and there's our
silicon<00:02:41.600> shots<00:02:42.760> maybe<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.850> little<00:02:44.000> hard<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.299> see

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
silicon shots maybe a little hard to see

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.550 
silicon shots maybe a little hard to see
so<00:02:44.720> what<00:02:44.840> I'm<00:02:44.900> going<00:02:45.019> to<00:02:45.080> do<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:45.319> I'm<00:02:45.410> going<00:02:45.440> to

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.410 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
turn<00:02:45.799> on<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.190> function<00:02:46.670> here<00:02:47.030> which<00:02:47.090> will

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
turn on this function here which will

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.979 
turn on this function here which will
freeze<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.140> images<00:02:48.610> on<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.819> screen<00:02:49.989> and

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
freeze the images on the screen and

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.340 
freeze the images on the screen and
there's<00:02:51.230> our<00:02:51.470> unipolar<00:02:52.160> gated<00:02:52.940> pulses<00:02:53.569> good

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
there's our unipolar gated pulses good

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.660 
there's our unipolar gated pulses good
cell<00:02:54.670> again<00:02:55.670> this<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.690> just<00:02:56.870> power<00:02:57.260> amps<00:02:57.739> to

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
cell again this is just power amps to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.210 
cell again this is just power amps to
controls<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.810> triggering<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.650> scr<00:03:03.220> three

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
controls the triggering of the scr three

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.420 
controls the triggering of the scr three
hundred<00:03:04.519> turns<00:03:04.760> choke<00:03:05.209> coils<00:03:09.130> there<00:03:10.130> we<00:03:10.280> go

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
hundred turns choke coils there we go

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.120 
hundred turns choke coils there we go
there's<00:03:10.750> there's<00:03:11.750> our<00:03:12.049> pulses<00:03:12.620> but

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
there's there's our pulses but

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.210 
there's there's our pulses but
everybody's<00:03:13.700> been<00:03:13.730> trying<00:03:14.299> to<00:03:14.450> generate

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
everybody's been trying to generate

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.259 
everybody's been trying to generate
should<00:03:16.220> say<00:03:16.370> that's<00:03:16.640> pretty<00:03:16.910> much<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.150> whole

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
should say that's pretty much the whole

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.930 
should say that's pretty much the whole
circuit<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:17.989> can<00:03:18.650> vary<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.250> voltage<00:03:19.370> on<00:03:19.880> the

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
circuit I can vary the voltage on the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.020 
circuit I can vary the voltage on the
very<00:03:20.180> act<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:20.750> voltage<00:03:21.079> down<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:22.820> say

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
very act and voltage down and say

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.160 
very act and voltage down and say
decrease<00:03:23.600> in<00:03:23.810> pulses<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:25.100> hold<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:25.519> back<00:03:25.700> up

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
decrease in pulses and hold it back up

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.360 
decrease in pulses and hold it back up
now<00:03:27.170> this<00:03:27.350> is<00:03:27.410> what<00:03:27.620> happens<00:03:27.980> if<00:03:28.070> I<00:03:28.160> go<00:03:28.310> too

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
now this is what happens if I go too

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.280 
now this is what happens if I go too
high<00:03:28.790> I'm<00:03:29.090> believe<00:03:29.480> I'm<00:03:29.630> running<00:03:29.959> into<00:03:30.260> a

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
high I'm believe I'm running into a

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.860 
high I'm believe I'm running into a
course<00:03:30.709> a<00:03:30.920> tree<00:03:31.160> right<00:03:31.340> there<00:03:31.609> it's<00:03:32.540> just<00:03:32.780> a

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
course a tree right there it's just a

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.599 
course a tree right there it's just a
little<00:03:33.049> over<00:03:33.350> 20<00:03:33.650> volts<00:03:33.980> if<00:03:34.070> I<00:03:34.130> turn<00:03:34.340> it<00:03:34.459> back

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
little over 20 volts if I turn it back

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.569 
little over 20 volts if I turn it back
down<00:03:34.880> a<00:03:34.910> hair<00:03:35.239> more<00:03:36.130> system<00:03:37.130> will<00:03:37.220> come<00:03:37.400> back

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
down a hair more system will come back

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:43.210 
down a hair more system will come back
online<00:03:38.200> I<00:03:39.200> can<00:03:40.100> vary<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:41.590> pulses<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:42.829> change

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
online I can vary the pulses and change

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.500 
online I can vary the pulses and change
the<00:03:43.400> range<00:03:43.670> on<00:03:43.910> here<00:03:44.299> so<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:44.600> have<00:03:45.350> more<00:03:45.560> pulses

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.360 

and<00:03:50.510> I<00:03:50.690> can<00:03:50.870> turn<00:03:51.109> the<00:03:51.290> pulses<00:03:51.739> down

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.810 

just<00:03:54.940> a<00:03:55.060> few<00:03:55.239> all<00:03:55.569> sins

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.140 

but<00:03:59.820> basically<00:04:00.300> I<00:04:00.660> so<00:04:00.840> we<00:04:00.960> have<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:02.940> see

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
but basically I so we have and you see

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.250 
but basically I so we have and you see
our<00:04:03.300> own<00:04:03.360> college<00:04:04.130> point<00:04:05.130> 6<00:04:06.090> amps<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.870> gas

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
our own college point 6 amps and gas

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.870 
our own college point 6 amps and gas
production<00:04:07.680> is<00:04:09.020> can't<00:04:10.020> see<00:04:10.230> anymore

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
production is can't see anymore

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.470 
production is can't see anymore
that's<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.630> general<00:04:12.870> idea<00:04:13.940> there's<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:15.000> signal

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
that's the general idea there's a signal

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.260 
that's the general idea there's a signal
and<00:04:15.570> everybody's<00:04:16.050> been<00:04:16.230> trying<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.650> replicate

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
and everybody's been trying to replicate

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.030 
and everybody's been trying to replicate
there<00:04:18.270> it<00:04:18.360> is<00:04:18.450> hope<00:04:19.380> you<00:04:19.530> enjoyed<00:04:19.770> the<00:04:19.800> video

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
there it is hope you enjoyed the video

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.940 
there it is hope you enjoyed the video
thanks<00:04:20.790> for<00:04:20.820> watching
