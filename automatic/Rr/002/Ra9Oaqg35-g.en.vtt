hand corner will say set up MMI we're

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.590 
hand corner will say set up MMI we're
gonna<00:01:00.700> click<00:01:01.000> on<00:01:01.030> that<00:01:02.520> then<00:01:03.520> we're<00:01:03.700> going<00:01:04.030> to

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
hit start speech training so I'm gonna

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.840 
hit start speech training so I'm gonna
go<00:01:26.740> ahead<00:01:26.800> and<00:01:26.890> cancel<00:01:27.040> that<00:01:27.250> out<00:01:27.370> but<00:01:27.730> you'll

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
go ahead and cancel that out but you'll

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.460 
go ahead and cancel that out but you'll
walk<00:01:28.000> through<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.330> list<00:01:28.540> and<00:01:29.020> what<00:01:29.200> that'll

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
walk through the list and what that'll

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.630 
walk through the list and what that'll
do<00:01:29.620> is<00:01:29.650> it'll<00:01:29.770> imitate<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.280> lot<00:01:30.460> of<00:01:30.550> the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
do is it'll imitate a lot of the

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.820 
do is it'll imitate a lot of the
confusion<00:01:31.180> in<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.840> future<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.350> it'll<00:01:32.740> allow

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
confusion in the future and it'll allow

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.020 
confusion in the future and it'll allow
you<00:01:33.010> to<00:01:33.130> speak<00:01:33.580> a<00:01:33.700> little<00:01:33.820> bit<00:01:33.940> more

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
you to speak a little bit more

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.790 
you to speak a little bit more
comfortably<00:01:34.510> to<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.810> car<00:01:35.020> it'll<00:01:35.380> understand

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
comfortably to the car it'll understand

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.040 
comfortably to the car it'll understand
you<00:01:35.950> better<00:01:36.070> and<00:01:37.060> eliminate<00:01:37.570> a<00:01:37.600> little<00:01:37.870> bit<00:01:37.960> of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
you better and eliminate a little bit of

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.160 
you better and eliminate a little bit of
frustration<00:01:38.170> for<00:01:38.590> you

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.940 

so<00:01:46.170> there<00:01:46.320> are<00:01:46.350> quite<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> few<00:01:46.620> voice

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
so there are quite a few voice

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.350 
so there are quite a few voice
recognition<00:01:47.220> commands<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.060> get<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
recognition commands you can get to the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.170 
recognition commands you can get to the
car<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.750> think<00:01:49.080> there's<00:01:49.230> over<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> hundred<00:01:50.180> there

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
car I think there's over a hundred there

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.750 
car I think there's over a hundred there
are<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.300> couple<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.660> use<00:01:51.960> all<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.230> time<00:01:52.760> a

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
are a couple that I use all the time a

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.610 
are a couple that I use all the time a

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
few of those are entering and

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.860 
few of those are entering and

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
destinations for navigation the

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.570 
destinations for navigation the
bluetooth<00:01:58.320> commands<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:58.950> making<00:01:59.220> phone<00:01:59.550> calls

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
bluetooth commands so making phone calls

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.630
