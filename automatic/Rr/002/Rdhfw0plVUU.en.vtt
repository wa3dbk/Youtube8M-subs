Protoss players I had a I had a Jehovah

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.509 
Protoss players I had a I had a Jehovah
Witness<00:01:03.539> friend<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.379> school<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.129> I'm<00:01:05.250> allowed

Witness friend in school so I'm allowed

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.580 
Witness friend in school so I'm allowed
to<00:01:05.640> make<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.970> joke<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.479> actually<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
to make that joke and actually the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.740 
to make that joke and actually the
original<00:01:07.680> observer<00:01:08.310> was<00:01:08.610> called<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.360> witness

original observer was called the witness

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.300 
original observer was called the witness
so<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.350> think<00:01:10.409> blizzard<00:01:10.770> knew<00:01:11.010> what<00:01:11.130> they<00:01:11.250> were

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.580 
so I think blizzard knew what they were
doing<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:11.700> okay<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:13.020> see<00:01:13.140> luxury

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
evenly but I kind of doubt that that's

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.140 
evenly but I kind of doubt that that's
the<00:04:57.110> case<00:04:57.140> I<00:04:57.560> bet<00:04:57.980> one<00:04:58.190> guy<00:04:58.340> took<00:04:58.400> a<00:04:58.700> lot<00:04:58.940> more

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
the case I bet one guy took a lot more

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.360 
the case I bet one guy took a lot more
money<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.870> other<00:04:59.990> guy<00:05:00.170> kind<00:05:00.740> of<00:05:00.830> less<00:05:01.070> money

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
money the other guy kind of less money

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.160 
money the other guy kind of less money
but<00:05:01.610> either<00:05:02.090> way<00:05:02.330> it's<00:05:02.510> a<00:05:02.570> really<00:05:02.750> crappy
