00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:09.110
 today we will check the bearings 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:11.790
 of piaggio mp3 forks and at the same 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.690
 the first thing to do is to position 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.330
 danger on the central stand e 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.949
 lift lamon train through a 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.619
 pantograph or a click center have 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.109
 raised the important basis and that 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.420
 wheels that even the locking system does 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.820
 is released and therefore there is the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.850
 possibility to move everything freely 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.960
 the territory system 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:44.360
 done this we will check the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.360
 perfect flow of the mother a 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:52.469
 we should feel especially in the part 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.129
 central and therefore with straight wheels if there 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.989
 these are steps to a fort of 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.989
 Latin practically in the central area 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.700
 for safety to have even more 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.880
 sensitivity we could repeat that 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.740
 handlebar control grabbed on a 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.409
 barbell and operating a lot 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.130
 gently we shouldn't feel 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.700
 some stumbling as before 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.720
 appointments are perfectly present 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.439
 also on the handlebar 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.689
 that said 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.119
 we'll see if the bearings are both 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.770
 named or ruined only one 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.770
 we will disassemble this panel 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:59.439
 this bolt will take this away from you 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.330
 bolt and then remove the 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.479
 command precept we should do 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.330
 attention to correct positioning ed 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:13.900
 It is generally a good thickness 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:19.540
 mounted on the inside and are 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:22.950
 generally two for a total thickness 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.950
 about a millimeter 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:32.760
 the second bounced carats to this 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.670
 point having released a fork 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.430
 we could hear again if you of 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.500
 pointing and present in the specific the 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.209
 pointing and present 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.840
 so this rella is definitely 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.840
 ruined 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.670
 another test is to hear 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.100
 if there is a thing even in the absence of 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.299
 impuntamenti in this case is present 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.870
 the game will also pass to the other 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.870
 cascella 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:31.110
 also in this case we will try to 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:33.720
 dismantling this we have now found 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.720
 an external base, both pink 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.590
 because they are external this represents 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.280
 a small anomaly will eventually occur 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.690
 rechecked the axle alignment 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:53.450
 this fork also presents 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:53.450
 impuntamenti is a game 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:02.770
 this vehicle to go 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.630
 replaced if they have not been found 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:10.180
 teething or play you can proceed 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.180
 inversely to reassembly 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.990
 being careful to reassemble the 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.410
 any payments as they were 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.410
 found 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:59.670
 at this point it will be enough of 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:06:01.530
 lower the vehicle and if we have 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.930
 found a scroll to adjust 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.500
 the vehicle is ready to move 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.500
 to remain
