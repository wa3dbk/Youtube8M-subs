00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 he asks me to happen ultrà is something that 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.420
 there are guys that today are not all of them 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.630
 boys yesterday both the stadium and 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.540
 flags sing all the poles though 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.090
 go home play cabret session 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.150
 then I tell myself to be chamack at all 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.930
 ultras means going further 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.039
 go further if possible by train vi 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.920
 I explain 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.230
 now there are all these fans of 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.600
 Sunday because for me those under i 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.510
 I was from Sunday going all 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.719
 transfer the cars stop at 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.200
 eat in the store even the kids who 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.149
 for me another discovery worthy that more 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.850
 on the train c to me I really like the most 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.070
 train because then I then smashed the train 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.399
 instead it breaks your machina ea 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.090
 your car instead we'll break out and wait 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.410
 a sky and it damages no bands to 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.690
 train that is not yours 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.699
 then if I had a train maybe 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.100
 analogous but china but I like it instead 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.799
 anna the train descends from various train 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.030
 at the stadium and I like like guards on the 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.939
 train I like the train because it is a 6 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.110
 man from jokic to playstation 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.189
 yes we are smashing the train as i 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.320
 English ultras from mbolhì 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.850
 they have it then we think it is not 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.939
 just have the drums 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.820
 but no because we for you in and give the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.280
 Brits and likes to let loose and for the 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.920
 for example because but it is our thing and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.920
 there is one thing of our own that is hostile 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.470
 ultras there is one thing of racism neither 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.479
 that head of this negro and therefore sena 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.579
 monkey then go something more de 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.110
 goliardia has understood is one thing 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.780
 goliardic and we like negroes when 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.770
 they play football because I see them 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.140
 nothing bad then that is that you want 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.680
 exploit if you want 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.229
 put ourselves in the media grinder is for 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.310
 why we are anti this is why 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.650
 what my name is 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:17.190
 ultras we seek besides politics of 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.430
 entry stages but in my opinion there is meanwhile 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.860
 a big exploitation of this 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.400
 because why the politics inside them 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.980
 stadiums 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.390
 yes there is once the politics is 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.920
 coming to dust is bent by us 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.130
 however it came only once therefore to 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.519
 thrive stage politics from time to time 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.160
 ceases dinners that are always there 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.470
 then it is that all and all policies say 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.080
 today I come red today I come that is of 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.810
 musahi no then all good and the 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.940
 the next day he slams the monster first 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:56.930
 page to instrumental area of ​​cabbages of 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:01.530
 guy states our ultras mentality 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:05.130
 that is, we like to show our brother 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.590
 that what I have been nothing before 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.450
 I was also asked why he knew 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.940
 have my say on the ultras world 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.670
 I too like my brother 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.440
 years of states or behind and how 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.700
 see we have more or less the same 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.709
 style in scotland england but not for 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.220
 leave ours moved or yes 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:30.030
 inspire shards in england 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:34.079
 we distinguish ourselves we understand it 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:37.370
 style an ultras of lost distinction 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:40.799
 gavira was invented by the ultras 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.380
 Egyptians who then brought it on 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.660
 train took her on the train 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.880
 Egyptians but those were the ones I 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.650
 of chelsea 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.160
 what is our goal then 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.410
 the target 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.340
 we set ourselves no goals because we 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.069
 we are ultras 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.799
 we have over beyond goals therefore 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.840
 present if if cesta they see from overrides 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.880
 the glass wall that separates two 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.850
 salt fields we climb over because from 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.000
 many obstacles no if a guardian ceases 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:12.690
 ceri not hungry or is he and just montura 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.140
 because if many understood me those who do not 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.239
 I understand your tone 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.549
 of votes from Sunday those who make you 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.620
 to their team that they feel part of 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.700
 a whole only on Sundays 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.010
 we live the team daily 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:30.280
 weekly monthly annually 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:34.300
 more and uncertain molecules of muriel started 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:38.230
 yo yo la by voltage and certain tv 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:41.680

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.250
