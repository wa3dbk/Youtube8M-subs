USB<00:03:05.329> I<00:03:05.780> think<00:03:06.200> this<00:03:06.320> is<00:03:06.470> just<00:03:06.620> part<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:06.950> plug

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
USB I think this is just part the plug

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.970 
USB I think this is just part the plug
socket<00:03:07.519> you<00:03:07.700> just<00:03:07.910> fit<00:03:08.030> together<00:03:08.329> with<00:03:08.540> a<00:03:08.570> USB

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
socket you just fit together with a USB

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.740 
socket you just fit together with a USB
cable<00:03:09.980> there<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.549> then<00:03:10.640> attach<00:03:10.940> this<00:03:11.480> pin

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
cable there and then attach this pin

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.990 
cable there and then attach this pin
plug<00:03:12.170> there<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:14.030> that's<00:03:14.209> what<00:03:14.359> we've<00:03:14.510> got

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
plug there so that's what we've got

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.370 
plug there so that's what we've got
these<00:03:17.000> easy<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:17.420> take<00:03:17.660> out<00:03:17.870> all<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.320> old

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
these easy to take out all the old

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.960 
these easy to take out all the old
sealed<00:03:19.209> okay<00:03:20.209> at<00:03:20.810> least<00:03:20.989> I'm<00:03:21.260> doing<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.680> half

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
sealed okay at least I'm doing the half

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.330 
sealed okay at least I'm doing the half
and<00:03:22.970> then<00:03:23.060> here<00:03:23.299> we<00:03:23.329> have<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.870> g2<00:03:24.709> touch<00:03:25.010> let's

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
and then here we have the g2 touch let's

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.870 
and then here we have the g2 touch let's
have<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.519> quick<00:03:25.790> look<00:03:26.920> move<00:03:27.920> very<00:03:28.280> carefully

compared to samsung i8910 HD this is the

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.100 
compared to samsung i8910 HD this is the
samsung<00:04:39.160> going<00:04:39.400> 89<00:04:39.970> HDS<00:04:40.450> obviously<00:04:40.870> one<00:04:41.080> of

samsung going 89 HDS obviously one of

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
touchscreen handsets that I'd be playing

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.140 
around without moment 3.7 inch LED
screen<00:04:51.100> so<00:04:51.430> it's<00:04:51.580> obviously<00:04:51.820> one<00:04:52.030> of<00:04:52.060> the

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
screen so it's obviously one of the

screen so it's obviously one of the
larger<00:04:52.510> ones<00:04:52.660> is<00:04:52.870> even<00:04:53.110> fine<00:04:54.060> but<00:04:55.060> that

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
larger ones is even fine but that

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.240 
larger ones is even fine but that
compares<00:04:55.600> to<00:04:57.270> you<00:04:58.270> know<00:04:58.419> the<00:04:59.039> gt's<00:05:00.039> you<00:05:00.130> can

compares to you know the gt's you can

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.790 
compares to you know the gt's you can
tell<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:00.550> size<00:05:00.760> there<00:05:01.120> it's<00:05:01.500> it's<00:05:02.500> obviously

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
tell the size there it's it's obviously

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.950 
tell the size there it's it's obviously
a<00:05:03.100> bit<00:05:03.370> smaller<00:05:03.700> not<00:05:04.419> too<00:05:04.539> much<00:05:04.660> difference

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
a bit smaller not too much difference

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.920 
a bit smaller not too much difference
I've<00:05:05.080> got<00:05:05.229> a<00:05:05.260> case<00:05:05.470> on<00:05:05.620> the<00:05:05.740> i8910<00:05:06.490> so<00:05:07.060> you<00:05:07.840> know

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
I've got a case on the i8910 so you know

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.379 
I've got a case on the i8910 so you know
that's<00:05:08.110> different<00:05:08.860> that<00:05:08.890> we<00:05:09.070> have<00:05:09.190> there<00:05:09.490> you

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
that's different that we have there you

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:11.670 
that's different that we have there you
can<00:05:10.510> have<00:05:10.630> a<00:05:10.690> look<00:05:10.720> at<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:11.169> you<00:05:11.560> know

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
can have a look at the you know

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.900 
can have a look at the you know
thickness<00:05:12.190> is<00:05:12.340> obviously<00:05:12.610> a<00:05:12.700> slightly

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
thickness is obviously a slightly

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.110 
thickness is obviously a slightly
different<00:05:13.150> situation<00:05:14.729> it's<00:05:15.729> probably<00:05:15.910> very

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
different situation it's probably very

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.210 
different situation it's probably very
similar<00:05:16.300> thing<00:05:16.750> i<00:05:16.900> 8910<00:05:17.380> is<00:05:17.680> slightly<00:05:17.919> thinner

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
similar thing i 8910 is slightly thinner

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.129 
similar thing i 8910 is slightly thinner
as<00:05:18.760> i<00:05:18.940> said<00:05:19.090> i've<00:05:19.240> got<00:05:19.419> a<00:05:19.450> case<00:05:19.630> there<00:05:19.900> in

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
as i said i've got a case there in

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.870 
as i said i've got a case there in
probably<00:05:20.350> tell<00:05:20.680> that<00:05:22.139> the<00:05:23.139> g2<00:05:23.740> touch<00:05:23.979> or<00:05:24.280> HTC

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
probably tell that the g2 touch or HTC

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.200 
probably tell that the g2 touch or HTC
hero<00:05:25.380> is<00:05:26.380> still<00:05:27.100> you<00:05:27.430> know<00:05:27.520> probably<00:05:27.760> just

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
hero is still you know probably just

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.930 
hero is still you know probably just
like<00:05:28.389> thicker<00:05:28.750> as<00:05:28.990> well<00:05:29.169> so<00:05:30.160> there<00:05:30.550> you<00:05:30.639> go<00:05:30.700> so
