00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:04.626
 You need to replace a cartridge in your HP printer. 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.729
 I suggest you follow the procedure together. 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.009
 Start by turning on the printer first. To do this, press the On / Off button. 

00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:17.617
 Then push the paper into the tray until resistance is encountered. 

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:23.785
 Slide the paper width guide inward until it is against the edge of the paper. 

00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:28.010
 Do not push the guide too far so that it does not bend the paper. 

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.618
 Open the access panel to the cartridges. 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.159
 The carriage is placed in the center of the printer. 

00:00:35.515 --> 00:00:39.907
 Wait for the carriage to stop, then gently press the cartridge to release it. 

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:42.945
 You can then remove the cartridge from the printer. 

00:00:45.892 --> 00:00:48.601
 Take out the new cartridge from its packaging. 

00:00:55.425 --> 00:00:58.650
 Gently pull on the pink tab to remove the plastic ribbon. 

00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:08.837
 When handling cartridges, be careful of electrical contacts and ink nozzles. 

00:01:09.912 --> 00:01:15.099
 Take care not to touch the contacts or the nozzles so as not to cause lumps, 

00:01:15.613 --> 00:01:18.350
 of ink failure or bad contacts. 

00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:22.903
 Be sure to insert the replacement cartridge in the space provided. 

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:24.585
 The 3-color cartridge on the left. 

00:01:24.912 --> 00:01:25.894
 The black cartridge on the right. 

00:01:27.202 --> 00:01:33.592
 Place the new cartridge in the housing provided and press firmly on it until it fits. 

00:01:34.983 --> 00:01:40.076
 Prevent the printer from moving by placing your left hand on the back while inserting the cartridge. 

00:01:40.637 --> 00:01:44.054
 After the cartridges are inserted, close the printer cartridge access door. 

00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:47.413
 An alignment page will print. 

00:01:54.282 --> 00:01:55.310
 Lift the scanner cover. 

00:02:00.497 --> 00:02:04.644
 Place the alignment page in the right front corner of the scanner glass, with the print side facing down. 

00:02:13.488 --> 00:02:14.376
 Fold down the hood. 

00:02:19.314 --> 00:02:21.510
 Press the Scan button to start the alignment 

00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:35.483
 Once successful, you can recycle the alignment page. 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.501
 Once all the steps are complete, your printer is ready for use.
