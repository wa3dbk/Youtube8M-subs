00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
kind of like how they did that but at

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.750 
kind of like how they did that but at
the<00:06:04.030> same<00:06:04.210> time<00:06:04.390> I<00:06:04.830> don't<00:06:05.830> like<00:06:05.950> it<00:06:06.160> because<00:06:06.280> my

lights<00:06:06.940> because<00:06:07.090> it's<00:06:07.300> resourceful<00:06:07.990> like<00:06:08.230> you

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
lights because it's resourceful like you

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.840 
lights because it's resourceful like you
know<00:06:08.500> they<00:06:08.620> know<00:06:08.710> how<00:06:08.830> to<00:06:08.860> reuse<00:06:09.160> parts<00:06:09.610> but

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
know they know how to reuse parts but

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.990 
know they know how to reuse parts but
then<00:06:10.000> um<00:06:10.770> I<00:06:11.770> don't<00:06:12.130> like<00:06:12.250> it<00:06:12.400> because<00:06:12.550> it<00:06:12.790> kind

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
then um I don't like it because it kind

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.450 
then um I don't like it because it kind
of<00:06:13.030> like<00:06:13.350> it's<00:06:14.350> like<00:06:14.470> I<00:06:14.590> know<00:06:14.650> those<00:06:15.190> are<00:06:15.370> the

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
of like it's like I know those are the

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.210 
of like it's like I know those are the
older<00:06:15.700> models<00:06:15.880> and<00:06:16.210> don't<00:06:16.540> have<00:06:16.690> a<00:06:17.100> don't<00:06:18.100> have

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
older models and don't have a don't have

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.710 
older models and don't have a don't have
was<00:06:18.340> good<00:06:18.520> at<00:06:18.610> articulating<00:06:18.790> as<00:06:19.240> a<00:06:19.270> new<00:06:19.419> ones

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
was good at articulating as a new ones

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.280 
was good at articulating as a new ones
and<00:06:20.020> adding<00:06:20.830> all<00:06:20.980> this<00:06:21.130> armor<00:06:21.490> only<00:06:21.850> on

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
and adding all this armor only on

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:26.100 
and adding all this armor only on
hinders<00:06:23.290> that<00:06:23.470> articulation<00:06:24.900> this<00:06:25.900> is<00:06:26.020> a

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
hinders that articulation this is a

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.570 
hinders that articulation this is a
great<00:06:26.290> articulation<00:06:26.560> but<00:06:27.010> I<00:06:27.039> think<00:06:27.310> it<00:06:27.430> could

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
great articulation but I think it could

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.130 
great articulation but I think it could
have<00:06:27.669> been<00:06:27.760> better<00:06:28.000> if<00:06:28.120> they<00:06:28.419> use<00:06:28.600> like<00:06:28.870> if

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
have been better if they use like if

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.159 
have been better if they use like if
they<00:06:29.289> made<00:06:29.470> this<00:06:29.640> I'm<00:06:30.640> an<00:06:30.880> original<00:06:31.360> frame<00:06:31.600> for

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169 
they made this I'm an original frame for

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:32.820 
they made this I'm an original frame for
the<00:06:32.260> solution

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
the solution

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.970 
the solution
oh<00:06:33.690> you<00:06:34.690> can<00:06:34.840> see<00:06:34.990> like<00:06:35.110> those<00:06:35.260> decals<00:06:35.620> over

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
oh you can see like those decals over

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.110 
oh you can see like those decals over
here<00:06:36.190> and<00:06:36.550> what<00:06:36.730> not<00:06:37.800> all<00:06:38.800> in<00:06:39.220> all<00:06:39.370> I<00:06:39.610> really

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
here and what not all in all I really
