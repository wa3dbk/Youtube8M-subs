00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.340

 It takes not a Te poison 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.910

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.670

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.809

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.020

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.260
 It is and relieved 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.430
 Really but one by one 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.480
 Everyone Shinobu for the team 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.500
 I have to do something to do 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:34.150
 Because I thought not win absolute rollover fee 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.010
 I already have a printer 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.390
 Famous but last intention 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.409
 Yellow action 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.409
 I will do it last 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.460

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.460
 Thank you 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.590
 Open-air tea is Sam to regular team 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.830
 The team to say is hollow o 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.100
 I want to show you 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.180
 In a good sense 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.330
 Have 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:08.390
 Or say that the ride to the tone in the team 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:12.300
 Because it flows from the sky to the child Tteyuu Ageteko Uzes 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.330
 After all I wanted to practice today and today, though 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.160
 Well after all really 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.680
 And each other to do smash 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.650
 I can play and practice 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.650
 Everyone's feeling that I will never lose 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.000
 I think that comes with from the state of play practice out in front 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.560
 Hmm 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.830
 Already 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.110
 It is provided by this far away 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:42.560
 There was Leica and I thought by myself 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:43.790
 Well decided by the customer early and the team then the situation of the team is really bad 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.209
 Feel at 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.209
 The team is getting better and better every season 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.720
 It is against something that is not so pessimistic 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.860
 Just to have credit with another Martin name 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.160
 Because we have been doing all performance 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.420
 I'm waiting 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.870
 Say Well honest and more carp 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.900
 I want to do what I can do on the left 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.319
 Something Ma'at calligraphy also Deke that Las handle 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.319
 A little longer 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:21.110
 Do you say want to hope 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.410
 If you don't want to do it, you don't want to do it there 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.570
 But I want to play a match 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.570
 Amazing that I can do this on a place called now Yabaa 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.130
 Do you Ja amazing 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.780
 Anymore joists 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:39.220
 Because even chubby is hanging 3 Origin will continue to do 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.569
 Well just show it off 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.450
 Losing continues throughout the season 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:49.709
 Say Well usually do if you lose is followed by 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.980
 Though I think that it is a bad part and the morale of hm can also be connected 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.260
 Not at all 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:04:02.260
 I lost but there are lots of good plays 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:07.989
 Even if it mortifying collectively for each Shah overlaid with've been getting better every time after work decided 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:12.459
 Well true also Toka last game to say that Serve committed to the one company normally everyone outside 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:18.420
 It's a lie that I said there was no pressure I thought I did, but I feel another pressure 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:19.670
 But I'm not good enough if you 're a horse and you 're all alone 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.270
 towel 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:29.200
 I think it and the results will follow and was 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:32.860
 I will not play next season again and that is a form as a regular team 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.880
 I always won by What's 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.880
 I think as a catcher
