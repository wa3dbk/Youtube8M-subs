00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
this game the only person who did like

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.040 
this game the only person who did like
substantially<00:04:31.160> well<00:04:31.340> was<00:04:31.610> me<00:04:31.850> like<00:04:32.660> as<00:04:32.840> in<00:04:32.870> a

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
substantially well was me like as in a

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.830 
substantially well was me like as in a
high<00:04:33.230> scoring<00:04:33.590> game<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:35.360> that's<00:04:35.479> purely

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
high scoring game and that's purely

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.450 
high scoring game and that's purely
because<00:04:36.050> it's<00:04:36.440> just<00:04:36.500> not<00:04:36.740> enough<00:04:36.889> kills<00:04:37.160> to<00:04:37.340> go

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
because it's just not enough kills to go

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.030 
because it's just not enough kills to go
around<00:04:37.729> and<00:04:37.940> I<00:04:38.000> was<00:04:38.180> fortunate<00:04:38.870> of<00:04:39.260> fortunate

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
enough to get mostly kills and I do pick

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.290 
enough to get mostly kills and I do pick
up<00:04:42.919> about<00:04:43.040> three<00:04:43.460> ballistic<00:04:43.940> vests<00:04:44.060> in<00:04:44.090> this

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
up about three ballistic vests in this

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.020 
up about three ballistic vests in this
game<00:04:44.570> and<00:04:44.810> they<00:04:45.410> saved<00:04:45.949> my<00:04:46.100> life<00:04:46.250> probably

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
game and they saved my life probably

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.270

twice<00:04:47.510> where<00:04:48.169> I<00:04:48.199> was<00:04:48.290> one<00:04:48.560> bullet<00:04:48.800> of<00:04:48.949> death

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
twice where I was one bullet of death

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.280 
twice where I was one bullet of death
and<00:04:49.639> they<00:04:50.600> can<00:04:50.750> really<00:04:50.990> come<00:04:51.139> in<00:04:51.169> handy

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290

those<00:04:53.449> two<00:04:53.690> guys<00:04:53.930> running<00:04:54.229> the<00:04:54.470> ballistic

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
those two guys running the ballistic

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.560 
those two guys running the ballistic
vest<00:04:55.070> they<00:04:55.280> can<00:04:55.430> use<00:04:55.580> them<00:04:55.760> the<00:04:55.850> self<00:04:56.120> that<00:04:56.240> can

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
vest they can use them the self that can

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.629 
vest they can use them the self that can
send<00:04:57.260> them<00:04:57.410> out<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:57.710> your<00:04:57.830> teammates<00:04:58.340> make

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
send them out to your teammates make

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.550 
send them out to your teammates make
sure<00:04:58.880> the<00:04:59.000> dirt<00:04:59.180> down<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.660> street<00:05:00.110> so<00:05:00.380> you<00:05:00.440> can

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
sure the dirt down the street so you can

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.610 
sure the dirt down the street so you can
get<00:05:00.680> more<00:05:00.740> streaks<00:05:01.280> in<00:05:01.639> and<00:05:02.500> they're<00:05:03.500> just

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
get more streaks in and they're just

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.560 
get more streaks in and they're just
probably<00:05:04.100> one<00:05:04.490> of<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.700> best<00:05:04.880> kill<00:05:05.090> streaks<00:05:05.419> in

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
probably one of the best kill streaks in

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.570 
probably one of the best kill streaks in
the<00:05:05.660> game<00:05:05.840> and<00:05:06.200> one<00:05:06.889> of<00:05:07.010> the<00:05:07.100> less<00:05:07.250> annoying

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
the game and one of the less annoying

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.850 
the game and one of the less annoying
ones<00:05:07.970> to<00:05:08.300> to<00:05:08.660> play<00:05:08.870> against<00:05:09.260> as<00:05:09.410> well<00:05:09.590> because

ones to to play against as well because

ones to to play against as well because
if<00:05:10.010> people<00:05:10.370> on<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.669> enemy<00:05:10.760> team<00:05:10.940> I<00:05:11.180> using

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
if people on the enemy team I using

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.120 
if people on the enemy team I using
ballistic<00:05:11.630> vests<00:05:12.020> as<00:05:12.260> long<00:05:12.860> as<00:05:12.889> you're

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
ballistic vests as long as you're

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.730 
ballistic vests as long as you're
flanking<00:05:13.729> them<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:14.180> taking<00:05:14.810> them<00:05:15.020> on<00:05:15.200> so<00:05:15.680> you

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
flanking them and taking them on so you

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.020 
flanking them and taking them on so you
have<00:05:16.100> the<00:05:16.220> advantage<00:05:16.370> you're<00:05:16.790> probably

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
have the advantage you're probably

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.340 
have the advantage you're probably
always<00:05:17.360> gonna<00:05:17.660> kill<00:05:17.930> them<00:05:18.080> they're<00:05:18.229> not

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
always gonna kill them they're not

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.260 
always gonna kill them they're not
really<00:05:18.530> gonna<00:05:18.770> take<00:05:19.460> you<00:05:19.639> out<00:05:19.789> but<00:05:20.000> if<00:05:20.120> you<00:05:20.240> are

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
really gonna take you out but if you are

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.270 
really gonna take you out but if you are

head-on head situation and they are

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.779 
head-on head situation and they are
using<00:05:24.110> it's<00:05:24.889> like<00:05:25.310> a<00:05:25.510> balance<00:05:26.510> to<00:05:27.169> the<00:05:28.070> cap<00:05:28.639> and

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
using it's like a balance to the cap and

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:29.890 
using it's like a balance to the cap and
get<00:05:28.880> my<00:05:28.970> words<00:05:29.120> out<00:05:29.240> properly<00:05:29.510> if<00:05:29.600> they<00:05:29.750> are

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
get my words out properly if they are

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.810 
get my words out properly if they are
using<00:05:30.139> like<00:05:30.889> a<00:05:30.919> sous<00:05:31.160> machine<00:05:31.190> and<00:05:31.700> you're

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
using like a sous machine and you're

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.760 
using like a sous machine and you're
using<00:05:32.000> a<00:05:32.180> submachine<00:05:32.630> gun<00:05:32.840> you<00:05:33.080> there

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
using a submachine gun you there

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:34.990 
using a submachine gun you there
probably<00:05:34.100> go<00:05:34.220> they're<00:05:34.610> going<00:05:34.729> to<00:05:34.789> have<00:05:34.880> the

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
probably go they're going to have the

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.640 
probably go they're going to have the
advantage<00:05:35.360> over<00:05:35.450> you<00:05:35.720> if<00:05:36.110> you're<00:05:36.260> taking<00:05:36.350> them

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
advantage over you if you're taking them

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.570 
advantage over you if you're taking them
on<00:05:36.710> head-on<00:05:37.750> so<00:05:38.750> you<00:05:39.410> gotta<00:05:39.860> try<00:05:40.100> and<00:05:40.130> not<00:05:40.400> do

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
on head-on so you gotta try and not do

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.960 
ballistic vest still try and flank
around<00:05:45.200> because<00:05:45.710> even<00:05:46.400> though<00:05:46.490> you<00:05:46.580> can<00:05:46.789> say

that one to two bullet extra damage it's

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.700 
that one to two bullet extra damage it's
still<00:05:50.389> best<00:05:50.630> not<00:05:50.870> to<00:05:50.960> tape<00:05:51.139> you<00:05:51.289> played<00:05:51.560> on

still best not to tape you played on
just<00:05:52.010> because<00:05:52.400> you<00:05:52.910> might<00:05:53.090> get<00:05:53.240> a<00:05:53.300> live<00:05:53.479> com

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
just because you might get a live com

she might miss a couple bullets and you

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.670 
she might miss a couple bullets and you
might<00:05:56.210> end<00:05:56.360> up<00:05:56.479> getting<00:05:56.780> screwed<00:05:57.050> over<00:05:57.169> anyway
