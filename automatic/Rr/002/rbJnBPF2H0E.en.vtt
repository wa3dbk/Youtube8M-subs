00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
electric you can see the baseboard there

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.789 
electric you can see the baseboard there
that's<00:01:29.159> water<00:01:29.610> heat<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> water<00:01:31.229> radiator

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
that's water heat so the water radiator

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.770 
that's water heat so the water radiator
runs<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.310> full<00:01:32.579> length<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.270> line<00:01:33.570> that's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
runs the full length of this line that's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.960 
runs the full length of this line that's
on<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.140> floor<00:01:34.460> of<00:01:35.460> course<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
on the floor of course you can see the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.490

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
through the wall air conditioner now

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.109 
through the wall air conditioner now
that's<00:01:37.710> electrical<00:01:38.310> right<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.880> would<00:01:39.000> be

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
that's electrical right so that would be

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.020 
that's electrical right so that would be
