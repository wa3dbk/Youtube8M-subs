of my favorites a really soft buttery

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.840 
of my favorites a really soft buttery
add<00:00:54.660> cheese<00:00:55.050> we've<00:00:55.620> got<00:00:55.829> double<00:00:56.100> cream<00:00:56.489> brie

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
add cheese we've got double cream brie

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.319 
add cheese we've got double cream brie
here<00:00:57.300> which<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> higher<00:00:58.920> ratio<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.879> cream<00:01:00.300> to

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
here which is a higher ratio of cream to

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.900 
here which is a higher ratio of cream to
milk<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.170> that's<00:01:01.350> why<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:01.770> even<00:01:02.100> softer<00:01:02.730> and

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
milk so that's why it's even softer and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.520 
milk so that's why it's even softer and
if<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.270> want<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> go<00:01:03.660> even<00:01:03.870> more<00:01:04.019> indulgent
