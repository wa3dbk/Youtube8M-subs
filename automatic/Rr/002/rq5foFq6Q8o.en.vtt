as<00:02:51.880> your<00:02:52.030> weakest<00:02:52.840> players<00:02:53.200> out<00:02:53.380> there<00:02:53.410> you're

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
as your weakest players out there you're

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.230 
as your weakest players out there you're
only<00:02:53.740> as<00:02:53.920> good<00:02:54.100> as<00:02:54.160> you<00:02:54.700> know<00:02:54.820> your<00:02:55.030> depth

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
only as good as you know your depth

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.060 
only as good as you know your depth
chart<00:02:55.480> goes<00:02:55.660> so<00:02:55.960> the<00:02:56.380> stronger<00:02:56.710> we<00:02:56.830> are<00:02:56.860> in

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
chart goes so the stronger we are in

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.710 
chart goes so the stronger we are in
depth<00:02:57.280> that's<00:02:57.490> going<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.700> make<00:02:57.790> us<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.090> better

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
depth that's going to make us the better

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.900 
depth that's going to make us the better
