00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.840 
anything is better than nothing I think
the<00:02:05.200> very<00:02:05.679> best<00:02:06.039> thing<00:02:06.340> is<00:02:06.520> when<00:02:06.700> the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
the very best thing is when the

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.240 
the very best thing is when the
footballers<00:02:07.360> themselves<00:02:07.990> stand<00:02:08.740> up<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.160> make

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
footballers themselves stand up and make

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.430 
footballers themselves stand up and make
statements<00:02:09.940> say<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.660> public<00:02:11.080> it's<00:02:11.290> not

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
statements say to the public it's not

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.559 
statements say to the public it's not
accept<00:02:11.770> so<00:02:11.920> do<00:02:12.069> you<00:02:12.190> think<00:02:12.250> England<00:02:12.910> are<00:02:13.180> a

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
accept so do you think England are a

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.990 
accept so do you think England are a
main<00:02:13.810> leader<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.349> stopping<00:02:14.920> racism<00:02:15.400> in<00:02:15.880> the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
main leader of stopping racism in the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000 
main leader of stopping racism in the
world<00:02:16.180> yeah<00:02:16.660> I<00:02:16.930> think<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:17.560> it's<00:02:17.680> good<00:02:17.890> that

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
world yeah I think that it's good that

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.309 
world yeah I think that it's good that
we<00:02:18.099> can<00:02:18.250> be<00:02:18.400> leaders<00:02:18.910> in<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.540> front<00:02:19.959> because

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
we can be leaders in that front because

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.160 
we can be leaders in that front because
if<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:20.860> look<00:02:20.980> at<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.130> Premier<00:02:21.459> League<00:02:21.520> and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
if you look at the Premier League and

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.260 
if you look at the Premier League and
some<00:02:23.170> multinational<00:02:23.709> late<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.730> one<00:02:25.120> the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
some multinational late is one the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.699 
some multinational late is one the
supported<00:02:25.720> or<00:02:25.810> around<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.110> world<00:02:26.349> so<00:02:26.590> it

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
supported or around the world so it

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.230 
supported or around the world so it
needs<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:26.980> be<00:02:27.099> something<00:02:27.250> pneus<00:02:27.610> on<00:02:27.819> the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
needs to be something pneus on the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.449 
needs to be something pneus on the
priorities<00:02:28.690> yeah<00:02:29.700> i<00:02:30.700> was<00:02:31.240> playing<00:02:32.190> spain<00:02:33.190> and

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
priorities yeah i was playing spain and

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.440 
priorities yeah i was playing spain and
everything<00:02:34.150> tries<00:02:34.930> as<00:02:35.170> well<00:02:35.410> i<00:02:35.910> can<00:02:36.910> see<00:02:37.120> we

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
everything tries as well i can see we

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.870 
everything tries as well i can see we

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
Premier League and that's the good thing

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.130 
Premier League and that's the good thing
and<00:03:22.670> we're<00:03:23.180> all<00:03:23.300> one<00:03:23.570> and<00:03:23.720> we're<00:03:23.810> all<00:03:23.959> together

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
and we're all one and we're all together

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.830 
and we're all one and we're all together
so<00:03:24.560> um<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:25.880> know<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.150> that's<00:03:26.300> how<00:03:26.450> long<00:03:26.690> may

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
so um you know and that's how long may

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.670 
so um you know and that's how long may
that<00:03:26.870> continue<00:03:27.080> really<00:03:29.110> racism<00:03:30.110> seems<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:30.560> be

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
that continue really racism seems to be

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.530 
that continue really racism seems to be
an<00:03:30.770> obstacle<00:03:30.980> that<00:03:31.489> is<00:03:31.610> incredibly<00:03:32.270> difficult

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
an obstacle that is incredibly difficult

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.690 
an obstacle that is incredibly difficult
to<00:03:32.840> get<00:03:33.050> over<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:33.890> you<00:03:33.980> want<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:34.310> know<00:03:34.459> why<00:03:34.640> this

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
to get over so you want to know why this

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.960 
to get over so you want to know why this
is<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.120> case<00:03:35.980> it's<00:03:36.980> not<00:03:37.190> their<00:03:37.400> parents<00:03:37.850> are

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
is the case it's not their parents are

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.470 
is the case it's not their parents are
racist<00:03:38.360> so<00:03:38.630> they<00:03:39.010> their<00:03:40.010> parents<00:03:40.580> influence

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
racist so they their parents influence

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.360 
racist so they their parents influence
their<00:03:41.870> kids<00:03:42.110> and<00:03:42.320> their<00:03:42.410> kids<00:03:42.530> see<00:03:42.980> that<00:03:43.190> and

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
their kids and their kids see that and

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.949 
their kids and their kids see that and
then<00:03:43.459> it<00:03:43.610> it<00:03:44.060> grows<00:03:44.209> with<00:03:44.540> them<00:03:44.720> and<00:03:44.870> their

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
then it it grows with them and their

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.240 
then it it grows with them and their
neighbor<00:03:45.170> common<00:03:45.530> races<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:46.010> then<00:03:46.100> their

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
neighbor common races and then their

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.060 
neighbor common races and then their
kids<00:03:46.489> here<00:03:46.700> so<00:03:47.450> it<00:03:47.959> depends<00:03:48.500> on<00:03:48.680> their

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
kids here so it depends on their

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.190 
kids here so it depends on their
upbringing<00:03:49.300> syc<00:03:50.300> of<00:03:50.420> that<00:03:50.600> do<00:03:50.900> you<00:03:50.989> think

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
upbringing syc of that do you think

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.100 
upbringing syc of that do you think
clubs<00:03:51.410> could<00:03:51.650> do<00:03:51.799> more<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.070> prevent<00:03:52.430> racism<00:03:53.180> um

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
clubs could do more to prevent racism um

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.220 
clubs could do more to prevent racism um
I<00:03:54.610> think<00:03:55.610> every<00:03:55.790> clubs<00:03:56.060> doing<00:03:56.420> as<00:03:56.690> much<00:03:56.959> as<00:03:57.110> it

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
I think every clubs doing as much as it
