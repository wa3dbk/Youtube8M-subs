00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.259
 good guys let's finish the videos 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.929
 of today's news talking about the apple 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.820
 watch 2 because we have news about 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.620
 the little apple watch that we can put 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.139
 your turn recently we have already met 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.869
 which apple is developing the sdk 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.180
 for apple whats that will be presented in the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.460
 wwdc of 2015 and good now the rumors 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.429
 try to say create expectation of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.820
 face to a possible the second model that 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.250
 we would see in 2016 called apple watch 2 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.390
 what main novelties we could see 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.219
 in this role there is one thing that is not 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.780
 novelty that rumors of 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.129
 a device that has not yet come out 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.129
 well original in the first 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.730
 well then one of the main 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.649
 What seems to be that it can bring 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.989
 the new version of the web watch would be 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.600
 a camera a camera in addition to the one 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.660
 you can do face time in this 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.370
 in this new 2.0 watch to see is a 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.020
 thing that you have to take confidence I 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.329
 always thinking that really you are going to 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.339
 take a picture 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.860
 no but it will end it seems it would be 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.200
 to be able to do freestyle facetime 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.490
 therefore good about anger and talking 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.110
 that they are seeing your face is not what 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:21.160
 same as doing so 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:21.160
 I give you the photos and greetings 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.350
 another of the new developments is also 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.250
 that seems to bring more 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.289
 independent and independent with 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.210
 regarding the iphone but eye says it is 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.630
 what it allows is good to carry a chip 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.310
 wifi seems to be what they say so if you say 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.259
 than to allow to use functions of 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.539
 network without having an iPhone 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.479
 see is what Fernando would comment 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.159
 I do not see because with much without wifi that 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.939
 carry or be independent for me 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.939
 independence 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.030
 is that you leave with the eye to run 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.830
 out there and you here are watching your 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.530
 messages seeing the way is a card 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.990
 it's exactly a card without a chip 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.010
 wifi the only thing that does is that 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.660
 basically the bluetooth coking 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.390
 you are going to be in the same network 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.940
 creations of you learn from something that a 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.500
 Wi-Fi network is relatively small 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.500
 then independence 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.989
 then what we do not know and stay as 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.060
 better models with a 5 with like that not 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.620
 it is necessary that you have a model for 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.030
 talk about phones on a card 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.890
 talk phone without a data card 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.810
 they're just going to fit in so 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.180
 that time so they say a function and 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.129
 it's called jaime watch that's important 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.060
 if it also seems that they are going to 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:39.409
 introduce that you can be fine but 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.150
 a little bit is bad we also bring this 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.220
 day if the battery is a pretty point 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.290
 strong according to second some 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.280
 leaks so that the battery of 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.980
 pivots for 30 or 40 and 45 for 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.670
 one hundred plus 40 30 40 more forgiveness than 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.670
 original 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.480
 and then because apart from that turn 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.400
 to get better 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:09.850
 the consumption 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.850
 the new 2000 objectives 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.690
 glory 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:30.030
 fernando dismisses the video good boy 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:33.590
 for nothing today to protect and is that I have 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.880
 collected picked up from the east 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.130
 collected from there are people who say that 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.750
 good that says fernando leave a little 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.750
 more to fernando upside down 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.440
 this is making me an authentic 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.720
 sergio so nothing you guys already know 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.610

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.500
