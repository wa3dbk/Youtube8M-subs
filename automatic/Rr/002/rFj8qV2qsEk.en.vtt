with<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> game<00:00:40.700> actually<00:00:41.700> staying<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
with the game actually staying in the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.360 
with the game actually staying in the
slot<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.230> did<00:00:43.710> some<00:00:43.860> research

he said the spring would be broken

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.430 
he said the spring would be broken
missing<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:48.329> it's<00:00:48.510> really<00:00:48.780> hard<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.140> can't

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
missing and it's really hard I can't

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
missing and it's really hard I can't
really<00:00:49.710> get<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.039> there<00:00:50.239> I<00:00:51.239> would<00:00:51.600> love<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.460> but

little tab right here all I did was lift

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.180 
little tab right here all I did was lift
it<00:02:14.230> up<00:02:14.319> just<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.650> bit<00:02:14.769> it<00:02:15.069> was<00:02:15.190> in<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.400> way<00:02:15.750> of

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
it up just a bit it was in the way of

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.220 
it up just a bit it was in the way of
that<00:02:18.190> mechanism<00:02:18.459> inside<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.810> we<00:02:19.900> talked

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
that mechanism inside that we talked

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.750 
that mechanism inside that we talked
about<00:02:20.349> earlier<00:02:20.709> that<00:02:20.739> little<00:02:21.220> tab<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.549> was<00:02:21.670> in

the<00:02:21.819> way<00:02:21.970> blocking<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.019> enabling<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.739> game<00:02:23.920> to

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
the way blocking it enabling the game to

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.280 
the way blocking it enabling the game to
actually<00:02:24.310> fully<00:02:24.700> go<00:02:24.879> down<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.239> click<00:02:25.390> all<00:02:26.230> I
