obviously going forward is important
it's<00:00:26.650> almost<00:00:26.860> setting<00:00:27.369> the<00:00:27.490> tone<00:00:27.900> against<00:00:28.900> the

it's almost setting the tone against the
opposition<00:00:29.230> trying<00:00:29.770> to<00:00:29.860> tell<00:00:30.340> them<00:00:30.520> you<00:00:30.759> know

opposition trying to tell them you know
send<00:00:31.900> a<00:00:31.990> message<00:00:32.349> then<00:00:32.619> that's<00:00:32.830> not<00:00:33.010> going<00:00:33.160> to

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
send a message then that's not going to

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.810 
send a message then that's not going to
be<00:00:33.280> an<00:00:33.640> easy<00:00:33.790> and<00:00:34.330> easy<00:00:34.570> right<00:00:34.840> for<00:00:35.050> them<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:36.280> I

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
be an easy and easy right for them and I

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.790 
be an easy and easy right for them and I
think<00:00:37.000> it's<00:00:37.150> the<00:00:37.269> same<00:00:37.540> on<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:38.470> offer<00:00:38.590> the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
think it's the same on the offer the

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.990 
think it's the same on the offer the
opposition<00:00:39.250> they<00:00:39.340> probably<00:00:39.550> want<00:00:39.760> to<00:00:39.820> sit

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
opposition they probably want to sit

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.750 
opposition they probably want to sit
down<00:00:40.239> and<00:00:40.510> can<00:00:41.440> demonstrate<00:00:41.800> us<00:00:42.280> then<00:00:42.550> they

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
down and can demonstrate us then they

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.410 
down and can demonstrate us then they
are<00:00:43.000> in<00:00:43.570> the<00:00:43.750> game<00:00:44.400> it's<00:00:45.400> like<00:00:45.580> a<00:00:45.640> prayer<00:00:46.120> like

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420

over pre-war battles you know that first
crime<00:00:49.300> was<00:00:49.420> always<00:00:49.750> important<00:00:50.440> that<00:00:50.920> you<00:00:51.100> have

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
crime was always important that you have

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.939 
crime was always important that you have
stability<00:00:51.629> clean<00:00:52.629> wall<00:00:52.900> and<00:00:53.170> that<00:00:53.710> you<00:00:53.860> go

of<00:01:00.900> weakness<00:01:01.900> in<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.470> scrums<00:01:02.799> as<00:01:03.010> you<00:01:03.190> go<00:01:03.369> in

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
of weakness in the scrums as you go in

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.609 
of weakness in the scrums as you go in
so<00:01:03.790> how<00:01:04.360> much<00:01:04.510> of<00:01:04.570> that<00:01:04.720> is<00:01:04.839> don't<00:01:05.080> experience

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
so how much of that is don't experience

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.969 
so how much of that is don't experience
nor<00:01:06.040> in<00:01:06.159> which<00:01:06.340> weaknesses<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:07.060> exploit<00:01:07.119> we<00:01:07.600> we

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
nor in which weaknesses to exploit we we

nor in which weaknesses to exploit we we
we<00:01:08.979> study<00:01:09.310> them<00:01:09.520> we<00:01:09.880> analyze<00:01:10.540> them<00:01:10.810> so<00:01:11.290> we<00:01:11.440> try

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
we study them we analyze them so we try

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.300 
we study them we analyze them so we try
and<00:01:12.010> find<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:13.450> weak<00:01:13.659> links<00:01:14.110> in<00:01:14.320> each<00:01:15.070> and

and you know things things that people
don't<00:01:19.689> even<00:01:19.960> think<00:01:20.080> about<00:01:20.260> the<00:01:21.040> way<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.700> title

don't even think about the way the title

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.380 
don't even think about the way the title
it<00:01:22.090> sets<00:01:22.360> up<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:23.460> what<00:01:24.460> are<00:01:24.670> legit<00:01:25.000> has<00:01:25.119> to<00:01:25.270> do

it sets up the what are legit has to do

it sets up the what are legit has to do
against<00:01:25.810> in<00:01:25.990> what<00:01:26.859> we<00:01:27.039> have<00:01:27.159> what<00:01:27.429> our

opposition<00:01:30.100> we've<00:01:30.280> said<00:01:30.520> it's<00:01:31.359> a<00:01:31.450> lot<00:01:31.630> more

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
opposition we've said it's a lot more

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.749 
opposition we've said it's a lot more
technical<00:01:32.409> and<00:01:32.590> more<00:01:32.799> complicated<00:01:33.460> than<00:01:33.640> what

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
technical and more complicated than what

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.639 
technical and more complicated than what
people<00:01:33.820> think<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.390> just<00:01:34.630> not<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:34.780> not<00:01:35.350> just<00:01:35.500> a

people think is just not a not just a

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.169 
people think is just not a not just a
pushing<00:01:35.950> contest<00:01:36.670> at<00:01:36.820> said<00:01:37.060> its<00:01:37.689> technical

pushing contest at said its technical

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.770 
pushing contest at said its technical
and<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:41.619> also<00:01:41.799> a<00:01:41.979> pushing<00:01:42.729> contest<00:01:43.119> what'd

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
and it's also a pushing contest what'd

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.499 
and it's also a pushing contest what'd
you<00:01:43.869> just<00:01:43.899> say<00:01:44.200> first<00:01:44.619> from<00:01:44.890> your<00:01:45.369> scrum<00:01:45.729> cross

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
you just say first from your scrum cross

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.989 
you just say first from your scrum cross
from<00:01:46.780> their<00:01:47.530> scrum<00:01:47.920> you<00:01:48.670> talked<00:01:48.909> about

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
from their scrum you talked about

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.660 
from their scrum you talked about
stability<00:01:49.390> for<00:01:50.079> that<00:01:50.560> first<00:01:50.890> one<00:01:51.159> for<00:01:51.429> you<00:01:51.549> to

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
stability for that first one for you to

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.700 
stability for that first one for you to
give<00:01:51.789> yourselves<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.149> good<00:01:52.179> platform<00:01:52.499> but<00:01:53.499> key

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
give yourselves a good platform but key

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.649 
give yourselves a good platform but key
principles<00:01:54.219> when<00:01:54.369> it's<00:01:54.549> their<00:01:54.759> scrum<00:01:55.090> key

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
principles when it's their scrum key

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.330 
principles when it's their scrum key
pursuing<00:01:56.170> these<00:01:56.530> from<00:01:56.890> is<00:01:57.490> to<00:01:57.700> put<00:01:57.880> pressure

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
pursuing these from is to put pressure

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.969 
pursuing these from is to put pressure
which<00:02:00.340> means<00:02:00.640> we<00:02:01.149> got<00:02:01.359> four<00:02:01.630> we<00:02:01.929> got<00:02:02.619> forward

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
which means we got four we got forward

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.969 
which means we got four we got forward
and<00:02:03.159> put<00:02:03.310> pressure<00:02:03.429> to<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.880> bottom<00:02:04.149> and<00:02:04.979> it's

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
and put pressure to the bottom and it's

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.559 
and put pressure to the bottom and it's
important<00:02:06.399> not<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.549> have<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:06.909> clean<00:02:07.179> bowl<00:02:07.389> for

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
important not to have a clean bowl for

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.730 
important not to have a clean bowl for
them<00:02:07.689> which<00:02:08.560> means<00:02:08.890> our<00:02:09.310> our<00:02:10.270> backlog<00:02:10.720> has<00:02:10.990> as

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
them which means our our backlog has as

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.309 
them which means our our backlog has as
an<00:02:12.069> advantage<00:02:12.580> on<00:02:12.850> putting<00:02:13.569> pressure<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.260> if

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
an advantage on putting pressure so if

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.170 
an advantage on putting pressure so if
we<00:02:14.410> put<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:14.920> we<00:02:15.100> are<00:02:15.220> pushing<00:02:15.400> them<00:02:15.700> backwards

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
we put it we are pushing them backwards

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.480 
we put it we are pushing them backwards
it<00:02:16.830> helps<00:02:17.830> our<00:02:18.150> backline<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:20.050> it's<00:02:20.470> even<00:02:21.220> more

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
it helps our backline so it's even more

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.090 
it helps our backline so it's even more
important<00:02:21.910> on<00:02:22.060> opposition<00:02:22.630> balti<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.860> really

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
important on opposition balti to really

I<00:04:24.720> know<00:04:25.260> that's<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:25.530> simplistic<00:04:25.710> in<00:04:26.190> DC<00:04:26.490> but<00:04:26.700> the

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
I know that's a simplistic in DC but the

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.270 
I know that's a simplistic in DC but the
forwards<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:27.840> get<00:04:28.110> pregnant<00:04:28.380> with<00:04:28.890> the<00:04:29.010> bikes

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
think it picks up picks up the whole

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.250 
think it picks up picks up the whole
team<00:04:34.380> that<00:04:35.340> picks<00:04:35.580> up<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:35.910> team<00:04:36.120> so<00:04:36.780> that's
