and then I'm pulling this one up through

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.950 
and then I'm pulling this one up through
the<00:00:38.530> middle<00:00:38.860> and<00:00:39.129> I'm<00:00:40.120> going<00:00:40.360> to<00:00:40.480> pull<00:00:40.930> that

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.520 
in mind while you're making these knots
is<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.180> want<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.479> do<00:01:57.659> them<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.050> same<00:01:58.290> way

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
is that you want to do them the same way

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.889 
is that you want to do them the same way
every<00:01:58.950> time<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.520> what<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.850> mean<00:02:00.119> by<00:02:00.300> that<00:02:00.540> is

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
every time and what I mean by that is

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.170 
every time and what I mean by that is
that<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.470> have<00:02:01.800> been<00:02:01.979> bringing<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.580> strand<00:02:02.909> on

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
that I have been bringing this strand on

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.600 
that I have been bringing this strand on
the<00:02:03.270> right<00:02:03.720> underneath<00:02:04.440> this<00:02:04.950> strand<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
the right underneath this strand on the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.059 
the right underneath this strand on the
left<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.270> then<00:02:06.869> I'm<00:02:06.990> using<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.440> Strand<00:02:07.800> that

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
left and then I'm using the Strand that

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.889 
left and then I'm using the Strand that
is<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.520> left<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:09.030> bring<00:02:09.239> up<00:02:09.479> through<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
is on the left to bring up through the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.199 
is on the left to bring up through the
middle<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.580> whichever<00:02:11.580> way<00:02:11.850> you<00:02:11.910> make<00:02:12.180> your

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
middle and whichever way you make your

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.880 
middle and whichever way you make your
knot<00:02:12.540> just<00:02:12.840> make<00:02:13.050> sure<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.380> do<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.709> same

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
knot just make sure you do it the same

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.620 
knot just make sure you do it the same
way<00:02:13.950> every<00:02:14.430> time<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.150> they<00:02:15.269> end<00:02:15.300> up

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
way every time so that they end up

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.840 
way every time so that they end up
looking<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.080> same<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.650> then<00:02:17.190> I'm<00:02:17.370> taking<00:02:17.580> the

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
looking the same and then I'm taking the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.729 
looking the same and then I'm taking the
Strand<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.330> right<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.989> flipping<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.620> over

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
Strand on the right and flipping it over

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.979 
Strand on the right and flipping it over
the<00:02:20.040> Strand<00:02:20.310> on<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.519> left<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.269> you<00:02:21.810> can

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
the Strand on the left and you can

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.660 
the Strand on the left and you can
definitely<00:02:22.170> do<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.920> opposite<00:02:23.430> way<00:02:23.489> you

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
definitely do it the opposite way you

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.250 
definitely do it the opposite way you
probably<00:02:24.120> just<00:02:24.300> want<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.600> do<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.959> same<00:02:25.200> way

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
probably just want to do it the same way

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:34.990 
probably just want to do it the same way
each<00:02:25.830> time

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.360 

you

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.520 

you

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.809 

okay<00:02:48.530> so<00:02:48.590> that's<00:02:48.950> what<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:49.220> looks<00:02:49.250> like<00:02:49.580> with<00:02:49.790> a

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
okay so that's what it looks like with a

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.520 
okay so that's what it looks like with a
couple<00:02:50.209> more<00:02:50.330> knots<00:02:50.600> you<00:02:50.930> can<00:02:51.080> just<00:02:51.260> do

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
couple more knots you can just do

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.260 
couple more knots you can just do
whatever<00:02:51.860> works<00:02:52.280> best<00:02:52.400> for<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.880> length<00:02:53.090> of

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
whatever works best for the length of

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:01.050 
whatever works best for the length of
hair<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.630> have

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.120
