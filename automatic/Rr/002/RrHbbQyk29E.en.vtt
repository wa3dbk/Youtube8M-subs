00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
bit of wave to this side and then I'm

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.009 
bit of wave to this side and then I'm
gonna<00:00:11.070> pin<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.519> other<00:00:11.550> side<00:00:12.030> up<00:00:12.210> so<00:00:12.509> this<00:00:12.960> is

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
gonna pin the other side up so this is

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.890 
gonna pin the other side up so this is
about<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.349> one-inch<00:00:13.620> curling<00:00:14.040> iron<00:00:14.719> one<00:00:15.719> thing

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
about a one-inch curling iron one thing

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.180 
about a one-inch curling iron one thing
to<00:00:16.049> remember<00:00:16.260> when<00:00:16.470> you're<00:00:16.619> curling<00:00:16.830> hair

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
to remember when you're curling hair

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.070 
to remember when you're curling hair
especially<00:00:17.400> short<00:00:17.820> hair<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.810> want<00:00:18.990> to

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
especially short hair is you want to

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.990 
especially short hair is you want to
avoid<00:00:19.289> getting<00:00:19.650> little<00:00:19.859> dip<00:00:20.039> marks<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.609> so

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
avoid getting little dip marks and so

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.759 
avoid getting little dip marks and so
what<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> do<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.720> try<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.960> hold<00:00:22.199> my<00:00:22.470> curling

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
what I do is I try to hold my curling

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.259 
what I do is I try to hold my curling
iron<00:00:22.890> really<00:00:23.279> really<00:00:23.490> loosely

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
iron really really loosely

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.019 
iron really really loosely
I'm<00:00:24.570> not<00:00:24.810> clamping<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.619> down<00:00:25.650> tightly<00:00:26.160> one

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
I'm not clamping it down tightly one

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.519 
I'm not clamping it down tightly one
thing<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.359> always<00:00:27.570> think<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.050> as<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.349> put

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
thing that I always think of as I put

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.080 
thing that I always think of as I put
myself<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.220> mind<00:00:29.429> frame<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.880> I'm<00:00:29.970> a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
myself in the mind frame that I'm a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.820 
myself in the mind frame that I'm a
ballerina<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.840> I'm<00:00:31.019> trying<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.410> hold<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.710> as

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
ballerina and I'm trying to hold it as

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.549 
ballerina and I'm trying to hold it as
elegantly<00:00:32.369> as<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> can<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.989> what<00:00:34.079> I'm<00:00:34.200> gonna<00:00:34.350> do

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
is I'm just gonna take this kind of top

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.690 
is I'm just gonna take this kind of top
portion<00:00:36.899> here<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.590> temple<00:00:38.010> section<00:00:38.489> I'm

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
portion here this temple section I'm

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.299 
portion here this temple section I'm
gonna<00:00:38.879> pull<00:00:39.210> each<00:00:39.719> piece<00:00:40.200> straight<00:00:40.980> out<00:00:41.129> to

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
gonna pull each piece straight out to

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.190 
gonna pull each piece straight out to
the<00:00:41.340> side<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.090> I'm<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.360> gonna<00:00:42.450> curl<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.960> away

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the side and I'm just gonna curl it away

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.799 
the side and I'm just gonna curl it away
from<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.590> face<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.270> start<00:00:45.539> at<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
from the face I like to start at the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.430 
from the face I like to start at the
root<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.260> work<00:00:46.530> my<00:00:46.710> way<00:00:46.739> down<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.430> tip

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
root and work my way down to the tip

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.360 
root and work my way down to the tip
traditionally<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.559> would<00:00:49.739> start<00:00:49.980> at<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> end

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
traditionally we would start at the end

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.189 
traditionally we would start at the end
and<00:00:50.579> work<00:00:50.730> our<00:00:50.910> way<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.120> but<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> reason<00:00:52.170> that

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
and work our way up but the reason that

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.799 
and work our way up but the reason that
this<00:00:52.440> works<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.800> little<00:00:52.890> bit<00:00:53.070> better<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.809> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
this works a little bit better is the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.049 
this works a little bit better is the
hair<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.260> softest<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> newest<00:00:56.640> at

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
hair is the softest and the newest at

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.240 
hair is the softest and the newest at
the<00:00:57.329> root<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.530> needs<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.859> little<00:00:58.890> bit

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the root and so it needs a little bit

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.689 
the root and so it needs a little bit
more<00:00:59.550> time<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:00.989> heated<00:01:01.320> up<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.309> ends

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
more time to be heated up and the ends

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.399 
more time to be heated up and the ends
tend<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.300> oldest<00:01:03.660> part<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.080> our<00:01:04.199> hair

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
tend to be the oldest part of our hair

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.800 
tend to be the oldest part of our hair
and<00:01:04.559> take<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> curl<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.610> quickly<00:01:06.119> so

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
and take to the curl really quickly so

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.380 
and take to the curl really quickly so
you're<00:01:06.930> giving<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.409> more<00:01:07.590> even<00:01:08.100> curl<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:09.060> you

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
you're giving it a more even curl if you

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.660 
you're giving it a more even curl if you
do<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.810> way

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
do it this way

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.980 
do it this way
so<00:01:11.670> now<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.880> I've<00:01:12.060> curled<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.479> top<00:01:12.750> section

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
so now that I've curled that top section

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.190 
so now that I've curled that top section
I'm<00:01:13.680> gonna<00:01:13.830> curl<00:01:14.420> this<00:01:15.420> bottom<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.049> I'm<00:01:16.110> gonna

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
I'm gonna curl this bottom and I'm gonna

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.780 
I'm gonna curl this bottom and I'm gonna
go<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> opposite<00:01:17.100> direction<00:01:17.159> I'm<00:01:17.640> going

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
go in the opposite direction I'm going

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.230 
go in the opposite direction I'm going
to<00:01:17.850> go<00:01:17.939> towards<00:01:18.390> us<00:01:19.490> again<00:01:20.490> kind<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> starting

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
to go towards us again kind of starting

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.170 
to go towards us again kind of starting
in<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.390> middle<00:01:22.460> just<00:01:23.460> heating<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.150> a

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
in the middle just heating it for a

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.510 
in the middle just heating it for a
little<00:01:24.420> bit<00:01:24.619> ignoring<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.920> pieces<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
little bit ignoring the pieces on the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.880 
little bit ignoring the pieces on the
top<00:01:27.170> we<00:01:28.170> get<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.350> really<00:01:28.770> nice<00:01:29.040> shape<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.759> there

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
top we get a really nice shape in there

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.679 
top we get a really nice shape in there
really<00:01:31.890> run<00:01:32.189> your<00:01:32.220> hands<00:01:32.700> through<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.509> can

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
really run your hands through you can

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.179 
really run your hands through you can
touch<00:01:33.869> up<00:01:34.020> anything<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.740> need<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.009> touch

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
touch up anything that you need to touch

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.010 
touch up anything that you need to touch
up<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.759> bangs<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.240> way<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:38.299> again<00:01:39.299> super

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
up in the bangs that way to again super

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.219 
up in the bangs that way to again super
super<00:01:40.380> light<00:01:40.590> touch

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.240 

sometimes<00:01:44.229> you<00:01:44.380> just<00:01:44.409> need<00:01:44.650> a<00:01:44.710> touchup<00:01:45.010> a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
sometimes you just need a touchup a
