00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.910 
one of the ways that halo is different
from<00:02:59.360> other<00:02:59.540> first-person<00:03:00.110> shooters<00:03:00.440> is<00:03:00.680> that

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
from other first-person shooters is that

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.680 
from other first-person shooters is that
it<00:03:01.070> only<00:03:01.220> allows<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.880> carry<00:03:02.060> two<00:03:02.660> weapons

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
it only allows you to carry two weapons

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.750 
it only allows you to carry two weapons
at<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.170> same<00:03:03.380> time<00:03:03.620> that's<00:03:04.160> something<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:04.730> I

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
at the same time that's something that I

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.030 
at the same time that's something that I
think<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:05.330> for<00:03:05.750> years<00:03:06.050> you<00:03:06.770> know<00:03:06.860> game

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
think that for years you know game

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.980 
think that for years you know game
players<00:03:07.310> have<00:03:07.550> probably<00:03:07.880> thought<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.720> that

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
players have probably thought and that

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.690 
players have probably thought and that
sort<00:03:09.260> of<00:03:09.320> realism<00:03:09.740> would<00:03:10.100> detract<00:03:10.430> from<00:03:10.580> the

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
sort of realism would detract from the

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.130 
sort of realism would detract from the
first-person<00:03:11.240> shooter<00:03:11.450> in<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.690> past<00:03:11.900> you've

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
first-person shooter in the past you've

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.870 
first-person shooter in the past you've
always<00:03:12.320> been<00:03:12.560> able<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.950> carry<00:03:13.550> you<00:03:13.730> know<00:03:13.850> a

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
always been able to carry you know a

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.000

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
huge rocket launcher and machine gun and

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.890 
huge rocket launcher and machine gun and
so<00:03:16.490> on<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:16.730> so<00:03:16.820> forth<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.360> probably<00:03:17.630> twelve

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
so on and so forth and probably twelve

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.100 
so on and so forth and probably twelve
weapons<00:03:18.290> in<00:03:19.070> this<00:03:19.310> it's<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:20.810> adds<00:03:20.990> a<00:03:21.050> really

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
weapons in this it's it adds a really

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
nice strategic element and a necessity

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.880 
nice strategic element and a necessity

that you start off with is probably the
