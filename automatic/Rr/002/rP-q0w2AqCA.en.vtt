fasting is abstaining from food for a

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.190

certain<00:00:07.379> period<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.770> time<00:00:08.120> but<00:00:09.120> it's<00:00:09.270> done<00:00:09.570> for

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
purpose and for Christians I believe it

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.740 
purpose and for Christians I believe it
is<00:00:15.270> to<00:00:15.779> express<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.850> intensify<00:00:18.359> our

hunger for God you know some people may

hunger for God you know some people may
fast<00:00:22.880> you<00:00:23.880> know<00:00:24.000> if<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.270> want<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.600> lose<00:00:24.810> weight

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
fast you know if you want to lose weight

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.950 
fast you know if you want to lose weight
something<00:00:25.560> like<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.010> but<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.940> think<00:00:27.090> for<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
something like that but I think for the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.700 
something like that but I think for the
Christian<00:00:28.350> the<00:00:28.860> the<00:00:29.340> idea<00:00:29.940> is<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.630> draw<00:00:31.350> closer

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
Christian the the idea is to draw closer

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.299 
Christian the the idea is to draw closer
to<00:00:31.860> God<00:00:32.690> I<00:00:33.690> think<00:00:33.989> if<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.469> look<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> Bible

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
to God I think if you look in the Bible

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.599 
to God I think if you look in the Bible
in<00:00:35.579> terms<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.569> wind<00:00:36.839> people<00:00:37.019> fasted<00:00:37.739> there

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:38.609 
in terms of wind people fasted there

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.360 
in terms of wind people fasted there
were<00:00:38.699> times<00:00:38.999> of<00:00:39.359> sorrow<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:41.039> know<00:00:41.159> there

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
were times of sorrow you know there

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.160 
were times of sorrow you know there
could<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.609> illness<00:00:42.269> or<00:00:42.539> something<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:42.960> that

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
could be illness or something like that

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.009 
could be illness or something like that
there<00:00:43.440> could<00:00:43.620> be<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:44.370> time<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:44.999> repentance<00:00:45.359> when

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
there could be a time of repentance when

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.840 
there could be a time of repentance when
people<00:00:46.350> realize<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.159> sin<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.699> they've

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
people realize the sin that they've

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.329 
people realize the sin that they've
committed<00:00:48.210> against<00:00:48.960> God<00:00:49.139> there<00:00:50.129> were<00:00:50.190> also

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
committed against God there were also

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:51.919 
committed against God there were also
times<00:00:50.699> when<00:00:50.999> they<00:00:51.149> had<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.539> make<00:00:51.690> some<00:00:51.899> big

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929 
times when they had to make some big

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.169 
times when they had to make some big
decisions<00:00:52.409> about<00:00:53.190> sending<00:00:53.609> people<00:00:53.670> out<00:00:54.149> on

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:54.179 
decisions about sending people out on

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.969 
decisions about sending people out on
missions<00:00:54.839> and<00:00:55.049> that<00:00:55.199> kind<00:00:55.409> of<00:00:55.469> thing<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
missions and that kind of thing and

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:01.099 
missions and that kind of thing and
people<00:00:56.429> were<00:00:56.760> fasting<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.839> so<00:00:58.109> people<00:01:00.109> often

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
people were fasting and so people often

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.189 
people were fasting and so people often
fasting<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:01.979> associated<00:01:02.519> with<00:01:02.699> prayer<00:01:03.199> but

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
fasting is associated with prayer but

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.590 
fasting is associated with prayer but
there<00:01:05.159> was<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> time<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.670> sometimes<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
there was a time that sometimes the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.749 
there was a time that sometimes the
prayer<00:01:07.380> didn't<00:01:07.890> even<00:01:08.009> seem<00:01:08.219> to<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.430> enough

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
prayer didn't even seem to be enough

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.880 
prayer didn't even seem to be enough
that<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.180> wanted<00:01:09.509> to<00:01:09.570> even<00:01:09.719> draw<00:01:10.020> closer<00:01:10.380> and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that you wanted to even draw closer and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.550 
that you wanted to even draw closer and
so<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.549> seemed<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.030> fasting<00:01:12.990> was<00:01:13.170> something

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
so it seemed like fasting was something

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.700 
so it seemed like fasting was something
that<00:01:14.180> both<00:01:15.180> was<00:01:15.659> practiced<00:01:16.110> both<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.469> the<00:01:16.560> Old

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
that both was practiced both in the Old

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.560 
that both was practiced both in the Old
Testament<00:01:16.799> by<00:01:17.399> the<00:01:17.460> Jewish<00:01:17.820> people<00:01:18.210> as<00:01:18.359> well

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
Testament by the Jewish people as well

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.440 
Testament by the Jewish people as well
as<00:01:18.780> by<00:01:19.770> Christians<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.789> New<00:01:20.909> Testament<00:01:20.939> as

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
as by Christians in the New Testament as

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.649 
as by Christians in the New Testament as
well<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:23.460> know<00:01:23.490> whether<00:01:23.759> fasting<00:01:24.329> is<00:01:24.450> for

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
well and you know whether fasting is for

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.349 
well and you know whether fasting is for
day<00:01:24.780> today<00:01:25.289> to<00:01:25.829> be<00:01:25.950> honest<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.369> don't<00:01:26.609> have

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
day today to be honest we don't have

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.090 
day today to be honest we don't have
that<00:01:27.600> much<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.780> an<00:01:27.990> emphasis<00:01:28.109> on<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:29.039> today<00:01:29.750> I

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
that much of an emphasis on it today I

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.310 
that much of an emphasis on it today I
think<00:01:32.100> part<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.789> is<00:01:32.850> because<00:01:33.420> maybe<00:01:33.689> food

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
think part of it is because maybe food

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.999 
think part of it is because maybe food
hasn't<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.939> know<00:01:35.969> so<00:01:36.240> much<00:01:36.390> food<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.009> maybe

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
hasn't you know so much food and maybe

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.230 
hasn't you know so much food and maybe
there's<00:01:38.340> such<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> emphasis<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:40.530> just

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
there's such a emphasis on just

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.289 
there's such a emphasis on just
indulging<00:01:42.240> ourselves<00:01:42.420> today<00:01:43.880> but<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.119> think

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
indulging ourselves today but I think

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.029 
indulging ourselves today but I think
it's<00:01:45.479> something<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.990> certainly<00:01:46.499> should<00:01:47.009> be

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
it's something that certainly should be

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.539 
it's something that certainly should be
should<00:01:47.969> be<00:01:48.049> practice<00:01:49.049> today<00:01:49.679> so<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.219> we<00:01:50.369> can

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
should be practice today so that we can

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.179 
should be practice today so that we can
draw<00:01:50.759> closer<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.240> God<00:01:51.359> but<00:01:51.689> maybe<00:01:51.869> we're<00:01:52.140> just

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
draw closer to God but maybe we're just

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.429 
draw closer to God but maybe we're just
food<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.490> available<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:54.299> us<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.810> maybe<00:01:55.049> we

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
food is so available to us and maybe we

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.649 
food is so available to us and maybe we
can<00:01:55.679> even<00:01:55.859> think<00:01:55.979> about<00:01:56.329> fasting<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.479> other

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
can even think about fasting in other

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.739 
can even think about fasting in other
areas<00:01:58.079> besides<00:01:58.320> food<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.130> know<00:01:59.280> certainly<00:01:59.939> in

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:00.749 
areas besides food you know certainly in

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:03.669 
areas besides food you know certainly in
1st<00:02:01.020> Corinthians<00:02:01.499> 7<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.130> talks<00:02:02.159> about<00:02:02.520> how

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
1st Corinthians 7 it talks about how

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.069 
1st Corinthians 7 it talks about how
couples<00:02:05.060> husband<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.210> wife<00:02:06.299> could<00:02:06.569> abstain

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
couples husband and wife could abstain

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.830 
couples husband and wife could abstain
from<00:02:07.380> sexual<00:02:07.920> intercourse<00:02:08.539> so<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.720> they

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
from sexual intercourse so that they

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.490 
from sexual intercourse so that they
could<00:02:10.020> devote<00:02:10.350> some<00:02:10.950> time<00:02:11.010> to<00:02:11.220> God<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:13.290> so

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
could devote some time to God and and so

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.550 
could devote some time to God and and so
I<00:02:13.830> think<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.460> means<00:02:14.730> fasting<00:02:15.570> can<00:02:15.720> go<00:02:15.930> beyond

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
I think that means fasting can go beyond

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.339 
I think that means fasting can go beyond
just<00:02:17.099> food<00:02:17.310> maybe<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.849> could<00:02:18.090> be<00:02:18.239> for<00:02:19.080> some<00:02:19.260> of

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
just food maybe it could be for some of

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.650 
just food maybe it could be for some of
us<00:02:19.440> TV<00:02:20.010> or<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.790> know<00:02:20.910> listening<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.510> radio

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
us TV or you know listening to the radio

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.020 
us TV or you know listening to the radio
or<00:02:21.900> music<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:23.220> all<00:02:23.310> these<00:02:23.400> kinds<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.760> things

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
or music and all these kinds of things

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.540 
or music and all these kinds of things
and<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:25.530> could<00:02:25.739> be<00:02:25.830> very<00:02:26.040> helpful<00:02:26.310> for

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
and that could be very helpful for

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.190 
and that could be very helpful for
people<00:02:26.700> because<00:02:27.060> sometimes<00:02:27.630> we<00:02:27.840> were

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
people because sometimes we were

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.949 
people because sometimes we were
distracted<00:02:28.800> more<00:02:29.010> by<00:02:29.190> those<00:02:29.430> things<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.030> and

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
distracted more by those things and and

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.809 
distracted more by those things and and
we<00:02:31.110> don't<00:02:31.290> spend<00:02:31.560> enough<00:02:31.650> time<00:02:31.860> with<00:02:32.220> God<00:02:32.430> so

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
we don't spend enough time with God so

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.520 
we don't spend enough time with God so
we<00:02:32.970> need<00:02:33.150> some<00:02:33.300> silence<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:34.170> our<00:02:34.260> lives

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
we need some silence in our lives

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.860 
we need some silence in our lives
sometimes<00:02:34.830> maybe<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.090> think<00:02:36.209> fasting

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
sometimes maybe and so I think fasting

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.850 
sometimes maybe and so I think fasting
can<00:02:37.260> take<00:02:37.739> different<00:02:38.040> forms<00:02:38.390> today<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:40.349> think

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
can take different forms today I think

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.680 
can take different forms today I think
some<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.160> dangers<00:02:41.670> has<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.120> do<00:02:42.269> with<00:02:42.420> fact

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
some of the dangers has to do with fact

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.479 
some of the dangers has to do with fact
that<00:02:42.780> sometimes<00:02:43.080> people<00:02:43.650> think<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.340> as

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
that sometimes people think of it as

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.660 
that sometimes people think of it as
sort<00:02:45.330> of<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.540> spiritual<00:02:46.140> magic<00:02:46.739> bullet<00:02:47.069> you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
sort of the spiritual magic bullet you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.910 
sort of the spiritual magic bullet you
know<00:02:47.790> there's<00:02:48.000> some<00:02:48.319> writers<00:02:49.319> who<00:02:49.560> sort<00:02:49.860> of

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
know there's some writers who sort of

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.190 
know there's some writers who sort of
say<00:02:50.069> this<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.610> spiritual<00:02:51.480> secret<00:02:51.989> and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
say this is the spiritual secret and

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.660 
say this is the spiritual secret and
that<00:02:52.230> kind<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.500> thing<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.950> I'm<00:02:53.220> not<00:02:53.400> sure<00:02:53.610> if

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
that kind of thing and I'm not sure if

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.259 
that kind of thing and I'm not sure if
that<00:02:53.819> would<00:02:53.970> be<00:02:54.030> true<00:02:54.180> because<00:02:55.400> if<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.760> was<00:02:56.970> it

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
that would be true because if it was it

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.390 
that would be true because if it was it
would<00:02:57.450> be<00:02:57.480> commanded<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.590> would<00:02:58.709> be<00:02:58.860> you

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
would be commanded and it would be you

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.890 
would be commanded and it would be you
know<00:02:59.430> but<00:02:59.640> we<00:02:59.790> don't<00:02:59.970> really<00:03:00.209> see<00:03:00.540> any

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
know but we don't really see any

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.670 
know but we don't really see any
commands<00:03:01.739> by<00:03:02.840> any<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.140> writers<00:03:04.349> the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
commands by any of the writers the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.250 
commands by any of the writers the
saying<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.010> know<00:03:05.099> you<00:03:05.160> should<00:03:05.670> do<00:03:05.940> this<00:03:06.260> it's

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
saying you know you should do this it's

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.920 
saying you know you should do this it's
really<00:03:07.980> something<00:03:08.459> that's<00:03:08.580> voluntary<00:03:08.930> it's

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
really something that's voluntary it's

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.380 
really something that's voluntary it's
something<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.799> really<00:03:11.280> want<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.239> get

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
something that I really want to get

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.509 
something that I really want to get
closer<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.840> God<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.410> it's<00:03:13.890> something<00:03:14.099> that<00:03:14.489> I

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
closer to God and it's something that I

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.670 
closer to God and it's something that I
want<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.090> do<00:03:15.330> not<00:03:15.510> because<00:03:15.810> somebody<00:03:16.080> told<00:03:16.560> me

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
want to do not because somebody told me

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.559 
want to do not because somebody told me
to<00:03:16.860> do<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.160> or<00:03:17.370> I'm<00:03:17.670> forced<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.150> do<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.420> but<00:03:18.510> I

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
to do it or I'm forced to do it but I

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.170 
to do it or I'm forced to do it but I
want<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.930> do<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.500> whether<00:03:20.459> again<00:03:20.940> whether

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
want to do it and whether again whether

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.420 
want to do it and whether again whether
it's<00:03:21.390> appropriate<00:03:21.930> for<00:03:21.959> today<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.440> mean<00:03:22.859> in

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
it's appropriate for today I mean in

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.319 
it's appropriate for today I mean in
Matthew<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.180> talks<00:03:24.690> about<00:03:24.930> how<00:03:25.049> Jesus<00:03:26.329> was

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
Matthew it talks about how Jesus was

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.390 
Matthew it talks about how Jesus was
asked<00:03:27.870> about<00:03:27.959> how<00:03:28.170> come<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:29.160> know<00:03:29.280> the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
asked about how come you know the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.569 
asked about how come you know the
Pharisees<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.390> John's<00:03:30.690> disciples<00:03:31.250> fast<00:03:32.250> how

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
Pharisees and John's disciples fast how

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.150 
Pharisees and John's disciples fast how
come<00:03:32.730> your<00:03:32.970> people<00:03:33.540> don't<00:03:33.810> fast<00:03:34.109> and<00:03:34.739> he<00:03:34.950> said

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
come your people don't fast and he said

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.849 
come your people don't fast and he said
that<00:03:35.370> well<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.569> bridegroom<00:03:37.049> is<00:03:37.200> here<00:03:37.260> but

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
that well the bridegroom is here but

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.190 
that well the bridegroom is here but
when<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.100> bridegroom<00:03:38.310> is<00:03:38.819> gone<00:03:39.180> that's<00:03:39.810> the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
when the bridegroom is gone that's the

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.930 
when the bridegroom is gone that's the
time<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.440> fast<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.100> so<00:03:41.250> we're<00:03:41.459> living<00:03:41.640> in<00:03:41.910> that

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
time to fast and so we're living in that

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.430 
time to fast and so we're living in that
era<00:03:42.299> so<00:03:42.600> I<00:03:42.630> think<00:03:42.780> that's<00:03:43.109> certainly

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
era so I think that's certainly

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.330 
era so I think that's certainly
appropriate<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.810> so<00:03:46.049> but<00:03:46.500> again<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:47.130> know<00:03:47.220> we

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
appropriate and so but again you know we

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.740 
appropriate and so but again you know we
need<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:47.519> be<00:03:47.639> careful<00:03:47.819> Jesus<00:03:48.329> in<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.569> Sermon

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
need to be careful Jesus in the Sermon

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.470 
need to be careful Jesus in the Sermon
on<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.049> Mount<00:03:49.350> said<00:03:50.069> don't<00:03:50.819> do<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:50.970> -<00:03:51.180> for<00:03:51.329> sure

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
on the Mount said don't do it - for sure

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.449 
on the Mount said don't do it - for sure
you<00:03:51.810> know<00:03:51.900> don't<00:03:52.049> broadcast<00:03:52.350> that<00:03:52.739> on<00:03:52.920> fasting

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459

until you you do it you know and that's
not<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:17.039> the<00:04:17.489> thing<00:04:17.729> that<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.329> Bible<00:04:18.660> tells

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
not the the thing that the Bible tells

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.949 
not the the thing that the Bible tells
us<00:04:19.079> it<00:04:19.739> tells<00:04:19.950> us<00:04:20.100> that<00:04:20.359> we<00:04:21.359> just<00:04:21.570> want<00:04:21.810> to

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
us it tells us that we just want to

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.890 
us it tells us that we just want to
humble<00:04:22.950> ourselves<00:04:23.070> before<00:04:23.490> God<00:04:24.090> we<00:04:24.539> want<00:04:24.810> to

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
humble ourselves before God we want to

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.930 
humble ourselves before God we want to
draw<00:04:25.050> closer<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.650> God<00:04:25.830> and<00:04:26.159> we<00:04:26.610> don't<00:04:26.760> want<00:04:26.880> to

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
draw closer to God and we don't want to

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.200 
draw closer to God and we don't want to
have<00:04:27.150> any<00:04:27.390> kind<00:04:27.570> of<00:04:27.690> distress

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
have any kind of distress

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.510 
have any kind of distress
and<00:04:28.780> that's<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.560> thing<00:04:29.770> that<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:30.039> think<00:04:30.220> we

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
and that's the thing that I think we

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.050 
and that's the thing that I think we
should<00:04:30.550> remember<00:04:31.030> about<00:04:32.160> about<00:04:33.160> fasting<00:04:33.880> and

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
should remember about about fasting and

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.969 
should remember about about fasting and
I<00:04:34.150> think<00:04:34.330> one<00:04:34.479> other<00:04:34.630> thing<00:04:34.900> is<00:04:35.020> in<00:04:35.319> Isaiah<00:04:36.870> 58

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
I think one other thing is in Isaiah 58

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.589 
I think one other thing is in Isaiah 58
it<00:04:38.979> talks<00:04:39.250> about<00:04:39.340> living<00:04:39.699> the<00:04:40.060> right<00:04:40.300> kind<00:04:40.539> of

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
it talks about living the right kind of

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:44.610 
it talks about living the right kind of
life<00:04:40.870> as<00:04:41.319> well<00:04:41.650> that<00:04:42.460> even<00:04:43.180> though<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:44.349> Jewish

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
life as well that even though the Jewish

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.629 
life as well that even though the Jewish
people<00:04:45.009> were<00:04:45.190> fasting<00:04:45.940> God<00:04:46.930> says<00:04:47.199> I'm<00:04:47.410> not

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
people were fasting God says I'm not

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.219 
people were fasting God says I'm not
impressed<00:04:48.639> with<00:04:48.729> all<00:04:49.000> this<00:04:49.150> fasting<00:04:49.630> you<00:04:50.110> know

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
impressed with all this fasting you know

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.339 
impressed with all this fasting you know
I<00:04:50.259> want<00:04:50.590> you<00:04:50.680> to<00:04:50.800> live<00:04:51.069> lives<00:04:51.520> of<00:04:52.080> justice<00:04:53.080> I

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
I want you to live lives of justice I

I want you to live lives of justice I
want<00:04:53.889> you<00:04:54.009> to<00:04:54.130> live<00:04:54.310> lives<00:04:54.580> of<00:04:54.789> mercy<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:56.280> if

want you to live lives of mercy and if

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.150 
want you to live lives of mercy and if
you're<00:04:57.460> not<00:04:57.580> doing<00:04:57.819> that<00:04:57.940> then<00:04:58.949> fasting<00:04:59.949> won't

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
you're not doing that then fasting won't

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.860 
you're not doing that then fasting won't
get<00:05:00.280> you<00:05:00.400> any<00:05:00.580> closer<00:05:00.849> to<00:05:01.180> me<00:05:01.300> you<00:05:01.449> know<00:05:01.660> so<00:05:01.840> I

get you any closer to me you know so I

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.439 
get you any closer to me you know so I
think<00:05:01.990> we<00:05:02.320> also<00:05:02.470> need<00:05:02.800> to<00:05:02.949> live<00:05:03.190> the<00:05:03.729> kind<00:05:04.330> of

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
think we also need to live the kind of

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.170 
think we also need to live the kind of
life<00:05:04.660> that<00:05:04.960> God<00:05:05.139> wants<00:05:05.169> us<00:05:05.530> to<00:05:05.560> live<00:05:05.979> and<00:05:06.280> and

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
life that God wants us to live and and

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.360 
life that God wants us to live and and
fasting<00:05:07.690> is<00:05:07.870> in<00:05:08.440> if<00:05:08.650> we're<00:05:08.800> doing<00:05:09.039> that<00:05:09.190> then

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
fasting is in if we're doing that then

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.580 
fasting is in if we're doing that then
fasting<00:05:09.820> can<00:05:10.090> be<00:05:10.240> helpful<00:05:10.630> to<00:05:11.050> draw<00:05:11.199> us<00:05:11.380> closer

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
fasting can be helpful to draw us closer
