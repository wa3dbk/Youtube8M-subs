me<00:02:09.000> warm<00:02:09.330> up<00:02:09.509> with<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.379> front<00:02:10.950> squat<00:02:11.099> whenever

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
me warm up with a front squat whenever

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.280 
me warm up with a front squat whenever
I'm<00:02:11.910> back<00:02:12.120> squatting

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
I'm back squatting

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.699 
I'm back squatting
I<00:02:13.379> have<00:02:13.920> always<00:02:14.159> done<00:02:14.489> this<00:02:14.700> since<00:02:15.180> about<00:02:15.500> 2007

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
I have always done this since about 2007

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.630 
I have always done this since about 2007
so<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.879> always<00:02:18.510> go<00:02:18.719> one<00:02:19.019> plate<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.590> play<00:02:20.099> three

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
so I always go one plate to play three

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.640 
so I always go one plate to play three
plates<00:02:20.939> and<00:02:21.239> then<00:02:21.900> it's<00:02:22.079> not<00:02:22.230> until<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
plates and then it's not until the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.819 
plates and then it's not until the
fourth<00:02:22.859> plate<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:25.019> I<00:02:25.049> do<00:02:25.500> my<00:02:25.650> first

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
fourth plate that that I do my first

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.099 
fourth plate that that I do my first
back<00:02:26.129> squat<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:26.909> I<00:02:27.420> find<00:02:27.659> that<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:27.870> just

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
back squat and I find that this just

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.130 
back squat and I find that this just
makes<00:02:28.439> me<00:02:28.590> feel<00:02:28.739> very<00:02:29.040> grooved<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:30.390> just

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
makes me feel very grooved and it just

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.690 
makes me feel very grooved and it just
feels<00:02:31.349> much<00:02:31.530> better<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.980> warm<00:02:32.159> up<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.489> way<00:02:32.670> to

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
feels much better to warm up that way to

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.210 
feels much better to warm up that way to
me<00:02:32.939> it<00:02:33.030> always<00:02:33.239> has<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.319> haven't<00:02:34.560> back<00:02:34.829> squat

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
me it always has so I haven't back squat

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.880 
me it always has so I haven't back squat
at<00:02:35.370> anything<00:02:35.549> less<00:02:35.879> than<00:02:35.939> 405<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.079> about<00:02:37.319> in

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.369 
almost seven years when I front squat I
usually<00:02:42.090> like<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.359> work<00:02:42.480> up<00:02:42.689> to<00:02:42.719> a<00:02:42.870> moderately

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
reps to being when I'm going a little

when<00:03:23.340> I'm<00:03:23.519> trying<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:23.909> challenge<00:03:24.150> myself<00:03:25.159> when

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
when I'm trying to challenge myself when

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.800 
when I'm trying to challenge myself when
I'm<00:03:26.250> doing<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.489> lot<00:03:26.519> of<00:03:26.669> reps<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.629> real

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
I'm doing a lot of reps the the real

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.839 
I'm doing a lot of reps the the real
thing<00:03:28.139> is<00:03:28.379> the<00:03:28.560> real<00:03:28.709> hard<00:03:28.949> part<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.519> limiting

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
thing is the real hard part the limiting

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.780 
thing is the real hard part the limiting
factor<00:03:30.299> is<00:03:30.419> your<00:03:30.540> rack<00:03:30.780> position<00:03:31.549> quite<00:03:32.549> often

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
factor is your rack position quite often

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.250 
factor is your rack position quite often
the<00:03:33.060> legs<00:03:33.239> will<00:03:33.419> be<00:03:33.540> strong<00:03:33.840> enough<00:03:34.049> but

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
the legs will be strong enough but

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.330 
the legs will be strong enough but
you'll<00:03:34.409> lose<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.859> you'll<00:03:35.549> lose<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:35.940> at<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.180> top

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
you'll lose it you'll lose it at the top

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.969 
you'll lose it you'll lose it at the top
but<00:03:38.340> like<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:38.579> said<00:03:38.639> today<00:03:39.260> I'm<00:03:40.260> going<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.889> little

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:40.979 
but like I said today I'm going a little

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.159 
but like I said today I'm going a little
bit<00:03:41.159> lighter<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:41.699> this<00:03:42.449> is<00:03:42.569> because<00:03:42.900> I've<00:03:43.139> been

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
bit lighter so this is because I've been

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.110 
bit lighter so this is because I've been
doing<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.680> lot<00:03:43.919> of<00:03:43.949> front<00:03:44.280> squatting<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.000> when

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
doing a lot of front squatting and when

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.300 
doing a lot of front squatting and when
I<00:03:45.209> when<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.540> do<00:03:45.659> too<00:03:46.109> much<00:03:46.290> heavy<00:03:46.889> front

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
I when I do too much heavy front

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.479 
I when I do too much heavy front
squatting<00:03:48.409> that's<00:03:49.409> when<00:03:49.590> my<00:03:49.769> knees<00:03:49.979> start<00:03:50.430> to

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
squatting that's when my knees start to

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.030 
squatting that's when my knees start to
hurt<00:03:50.699> a<00:03:50.819> little<00:03:50.909> bit<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.709> that's<00:03:52.709> not<00:03:52.859> because

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
hurt a little bit and that's not because

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.680 
hurt a little bit and that's not because
front<00:03:53.459> squatting<00:03:53.879> is<00:03:53.970> bad<00:03:54.180> for<00:03:54.419> your<00:03:54.479> knees

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
front squatting is bad for your knees

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.439 
front squatting is bad for your knees
it's<00:03:54.989> because<00:03:55.349> when<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.709> go<00:03:55.979> heavy<00:03:56.250> if<00:03:56.579> I'm<00:03:57.269> not

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
it's because when I go heavy if I'm not

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.349 
it's because when I go heavy if I'm not
if<00:03:58.019> I'm<00:03:58.199> not<00:03:58.319> perfect<00:03:58.590> with<00:03:58.979> my<00:03:59.010> technique<00:03:59.639> I

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
if I'm not perfect with my technique I

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.539 
if I'm not perfect with my technique I
shift<00:04:01.139> onto<00:04:01.349> my<00:04:01.530> toes<00:04:01.799> a<00:04:01.829> little<00:04:02.099> bit<00:04:02.370> and

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
shift onto my toes a little bit and

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.569 
shift onto my toes a little bit and
that's<00:04:02.699> when<00:04:02.909> it<00:04:03.000> gets<00:04:03.120> rough<00:04:03.359> on<00:04:03.599> the<00:04:03.720> knees

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
that's when it gets rough on the knees

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.710 
that's when it gets rough on the knees
so<00:04:05.579> here<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:05.849> see<00:04:06.060> me<00:04:06.180> kind<00:04:06.359> of<00:04:06.479> doing<00:04:06.629> a

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
so here you see me kind of doing a

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.740 
so here you see me kind of doing a
piston<00:04:07.109> fashion<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:08.549> only<00:04:08.970> do<00:04:09.209> that<00:04:09.239> when<00:04:09.629> I'm

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
piston fashion I only do that when I'm

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.439 
piston fashion I only do that when I'm
going<00:04:09.900> really<00:04:10.199> light<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:11.280> never<00:04:11.819> do<00:04:12.000> that

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
going really light I never do that

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:15.319 
going really light I never do that
when<00:04:12.989> I'm<00:04:13.109> doing<00:04:13.439> any<00:04:13.889> serious<00:04:14.340> weight<00:04:14.549> so

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489
