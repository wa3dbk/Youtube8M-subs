Osment<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.530> managed<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.070> fix<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.810> so<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.320> think<00:01:10.920> I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
Osment I managed to fix it so I think I

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.780 
Osment I managed to fix it so I think I
did<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> pretty<00:01:11.280> good<00:01:11.610> job<00:01:11.689> like<00:01:12.689> saying<00:01:12.960> it

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
did a pretty good job like saying it

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.630 
did a pretty good job like saying it

million<00:01:53.340> pounds<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.000> cargo<00:01:54.920> which<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.189> was<00:01:56.399> very

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
million pounds of cargo which I was very

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.780 
million pounds of cargo which I was very
surprised<00:01:58.969> this<00:01:59.969> plan<00:02:00.860> was<00:02:01.860> designed<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.490> tear

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
surprised this plan was designed to tear

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.550 
surprised this plan was designed to tear
a<00:02:02.820> heavy<00:02:03.060> cargo<00:02:03.420> overseas<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.820> also<00:02:06.320> it<00:02:07.320> was

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
a heavy cargo overseas and also it was

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.880 
a heavy cargo overseas and also it was
designed<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.759> carry<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.869> beer<00:02:10.259> on<00:02:10.410> Space

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
designed to carry the beer on Space

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.220 
designed to carry the beer on Space
Shuttle<00:02:10.920> on<00:02:11.670> these

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.210 

part<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.130> guess<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:17.070> so<00:02:18.070> a<00:02:19.830> boron<00:02:20.830> could

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
part of the guess and so a boron could

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.390 
part of the guess and so a boron could
be<00:02:21.340> transported<00:02:22.150> place<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.140> place<00:02:23.400> easier

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
be transported place the place easier

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.520 
be transported place the place easier
the<00:02:24.970> without<00:02:26.130> like<00:02:27.750> taking<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.840> apart<00:02:29.200> and

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
the without like taking it apart and

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.680 
the without like taking it apart and
transferring<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.370> part<00:02:31.000> by<00:02:31.060> part<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.670> this<00:02:34.450> is

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
transferring it part by part so this is

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.790 
transferring it part by part so this is
the<00:02:35.590> way<00:02:36.340> bigger<00:02:36.790> version<00:02:37.270> of<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.590> 747<00:02:38.590> that

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
the way bigger version of the 747 that

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.580 
the way bigger version of the 747 that
carried<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:40.000> Shuttle<00:02:40.900> Endeavor<00:02:42.030> much<00:02:43.030> better

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
carried the Shuttle Endeavor much better

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.530 
carried the Shuttle Endeavor much better
I<00:02:45.210> think<00:02:46.210> people<00:02:46.390> say<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.860> 747<00:02:47.860> is<00:02:48.190> about<00:02:48.880> this

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
I think people say a 747 is about this

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.000 
I think people say a 747 is about this
big<00:02:49.810> compared<00:02:50.320> to<00:02:50.380> it<00:02:52.020> that's<00:02:53.020> this<00:02:53.530> is<00:02:53.590> pretty

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
big compared to it that's this is pretty

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.850 
big compared to it that's this is pretty
big<00:02:54.280> this<00:02:54.490> massive<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.650> currently<00:02:56.650> is<00:02:56.830> the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
big this massive and currently is the

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.880 
big this massive and currently is the
