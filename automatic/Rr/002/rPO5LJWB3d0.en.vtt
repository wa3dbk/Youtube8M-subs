majorly<00:06:15.219> different<00:06:15.729> but<00:06:16.089> I<00:06:16.180> just<00:06:16.419> think<00:06:16.629> it

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:16.779 
majorly different but I just think it

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:18.869 
majorly different but I just think it
could<00:06:16.930> be<00:06:17.139> it<00:06:17.770> could<00:06:17.830> be<00:06:18.069> a<00:06:18.099> lot<00:06:18.339> better<00:06:18.580> than

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:18.879 
could be it could be a lot better than

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.230 
could be it could be a lot better than
this<00:06:19.029> like<00:06:19.509> more<00:06:19.750> balanced<00:06:20.229> like<00:06:20.439> I<00:06:21.240> think

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
this like more balanced like I think

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.559 
this like more balanced like I think
