hey there guys Nathan here's a little
late<00:00:02.550> tres<00:00:02.850> update<00:00:03.350> so<00:00:04.350> I<00:00:04.950> think<00:00:05.190> it's<00:00:05.339> been

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
late tres update so I think it's been

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.160 
late tres update so I think it's been
two<00:00:05.970> weeks<00:00:06.000> or<00:00:06.359> so<00:00:06.509> since<00:00:06.720> it<00:00:06.839> blowed<00:00:06.960> out<00:00:06.990> the

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
two weeks or so since it blowed out the

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.110 
two weeks or so since it blowed out the
last<00:00:07.319> videos<00:00:07.649> can<00:00:08.370> probably<00:00:08.700> see<00:00:08.880> there's

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
last videos can probably see there's

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.110 
last videos can probably see there's
been<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> few<00:00:09.630> more<00:00:09.780> changes<00:00:10.460> so<00:00:11.460> sort<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:11.880> with

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
been a few more changes so sort of with

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.519 
been a few more changes so sort of with
the<00:00:12.950> environment<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.160> now<00:00:14.480> more<00:00:15.480> poorly<00:00:16.049> I

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
the environment is now more poorly I

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.370 
the environment is now more poorly I
think<00:00:16.980> I've<00:00:17.100> described<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.580> as<00:00:18.199> it's<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.260> lot

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
think I've described it as it's a lot

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.470 
think I've described it as it's a lot
cleaner<00:00:20.240> less<00:00:21.240> dark<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:23.180> yeah<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:24.359> pretty

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
cleaner less dark and yeah it's pretty

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.150 
cleaner less dark and yeah it's pretty
much<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:25.490> the<00:00:27.109> menu<00:00:28.109> selection<00:00:28.590> now<00:00:28.769> is

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
much that the menu selection now is

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.870 
much that the menu selection now is

these two cubes here so this one

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.729 
these two cubes here so this one
controls<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.450> camera<00:00:33.809> going<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.260> out<00:00:34.350> and

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
controls the camera going in and out and

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.780

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.389 
this menu it is going to have to change
just<00:00:47.940> because<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.809> new<00:00:49.230> leap<00:00:49.829> airspace

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.880 
form and you can look that up and how it
works<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.160> your<00:00:59.190> own<00:01:00.289> would<00:01:01.289> much<00:01:01.559> prefer<00:01:01.590> to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
works on your own would much prefer to

works on your own would much prefer to
keep<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.340> but<00:01:02.579> won't<00:01:02.760> be<00:01:02.850> able<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.059> get

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
keep this but won't be able to get

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.690 
keep this but won't be able to get

anything on the airspace store if I do

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.359 
anything on the airspace store if I do
so<00:01:06.540> I'm<00:01:07.020> thinking<00:01:07.380> I'm<00:01:07.560> going<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.799> release<00:01:08.070> a

below<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.240> board<00:01:27.540> down<00:01:27.750> instead<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.560> book

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
below the board down instead of the book

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.289 
below the board down instead of the book
you<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> transparent<00:01:29.640> which<00:01:29.729> was<00:01:29.880> jarring<00:01:30.180> to

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
you a transparent which was jarring to

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.499 
you a transparent which was jarring to
people<00:01:30.780> there's<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.130> indicator<00:01:33.000> comes<00:01:33.270> up

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
people there's just a indicator comes up

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.910 
people there's just a indicator comes up
showing<00:01:33.840> where<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.079> hand<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:36.470> which<00:01:37.470> yeah

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
showing where the hand is which yeah

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.220 
showing where the hand is which yeah
works<00:01:38.189> pretty<00:01:38.340> well

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.970 

and<00:01:41.830> uh<00:01:42.480> yeah<00:01:43.480> I<00:01:43.510> think<00:01:43.630> that's<00:01:44.560> pretty<00:01:44.830> much

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
and uh yeah I think that's pretty much

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.590 
and uh yeah I think that's pretty much
all<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.370> changes<00:01:45.820> that<00:01:45.850> there<00:01:46.090> are<00:01:46.210> so<00:01:46.390> far

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
all the changes that there are so far

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.080 
all the changes that there are so far

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
I've got a title screen kind of guy but

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.580 
I've got a title screen kind of guy but

this<00:02:29.620> deliberately<00:02:30.190> lose<00:02:32.160> just<00:02:33.160> his<00:02:33.550> in<00:02:33.940> the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
this deliberately lose just his in the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.510 
this deliberately lose just his in the
last<00:02:34.210> video<00:02:34.740> some<00:02:35.740> people<00:02:35.980> wanted<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.190> see<00:02:36.400> the

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
last video some people wanted to see the

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.800 
last video some people wanted to see the
robot<00:02:36.670> move<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.000> bunch<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.330> different<00:02:37.630> pieces

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
robot move a bunch of different pieces

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.180 
robot move a bunch of different pieces
so<00:02:38.170> hopefully<00:02:38.530> I'll<00:02:38.650> do<00:02:38.740> that<00:02:38.890> over<00:02:39.100> the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
so hopefully I'll do that over the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.510 
so hopefully I'll do that over the
course<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.460> the<00:02:39.550> video<00:02:39.790> or<00:02:41.220> I'll<00:02:42.220> just<00:02:42.370> take

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
course of the video or I'll just take

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:50.080 
course of the video or I'll just take
that

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.140 

yes<00:02:51.530> it's<00:02:52.530> actually<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.550> presidency<00:02:54.000> how

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
yes it's actually the presidency how

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.150 
yes it's actually the presidency how
many<00:02:54.300> people<00:02:54.630> can't<00:02:55.170> quite<00:02:55.470> get<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.860> depth

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
many people can't quite get the depth

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.350 
many people can't quite get the depth
perception<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.890> hand<00:02:59.160> mainly<00:02:59.880> when<00:03:00.240> it's

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
perception of the hand mainly when it's

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.660 
perception of the hand mainly when it's
in<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.600> 2d<00:03:00.900> screen<00:03:01.230> I've<00:03:01.380> really<00:03:01.710> had<00:03:02.430> anyone

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
in the 2d screen I've really had anyone

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.410 
in the 2d screen I've really had anyone
try<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.090> yet<00:03:03.240> with<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.450> VR<00:03:04.050> enabled<00:03:05.300> but<00:03:06.300> oh

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
try it yet with the VR enabled but oh

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.260 
try it yet with the VR enabled but oh
yeah<00:03:06.600> definitely<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:07.520> design<00:03:08.520> issue<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:09.090> think

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
yeah definitely a design issue to think

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.810 
yeah definitely a design issue to think
about<00:03:09.510> for<00:03:09.750> when<00:03:10.350> designing<00:03:11.340> things<00:03:11.610> like

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
about for when designing things like

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.460 
about for when designing things like
this<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.060> probably<00:03:12.360> applicable<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:13.110> control

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
this and probably applicable to control

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.620 
this and probably applicable to control
vr<00:03:13.800> as<00:03:13.950> well<00:03:14.210> people<00:03:15.210> not<00:03:15.390> quite

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
vr as well people not quite

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.220 
vr as well people not quite
understanding<00:03:16.320> how<00:03:17.040> far<00:03:17.280> away<00:03:17.370> things<00:03:17.520> are<00:03:19.820> so

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
understanding how far away things are so

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.050 
understanding how far away things are so
yeah<00:03:22.230> actually<00:03:22.440> quickly<00:03:22.950> for<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.580> difficulty

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
yeah actually quickly for the difficulty

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.650 
yeah actually quickly for the difficulty
up<00:03:24.210> so<00:03:24.450> he'll<00:03:24.720> actually<00:03:24.870> take<00:03:25.440> my<00:03:26.660> king

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
up so he'll actually take my king

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.960 
up so he'll actually take my king
because<00:03:28.290> on<00:03:28.650> low<00:03:28.860> difficulties<00:03:29.430> he'll<00:03:29.640> wait<00:03:29.940> a

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
because on low difficulties he'll wait a

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.520 
because on low difficulties he'll wait a
while<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.570> not<00:03:30.690> actually<00:03:31.050> do<00:03:31.200> anything

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
while and not actually do anything

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.360 
while and not actually do anything
Torres<00:03:31.950> annoying<00:03:33.110> let's<00:03:34.110> lose<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.530> Queen<00:03:34.830> why

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
Torres annoying let's lose the Queen why

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
not yeah so this I guarantee this will

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.280 
not yeah so this I guarantee this will
be<00:03:48.810> out<00:03:48.930> by<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.380> end<00:03:49.920> of<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.340> month<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:51.750> first

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
be out by the end of the month so first

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.590 
be out by the end of the month so first
of<00:03:52.440> August<00:03:52.770> is<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.160> deadline<00:03:56.330> well<00:03:57.330> that's

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
of August is the deadline well that's

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.900 
of August is the deadline well that's
good<00:03:57.750> like<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.500> see<00:03:58.680> what<00:03:58.800> causes<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.160> do

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
good like to see what causes that do

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.750 
good like to see what causes that do
that<00:04:00.030> later<00:04:01.100> so<00:04:02.100> yeah<00:04:02.220> there's<00:04:02.670> probably

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
that later so yeah there's probably

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.280 
that later so yeah there's probably
still<00:04:03.120> some<00:04:03.180> optimizations<00:04:03.989> that<00:04:04.050> could<00:04:04.200> be

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
still some optimizations that could be

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.330 
still some optimizations that could be
made<00:04:06.320> I'll<00:04:07.320> just<00:04:07.560> move<00:04:07.680> this<00:04:07.830> king<00:04:08.070> forward

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
made I'll just move this king forward

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.190 
made I'll just move this king forward
lose<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:10.489> little<00:04:11.489> bit

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
lose a little bit

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.990 
lose a little bit
yeah<00:04:14.489> made<00:04:15.489> a<00:04:15.519> change<00:04:15.819> this<00:04:16.090> text<00:04:16.329> here<00:04:16.630> here's

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
yeah made a change this text here here's

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000 
yeah made a change this text here here's
the<00:04:19.000> fonts<00:04:19.329> good<00:04:19.570> but<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.109> color<00:04:20.350> with<00:04:20.979> the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
the fonts good but the color with the

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.680 
the fonts good but the color with the
new<00:04:21.280> room<00:04:21.489> is<00:04:21.669> clearly<00:04:21.940> wrong<00:04:22.150> which<00:04:22.479> is<00:04:22.540> the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
new room is clearly wrong which is the

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.969 
new room is clearly wrong which is the
first<00:04:22.900> i've<00:04:23.050> actually<00:04:23.199> played<00:04:23.380> it<00:04:23.770> through<00:04:23.889> a

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
first i've actually played it through a

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.710 
first i've actually played it through a
checkmate<00:04:24.460> before<00:04:24.850> seven<00:04:25.150> actually<00:04:25.389> noticed

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
checkmate before seven actually noticed

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.820 
checkmate before seven actually noticed
it<00:04:26.220> but<00:04:27.220> yeah<00:04:27.430> I<00:04:27.460> make<00:04:27.880> that<00:04:27.990> maybe<00:04:28.990> a<00:04:29.110> sigh

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
it but yeah I make that maybe a sigh

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.560 
it but yeah I make that maybe a sigh
anything<00:04:30.340> maybe<00:04:30.580> dark<00:04:30.910> blue<00:04:32.190> hey<00:04:33.190> that's<00:04:34.090> all

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
anything maybe dark blue hey that's all

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.850 
anything maybe dark blue hey that's all
for<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.020> video<00:04:35.460> we'll<00:04:36.460> catch<00:04:36.669> you<00:04:36.820> later
