00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.139
 the competition news of Friday 27 March 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.780
 it is more than 250 years old and was in need of renovation today 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:17.110
 started to get music again from oldest organ in nijmegen but just one 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.110
 making a few new organ pipes is not done very quickly 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.000
 it is like the church organ of nijmegen and that was also a bit 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.589
 to notice the trail of the lutheran church on the prince hendrikstraat it already descends 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:35.720
 from the recession already 56 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.150
 and has also experienced a few buildings 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.100
 now the organ is restored to its former glory with the organ builder in reclaimed wine 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.720
 Nevertheless 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.340
 so you wouldn't say it 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.340
 this is a completely new college 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.610
 the union of the university in japan 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.700
 but henk van rekum also has a lot of respect for the elderly and the 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.380
 original 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.840
 George of the Lutheran Church in Nijmegen anyway as much as possible in the old 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.600
 be restored 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.020
 especially the restoration of 19 40 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.900
 that is very special even in the city the original pipelink 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.890
 how long there has been and they have urgently cut off more than 40 ordinary ones 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.070
 we are vandalism 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.070
 it sounds way too soft 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.040
 2 because it appeals badly, the restoration is now very different 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.270
 today with a metaphor the organ pipes large according to the original method 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.950
 the eighteenth century Nijmegen 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.310
 usually expires and child on canvas 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.409
 and that is not so easy i do see luck that i see all the power to it 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.180
 to himself 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.760
 I am not going to move a small booty abroad over a large number 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.110
 to do it on smaller trucks in the winter 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.730
 he intended 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.010
 the intention is to run as nicely as possible displaced pour the milk from 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.330
 be less western 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
 with a lot of patience the desired result will eventually come 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.240
 today the organ committee of the Lutheran church also came to take a look 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.429
 The church spends 2 tons to have the organ restored 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.590
 and the damage of the modernization of 19 40 paris saint germain 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.950
 electric kamathi is tracture with everyone 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:20.999
 NVB and electrical connections on the cliffs did not work 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:27.009
 the stentor that suddenly made a very strange noise during the in style of color and 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:29.689
 well that could not be argued 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.740
 in 2011 it must all sound perfect again 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.760
 in the Lutheran church
