stake in the ring then there's one more
angel<00:03:15.540> whose<00:03:16.169> fold<00:03:16.500> will<00:03:16.829> go<00:03:16.980> back-to-back<00:03:17.459> so

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
angel whose fold will go back-to-back so

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.349 
angel whose fold will go back-to-back so
all<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.299> folds<00:03:18.659> are<00:03:18.750> touching<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.650> again

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
all the folds are touching and again

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.890 
all the folds are touching and again
staple<00:03:21.359> the<00:03:21.750> skirt<00:03:22.549> staple<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.669> wing<00:03:23.879> at<00:03:24.569> that

staple the skirt staple the wing at that

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.839 
staple the skirt staple the wing at that
slide<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.859> these<00:03:26.099> ones<00:03:26.400> still<00:03:26.669> aren't

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
slide and these ones still aren't

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.819 
slide and these ones still aren't
stapled<00:03:27.389> together<00:03:27.540> so<00:03:28.349> we've<00:03:28.500> pulled<00:03:28.680> them

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
stapled together so we've pulled them

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.689 
stapled together so we've pulled them
together<00:03:28.979> firmly<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:30.090> staple<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.680> staple<00:03:32.150> I

together firmly and staple and staple I

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:37.189 
together firmly and staple and staple I
can<00:03:35.699> see<00:03:35.909> that<00:03:36.090> those<00:03:36.269> wings<00:03:36.540> don't<00:03:36.840> exactly

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
can see that those wings don't exactly

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.809 
can see that those wings don't exactly
match<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:37.769> this<00:03:37.949> is<00:03:38.099> your<00:03:38.220> chance<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.669> just

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
match so this is your chance to just

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.479 
match so this is your chance to just
have<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.030> little<00:03:39.209> bit<00:03:39.479> of<00:03:39.659> time<00:03:40.590> trimming<00:03:41.370> it

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
have a little bit of time trimming it

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.430 
have a little bit of time trimming it
and<00:03:42.120> making<00:03:42.479> sure<00:03:42.599> they<00:03:42.750> all<00:03:42.840> match<00:03:43.079> up<00:03:43.109> as

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
and making sure they all match up as

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.670 
and making sure they all match up as
nicely<00:03:43.650> as<00:03:43.889> possible<00:03:44.359> so<00:03:45.359> there's<00:03:45.569> no<00:03:45.750> extra

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
nicely as possible so there's no extra

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.159 
nicely as possible so there's no extra
layers<00:03:46.979> showing<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:48.150> make<00:03:48.329> it<00:03:48.479> look<00:03:48.629> neater<00:03:48.870> by

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
layers showing to make it look neater by

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.960 
layers showing to make it look neater by
the<00:03:49.229> time<00:03:49.500> you're<00:03:49.709> finished<00:03:51.979> and<00:03:52.979> this<00:03:53.699> one

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
the time you're finished and this one

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.780 
the time you're finished and this one
again<00:03:54.239> just<00:03:54.449> needs<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.930> bit<00:03:55.079> of<00:03:55.199> a<00:03:55.260> trim<00:03:55.609> to<00:03:56.609> tie

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
again just needs a bit of a trim to tie

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.110 
again just needs a bit of a trim to tie
tie<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.389> it<00:03:57.629> up<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.799> now<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.069> can<00:03:59.400> see<00:03:59.639> if<00:04:00.000> you

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
tie the it up and now you can see if you

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.179 
tie the it up and now you can see if you
put<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.419> angel<00:04:00.750> on<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.900> table<00:04:01.379> she<00:04:01.799> stands<00:04:02.040> up

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
put the angel on the table she stands up

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.640 
put the angel on the table she stands up
ever<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:02.699> easily<00:04:02.879> or<00:04:03.870> she<00:04:04.019> could<00:04:04.139> stand<00:04:04.349> on<00:04:04.530> the

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
ever so easily or she could stand on the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.449 
ever so easily or she could stand on the
top<00:04:04.799> of<00:04:04.829> your<00:04:05.040> tree
