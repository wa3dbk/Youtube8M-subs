00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.429
 now that mobile 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:15.880
 and I say that look at artistic composition of 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.880
 part of the cameraman 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:28.450
 the day that suddenly a favorite dish 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.180
 that is, a selection plate does not have 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.010
 another thing more than doing it put in 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.379
 front of a camera take off 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.540
 the photo with your selection plate to mode 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.540
 of homage a mermaid is 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.790
 but 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:55.030
 Argentine as famous that go in the 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.030
 neighborhood making that money because the 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.560
 ingredients 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.370
 this is estimating flying from witnesses to 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.370
 sea ​​ball 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.540
 coffee with milk with 200 grams of butter 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.540
 plant capo nothing 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.810
 karpaty batimat iba has three eggs 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.210
 active active smoothies you separated in 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.970
 two mixtures 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.780
 one of bastardear 200 grams of flour 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.780
 leavening 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.850
 or cubic centimeters in the coffee not the 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.880
 coffee powder but coffee the liquid 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.860
 luckily 100 cubic centimeters and the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.090
 another would be 200 grams of flour 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.580
 leavening and 100 grams of 200 thousand meters 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.390
 cubic of milk cream well now 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.390
 dani asked me a question 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.369
 would make 40 color near you can use the 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.150
 40 girl who colom files and have color 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.850
 nor does he have a hearty spoonful in this 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.710
 amount of flour 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.409
 now let's marble or marble putting 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.390
 like spoonfuls of the coffee mixture and 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.200
 now I'm going to interpolate spoon 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.200
 mix 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.890
 why 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.500
 to the oil mixture arm yourself 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.080
 partner and have the other mix you 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.420
 one of the two mixtures sits and I go sea 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.440
 flying with that of beliefs and that of 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.300
 cream 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.150
 then I put there are a few spoonfuls 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.430
 lost up once I go to 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.710
 put a coffee one on top of a cream 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.630
 like a coffee and so you're preparing 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:44.370
 this mix is ​​coming a key moment 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.550
 because marble is not done nothing 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.640
 what is done now is 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:54.620
 now I'm not going to show you how 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:57.200
 my life because I see that people do not 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.000
 always always a lot of money in 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.400
 mantecada and floured good more 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.400
 frustrating after this book 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.510
 nothing very bad in my life I'm not going to 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.730
 create but now in tragedy 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.640
 Bastien did the insurance and jam and it's 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.230
 as easy as this interspersed 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.420
 mixing spoons two colors and 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.690
 with a knife what I do is very 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.989
 as a little step to mix little in 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.810
 just like that in his carrara marble 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.440
 it's a Carrara marble mixing what 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.440
 you pass the knife or fork too 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.180
 barbon on is a crazy marble not too 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.670
 because if it is not mixed it would make you look 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.880
 for you want to make a decent home the 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.880
 sea 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:58.120
 many many things because if we do not pass 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.620
 of and of returning it is going to mix the 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.980
 colors 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.680
 it's a bit something very important when 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.930
 stain with mixture the edges of the 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.970
 Güinera is going to take it out because if it is not 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.030
 they are going to burn there was going to be burnt smell 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.310
 in your letter and it's not what you want 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.040
 this you're going to cook medium oven 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.109
 approximately 40 minutes it 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.820
 it grows because it has color nothing 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.460
 you have to be doubt it more you live 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.100
 your value for 40 minutes soon 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.940
 it grows 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.979
 giants the flour in front 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.800
 up above all this these battles 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.840
 in gwinnett you have a free place because 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.580
 it's okay to be pretty inclusive 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.680
 growing up there once 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.430
 be cold guys back in this 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.430
 chocolate bath 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:50.669
 to 200 grams of chopped chocolate with 100 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:54.559
 grams of melted butter or in the 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.559
 average microwave 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.380
 look 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.380
 and this is undoubtedly 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:07.819
 a capuchin boeing 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.050
 It is a good cappuccino because it has 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:11.749
 chocolate above 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:16.100
 we dedicate this image we put a candle 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:20.480
 up for today 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:22.550
 I know that sometimes you do not see it because you 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.220
 daughter I can not work here sometimes 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:29.889
 he does not see us but when he sees us a lot of help 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:33.440
 very big always 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:36.480
 they demand something please 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.880
 Enjoy it with friends if what you express 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.770
 because these are only a few 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.980
 cut them fried and you're taking out one by one 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.360
 and you're eating it amazing and the fact 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.390
 If there was a lot of noise, 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.910
 chocolate is a good foot to take us 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:54.240
 to san antonio de areco small 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.750
