00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.200
 with the passage of time the doors of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.060
 home may we begin to 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.920
 deteriorate that they drop a little 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.260
 that with the dilatations have been 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.190
 bloated and these are caused 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.340
 friction 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.890
 that are so uncomfortable and that we also 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.600
 deteriorate the floors good for 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.550
 solve it is very simple simply 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.469
 we have to brush the door for the 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.539
 lower part look I'm going to show you 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.449
 how to do it in a comfortable way and 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:51.219
 safe for the welfare of your door 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.769
 dry yourself with the help of a pencil and a 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.710
 Piece of wood or cardboard that goes 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:59.019
 to help raise a few millimeters of 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.610
 height the tip of the pencil with respect to 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.879
 the door so I can draw a 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.239
 line that serves as a reference for the 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.239
 brushed 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.670
 if in your case what you want to do is 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.250
 brush the door because you are going to change 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.630
 the floor and you're going to mount a stage what 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.790
 what you have to do is make this same 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.640
 operation but instead of with the wedge 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.560
 with a piece of stage also a 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.869
 piece of stage you're going to put more 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.000
 insulator you put it in its place and 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.350
 you draw again with the good pencil 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.270
 now what we have left is to take the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.759
 door to take us to the workshop and 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.170
 look with the help of this nail you're going to 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.140
 do in a very common way 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.689
 you put it here at the end of the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.110
 door to be able to release easily 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:50.250
 the lost ones you just have to step on 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.250
 and hold the sheet 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.960
 in this way avoids the struggle with the 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.610
 door and be able to damage the fence good 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.610
 we take it and we take it to the workshop 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.070
 well let's finish holding the 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.050
 door it is convenient that you place a 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.820
 blanket or something soft between the door and the 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.310
 work bench so as not to deteriorate the 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.110
 with some movement look to do the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.690
 brushing we will use a brush 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.480
 electrical with which we put some 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.860
 glasses and now before you start 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.440
 brush what we have to do is 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.200
 regulate the depth of brushing that 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.470
 we are going to give by means of this one how and the 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.010
 numbered regulation that has there we 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.830
 indicates how deep we are going to give 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.260
 the plate 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.360
 for the rebate that we are going to make in this 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.590
 case let's go little by little we're going to 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.099
 regular 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.250
 in 0.5 to give a soft first pass 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.290
 and see the result of we have them and 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.220
 let's attach to the brush also a 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:07.069
 vacuum cleaner so we keep the space of 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.069
 clean work we light 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.970
 and now to avoid that like any 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.020
 other cutting tool splinter us 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.730
 the exit 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.670
 if you notice the door is built 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.800
 with a ribbon around here the brush at 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.260
 leaving you can deteriorate 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.930
 this part of the sheet we are going to make 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.250
 a small rebate here that will be the 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.070
 exit so that when we go 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.870
 brushing in this sense the machine does not 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.830
 go outside and do not have problems 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.830
 look good 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.450
 well as you have seen we have done the 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:11.580
 first met and now we're going to go 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.580
 brushing from the other side 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.319
 Clear 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.970
 we have made a first pass of 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.450
 approach and we're going to do the 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.450
 following 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.810
 and ready then the work we have already 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.430
 finished now we can go to 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.710
 put it in its place but look 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.510
 taking advantage of that we have it here we are going to 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.430
 try to repair a little before 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.430
 they found hello all this know those 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.229
 well then once we have posted the 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.229
 door let's check the result 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.720
 the friction problem we already have 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.910
 removed now we just have to repair 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.980
 the ground but this I will show you in 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.450
 another good video so now what 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:12.240
 you have to do is check your doors 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.240
 and if some slash you already know how to repair it
