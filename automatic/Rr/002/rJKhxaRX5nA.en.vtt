on the top and on the bottom now the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.850 
on the top and on the bottom now the
bottom<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.520> live<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:08.970> because<00:01:09.350> it<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.530> I

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
bottom I can live with because it just I

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.219 
bottom I can live with because it just I
don't<00:01:11.400> know<00:01:11.550> it's<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.300> little<00:01:12.420> bit<00:01:12.630> more

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
don't know it's just a little bit more

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.770 
don't know it's just a little bit more
appealing<00:01:13.619> now<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> whole<00:01:14.550> idea<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.479> I

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
appealing now the whole idea for this I

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.280 
appealing now the whole idea for this I
guess<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.310> case<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.820> fit<00:01:18.180> better<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.720> don't

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
guess is the case is fit better I don't

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.200 
guess is the case is fit better I don't
know<00:01:19.409> at<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.070> top<00:01:20.310> here<00:01:20.490> when<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.700> first<00:01:20.970> did

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
know at the top here when I first did

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.990 
know at the top here when I first did
this<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.570> tried<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.020> line<00:01:22.259> up<00:01:22.500> these<00:01:23.130> sides<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
this I tried to line up these sides and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.910 
this I tried to line up these sides and
that's<00:01:24.509> not<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:24.750> point<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.440> this<00:01:25.649> side

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
that's not the point they have this side

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.070 
that's not the point they have this side
open<00:01:26.460> here<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.270> actually<00:01:27.420> line<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
open here to actually line up so the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.760 
open here to actually line up so the
sensors<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:28.770> shine<00:01:29.009> through<00:01:29.600> um<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.770> still

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
sensors can shine through um I still

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.170 
sensors can shine through um I still
don't<00:01:31.950> see<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.100> point<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.700> because<00:01:32.970> now

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
don't see the point of that because now

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.730 
don't see the point of that because now
it<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.420> looks<00:01:33.690> crooked<00:01:34.080> up<00:01:34.320> here<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.649> way

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
like it put it back on and line it up

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.339 
like it put it back on and line it up
pretty<00:02:29.069> well<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:29.790> like<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.120> said<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:31.020> does

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
pretty well so like I said this does

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.770 
pretty well so like I said this does
line<00:02:31.650> up<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.980> little<00:02:32.310> bit<00:02:32.430> weird<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.390> have

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
line up a little bit weird you you have

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.040 
line up a little bit weird you you have
to<00:02:33.989> line<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.230> up<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:35.430> left<00:02:35.879> side<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.540> more

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
to line it up to the left side so more

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.750 
to line it up to the left side so more
is<00:02:37.260> showing<00:02:37.770> on<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.099> left<00:02:38.340> side<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.580> your

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
is showing on the left side of your

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.229 
is showing on the left side of your
speaker<00:02:39.300> as<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.260> look<00:02:40.470> at<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.709> phone<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.239> the

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
speaker as you look at the phone and the

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.280 
speaker as you look at the phone and the
right<00:02:42.420> side<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:42.720> going<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.930> be<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.050> little<00:02:43.140> bit

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
right side is going to be a little bit

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.500 
right side is going to be a little bit
closer<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:43.980> we've<00:02:44.550> actually<00:02:44.730> got<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:45.209> lined

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
closer so we've actually got this lined

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.900 
closer so we've actually got this lined
up<00:02:45.720> pretty<00:02:46.140> well<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.739> we're<00:02:47.610> going<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.760> go

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
up pretty well and we're going to go

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.820 
up pretty well and we're going to go
ahead<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.090> push<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.540> bubbles<00:02:48.900> out<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.349> the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
ahead and push the bubbles out and the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.100 
ahead and push the bubbles out and the
solution<00:02:50.640> that's<00:02:50.819> underneath<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:51.420> now<00:02:51.900> this

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
solution that's underneath this now this

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.710 
solution that's underneath this now this
is<00:02:52.170> going<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.860> look<00:02:53.010> bad<00:02:53.250> for<00:02:53.280> about<00:02:53.700> 24<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.300> 48

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
is going to look bad for about 24 to 48

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.199 
is going to look bad for about 24 to 48
hours<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.440> they<00:02:56.250> do<00:02:56.310> suggest<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.970> try<00:02:57.150> to

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
hours and they do suggest to try to

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.210 
hours and they do suggest to try to
leave<00:02:57.450> your<00:02:57.599> phone<00:02:57.900> off<00:02:58.140> for<00:02:58.170> 24<00:02:58.620> hours<00:02:58.800> if

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
leave your phone off for 24 hours if

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.020 
leave your phone off for 24 hours if
possible<00:02:59.849> and<00:03:00.140> you<00:03:01.140> know<00:03:02.010> settle<00:03:02.430> all<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.819> up

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
possible and you know settle all that up

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.270 
possible and you know settle all that up
get<00:03:03.360> all<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.660> bubbles<00:03:03.810> out<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.410> hopefully

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
get all the bubbles out and hopefully

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.220 
get all the bubbles out and hopefully
you<00:03:05.519> have<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> pretty<00:03:06.120> good<00:03:06.180> install<00:03:06.720> on<00:03:06.960> that

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
you have a pretty good install on that

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.300 
you have a pretty good install on that
so<00:03:08.150> pretty<00:03:09.150> straightforward<00:03:09.960> right<00:03:10.140> guys<00:03:10.410> and

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
so pretty straightforward right guys and

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.430 
so pretty straightforward right guys and
I'm<00:03:11.640> kind<00:03:12.239> of<00:03:12.360> happy<00:03:12.569> with<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.050> way<00:03:13.170> that<00:03:13.319> it

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
I'm kind of happy with the way that it

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.250 
I'm kind of happy with the way that it
lined<00:03:13.709> up<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.190> i<00:03:14.640> I'm<00:03:15.150> still<00:03:15.630> bothered<00:03:16.050> by<00:03:16.080> the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
lined up I i I'm still bothered by the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.820 
lined up I i I'm still bothered by the
cutouts<00:03:16.770> and<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.870> again<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:19.140> don't<00:03:19.650> know<00:03:19.709> how

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
cutouts and I again I don't know how

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.650 
cutouts and I again I don't know how
we're<00:03:19.980> going<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.130> get<00:03:20.280> around<00:03:20.550> that<00:03:20.730> maybe

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
we're going to get around that maybe

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.390 
we're going to get around that maybe
it'll<00:03:21.840> be<00:03:21.930> clear<00:03:22.200> enough<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.770> won't<00:03:23.250> see

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
it'll be clear enough that I won't see

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.640 
it'll be clear enough that I won't see
it<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:23.880> won't<00:03:24.060> bother<00:03:24.239> but<00:03:24.690> they<00:03:25.230> do<00:03:25.290> have

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
it and I won't bother but they do have

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.500 
it and I won't bother but they do have
this<00:03:25.830> cut<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.220> little<00:03:26.489> bit<00:03:26.670> short<00:03:27.000> around<00:03:27.420> the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
this cut a little bit short around the

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.720 
this cut a little bit short around the
sides<00:03:27.750> in<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.170> top<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.680> corners<00:03:29.099> to

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
sides in the top and the corners to

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.600 
sides in the top and the corners to
allow<00:03:30.330> for<00:03:30.360> cases<00:03:31.349> that<00:03:31.560> kind<00:03:31.830> of<00:03:31.950> fold<00:03:32.310> over

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
but same thing here they did go a little

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.800 
but same thing here they did go a little

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
bit shorter on the sides now I think

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.960

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
this is a wet install it just seemed

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.880 
this is a wet install it just seemed
like<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.330> was<00:04:12.450> kind<00:04:12.630> of<00:04:12.810> sliding<00:04:13.319> around<00:04:13.709> a

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
like it was kind of sliding around a

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.969 
like it was kind of sliding around a
little<00:04:14.099> bit<00:04:14.280> too<00:04:14.489> much<00:04:14.640> and<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.870> kind<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.680> got

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
little bit too much and I kind of got

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.060
