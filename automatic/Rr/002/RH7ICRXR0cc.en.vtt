and definitely worth getting also yeah
I'm<00:04:08.750> just<00:04:08.900> checking<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.380> chest<00:04:09.770> over<00:04:10.070> here

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
I'm just checking the chest over here

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.720 
I'm just checking the chest over here
there's<00:04:10.910> a<00:04:11.060> little<00:04:11.360> bit<00:04:11.600> of<00:04:12.160> more<00:04:13.160> there's<00:04:13.670> a

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
there's a little bit of more there's a

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.340 
there's a little bit of more there's a
little<00:04:13.940> bit<00:04:14.120> more<00:04:14.270> stuff<00:04:14.630> and<00:04:14.900> then<00:04:15.020> I<00:04:15.140> get<00:04:15.320> to

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
little bit more stuff and then I get to

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.479 
little bit more stuff and then I get to
the<00:04:16.190> part<00:04:16.430> where<00:04:16.489> there<00:04:16.820> is<00:04:17.060> a<00:04:17.350> lot<00:04:18.350> of<00:04:18.489> armor

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
the part where there is a lot of armor

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.490 
the part where there is a lot of armor
so<00:04:19.850> as<00:04:19.940> you<00:04:20.060> can<00:04:20.150> see<00:04:20.299> i<00:04:20.329> broke<00:04:20.630> that<00:04:20.660> chest<00:04:21.169> and

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
so as you can see i broke that chest and

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.950 
so as you can see i broke that chest and
tons<00:04:22.340> of<00:04:22.520> iron<00:04:22.669> armor<00:04:23.030> just<00:04:23.270> come<00:04:23.450> spilling

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
tons of iron armor just come spilling

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.200 
tons of iron armor just come spilling
out<00:04:24.169> my<00:04:24.500> guess<00:04:24.740> is<00:04:24.950> that<00:04:24.980> chest<00:04:25.580> is<00:04:25.820> their<00:04:26.030> iron

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
out my guess is that chest is their iron

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.960 
out my guess is that chest is their iron
armor<00:04:26.630> chest<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:27.290> they<00:04:27.560> had<00:04:28.010> a<00:04:28.040> bunch<00:04:28.400> in

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
armor chest and they had a bunch in

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.840 
armor chest and they had a bunch in
there<00:04:29.530> but<00:04:30.530> now<00:04:30.740> it's<00:04:30.919> all<00:04:31.040> gone<00:04:31.220> because<00:04:31.550> I

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
there but now it's all gone because I

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.000 
there but now it's all gone because I
blew<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.090> up<00:04:32.300> and<00:04:32.600> have<00:04:32.750> us<00:04:32.900> even<00:04:33.200> more<00:04:33.230> iron

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
blew it up and have us even more iron

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.100 
blew it up and have us even more iron
armor<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:34.640> guessing<00:04:35.150> they<00:04:35.450> had<00:04:35.570> to<00:04:35.750> double

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
armor so guessing they had to double

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.140 
armor so guessing they had to double
chests<00:04:36.410> full<00:04:36.560> of<00:04:36.620> iron<00:04:36.950> armor<00:04:37.310> so<00:04:37.760> that's

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
chests full of iron armor so that's

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.640 
chests full of iron armor so that's
pretty<00:04:38.390> good<00:04:38.540> right<00:04:39.380> here<00:04:40.190> I<00:04:40.220> find<00:04:40.640> in

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
pretty good right here I find in

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.980 
pretty good right here I find in
unbreaking<00:04:42.650> one<00:04:42.950> efficiency<00:04:43.940> one<00:04:44.120> pickups<00:04:44.690> I

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
unbreaking one efficiency one pickups I

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.350 
unbreaking one efficiency one pickups I
think<00:04:45.260> it<00:04:45.350> is<00:04:45.500> and<00:04:45.890> then<00:04:46.640> a<00:04:46.700> forceout<00:04:47.030> diamond

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
think it is and then a forceout diamond

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.930 
think it is and then a forceout diamond
armor<00:04:47.630> which<00:04:47.810> is<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.020> good<00:04:48.500> meantime<00:04:49.100> because

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
armor which is a good meantime because

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.210 
armor which is a good meantime because
if<00:04:50.270> you<00:04:50.390> get<00:04:50.570> your<00:04:50.600> MC<00:04:50.990> mo<00:04:51.320> level<00:04:51.710> up<00:04:51.830> you<00:04:52.040> can

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
if you get your MC mo level up you can

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.310 
if you get your MC mo level up you can
salvage<00:04:52.520> that<00:04:52.910> into<00:04:53.270> diamonds<00:04:53.479> then<00:04:54.080> you<00:04:54.200> can

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
salvage that into diamonds then you can

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.990 
salvage that into diamonds then you can
sell<00:04:54.530> those<00:04:54.650> diamonds<00:04:55.010> at<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.430> shop<00:04:55.700> and

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
it's always good to take diamond armor

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.860 
it's always good to take diamond armor
and<00:05:00.979> if<00:05:01.729> I<00:05:01.850> was<00:05:01.970> smart<00:05:02.120> i<00:05:02.479> should<00:05:02.660> take<00:05:02.810> a

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
and if I was smart i should take a

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.020 
and if I was smart i should take a
number<00:05:03.380> but<00:05:03.740> I<00:05:03.919> didn't<00:05:04.280> think<00:05:04.370> of<00:05:04.520> that<00:05:04.580> at<00:05:04.729> the

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
number but I didn't think of that at the

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.659 
number but I didn't think of that at the
time<00:05:05.240> but<00:05:05.930> yeah<00:05:06.110> the<00:05:06.380> video<00:05:06.770> is<00:05:07.130> about<00:05:07.340> down
