00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
it and that's rare for me I don't

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.480

usually play games to that extent it's

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.460 
usually play games to that extent it's
not<00:01:41.670> perfect<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.450> anything<00:01:42.899> there<00:01:43.079> are<00:01:43.200> some

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
not perfect like anything there are some

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.050 
not perfect like anything there are some
issues<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> game<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.280> will<00:01:44.549> say<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.820> I

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
issues as the game I will say that I

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.710 
issues as the game I will say that I
think<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.570> first<00:01:45.840> one<00:01:46.049> for<00:01:46.619> me<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:48.570> fact

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
think the first one for me is the fact

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.780 
think the first one for me is the fact
that<00:01:48.869> there<00:01:49.079> aren't<00:01:49.229> really<00:01:49.380> enough<00:01:49.680> tanks<00:01:50.399> or

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
that there aren't really enough tanks or

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.270 
that there aren't really enough tanks or
that<00:01:51.689> there's<00:01:51.930> certainly<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.770> sense<00:01:53.100> of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
that there's certainly not the sense of

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.859 
that there's certainly not the sense of
the<00:01:53.340> tank<00:01:53.670> combat<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.270> got<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.659> Red

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
the tank combat you got in a Red

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.990

vehicles<00:02:14.469> so<00:02:15.469> I<00:02:15.799> reckon<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.519> will<00:02:16.639> come

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
vehicles so I reckon that will come

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.259 
vehicles so I reckon that will come
sooner<00:02:17.269> or<00:02:17.450> later<00:02:17.540> anyway<00:02:18.459> but<00:02:19.459> for<00:02:19.939> me<00:02:20.060> this

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
sooner or later anyway but for me this

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.369 
sooner or later anyway but for me this
is<00:02:21.909> probably<00:02:22.909> the<00:02:23.209> best<00:02:23.389> World<00:02:23.810> War<00:02:23.959> 2<00:02:24.139> FPS

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
is probably the best World War 2 FPS

getting<00:03:25.729> the<00:03:25.819> kill<00:03:26.030> how<00:03:26.569> satisfying<00:03:27.229> it<00:03:27.439> is<00:03:28.629> so

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
getting the kill how satisfying it is so

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.920 
getting the kill how satisfying it is so
like<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.069> say<00:03:31.430> it's<00:03:32.060> one<00:03:32.209> of<00:03:32.299> my<00:03:32.359> favorites<00:03:32.810> I

like I say it's one of my favorites I

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.240 
like I say it's one of my favorites I
mean<00:03:33.049> it<00:03:33.199> doesn't<00:03:33.439> have<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.560> scale<00:03:33.949> with<00:03:34.220> a

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
mean it doesn't have the scale with a

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.009 
mean it doesn't have the scale with a
game<00:03:34.459> like<00:03:34.609> World<00:03:34.790> War<00:03:34.879> 2<00:03:35.180> online<00:03:35.419> which<00:03:35.840> is<00:03:35.989> a

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.690 
mean i love the maps in this look at the
destruction<00:03:58.710> look<00:03:58.860> at<00:03:58.980> this<00:03:59.040> one<00:03:59.220> of<00:03:59.310> urban

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
destruction look at this one of urban

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.850 
destruction look at this one of urban
environment<00:04:00.240> I'm<00:04:00.360> in<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.780> I<00:04:01.260> mean<00:04:01.530> there's<00:04:01.710> so

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
environment I'm in and I mean there's so

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.710 
environment I'm in and I mean there's so
many<00:04:02.010> good<00:04:02.250> maps<00:04:02.460> minimum<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.150> my<00:04:03.330> favorites

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720

probably this there's a one called grain

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.330 
probably this there's a one called grain
factory<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:07.110> it's<00:04:07.260> just<00:04:07.440> this<00:04:07.560> hive<00:04:07.920> like

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
factory and it's just this hive like

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.670 
factory and it's just this hive like
looks<00:04:08.790> like<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:08.940> 30-story<00:04:09.630> building<00:04:09.810> where<00:04:10.590> you

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
looks like a 30-story building where you

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.560
