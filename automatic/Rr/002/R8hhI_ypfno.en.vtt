all<00:00:33.850> the<00:00:33.969> stuff<00:00:34.149> that<00:00:34.180> I've<00:00:34.360> compiled<00:00:34.840> in<00:00:35.770> my

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
all the stuff that I've compiled in my

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.389 
all the stuff that I've compiled in my
in<00:00:36.280> my<00:00:36.510> notes<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:37.719> stuff<00:00:37.899> like<00:00:38.020> that<00:00:38.079> so<00:00:38.530> the

in my notes and stuff like that so the

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.459 
in my notes and stuff like that so the
first<00:00:39.670> run<00:00:39.940> defense<00:00:40.270> that<00:00:40.480> I<00:00:40.539> think<00:00:40.899> that<00:00:41.110> we

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
first run defense that I think that we

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.080 
first run defense that I think that we
need<00:00:41.500> to<00:00:41.649> do<00:00:41.800> focus<00:00:42.039> on<00:00:42.250> this<00:00:42.489> is<00:00:42.610> number<00:00:42.820> five

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
need to do focus on this is number five

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.869 
need to do focus on this is number five

nature<00:01:42.790> so<00:01:43.330> it's<00:01:43.570> great<00:01:43.780> run<00:01:44.080> defense<00:01:44.410> but

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
nature so it's great run defense but

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.670 
nature so it's great run defense but
it's<00:01:45.160> not<00:01:45.370> the<00:01:45.550> best<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.960> terms<00:01:47.140> of<00:01:47.350> pressure

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
it's not the best in terms of pressure

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.130 
it's not the best in terms of pressure
in<00:01:48.670> terms<00:01:49.090> of<00:01:49.270> coverage<00:01:49.480> in<00:01:49.810> terms<00:01:50.020> of

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
in terms of coverage in terms of

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.200 
in terms of coverage in terms of
whatever<00:01:50.470> you<00:01:50.650> want<00:01:50.800> to<00:01:50.890> do<00:01:51.040> with<00:01:51.220> it<00:01:51.460> it's<00:01:52.060> not

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
whatever you want to do with it it's not

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.690 
whatever you want to do with it it's not
flexible<00:01:52.750> enough<00:01:52.930> in<00:01:53.200> my<00:01:53.350> opinion<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:53.980> that's

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
flexible enough in my opinion and that's

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.630 
flexible enough in my opinion and that's
why<00:01:54.940> it<00:01:55.000> comes<00:01:55.420> in<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.690> number<00:01:55.810> four<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
why it comes in to number four the

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.000 
why it comes in to number four the
number<00:01:57.730> three<00:01:58.060> run<00:01:58.240> defense<00:01:58.600> in<00:01:58.840> medan<00:01:59.770> file

just it shuts down everything guys I
don't<00:02:40.010> know<00:02:40.190> why<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.400> does<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:41.360> just<00:02:41.600> does<00:02:41.780> the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
don't know why it does it just does the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.470 
don't know why it does it just does the
quarterback<00:02:42.500> blitzes<00:02:43.240> that's<00:02:44.240> it<00:02:44.420> so

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
quarterback blitzes that's it so

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.750 
quarterback blitzes that's it so
effective<00:02:45.410> for<00:02:45.620> stopping<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.460> run<00:02:46.550> in<00:02:46.670> this

game<00:02:46.850> but<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.270> one<00:02:47.420> problem<00:02:47.660> is<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.410> is<00:02:48.560> a

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
game but the one problem is it is a

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.020 
game but the one problem is it is a
quarterback<00:02:49.070> blitz<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.550> if<00:02:49.640> they're<00:02:49.820> on

cover three out of this or I could

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.310 
cover three out of this or I could
minime<00:03:41.690> up<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:41.930> can<00:03:42.080> make<00:03:42.170> different

adjustments<00:03:42.950> based<00:03:43.070> off<00:03:43.280> what<00:03:43.430> my<00:03:43.520> opponents

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
adjustments based off what my opponents

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.120 
adjustments based off what my opponents
doing<00:03:44.270> but<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.959> key<00:03:45.200> is<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:45.800> want<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.040> have

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
so exotic that it's going to blow up the

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.890 
so exotic that it's going to blow up the
inside<00:04:53.880> run<00:04:54.150> which<00:04:54.330> I<00:04:54.420> really<00:04:54.630> like<00:04:54.870> about

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
inside run which I really like about

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.800 
inside run which I really like about
this<00:04:55.260> run<00:04:55.470> defense<00:04:55.740> guys<00:04:55.920> in<00:04:56.730> my<00:04:56.970> opinion<00:04:57.330> it's

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
this run defense guys in my opinion it's

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.270 
this run defense guys in my opinion it's
one<00:04:57.990> of<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.140> best<00:04:58.290> run<00:04:58.470> offensive<00:04:58.830> in<00:04:58.920> I<00:04:59.070> think

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
one of the best run offensive in I think

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.500 
one of the best run offensive in I think
it's<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.400> best<00:04:59.550> running<00:04:59.820> fits<00:05:00.060> in<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.330> game

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
it's the best running fits in the game

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.750 
it's the best running fits in the game
at<00:05:01.260> least<00:05:01.470> it's<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.800> most<00:05:01.980> dominant<00:05:02.430> for<00:05:02.640> me

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
at least it's the most dominant for me

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.610 
at least it's the most dominant for me
it's<00:05:03.390> very<00:05:03.450> decent<00:05:04.140> against<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:04.440> pass

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
it's very decent against the pass

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.530 
it's very decent against the pass
obviously<00:05:05.310> guys<00:05:05.430> in<00:05:05.610> this<00:05:05.700> game<00:05:05.790> you're<00:05:06.390> not

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
obviously guys in this game you're not

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.790 
obviously guys in this game you're not
going<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:06.720> have<00:05:06.840> a<00:05:06.870> play<00:05:07.170> that's<00:05:07.380> bulletproof

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
going to have a play that's bulletproof

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.980 
going to have a play that's bulletproof
against<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.280> run<00:05:08.430> and<00:05:08.640> the<00:05:08.730> pass<00:05:09.000> but<00:05:09.780> it<00:05:09.810> is

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
against the run and the pass but it is

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.660 
against the run and the pass but it is
very<00:05:10.080> affected<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.740> sugar<00:05:10.950> blitz<00:05:11.250> guys<00:05:11.430> it's

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
very affected the sugar blitz guys it's

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.430 
very affected the sugar blitz guys it's
a<00:05:11.760> man<00:05:12.000> coverage<00:05:12.420> you're<00:05:12.810> going<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.050> get<00:05:13.140> right

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
a man coverage you're going to get right

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.380 
a man coverage you're going to get right
edge<00:05:13.620> pressure<00:05:13.950> out<00:05:14.220> of<00:05:14.250> it<00:05:14.460> when<00:05:14.880> you<00:05:14.940> send<00:05:15.300> it

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
edge pressure out of it when you send it

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.730 
edge pressure out of it when you send it
like<00:05:15.480> this<00:05:15.690> I<00:05:15.930> think<00:05:16.230> it's<00:05:16.350> one<00:05:16.500> of<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.650> most

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
like this I think it's one of the most

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.260 
like this I think it's one of the most
underrated<00:05:17.040> run<00:05:17.340> defenses<00:05:17.700> in<00:05:17.820> the<00:05:17.850> game<00:05:18.090> now

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
underrated run defenses in the game now

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.540 
underrated run defenses in the game now
I'm<00:05:18.570> thinking<00:05:18.660> you<00:05:18.900> guys<00:05:19.050> can<00:05:19.350> use<00:05:19.620> it<00:05:19.800> to

it's<00:05:53.490> very<00:05:53.730> similar<00:05:54.060> it's<00:05:54.360> actually<00:05:54.630> called

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
it's very similar it's actually called

the<00:05:54.840> cat<00:05:55.110> caplets<00:05:55.980> I<00:05:56.070> apologize<00:05:56.550> but<00:05:57.300> it's<00:05:57.840> the

the cat caplets I apologize but it's the

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.390 
the cat caplets I apologize but it's the
same<00:05:58.170> kind<00:05:58.440> of<00:05:58.500> concept<00:05:58.680> you're<00:05:59.130> just<00:05:59.280> going

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
same kind of concept you're just going

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.460 
same kind of concept you're just going
to<00:05:59.460> flip<00:05:59.640> the<00:05:59.910> play<00:06:00.150> to<00:06:00.780> which<00:06:00.990> side<00:06:01.260> they're

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
to flip the play to which side they're

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.530 
to flip the play to which side they're
strong<00:06:01.740> so<00:06:02.040> if<00:06:02.400> they're<00:06:02.670> strong<00:06:02.940> right<00:06:03.240> you're

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
strong so if they're strong right you're

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.760 
strong so if they're strong right you're
going<00:06:03.660> to<00:06:03.720> leave<00:06:03.930> it<00:06:04.050> stock<00:06:04.290> if<00:06:04.590> they're

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
going to leave it stock if they're

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:05.960 
going to leave it stock if they're
strong<00:06:05.010> left<00:06:05.310> you're<00:06:05.460> going<00:06:05.580> to<00:06:05.640> flip<00:06:05.820> the

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
strong left you're going to flip the
