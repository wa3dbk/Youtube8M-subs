00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
the league again which i think is very

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.750 
the league again which i think is very
defeatist<00:01:35.470> certainly<00:01:35.979> you<00:01:36.310> know<00:01:36.340> there's<00:01:36.640> a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
defeatist certainly you know there's a

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.570 
defeatist certainly you know there's a
chance<00:01:37.390> oh<00:01:37.690> yeah<00:01:38.200> can<00:01:38.409> turn<00:01:38.620> it<00:01:38.830> around<00:01:39.010> and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
chance oh yeah can turn it around and

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.000

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.219 
within it so to wave goodbye this point
I<00:01:42.190> think<00:01:42.729> that's<00:01:43.150> not<00:01:43.299> a<00:01:43.330> good<00:01:43.510> sign<00:01:43.570> frankly

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
battle really although I did think that

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.219 
battle really although I did think that
before<00:02:07.659> the<00:02:07.750> last<00:02:07.930> match<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.410> then

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
before the last match and then

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.800 
before the last match and then
what<00:02:09.470> happened<00:02:09.769> okay<00:02:10.429> yeah<00:02:10.909> well<00:02:11.360> the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
what happened okay yeah well the

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.289 
what happened okay yeah well the
over-under<00:02:12.379> market<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.860> overs<00:02:13.129> 1.85<00:02:13.909> and<00:02:14.239> the

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
over-under market the overs 1.85 and the

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.699 
over-under market the overs 1.85 and the
under<00:02:14.599> is<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:16.840> which<00:02:17.840> way'd<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:18.110> lean<00:02:18.409> on<00:02:18.440> that

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
under is to which way'd you lean on that

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.979 
under is to which way'd you lean on that
market<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:19.220> would<00:02:19.940> probably<00:02:20.090> lean<00:02:20.450> towards<00:02:20.810> to

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
market I would probably lean towards to

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.420 
market I would probably lean towards to
be<00:02:21.080> under<00:02:21.379> on<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.620> one<00:02:21.769> I<00:02:21.799> know<00:02:21.890> it's<00:02:22.190> it's

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
be under on that one I know it's it's

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.910 
be under on that one I know it's it's
not<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.849> bookies<00:02:23.120> favourite<00:02:23.569> but<00:02:24.200> you've<00:02:24.769> a

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
not the bookies favourite but you've a

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.220 
not the bookies favourite but you've a
they've<00:02:25.549> got<00:02:25.700> such<00:02:25.849> a<00:02:25.879> fantastic<00:02:26.209> defense<00:02:26.959> and

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
they've got such a fantastic defense and

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.690 
they've got such a fantastic defense and
you<00:02:27.410> know<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.560> good<00:02:27.799> midfield<00:02:28.220> in<00:02:28.400> front<00:02:28.610> of

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
you know a good midfield in front of

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.530 
you know a good midfield in front of
them<00:02:28.760> as<00:02:28.849> well<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.030> think<00:02:29.150> it's<00:02:29.330> going<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.480> be

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
them as well I think it's going to be

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.020 
them as well I think it's going to be
very<00:02:29.599> difficult<00:02:29.870> for<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.590> Madrid<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.670> score

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
very difficult for a Madrid to the score

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.089 
very difficult for a Madrid to the score
against<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.540> side<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:33.110> going<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:33.950> be

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
against a side that going to be

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.680 
against a side that going to be
determined<00:02:34.370> not<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.940> anymore<00:02:35.180> girls<00:02:35.510> I'm

determined not to anymore girls I'm

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.050 
determined not to anymore girls I'm
sure<00:02:35.900> mhm<00:02:36.560> what<00:02:37.069> about<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.370> both<00:02:37.519> teams<00:02:37.849> to

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.119 
sure mhm what about the both teams to
score<00:02:38.090> market<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:39.049> that<00:02:39.079> is<00:02:39.799> that<00:02:39.920> other<00:02:39.980> than

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
score market is that is that other than

score market is that is that other than
a<00:02:40.159> possible<00:02:40.549> know<00:02:40.879> or<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:41.299> that<00:02:41.390> sort<00:02:41.569> of<00:02:41.629> a

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
a possible know or is that sort of a

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.550 
a possible know or is that sort of a
plat<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.470> pass<00:02:42.799> on<00:02:43.099> that<00:02:43.670> bed<00:02:44.030> well<00:02:44.989> yeah

average<00:02:45.980> old<00:02:46.420> 1.92<00:02:47.420> for<00:02:47.870> no<00:02:48.019> I<00:02:48.290> think<00:02:48.859> that's<00:02:49.040> a

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
average old 1.92 for no I think that's a

average old 1.92 for no I think that's a
that's<00:02:49.549> a<00:02:49.700> reasonable<00:02:50.090> bet<00:02:50.359> I<00:02:50.900> think<00:02:51.260> that's

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
that's a reasonable bet I think that's

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.559 
that's a reasonable bet I think that's
what<00:02:51.470> I<00:02:51.500> might<00:02:51.739> look<00:02:51.859> at<00:02:52.069> myself<00:02:52.430> okay<00:02:53.180> now

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
what I might look at myself okay now

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.720 
what I might look at myself okay now

the way through this competition we

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:13.809 
the way through this competition we

good their midfielders and I think you'd

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.750 
good their midfielders and I think you'd
be<00:03:21.109> very<00:03:21.260> foolish<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:21.889> underestimate<00:03:21.950> in<00:03:22.609> this

could that be a way to go if you want

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.219 
could that be a way to go if you want
sort<00:04:14.900> of<00:04:14.989> tread<00:04:15.199> carefully<00:04:15.609> and<00:04:16.630> if<00:04:17.630> I<00:04:18.019> was

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
sort of tread carefully and if I was

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.779 
sort of tread carefully and if I was
looking<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:18.769> back<00:04:18.919> one<00:04:19.190> side<00:04:19.430> all<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.579> other

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
looking to back one side all the other

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.339 
looking to back one side all the other
than<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:20.060> think<00:04:20.269> I<00:04:20.359> probably<00:04:20.570> go<00:04:20.870> through<00:04:20.900> your

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
than I think I probably go through your

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.170 
than I think I probably go through your
Ventus<00:04:21.739> draw<00:04:22.070> no<00:04:22.250> bet

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
Ventus draw no bet

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.360 
Ventus draw no bet
so<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.479> might<00:04:24.960> be<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.110> way<00:04:25.259> to<00:04:25.289> go<00:04:25.500> all<00:04:26.099> right

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
so that might be a way to go all right

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.369 
so that might be a way to go all right
