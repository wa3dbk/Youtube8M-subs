00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:11.580
 Yes, let's go, I'm wondering if you stay in a syntax that I wondered 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:14.670
 Here it is one one one first two is to learn eye is it this is medicine Toka usage of interrogative + pain 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.700
 What say meaning contains the I mean bought the Ttsu Toka say Tsu wear Toka how to 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.320
 warm 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:25.150
 The number of confirmations is another one is a syntax that comes to a stop and often appears 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.779
 I'd had syntax because let's say in the video about the last time last time out may be to other syntax 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.520
 There is 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:32.279
 Together because we are sure that the Tteyuu First let's look at this question +2 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.140
 Interrogative + Call 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.680
 I heard the technique and translated it, for example, it should be broken, and what should I say about being two-word English ? 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.180
 Or 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:46.110
 500 after it is present and whether the parent the same as it should be after the one I went to say Uichi 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.550
 It should be somewhere in the translation and weights and a good not goods and Fuuniosu should wear smoothly and that 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.300
 I don't know Amber but this wind and it's 2 I wonder who should bookstore Unjo 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.540
 It will come out occasionally to Tteyuu 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.460
 2 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:01.340
 how to this it is ho how in what should be a bookstore Furiosu After the literal translation It is a frequent NYA 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.960
 It It is often translate I cormorants NYA of way 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:08.300
 How is it actually used? It feels like wear and child with cd don 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.590
 I did not know she did not know 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.560
 Where should I go to wear children ? Where should I go? 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.590
 Use in this kind of wind 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.010
 I will 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:24.280
 Next is the second one , let's know the nonstop and common syntax and its rewrite 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:28.010
 First of all, it's already common in junior high school, though 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:32.720
 It is too drunk to translate this as 2 way 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.820
 For example, the I mean the other in the two-body yard to work meeting the day is this English is his 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.910
 I was too tired 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:43.790
 I couldn't work any more at work and couldn't work anymore He was too tired to work any more 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:48.890
 It means that there was no Egi more than that 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.900
 It was easier to understand that I didn't do it now . The princess is 2 translation. He's too tired to work. 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.110
 I hope I did not 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:59.740
 And you can rewrite it 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:00.670
 Tteyuu What good or say when the books and the bookstore because it is very this Kuranaga I Nagasato Zong is the village syntax a 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.670
 It is the meaning 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.050
 You can get the wealth that you can not do by using the can 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:11.830
 It is a whole other tick Don and Boaku Imotoa means that day 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:18.640
 It seems that the keyword was very tired and the cafe was very tired 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:23.970
 He said that he couldn't work any more, so it 's very difficult to say "Kuranagari" in this mountain. 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:27.030
 A bookstore is meaningful, and it can be rewritten like this 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.470
 Comes out may be one more expression Tteyuu this Enough 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.700
 Aim to read a book in a normal group Aid enough to be able to read a book and still have a book after all 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.000
 There is a meaning to do 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.490
 I think this is a bit confusing, so please take a look at this beauty 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.920
 If it translates directly into the treasure Hina common issue and saves it 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:50.900
 Take a posh enough to go to school like a movie enough to do anything 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:55.370
 He is taking a shot with enough sound enough to be cool 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.930
 I I I he is feeling kind of like a good year radar went English school 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.049
 And if the rewrite goes wild 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.560
 If the first one can be in so Ayers and cormorant child or parent 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:07.250
 Ie cheese and old ass and save Kobe 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.380
 This will be exactly the same 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.790
 Hey he 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.450
 When enough to go school are taking enough year 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.750
 It feels like a he I feel a good age be carried out school Tteyuu 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:23.079
 You can also rewrite this Kuranagari too 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:29.200
 Why scratch unlikely to be very a so book or bookstore 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:32.060
 It is save and start Sea-chan No. He He go school in're taking a very old 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.520
 Will be the same 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:40.870
 Let's acquire the above knowledge using practice questions 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:44.980
 First of all, it's a word that comes out today before today is this shite witch 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.760

 You know what should I do the next and then to do what I do not know how can I of i don 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.920
 It is that what to do is to say that there is no 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:12.660
 Toulouse is the answer, divided by what you should do 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.660
 Aidonto Watch 2 Lou 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:23.730
 If you do not know what to what to do then it is should be 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:29.150
 Is this ok? Is this tool a verb with the meaning of a verb? 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:36.810
 Then before he is Heroes patio that knows how to drive a bicycle Noah automobile

 Please use the expression of the disciple like this and get used to it by all means 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:58.439
 First, try to rewrite the next third translate English It is a rewrite of the following from the shell to your familiar a part 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:05:03.689

 If it is not, I felt that it was springing last night. I was too tired last night and could not do my homework. 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:22.979
 It will be said 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:24.330
 Because it is very a when it is going to rewrite using this expectation, the creation of a book or Hoya is that 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:30.330
 It is good to use 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:34.409

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.330

 The point here is still at the time of this Enough is 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:10.040
 Kind Ina If you try to become normal then it seems so indoor headache and the word order here for a moment 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:15.530
 I think some people are confusing, but please be careful not to make a mistake here 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:18.060
 Simple Neuner 2 It's like the Earth 2 of the General Assembly . 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:22.290
 ok 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:23.820
 Next 4 last birds are a million fathers Seoul city the t can by this 

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:29.430
 it was a place 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:30.330
 My dad is a major rich so rich he can buy him a camber 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.720
 I can do it 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:36.780
 the this were place it is this watch 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:41.670
 So to rewrite this using Inaf 

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:45.210
 My father sly Cheena usually par think the wind say that it is enough disagreement change 

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:51.000
 This is quite the same if you say like this 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:53.710
 Spacey question word +2 which I questioned here is ok? 

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.960
 Syntax and leaving well with non-stop and after that of 

00:07:53.710 --> 00:08:02.620
 I studied the opportunity or that knowledge is enough just to be summarized here 

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:08.700
 After that, if you simply memorize it, you will soon forget it 

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:08.700
 Let's actually find successive generations and practice well so that you can do it yourself with no hints
