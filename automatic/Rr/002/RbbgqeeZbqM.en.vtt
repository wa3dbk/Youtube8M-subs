it's more authentic and you got to know

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.259 
it's more authentic and you got to know
that<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.160> characters<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.670> little<00:03:19.970> bit<00:03:20.090> more

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
that the characters a little bit more

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.449 
that the characters a little bit more
it's<00:03:20.450> not<00:03:20.660> just<00:03:20.930> about<00:03:21.140> blowing<00:03:21.620> stuff<00:03:21.980> up<00:03:22.190> so

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459

of<00:03:24.800> the<00:03:24.890> game<00:03:24.980> even<00:03:25.310> though<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.519> was<00:03:25.700> short<00:03:26.650> and

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
of the game even though it was short and

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.590 
of the game even though it was short and
the<00:03:27.950> multi-player<00:03:28.489> yeah<00:03:28.700> it<00:03:29.060> feels<00:03:29.300> kind<00:03:29.540> of

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
the multi-player yeah it feels kind of

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.080 
the multi-player yeah it feels kind of
solid<00:03:30.019> kind<00:03:30.200> of<00:03:30.260> polished<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:31.280> me<00:03:31.400> at<00:03:31.519> all<00:03:31.550> lots

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
solid kind of polished to me at all lots

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.840 
solid kind of polished to me at all lots
of<00:03:32.239> game<00:03:32.989> modes<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:33.950> it<00:03:34.310> adds<00:03:34.459> for<00:03:34.730> the

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
of game modes so it adds for the

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.340 
of game modes so it adds for the
versatility<00:03:35.239> in<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.540> game<00:03:35.750> which<00:03:36.320> is

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
versatility in the game which is

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.520 
versatility in the game which is
something<00:03:36.860> that<00:03:36.950> I<00:03:37.010> really<00:03:37.310> appreciate<00:03:37.970> and

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
something that I really appreciate and

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.900 
something that I really appreciate and
