00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
to use a funnel this is to avoid pouring

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.089 
to use a funnel this is to avoid pouring
oil<00:03:18.239> all<00:03:18.359> over<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.689> front<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.170> engine<00:03:22.099> to

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
oil all over the front of the engine to

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.910 
oil all over the front of the engine to
begin<00:03:23.400> with<00:03:23.609> we<00:03:24.209> started<00:03:24.659> by<00:03:24.840> pouring<00:03:25.200> 2.5

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
begin with we started by pouring 2.5

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.699 
begin with we started by pouring 2.5
litres<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.430> fresh<00:03:26.700> oil<00:03:27.230> it's<00:03:28.230> likely<00:03:28.530> there'll

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
litres of fresh oil it's likely there'll

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.569 
litres of fresh oil it's likely there'll
be<00:03:28.769> some<00:03:29.099> residual<00:03:29.519> oil<00:03:29.760> left<00:03:30.030> in<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.359> engine

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
be some residual oil left in the engine

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.720 
be some residual oil left in the engine
we<00:03:32.579> then<00:03:32.760> pull<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.060> dipstick<00:03:33.239> have<00:03:34.079> a<00:03:34.200> look

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
we then pull the dipstick have a look

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.250 
we then pull the dipstick have a look
this<00:03:35.730> flattened<00:03:36.150> area<00:03:36.540> on<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.959> dipstick

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
this flattened area on the dipstick

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.289 
this flattened area on the dipstick
shows<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:37.859> minimum<00:03:38.189> and<00:03:38.310> maximum<00:03:38.400> markings

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
shows the minimum and maximum markings

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.360 
shows the minimum and maximum markings
and<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.569> coating<00:03:40.349> of<00:03:40.409> oil<00:03:40.560> shows<00:03:40.859> the<00:03:41.040> level

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
and the coating of oil shows the level

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.190 
and the coating of oil shows the level
in<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.669> engine<00:03:41.969> as<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.450> can<00:03:42.599> see<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.959> level

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
in the engine as you can see the level

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.149 
in the engine as you can see the level
is<00:03:43.290> very<00:03:43.349> close<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:44.159> maximum<00:03:45.980> we<00:03:46.980> might

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
is very close to the maximum we might

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.659 
is very close to the maximum we might
clean<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.669> dipstick<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:49.099> reinsert<00:03:50.099> it<00:03:50.340> into

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
clean the dipstick and reinsert it into

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:56.110 
clean the dipstick and reinsert it into
its<00:03:50.819> tube<00:03:53.090> we<00:03:54.090> then<00:03:54.269> add<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.780> touch<00:03:55.109> more<00:03:55.349> oil

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
its tube we then add a touch more oil

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.819 
its tube we then add a touch more oil
and<00:03:57.120> we<00:03:57.719> recheck<00:03:58.169> the<00:03:58.349> level<00:04:00.290> as<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:01.409> can<00:04:01.590> see

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
and we recheck the level as you can see

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:11.060 
and we recheck the level as you can see
level<00:04:02.400> is<00:04:02.489> very<00:04:02.699> near<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.120> top<00:04:03.329> now

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.830 

replace<00:04:12.070> the<00:04:12.220> dipstick<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:15.450> all<00:04:16.450> that's<00:04:16.660> left

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
replace the dipstick and all that's left

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:26.700 
replace the dipstick and all that's left
to<00:04:16.900> do<00:04:17.110> is<00:04:17.320> remove<00:04:17.920> the<00:04:18.130> funnel<00:04:25.320> place<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.560> oil

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
to do is remove the funnel place the oil

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.770 
to do is remove the funnel place the oil
filler<00:04:27.040> cap<00:04:29.730> without<00:04:30.730> cloth<00:04:31.090> just<00:04:31.570> give

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
filler cap without cloth just give

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.130
