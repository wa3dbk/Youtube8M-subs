right you see my feet are a little bit

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.119 
right you see my feet are a little bit
away<00:00:54.600> from<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.840> machine<00:00:55.170> elbows<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
away from the machine elbows in the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.979 
away from the machine elbows in the
fixed<00:00:56.430> position<00:00:56.550> hands<00:00:57.090> are<00:00:57.270> really<00:00:57.510> relaxed

fixed position hands are really relaxed
and<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> position<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:01:00.270> going

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
and this is the position that I'm going

another way notice a real subtle way to

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.570 
another way notice a real subtle way to
kind<00:02:17.960> of<00:02:18.050> let<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.380> weight<00:02:18.590> get<00:02:18.860> engaged<00:02:19.250> into

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
kind of let the weight get engaged into

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.220 
kind of let the weight get engaged into
a<00:02:19.640> certain<00:02:19.970> body<00:02:20.150> part<00:02:20.540> before<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:20.960> start

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
a certain body part before you start

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.550 
a certain body part before you start
hitting<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:22.700> small<00:02:23.330> exhale<00:02:23.960> almost<00:02:24.470> a

hitting it is a small exhale almost a

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.250 
hitting it is a small exhale almost a
little<00:02:24.850> just<00:02:25.850> like<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.120> at<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.870> beginning
