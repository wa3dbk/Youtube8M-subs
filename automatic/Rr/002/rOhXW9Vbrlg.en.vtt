things I've been dealing with tooth
aches<00:01:17.140> ear<00:01:18.140> aches<00:01:18.560> because<00:01:19.220> of<00:01:19.520> my<00:01:19.610> tooth

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
aches ear aches because of my tooth

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.330 
aches ear aches because of my tooth
swollen<00:01:21.530> face<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.479> I<00:01:23.479> got<00:01:24.200> on<00:01:24.409> antibiotics

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
swollen face and I got on antibiotics

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.920 
swollen face and I got on antibiotics
but<00:01:25.640> they<00:01:25.820> didn't<00:01:26.090> prescribing<00:01:26.570> pain

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
but they didn't prescribing pain

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.490 
but they didn't prescribing pain
medicine<00:01:27.409> so<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:28.780> ibuprofen<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:30.289> I<00:01:30.319> was

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
medicine so the ibuprofen that I was

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.889 
medicine so the ibuprofen that I was
taking<00:01:30.830> wasn't<00:01:31.130> really<00:01:31.310> working<00:01:31.520> for<00:01:31.909> the

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
taking wasn't really working for the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.649 
taking wasn't really working for the
pain<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:33.470> I've<00:01:33.649> just<00:01:33.679> been<00:01:34.210> dealing<00:01:35.210> with<00:01:35.360> it

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
pain so I've just been dealing with it

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.710 
pain so I've just been dealing with it
but<00:01:35.990> um<00:01:36.229> I<00:01:36.670> still<00:01:37.670> managed<00:01:37.970> to<00:01:38.030> work<00:01:38.270> out<00:01:38.450> three

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
but um I still managed to work out three

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.279 
but um I still managed to work out three
times<00:01:38.869> this<00:01:39.140> week<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:40.090> I<00:01:42.940> kept<00:01:43.940> my<00:01:44.720> food

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
times this week and I kept my food

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.880 
times this week and I kept my food
portions<00:01:45.850> small<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.750> I<00:01:48.049> guess<00:01:48.319> that's<00:01:48.590> the

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
portions small so I guess that's the

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.510 
portions small so I guess that's the
reason<00:01:49.729> why<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:50.240> was<00:01:50.720> able<00:01:50.869> to<00:01:51.080> lose<00:01:51.770> even

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
reason why I was able to lose even

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.999 
reason why I was able to lose even
though<00:01:52.880> I<00:01:53.210> wasn't<00:01:53.630> working<00:01:53.869> out<00:01:54.110> as<00:01:54.500> much<00:01:54.740> as<00:01:54.799> I

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
though I wasn't working out as much as I

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.959 
though I wasn't working out as much as I
usually<00:01:55.220> do<00:01:55.659> I<00:01:57.190> am<00:01:58.479> 11.4<00:01:59.479> pounds<00:01:59.930> down<00:02:00.110> total

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
usually do I am 11.4 pounds down total

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.289 
usually do I am 11.4 pounds down total
because<00:02:01.969> my<00:02:02.149> starting<00:02:02.479> weight<00:02:02.509> was<00:02:02.860> 377

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
because my starting weight was 377

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.580 
because my starting weight was 377
point2<00:02:05.299> and<00:02:05.659> now<00:02:05.960> I'm<00:02:06.200> 360<00:02:07.159> 5.8<00:02:07.789> so<00:02:08.750> I'm<00:02:09.229> happy

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
point2 and now I'm 360 5.8 so I'm happy

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.490 
point2 and now I'm 360 5.8 so I'm happy
with<00:02:09.860> it<00:02:09.920> I<00:02:10.310> feel<00:02:10.640> good<00:02:10.880> I<00:02:11.299> see<00:02:11.959> changes<00:02:12.470> in

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.100 
the 60s so in order to do that I need to
lose<00:03:11.930> six<00:03:12.560> pounds<00:03:12.620> this<00:03:13.160> upcoming<00:03:13.970> week<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.690> I

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
lose six pounds this upcoming week and I

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.590
