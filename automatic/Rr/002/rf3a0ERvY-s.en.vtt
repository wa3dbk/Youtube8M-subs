00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:04.220 
oh boy

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.890 
oh boy
so<00:00:05.220> budget<00:00:05.670> magic<00:00:06.089> blue/green<00:00:06.779> evolved<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:08.900> lot

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
so budget magic blue/green evolved a lot

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.759 
so budget magic blue/green evolved a lot
of<00:00:10.139> stuff<00:00:10.620> but<00:00:11.160> we're<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:12.000> know<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.660> guess<00:00:13.469> we<00:00:13.620> can

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
of stuff but we're I know I guess we can

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.890 
of stuff but we're I know I guess we can
try<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.630> the<00:00:15.630> mana<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.020> definitely<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> concern

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.670 

not<00:00:21.900> having<00:00:22.320> access<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.769> green<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.430> blue<00:00:23.699> is

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
not having access to green and blue is

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.099 
not having access to green and blue is
problematic<00:00:25.680> Oh<00:00:26.689> looks<00:00:27.689> like<00:00:27.779> we're<00:00:27.990> up

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
problematic Oh looks like we're up

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.139 
problematic Oh looks like we're up
against<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.680> fact<00:00:31.489> I'll<00:00:32.489> be<00:00:32.700> enough<00:00:32.940> this

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
against in fact I'll be enough this

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.720 
against in fact I'll be enough this
might<00:00:33.630> not<00:00:33.840> be<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> worst<00:00:34.290> matchup<00:00:34.730> dependent

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
might not be the worst matchup dependent

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.690 
might not be the worst matchup dependent
and<00:00:35.820> they<00:00:35.880> don't<00:00:36.030> think<00:00:36.329> shakeout<00:00:36.809> Oh<00:00:37.700> our

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
and they don't think shakeout Oh our

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.090 
and they don't think shakeout Oh our
mana<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.270> gonna<00:00:39.480> kill<00:00:39.780> us<00:00:39.809> though<00:00:40.200> because<00:00:40.920> we

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
mana is gonna kill us though because we

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.530 
mana is gonna kill us though because we
kind<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.579> correct<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.120> evolving

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
kind of have to correct the evolving

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.709 
kind of have to correct the evolving
wilds<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:44.000> guess<00:00:45.000> we've<00:00:45.180> probably<00:00:45.360> got<00:00:45.570> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
wilds I guess we've probably got to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.920 
wilds I guess we've probably got to
crack<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.079> blue

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
crack it for blue

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.860 
crack it for blue
there's<00:00:48.930> her<00:00:49.170> anchor<00:00:53.449> because<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.690> more

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
there's her anchor because we have more

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.540 
there's her anchor because we have more
green<00:00:55.110> sources<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.770> guess<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.100> crack<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.370> for

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
green sources so I guess we crack it for

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.920 
green sources so I guess we crack it for
blue<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:58.520> hope<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.699> we<00:00:59.820> draw<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> green<00:01:00.390> see

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
blue and hope that we draw a green see

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.990 
blue and hope that we draw a green see
if<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.530> was<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> real<00:01:01.980> fetch<00:01:02.399> we<00:01:02.760> could<00:01:02.879> have

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
if this was a real fetch we could have

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.179 
if this was a real fetch we could have
cracked<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:04.640> bounced<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.119> glisten<00:01:06.630> Arale<00:01:07.189> or

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
cracked it bounced the glisten Arale or

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.899 
cracked it bounced the glisten Arale or
we<00:01:08.580> could<00:01:08.700> just<00:01:08.729> play<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.090> creature<00:01:09.390> ie<00:01:10.140> oh

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
we could just play the creature ie oh

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.120 
we could just play the creature ie oh
yeah<00:01:12.049> well<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:15.200> guess<00:01:16.200> we<00:01:16.320> got<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> pass<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.100> just

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
yeah well I guess we got a pass and just

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.270 
yeah well I guess we got a pass and just
start<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.820> boon<00:01:18.060> satyr

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
start a boon satyr

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.960 
start a boon satyr
satyr<00:01:20.280> Oh<00:01:21.560> yep<00:01:22.560> yep<00:01:22.759> yep

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
satyr Oh yep yep yep

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.440 
satyr Oh yep yep yep
yeah<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.710> play<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> creature<00:01:26.310> there<00:01:26.640> you

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
yeah so if we play a creature there you

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.770 
yeah so if we play a creature there you
probably<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.290> die<00:01:28.970> by<00:01:29.970> not<00:01:30.360> playing<00:01:30.689> a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
probably just die by not playing a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.550 
probably just die by not playing a
creature<00:01:31.939> we<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:33.060> access<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.630> rapid

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
creature we have access to rapid

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.120 
creature we have access to rapid
hybridization<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.670> vapor<00:01:36.090> snag<00:01:36.979> we're<00:01:37.979> just

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
hybridization and vapor snag we're just

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.350 
hybridization and vapor snag we're just
going<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> hope<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.520> our<00:01:38.700> opponent<00:01:39.090> assumes

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
going to hope that our opponent assumes

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.359 
going to hope that our opponent assumes
one<00:01:39.810> blue<00:01:40.049> mana<00:01:40.290> means<00:01:40.650> we<00:01:41.520> can't<00:01:41.729> do<00:01:41.850> anything

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
one blue mana means we can't do anything

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:52.109 
one blue mana means we can't do anything
another<00:01:44.369> rancor<00:01:45.079> all<00:01:46.079> right

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.620 

so<00:01:53.119> let's<00:01:53.329> take<00:01:53.570> five<00:01:54.049> more<00:01:54.409> poison<00:01:55.630> fire

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
so let's take five more poison fire

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.050 
so let's take five more poison fire
phone<00:01:56.840> is<00:01:57.110> there's<00:01:57.920> mutagenic<00:01:58.490> growth<00:01:58.729> well

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
phone is there's mutagenic growth well

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.330 
phone is there's mutagenic growth well
that<00:01:59.930> probably<00:02:00.200> means<00:02:00.619> their<00:02:00.920> opponent<00:02:01.250> has

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
that probably means their opponent has

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:09.040 
that probably means their opponent has
vines<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.890> then<00:02:04.039> we're<00:02:04.280> just<00:02:04.310> dead<00:02:06.970> yeah<00:02:08.050> all

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
vines and then we're just dead yeah all

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.520 
vines and then we're just dead yeah all
right

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
right

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:17.680 
right
lack<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.429> mana<00:02:11.890> get<00:02:12.890> us<00:02:13.040> in<00:02:15.819> boy<00:02:16.819> all<00:02:17.450> right

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
lack of mana get us in boy all right

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.320 
lack of mana get us in boy all right
against<00:02:18.410> in<00:02:18.650> fact<00:02:19.130> we<00:02:19.700> definitely<00:02:20.090> want<00:02:20.209> all

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
against in fact we definitely want all

against in fact we definitely want all
our<00:02:20.360> creature<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.290> stuff<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.700> think<00:02:22.910> we

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
our creature you stuff and I think we

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.670 
our creature you stuff and I think we
want<00:02:23.180> fogs<00:02:23.660> I'd<00:02:24.170> be<00:02:24.440> enough<00:02:25.450> fog<00:02:26.450> is<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:26.870> pretty

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
want fogs I'd be enough fog is a pretty

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.400 
want fogs I'd be enough fog is a pretty
sweet<00:02:28.010> way<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.250> slow<00:02:28.940> down<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.330> fact<00:02:29.660> they're

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
sweet way to slow down in fact they're

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.039 
sweet way to slow down in fact they're
usually<00:02:30.560> going<00:02:31.130> big<00:02:31.760> we<00:02:32.150> get<00:02:32.299> rid<00:02:32.420> of<00:02:32.480> man's<00:02:32.840> I

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
usually going big we get rid of man's I

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:39.460 
usually going big we get rid of man's I
think<00:02:35.620> sense<00:02:36.620> bouncing<00:02:38.080> sense<00:02:39.080> bouncing

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
think sense bouncing sense bouncing

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.289 
think sense bouncing sense bouncing
mutagenic<00:02:39.950> gross<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.430> one<00:02:40.610> drops<00:02:40.849> isn't<00:02:41.150> that

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
mutagenic gross and one drops isn't that

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.350 
mutagenic gross and one drops isn't that
great<00:02:41.680> if<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.860> get<00:02:43.099> such<00:02:43.310> an<00:02:43.430> odd<00:02:43.549> sideward<00:02:44.060> card

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
great if I get such an odd sideward card

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.330 
great if I get such an odd sideward card
but<00:02:44.599> this<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.080> one<00:02:45.230> matchup<00:02:45.470> where<00:02:45.799> it<00:02:45.920> should

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
but this is one matchup where it should

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.729 
but this is one matchup where it should
be<00:02:46.489> really<00:02:46.760> solid<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:47.989> I<00:02:48.019> think<00:02:48.110> in<00:02:48.380> this<00:02:48.530> match

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
be really solid so I think in this match

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.979 
be really solid so I think in this match
where<00:02:49.220> we<00:02:49.730> need<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.030> take<00:02:50.180> on<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.510> control

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
where we need to take on the control

more action when it goes with probe so I

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.170

know<00:03:26.989> about<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.440> snag<00:03:27.799> so<00:03:28.760> you<00:03:28.850> might<00:03:29.000> just

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
know about the snag so you might just

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
probably be the best draws on a troll

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.810 
probably be the best draws on a troll
down<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.520> 13<00:04:12.519> that's<00:04:13.519> not<00:04:13.760> bad<00:04:15.549> another<00:04:16.549> high

with<00:04:23.600> a<00:04:23.630> high<00:04:23.810> arc<00:04:24.050> know<00:04:27.610> what<00:04:28.610> are<00:04:28.700> the<00:04:28.820> odds

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
with a high arc know what are the odds

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.880 
with a high arc know what are the odds
of<00:04:29.240> our<00:04:29.330> plumbing<00:04:29.660> killing<00:04:30.440> us<00:04:30.590> next<00:04:30.860> turn<00:04:32.890> not

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
of our plumbing killing us next turn not

of our plumbing killing us next turn not
that<00:04:34.130> low<00:04:35.080> they<00:04:36.080> actually<00:04:36.380> a<00:04:36.410> forum<00:04:36.860> you<00:04:37.040> know

probably a land drop activate and come

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.030 
probably a land drop activate and come
off<00:04:40.690> yeah<00:04:41.690> I<00:04:42.050> don't<00:04:42.200> think<00:04:42.320> we<00:04:42.530> can<00:04:42.620> play<00:04:42.740> cloud

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
off yeah I don't think we can play cloud

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.920 
off yeah I don't think we can play cloud
fin<00:04:43.400> I<00:04:43.610> think<00:04:44.570> we<00:04:44.690> just<00:04:44.840> play<00:04:45.110> Geist<00:04:46.690> tak<00:04:47.690> with

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
fin I think we just play Geist tak with

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.920 
fin I think we just play Geist tak with
Bowl<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.860> hope<00:04:52.669> that<00:04:52.850> we<00:04:52.970> can<00:04:53.150> use<00:04:53.300> this<00:04:53.479> vapor

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
Bowl and hope that we can use this vapor

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:01.490 
Bowl and hope that we can use this vapor
snag<00:04:54.380> to<00:04:54.710> defend<00:04:55.100> us

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.280 

another<00:05:02.500> ink<00:05:02.770> wash<00:05:06.870> alright<00:05:07.870> it's<00:05:08.170> gonna

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
another ink wash alright it's gonna

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:27.090 
another ink wash alright it's gonna
tackle<00:05:08.680> the<00:05:08.920> ink<00:05:09.040> loss

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.160 

I<00:05:27.130> don't<00:05:27.760> think<00:05:27.820> we'll<00:05:28.090> cast<00:05:28.480> pay<00:05:28.780> per<00:05:28.840> se

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
I don't think we'll cast pay per se

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.850 
I don't think we'll cast pay per se
unless<00:05:29.410> our<00:05:29.710> opponent<00:05:30.190> starts<00:05:30.730> trying<00:05:31.120> to

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
unless our opponent starts trying to

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:38.760 
unless our opponent starts trying to

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
cast spells Rangers guy all right well I

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.040 
cast spells Rangers guy all right well I
think<00:05:39.040> that's<00:05:39.310> enough<00:05:39.640> for<00:05:39.970> us<00:05:40.060> to<00:05:40.090> run<00:05:40.870> out<00:05:41.020> of

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
think that's enough for us to run out of

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:51.270 
think that's enough for us to run out of
a<00:05:41.290> purse<00:05:41.530> neg<00:05:49.050> all<00:05:50.050> right<00:05:50.200> we're<00:05:50.410> taking<00:05:50.740> a<00:05:50.950> lot

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
a purse neg all right we're taking a lot

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:59.749 
a purse neg all right we're taking a lot
of<00:05:51.430> in<00:05:51.550> fact<00:05:51.790> damage

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:08.140 

well<00:06:00.449> there's<00:06:00.779> another<00:06:01.020> string<00:06:01.349> of<00:06:01.499> reduced

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.200 

and<00:06:23.150> we're<00:06:23.870> probably<00:06:24.050> dead<00:06:28.210> especially

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
and we're probably dead especially

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.180 
and we're probably dead especially
considering<00:06:29.690> our<00:06:29.720> opponent<00:06:30.230> had<00:06:30.890> another

land drop very close though

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:44.340 
land drop very close though
oh<00:06:34.420> they're<00:06:36.130> okay

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.350 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.050 

so<00:06:44.800> our<00:06:44.890> opponent<00:06:45.310> must<00:06:45.370> have<00:06:45.580> some<00:06:45.790> sort<00:06:45.910> of

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
so our opponent must have some sort of

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.740 
so our opponent must have some sort of
protection<00:06:46.600> or<00:06:46.930> trample<00:06:47.440> spell<00:06:48.750> otherwise

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
protection or trample spell otherwise

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.000 
protection or trample spell otherwise
I'm<00:06:49.990> not<00:06:50.230> sure<00:06:50.560> why<00:06:52.470> they<00:06:53.470> wouldn't<00:06:53.710> attack

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010 
I'm not sure why they wouldn't attack

00:06:54.010 --> 00:07:04.930 
I'm not sure why they wouldn't attack
with<00:06:54.250> bull

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:04.940 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.360 

and<00:07:05.510> we<00:07:05.960> still<00:07:06.260> do<00:07:06.440> nothing<00:07:06.830> so<00:07:07.070> it's<00:07:07.250> not

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370 
and we still do nothing so it's not

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:20.740 
and we still do nothing so it's not
going<00:07:07.550> to<00:07:07.610> matter

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.750 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:28.440 

well<00:07:21.380> I<00:07:21.770> guess<00:07:22.930> what<00:07:23.930> is<00:07:24.020> their<00:07:24.170> opponent<00:07:24.530> have

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.450 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.270 

they're<00:07:29.450> going<00:07:29.480> to<00:07:29.900> vine<00:07:30.440> to<00:07:30.650> the<00:07:30.680> vast<00:07:30.980> would

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 
they're going to vine to the vast would

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:40.360 
they're going to vine to the vast would
a<00:07:31.520> high<00:07:31.790> urge<00:07:37.330> and<00:07:38.410> that<00:07:39.410> means<00:07:39.680> we're<00:07:40.010> dead<00:07:40.190> if

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:40.370 
a high urge and that means we're dead if

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.100 
a high urge and that means we're dead if
our<00:07:40.520> opponent<00:07:40.700> just<00:07:41.060> attacks<00:07:41.510> with<00:07:41.720> both<00:07:41.900> of

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.110 
our opponent just attacks with both of

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.490 
our opponent just attacks with both of
them

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:42.500 
them

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:50.860 
them
oh<00:07:44.980> very<00:07:46.030> so<00:07:47.030> close<00:07:47.360> I<00:07:49.270> feel<00:07:50.270> like<00:07:50.420> we<00:07:50.570> could

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:50.870 
oh very so close I feel like we could

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.390 
oh very so close I feel like we could
have<00:07:51.170> won<00:07:51.440> this<00:07:51.590> match

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 
have won this match

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.340 
have won this match
but<00:07:53.710> our<00:07:54.710> opponent<00:07:55.670> managed<00:07:56.540> to<00:07:56.750> just<00:07:56.930> barely

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:57.350 
but our opponent managed to just barely

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.100 
but our opponent managed to just barely
pull<00:07:57.710> it<00:07:57.830> off<00:07:58.180> we<00:07:59.180> didn't<00:07:59.390> draw<00:07:59.540> our<00:07:59.660> big<00:07:59.810> trump

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:00.110 
pull it off we didn't draw our big trump

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:04.570 
pull it off we didn't draw our big trump
cards<00:08:01.960> having<00:08:02.960> even<00:08:03.260> one<00:08:03.590> of<00:08:03.890> our<00:08:04.070> pongo<00:08:04.400> fight

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:04.580 
cards having even one of our pongo fight

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.370 
cards having even one of our pongo fight
effects<00:08:05.030> should<00:08:05.600> have<00:08:05.720> been<00:08:05.870> enough<00:08:06.080> to<00:08:06.230> win

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:06.380 
effects should have been enough to win

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.760 
effects should have been enough to win
game<00:08:06.590> two<00:08:06.830> anyway<00:08:07.960> that's<00:08:08.960> it<00:08:09.110> for<00:08:09.320> now<00:08:09.410> be

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:09.770 
game two anyway that's it for now be
