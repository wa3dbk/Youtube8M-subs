00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.440 

so<00:00:01.660> I<00:00:02.050> happen<00:00:02.740> to<00:00:02.770> have<00:00:03.010> ordered<00:00:03.580> another

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:04.450 
so I happen to have ordered another

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.700 
so I happen to have ordered another
capacitor<00:00:05.259> as<00:00:05.500> you<00:00:05.799> can<00:00:05.950> see<00:00:06.450> it's<00:00:07.450> the<00:00:07.600> same

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
capacitor as you can see it's the same

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.940 
capacitor as you can see it's the same
micro<00:00:08.710> farad<00:00:09.190> range<00:00:09.429> is<00:00:09.790> the<00:00:10.269> original<00:00:10.630> one

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.830 

the<00:00:14.950> original<00:00:15.309> one<00:00:15.519> is<00:00:15.700> a<00:00:15.730> 43<00:00:16.690> to<00:00:17.440> 53<00:00:18.840> micro

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
the original one is a 43 to 53 micro

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.290 
the original one is a 43 to 53 micro
farad's<00:00:20.289> and<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:23.740> is<00:00:23.949> a<00:00:23.980> 43<00:00:24.609> to<00:00:24.730> 53

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
farad's and this is a 43 to 53

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.290 
farad's and this is a 43 to 53
microphone<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:27.189> um<00:00:27.760> you<00:00:28.539> need<00:00:29.260> to<00:00:29.439> take

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
microphone so um you need to take

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.910 
microphone so um you need to take
precautions<00:00:31.300> when<00:00:31.510> dealing<00:00:31.779> with<00:00:31.960> mic<00:00:32.380> with

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
precautions when dealing with mic with

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.650 
precautions when dealing with mic with
capacitors<00:00:33.520> because<00:00:33.700> they<00:00:34.059> can<00:00:34.300> hold<00:00:34.480> a

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
capacitors because they can hold a

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.340 
capacitors because they can hold a
charge

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
charge

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.340 
charge
sometimes<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.340> charge<00:00:36.640> is<00:00:36.880> quite<00:00:37.350> exciting

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
sometimes the charge is quite exciting

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.490 
sometimes the charge is quite exciting
so<00:00:38.680> you<00:00:39.219> need<00:00:39.340> to<00:00:39.430> be<00:00:39.550> very<00:00:39.670> careful<00:00:40.180> with

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
so you need to be very careful with

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.889 
so you need to be very careful with
capacitors<00:00:41.500> even<00:00:41.950> capacitors<00:00:42.550> that<00:00:42.820> may<00:00:43.719> not

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
capacitors even capacitors that may not

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.319 
capacitors even capacitors that may not
be<00:00:44.020> working<00:00:44.200> like<00:00:44.500> this<00:00:44.739> one<00:00:45.039> you<00:00:45.850> just<00:00:45.879> on<00:00:46.180> it

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
be working like this one you just on it

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.619 
be working like this one you just on it
in<00:00:47.230> this<00:00:47.350> case<00:00:47.559> this<00:00:48.309> capacitor<00:00:48.940> is<00:00:49.090> probably

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
in this case this capacitor is probably

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.970 
in this case this capacitor is probably
not<00:00:49.960> shorted<00:00:50.910> but<00:00:51.910> it<00:00:52.000> may<00:00:52.120> be<00:00:52.180> so<00:00:53.050> we<00:00:53.739> need<00:00:53.920> to

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
not shorted but it may be so we need to

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.130 
not shorted but it may be so we need to
be<00:00:54.100> careful<00:00:54.460> with<00:00:54.550> it<00:00:54.730> when<00:00:54.910> unplugging<00:00:55.329> it<00:00:55.600> so

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
be careful with it when unplugging it so

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.439 
be careful with it when unplugging it so
first<00:00:56.350> we<00:00:56.620> unplug<00:00:57.960> each<00:00:58.960> one<00:00:59.230> of<00:00:59.350> these

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
first we unplug each one of these

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.900 
first we unplug each one of these
terminals<00:01:01.449> and<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:03.219> I'll<00:01:03.309> go<00:01:03.430> ahead<00:01:03.609> and<00:01:03.760> plug

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
terminals and so I'll go ahead and plug

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.410 
terminals and so I'll go ahead and plug
it<00:01:04.119> and<00:01:04.360> plug<00:01:05.350> in<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.770> new<00:01:05.890> capacitor<00:01:06.549> you<00:01:07.210> can

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
it and plug in the new capacitor you can

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.460 
it and plug in the new capacitor you can
see<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.630> result<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:09.400> I've<00:01:09.549> been<00:01:09.670> plugged<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
see the result so I've been plugged the

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.510 
see the result so I've been plugged the
wires<00:01:11.710> that<00:01:12.040> went<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.760> capacitor<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.590> the

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
wires that went to the capacitor so the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.510 
wires that went to the capacitor so the
two<00:01:15.729> Blues<00:01:16.030> went<00:01:16.960> on<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.500> left-hand<00:01:18.009> terminal

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
two Blues went on the left-hand terminal

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.609 
two Blues went on the left-hand terminal
the<00:01:19.299> two<00:01:19.479> Reds<00:01:19.720> been<00:01:19.990> on<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.200> right-hand

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
the two Reds been on the right-hand

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.910 
the two Reds been on the right-hand
terminal<00:01:21.040> so<00:01:21.759> this<00:01:21.939> is<00:01:22.090> not<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.710> electrode<00:01:23.710> it

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
terminal so this is not a electrode it

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.560 
terminal so this is not a electrode it
is<00:01:24.040> an<00:01:24.130> electrolytic<00:01:24.610> capacitor<00:01:25.299> but<00:01:25.450> it's

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
is an electrolytic capacitor but it's

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.819 
is an electrolytic capacitor but it's
not<00:01:25.810> a<00:01:26.159> polarized<00:01:27.159> electrolytic<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.740> it

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
not a polarized electrolytic so it

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.160 
not a polarized electrolytic so it
probably<00:01:30.159> doesn't<00:01:30.340> matter<00:01:30.610> which<00:01:31.170> colors

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
probably doesn't matter which colors

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.160 
probably doesn't matter which colors
gone<00:01:32.409> which<00:01:32.619> side<00:01:32.890> just<00:01:33.220> make<00:01:33.310> sure<00:01:33.840> both<00:01:34.840> Reds

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
gone which side just make sure both Reds

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.289 
gone which side just make sure both Reds
go<00:01:35.439> on<00:01:35.560> one<00:01:35.799> side<00:01:35.829> and<00:01:36.460> both<00:01:36.670> blues<00:01:36.970> go<00:01:37.150> in

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
go on one side and both blues go in

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.120 
go on one side and both blues go in
either<00:01:37.450> so<00:01:38.020> I'm<00:01:38.259> going<00:01:38.439> to<00:01:38.500> plug<00:01:38.710> in<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:38.979> new

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
either so I'm going to plug in the new

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.819 
either so I'm going to plug in the new
one<00:01:39.509> leaving<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:40.780> old<00:01:40.900> one<00:01:41.079> in<00:01:41.229> place<00:01:41.439> for<00:01:41.710> now

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
one leaving the old one in place for now

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.649 
one leaving the old one in place for now
and<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.869> we'll<00:01:43.990> see<00:01:44.170> if<00:01:44.229> it<00:01:44.380> if<00:01:44.619> it<00:01:44.890> fixed<00:01:45.220> it<00:01:45.659> so

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
and so we'll see if it if it fixed it so

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:48.690 
and so we'll see if it if it fixed it so
I<00:01:46.689> plug<00:01:47.110> the<00:01:47.259> new<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.799> wires<00:01:48.009> onto<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.610> new

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
I plug the new the wires onto the new

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.899 
I plug the new the wires onto the new
capacitor<00:01:49.329> as<00:01:49.450> you<00:01:49.600> can<00:01:49.750> see<00:01:49.960> both<00:01:50.920> red<00:01:51.280> wires

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
capacitor as you can see both red wires

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.170 
capacitor as you can see both red wires
are<00:01:52.869> going<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.409> a<00:01:53.710> single<00:01:54.130> terminal

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
are going to a single terminal

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.950 
are going to a single terminal
we're<00:01:55.330> going<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.870> the<00:01:56.740> other<00:01:56.830> terminal<00:01:57.960> I'm

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
we're going to the other terminal I'm

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.180 
we're going to the other terminal I'm
going<00:01:59.230> to<00:01:59.380> plug<00:02:00.250> in<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.550> power<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:02.830> we'll<00:02:03.040> see

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
going to plug in the power and we'll see

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.280 
going to plug in the power and we'll see
what<00:02:03.340> happens

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.160 

so<00:02:08.290> like<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.369> power<00:02:09.580> in<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:12.960> capacitor<00:02:13.960> is

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
so like the power in and capacitor is

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.300 
so like the power in and capacitor is
still<00:02:14.440> plugged<00:02:14.830> in<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:16.720> now<00:02:16.840> I'm<00:02:16.960> going<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.650> hit

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
still plugged in so now I'm going to hit

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.110 
still plugged in so now I'm going to hit
the<00:02:18.460> remote<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:19.420> see<00:02:19.690> what<00:02:19.870> happens

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.090 

so<00:02:25.120> everything<00:02:26.020> is<00:02:26.110> operating<00:02:26.470> as<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.070> should

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
so everything is operating as it should

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.220 
so everything is operating as it should
be<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.810> limit<00:02:29.080> switches<00:02:29.320> are<00:02:29.590> going<00:02:29.830> up<00:02:31.230> right

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
be the limit switches are going up right

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.970 
be the limit switches are going up right
there<00:02:32.590> so<00:02:33.520> it<00:02:34.180> looks<00:02:34.450> like<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.770> only

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
there so it looks like it's the only

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.130 
there so it looks like it's the only
problem<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:37.320> capacitor<00:02:38.320> I<00:02:38.530> got<00:02:38.980> from<00:02:39.160> Amazon

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
problem the capacitor I got from Amazon

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.699 
problem the capacitor I got from Amazon
just<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:43.030> just<00:02:43.320> search<00:02:44.320> for<00:02:45.600> garage<00:02:46.709> door

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
just you just search for garage door

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.520 
just you just search for garage door
opener<00:02:49.080> motor<00:02:50.080> start<00:02:50.620> capacitor<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:52.530> specify

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
opener motor start capacitor and specify

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.000 
opener motor start capacitor and specify
the<00:02:53.910> micro<00:02:54.910> farad<00:02:55.390> range<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:56.500> make<00:02:56.530> sure<00:02:56.860> it's

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
the micro farad range to make sure it's

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.530 
the micro farad range to make sure it's
the<00:02:57.100> same<00:02:57.310> like<00:02:57.550> rough<00:02:57.760> hard<00:02:58.090> as<00:02:58.300> what's

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
the same like rough hard as what's

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.380 
the same like rough hard as what's
coming<00:02:58.870> off<00:02:59.459> just<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.550> make<00:03:00.670> sure<00:03:00.700> that's<00:03:01.180> a

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
coming off just to make sure that's a

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.750 
coming off just to make sure that's a
fifty<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.900> forty<00:03:02.410> three<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.800> fifty<00:03:03.130> 3<00:03:03.370> micro

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
fifty to forty three to fifty 3 micro

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.650 
fifty to forty three to fifty 3 micro
farad<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.890> so<00:03:05.890> is<00:03:05.950> this<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:07.120> I'm<00:03:07.239> just<00:03:07.300> going

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
farad and so is this so I'm just going

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.720 
farad and so is this so I'm just going
to<00:03:07.780> unscrew<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:09.310> old<00:03:09.570> capacitor<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:12.310> that<00:03:12.519> one

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
to unscrew the old capacitor is that one

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.210 
to unscrew the old capacitor is that one
screw<00:03:13.150> that's<00:03:13.480> right<00:03:13.750> now<00:03:13.930> I'm<00:03:14.830> going<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.070> put

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
screw that's right now I'm going to put

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.780 
screw that's right now I'm going to put
the<00:03:15.310> new<00:03:15.430> one<00:03:15.459> in<00:03:15.610> and<00:03:15.910> then<00:03:16.269> should<00:03:16.750> do<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.790> ok

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
the new one in and then should do it ok

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.610 
the new one in and then should do it ok
so<00:03:19.330> it's<00:03:19.630> close<00:03:20.380> back<00:03:20.650> up<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:22.410> going<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.500> do<00:03:23.590> a

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
so it's close back up and going to do a

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.410 
so it's close back up and going to do a
final<00:03:23.890> check<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.700> see<00:03:24.880> how<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.030> works<00:03:26.790> these<00:03:27.790> by

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
final check to see how it works these by

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.560 
final check to see how it works these by
the<00:03:28.480> way<00:03:28.600> are<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:30.040> limits<00:03:30.400> switches<00:03:33.570> these

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
the way are the limits switches these

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.190 
the way are the limits switches these
here<00:03:35.820> what<00:03:36.820> is<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.090> up<00:03:37.239> when<00:03:37.600> is<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:37.840> down<00:03:37.989> it

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
here what is the up when is it down it

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.070 
here what is the up when is it down it
should<00:03:38.410> be<00:03:38.500> marked<00:03:38.830> so<00:03:39.790> that<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.630> can<00:03:40.750> adjust

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
should be marked so that you can adjust

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.530 
should be marked so that you can adjust
these<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.830> the<00:03:42.160> door<00:03:42.370> stops<00:03:42.790> higher<00:03:43.180> or

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
these so that the door stops higher or

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.340 
these so that the door stops higher or
lower<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.970> middle<00:03:46.180> one<00:03:46.360> is<00:03:46.650> basically

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
lower and the middle one is basically

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.310 
lower and the middle one is basically
like<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.680> clutch<00:03:51.340> so<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.360> if<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.840> door<00:03:53.049> meets

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
like a clutch so that if the door meets

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.440 
like a clutch so that if the door meets
a<00:03:53.560> lot<00:03:53.709> of<00:03:53.769> resistance<00:03:54.130> like<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:55.030> hood<00:03:55.239> of

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
a lot of resistance like the hood of

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.000 
a lot of resistance like the hood of
car<00:03:55.720> or<00:03:56.050> something<00:03:56.560> it'll<00:03:57.250> reverse<00:03:57.670> itself<00:03:58.120> so

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
car or something it'll reverse itself so

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:08.589 
car or something it'll reverse itself so
you<00:04:00.010> see<00:04:00.190> make<00:04:00.550> sure<00:04:00.580> if<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:00.910> works

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:14.270 

that's<00:04:08.900> where

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.670 

stops<00:04:15.630> so<00:04:17.760> if<00:04:18.760> your<00:04:19.120> garage<00:04:19.540> door<00:04:19.989> opener

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
stops so if your garage door opener

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.140 
stops so if your garage door opener
just<00:04:21.160> buzzes<00:04:21.639> without<00:04:22.199> doing<00:04:23.199> anything

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
just buzzes without doing anything

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.350 
just buzzes without doing anything
motors<00:04:25.150> not<00:04:26.130> freeze<00:04:27.130> not<00:04:27.520> frozen<00:04:27.880> in<00:04:28.120> place

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
motors not freeze not frozen in place

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.200 
motors not freeze not frozen in place
not<00:04:28.930> seized<00:04:29.260> up<00:04:29.530> if<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.919> gears<00:04:30.160> seem<00:04:30.490> to<00:04:30.639> be<00:04:30.790> ok

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
not seized up if the gears seem to be ok

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.910 
not seized up if the gears seem to be ok
and<00:04:31.449> it's<00:04:32.139> probably<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.740> start<00:04:33.610> capacitor
