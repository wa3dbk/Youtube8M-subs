gaming build so we've added this set up
to<00:01:01.340> our<00:01:02.340> nexus<00:01:03.120> defender<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.780> they'll<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.379> a

to our nexus defender and they'll be a

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
link for that in the description as well

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.969 
link for that in the description as well
as<00:01:05.880> an<00:01:05.970> annotation<00:01:06.119> here<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:08.479> we've<00:01:09.479> paired

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
as an annotation here and we've paired

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.910 
as an annotation here and we've paired
this<00:01:10.979> Intel<00:01:11.430> chip<00:01:11.939> with<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> z97<00:01:13.380> motherboard

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
this Intel chip with a z97 motherboard

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.100 
this Intel chip with a z97 motherboard
and<00:01:14.250> that's<00:01:14.520> important<00:01:14.970> because<00:01:15.000> z97<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
and that's important because z97 is the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.560 
and that's important because z97 is the
only<00:01:16.409> board<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.799> officially<00:01:17.580> allows

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
only board that officially allows

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.520 
only board that officially allows
overclocking<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.490> it's<00:01:20.490> too<00:01:21.299> risky<00:01:21.600> haha<00:01:22.200> for

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
overclocking and it's too risky haha for

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.109 
overclocking and it's too risky haha for
a<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:23.670> 85<00:01:24.270> or<00:01:24.530> h97<00:01:25.530> board<00:01:26.130> because<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
a be 85 or h97 board because the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.789 
a be 85 or h97 board because the
possibility<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.780> Intel<00:01:28.259> removing

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
possibility of Intel removing

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.440 
possibility of Intel removing
overclocking<00:01:29.430> abilities<00:01:29.880> from<00:01:30.180> those

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
overclocking abilities from those

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.100 
overclocking abilities from those
chipsets<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:32.090> there<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.689> don't<00:01:33.750> want<00:01:34.049> to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
chipsets is there and I don't want to

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.240 
chipsets is there and I don't want to
leave<00:01:34.490> anyone<00:01:35.490> stuck<00:01:36.030> with<00:01:37.020> an<00:01:37.290> overclocked

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
leave anyone stuck with an overclocked

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.700 
leave anyone stuck with an overclocked
chip<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:38.820> an<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.390> overclockable<00:01:40.110> board<00:01:41.270> so

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
chip on an on overclockable board so

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.830 
chip on an on overclockable board so
what<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.860> exactly<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.579> get<00:01:44.729> out<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
what can exactly can you get out of the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.580 
what can exactly can you get out of the
CPU<00:01:46.380> then<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.520> overclockable<00:01:48.119> well<00:01:48.899> this

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
CPU then it's overclockable well this

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.850 
CPU then it's overclockable well this

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
pretty good but it's a dual core there's

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.069 
pretty good but it's a dual core there's

no hyper threading the cache isn't that

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:05.030 
no hyper threading the cache isn't that
great<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:59.270> but<00:02:00.270> we<00:02:00.869> got<00:02:01.079> our<00:02:01.670> CPU<00:02:02.670> up<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:04.040> 4.7

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
great on it but we got our CPU up to 4.7

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.059 
great on it but we got our CPU up to 4.7
and<00:02:05.189> gigahertz<00:02:05.570> with<00:02:06.570> just<00:02:07.469> an<00:02:07.619> air<00:02:07.799> cooler

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
and gigahertz with just an air cooler

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.350 
and gigahertz with just an air cooler
now<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.610> pretty<00:02:08.789> good<00:02:08.970> air<00:02:09.119> cooler

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
now this is a pretty good air cooler

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.850
