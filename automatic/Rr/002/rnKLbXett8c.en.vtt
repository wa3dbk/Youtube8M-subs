00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.810
 Today's recipe is by far one of the 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.340
 My first favorite tiramissu to 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.220
 who does not know is one of the Italians 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.420
 made of mascarpone cheese also cocoa 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.340
 and coffee 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.320
 precisely because of the presence of caffeine 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.290
 between the ingredient is calling draw 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.520
 This means wake me up and cheer me up 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.470

 write down the ingredients and we have 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.260
 begins 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.409
 coffee is used in this recipe 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.640
 It must be cold, ready and strong. 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.039
 so if you have not already 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.969
 prepared the drink is the first step to 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.369
 be made 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.700

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.580
 So you just put water in and let it 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.890
 hang have enough patience 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.060
 following the site to take to the refrigerator 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.060

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.140

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.750

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.500

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.500

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.140

 in small pots or if you prefer a 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.030
 medium refractory 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.490

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.490
 publicizing our work is now only 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.440
 take the refrigerator to freeze this 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.910
 dessert is more or less like wine with 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.740
 the passage of time it gets even better 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.750

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.459
 next day it gets even cooler 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.690
 it can still be frozen for more or 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.360
 at least one month 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.830
