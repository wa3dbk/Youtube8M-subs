00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.269
 when in eco-building in fact we can 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.280
 actually used rooms for 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.580
 its thermal insulation qualities and 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.010
 phonic so hemp is used either 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.200
 dry alone or be accompanied by 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.010
 shows in wet use for the 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.990
 slabs or insulating coatings so here it is 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.400
 are two parts actually in the plant 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.220
 chamber that can be used 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.740
 ecoconstruction wool so that's the 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.320
 fibrous part in fact of the plant and 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.640
 the string votes which is the most part 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.039
 mellow makes of the slope 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.379
 I am a farmer on PontchÃ¢teau 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:42.589
 Loire-Atlantique cattle producers in 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.620
 meat mainly and for reading from 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:47.420
 hemp also for five years on little 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.480
 close to 2 hectares it is a material 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.579
 ecological whose production is also 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.699
 ecological since the plant does not 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.949
 requires no input for a 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.469
 producer puts it up he just has the 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.659
 sowing to do and after they reinterpret 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.499
 that at the time of harvest so that's 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.630
 a plant that we can say they 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:08.299
 respect the environment 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.640
 and who really has a lot of qualities 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.700
 in terms of use in the habitat 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.979
 so therefore actually gradually 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.090
 my by dint of information and 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.590
 calf awareness echoes 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.210
 builder 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.340
 or individuals begin to 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.479
 use it more and more touching is going 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.049
 market in short circuit 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.990
 so we sell it directly to echoes 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.549
 constructor or auto builders and a 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.219
 little bit of craftsmen but for the 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.509
 moment is not yet very developed 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.429
 within room and peasants at this 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.319
 level there that what we miss a 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.209
 step defibering actually to separate the 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:45.469
 wool beyond the chain votes and have 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:46.549
 a more standardized product actually because 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:48.469
 artisans are waiting for a product 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.899
 really well calibrated and then regular 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.789
 so for the moment is not yet in 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.509
 able to provide 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.060
 normally it should come pretty 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.369
 quickly but here it is the next 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.310
 step yeah that's it so here we are in 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:05.239
 train to take him contacts for a 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.179
 sorter and we hope that it will happen 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.509
 by here winter or spring 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.239
 next 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.860
 the first step actually of the 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.540
 die is the production must 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.709
 have a group of producers enough 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.959
 therefore to be able to make an offer 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.090
 that's collective so that's how it says 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.860
 wants the sector was born within the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.329
 civam with a group of producers who 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.230
 was interested in growing hemp 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:31.660
 especially on the entrance make a 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.760
 production 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.830
 non- food recoverable in circuit 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.470
 short so they turned to the 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.280
 hemp to meet a demand 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.310
 of self-construction that was pretty 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.890
 scattered at the beginning then the craftsmen 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.780
 started to be interested in this product there 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.440
 and suddenly the group has grown 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.420
 little by little and since 4 5 years we 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.120
 evolves with 20 to 30 hectares each 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.190
 year so on the department and a 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.150
 group that varies between 10 and 15 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.150
 producers 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.250
 I made a wooden frame house and 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.830
 on the frame I made good loads 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.720
 So touching ie it takes 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.760
 two wooden boards that are removed from 40 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.530
 cm and filled with a porridge 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.310
 lime-hemp counts on being removed 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:20.020
 the boards and the wall and do it yourself 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.580
 that's yeah well from the field so 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.280
 in fact the plant grows on the harvest 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.080
 so we mow it and put it in windrows 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.060
 so that is put on line a 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.810
 forage harvester so it's a big 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.770
 crusher saab king is so there we get 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.910
 of hemp da as it is there so with 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.590
 of the chain votes so that is to say the 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.959
 small size 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.680
 so this is what is used to make the walls 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.330
 and otherwise we have once sorted it we 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.209
 rest the wool and so that I used it 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.130
 under roof to insulate in bulk there are 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.870
 wet use with lime 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.180
 for walls dry use under 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.579
 the roof today 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.829
 eco-construction projects 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.810
 to increase 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:04.150
 of the situation as energetic 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.010
 in which one is there so this 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.440
 plant where the qualities of hemp 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.080
 also are increasingly recognized 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.880
 so here is gradually today 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.170
 this is a plant that has a future 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.150
 certain in fact in the habitat to 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.890
 condition actually to do it 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.560
 know and for the group of 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.450
 producers to be able that's beyond 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.610
 fibers and to meet a 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.380
 more diverse application it's nice to 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.620
 see his house pushed into the field and 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.800
 after realizing that offends and it is 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.920
 Still, I'm proud enough when 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.920
 even
