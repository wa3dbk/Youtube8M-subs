00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
kind of cleaned out but anyway this does

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.639 
kind of cleaned out but anyway this does
keep<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> phone<00:02:09.209> pretty<00:02:09.450> secure<00:02:09.959> now<00:02:10.379> this

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
phone pretty well considering that it's

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.930 
phone pretty well considering that it's
not<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.200> another<00:02:28.410> thickest<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:28.890> plastic<00:02:29.400> so

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.850 
that could have been a chunk out of my
phone<00:02:33.120> but<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.750> case<00:02:33.960> is<00:02:33.990> definitely<00:02:34.530> save<00:02:34.740> me

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
here so I can say that this case will

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
about I'd say two to three feet off the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.590 
about I'd say two to three feet off the
ground<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.730> was<00:02:41.880> like<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.030> said<00:02:42.240> omni<00:02:42.480> ways

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
ground and I was like I said omni ways

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.540 
ground and I was like I said omni ways
cement<00:02:42.990> it<00:02:43.050> was<00:02:43.140> like<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.290> gravel<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.070> cement

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
cement it was like a gravel and cement

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.240 
cement it was like a gravel and cement
surface<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.510> pretty<00:02:46.170> rough<00:02:46.500> fall<00:02:46.860> in<00:02:47.100> this

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
surface so a pretty rough fall in this

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.680 
surface so a pretty rough fall in this
case<00:02:47.460> definitely<00:02:47.880> pulled<00:02:48.240> through<00:02:48.540> and

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
case definitely pulled through and

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.390 
case definitely pulled through and

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
that and there we go and this case here

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.720 
that and there we go and this case here
is<00:03:05.490> just<00:03:05.520> as<00:03:05.880> easy<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.180> apply<00:03:07.430> simply<00:03:08.430> put<00:03:08.640> it

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
is just as easy to apply simply put it

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.070 
is just as easy to apply simply put it
in<00:03:08.820> on<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.030> angle<00:03:09.180> with<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.480> volume<00:03:09.840> buttons

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
there and by the way as long as I'm

there and by the way as long as I'm
showing<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.760> guys<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:12.090> they<00:03:12.240> do<00:03:12.300> line<00:03:12.600> up

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
showing you guys that they do line up

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.300 
showing you guys that they do line up
perfectly<00:03:12.930> there<00:03:13.500> is<00:03:13.620> no<00:03:13.740> problems<00:03:14.250> there

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
perfectly there is no problems there

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.740

that<00:03:14.670> all<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.060> buttons<00:03:15.330> line<00:03:15.480> up<00:03:15.630> perfectly

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
that all the buttons line up perfectly

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.840 
that all the buttons line up perfectly
I'd<00:03:16.410> imagine<00:03:16.770> they<00:03:16.830> would<00:03:16.950> on<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.190> iphone<00:03:17.520> 4

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
I'd imagine they would on the iphone 4

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.700 
I'd imagine they would on the iphone 4
as<00:03:18.090> well<00:03:18.360> considering<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.320> know<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.470> buttons

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
as well considering you know the buttons

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.920 
as well considering you know the buttons
aren't<00:03:19.860> quite<00:03:20.310> exactly<00:03:20.820> lined<00:03:21.090> up<00:03:21.300> but<00:03:21.780> it's

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
aren't quite exactly lined up but it's

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.780 
aren't quite exactly lined up but it's
very<00:03:22.050> close<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:22.710> I<00:03:22.770> would<00:03:22.920> imagine<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.370> on

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
very close and I would imagine that on

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.790 
very close and I would imagine that on
the<00:03:23.880> flood<00:03:24.060> like<00:03:24.360> I<00:03:24.450> said<00:03:24.630> on<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.870> four<00:03:25.110> did

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
the flood like I said on the four did

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.020 
the flood like I said on the four did
you<00:03:25.890> really<00:03:26.070> won't<00:03:26.220> have<00:03:26.370> any<00:03:26.520> problems<00:03:26.910> there

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
you really won't have any problems there

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.610 
you really won't have any problems there
but<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:27.570> here<00:03:27.780> we<00:03:27.870> go<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.230> here's<00:03:28.440> how<00:03:28.560> you

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
but so here we go and here's how you

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.380 
but so here we go and here's how you
actually<00:03:28.860> pull<00:03:29.160> out<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.310> kickstand<00:03:29.730> this<00:03:30.150> is

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
actually pull out the kickstand this is

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.850 
actually pull out the kickstand this is
sort<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.720> hard<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:30.960> do<00:03:31.110> at<00:03:31.230> first<00:03:31.440> but<00:03:31.680> since

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
sort of hard to do at first but since

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.350 
sort of hard to do at first but since
I've<00:03:32.040> had<00:03:32.190> this<00:03:32.340> case<00:03:32.580> on<00:03:32.730> my<00:03:32.880> phone<00:03:33.120> for<00:03:33.300> a

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
I've had this case on my phone for a

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.300 
I've had this case on my phone for a
long<00:03:33.600> time<00:03:33.930> it's<00:03:34.530> actually<00:03:34.890> gotten<00:03:35.040> much

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
long time it's actually gotten much

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.180 
long time it's actually gotten much
easier<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.760> pull<00:03:35.910> out<00:03:36.770> that's<00:03:37.770> pretty<00:03:37.950> much<00:03:38.130> it

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
easier to pull out that's pretty much it

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.920 
easier to pull out that's pretty much it
you<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.520> stick<00:03:39.240> your<00:03:39.330> finger<00:03:39.600> nails<00:03:39.750> in

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
you just stick your finger nails in

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.470 
you just stick your finger nails in
there<00:03:40.310> and<00:03:41.310> kind<00:03:41.580> of<00:03:41.730> grab<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.180> like<00:03:42.270> that<00:03:42.420> and

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
there and kind of grab it like that and

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.780 
there and kind of grab it like that and
out<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.960> comes<00:03:42.990> and<00:03:43.470> there<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.370> go<00:03:44.400> like<00:03:44.640> that

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
out it comes and there you go like that

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.370 
out it comes and there you go like that
and<00:03:44.850> now<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:45.210> can<00:03:45.480> actually<00:03:45.630> prop<00:03:46.050> your<00:03:46.170> phone

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
and now you can actually prop your phone

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.410 
and now you can actually prop your phone
up<00:03:46.500> like<00:03:46.650> this<00:03:46.800> and<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.610> also<00:03:47.760> works<00:03:48.120> in

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
up like this and it also works in

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.390 
up like this and it also works in
landscape<00:03:48.960> as<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.380> would<00:03:49.530> think<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.950> like<00:03:50.280> I
