00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.389
 beauty talks to you 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.519
 Good, I'm bringing you here today. 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.830
 a banner grids there was channel arrived 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.330
 now five thousand enrolled thanks to you 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.949
 Many thanks to everyone. 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.890
 I know it's not a thank you and 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.300
 worthy of the affection that everyone has and I 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.490
 I know it's not a grandiose form 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.529
 enough to thank all 5 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.240
 thousand subscribers but it's something I 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.730
 I was able to do it quickly and easily 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.170
 that at least in this case will not be 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.610
 with nothing to celebrate the 5 thousand 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.079
 probably enrolled later on 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.329
 I'm going to throw another bani 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.730
 I want to go back to the tutorials but 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.260
 I'm working on the projects so if 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.000
 the tutorials to live 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.860
 you will see the result of the project 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.840
 in a while and will be satisfied 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.760
 well this bath will work more or 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.680
 about the same scheme of the another bank 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.360
 post before I'll show 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.430
 You guys, I think it's pretty cool. 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.620
 right he might have to sell himself puts 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.050
 Grace to you and yes I think of selling. 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.460
 or put it there as watermark because 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.920
 so the watermark really goes 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.780
 let the club be small and go 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.360
 stay here in the corner then I ask for 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.159
 You who do not miss the watermark 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.290
 also promised bank credit but 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.030
 anyway how it works here writing pudding 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.470
 that the name of the channel in the case I recommend 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.930
 you do not enter the channel name 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.640
 very large here in the case of conception 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.549
 but rather to encourage the quantity of 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.860
 you only have to decrease the size of the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:29.100
 text that you click on the edit layer 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.770
 free transformation and then you 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.659
 size of the leg shiftwell out 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.780
 to maintain the ratio and center 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.100
 decreases and rewrites the larger name then 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.900
 until everything is quiet 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.119
 if you want to change the color of the text 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.040
 or change the text itself or 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.020
 logically you are going to double 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.060
 Click here where has this symbol 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.299
 page of this new document gives a 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.340
 double click click here and it will open 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.740
 this other file which, in fact, is 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.579
 the same only one inside the other 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.040
 understood 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.350
 It's more or less out there in another explained. 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.570
 this will get you the text tool at 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.869
 source as the cloud will already be 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.729
 the banner and this source only gives you 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.190
 capitalized in spite of 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.350
 that his character is tiny 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.320
 May then sign up for 40 minutes 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.060
 will come out against the source you write with 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.590
 capital letter equal 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.240
 I do not know if it's caique and to change when 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.150
 text is just you double click nor 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.950
 I said here it comes in the kitchen and 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.550
 body if you wish me to at least 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.460
 I liked this subject, I 'm not going to have to 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.550
 when you are renaming rename 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:42.510
 Changed the color only I come here on file 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.780
 and click save only nothing else 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.010
 closes and already will be here written caÃ­que 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.570
 more or less this way for you to have 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.850
 this text in which only a double 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.880
 click here and change what you want 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.110
 here in the case of twitter you can change 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.180
 Also here 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.010
 remembering this source again as a slot 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.350
 only works with uppercase 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.150
 You can duplicate this text here I know 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.690
 there put other further information 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.240
 on here 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.260
 so I know there goes from the taste of each one the 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:14.760
 background is only you change the background attack 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.980
 very simple and it was just that simple 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.590
 that it is impossible if you want 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.780
 raise this sentence here for you 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.450
 stretch those ellipses that are behind 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.730
 they have to separate separate cells 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.090
 here then only you duplicate them 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.980
 tightening against likely drag 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.600
 that it will get bigger then it will not 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.460
 have trouble with this with regard to 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.110
 size for the moment so that 's it 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.300
 people, I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.460
 I'll ask you and use them 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.080
 this bath in your channel if you 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.820
 even add some 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.410
 things they commit in the description that is 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.180
 using a banner to see how the 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.670
 result in a next video a monster 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.980
 This is going to be an even 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.070
 The channel's advertising is more 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.180
 forced to apologize for time 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.280
 enter the videos because this 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.560
 it will probably happen again 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.410
 thanks for the patience collaboration of 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.720
 You all stay with the little thing now . 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.120
 the end of the video I did and the 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.920
 next tutorial I teach how to do 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.340
 same thing until the next 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.340
 said
