drill<00:00:20.609> protection<00:00:21.119> all<00:00:21.330> become<00:00:22.320> their<00:00:22.619> values

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
drill protection all become their values

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.779 
drill protection all become their values
get<00:00:23.189> increased<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.119> slight<00:00:24.420> bit<00:00:24.689> now<00:00:25.789> relics

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
get increased the slight bit now relics

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.670 
get increased the slight bit now relics
what<00:00:27.150> they<00:00:27.240> do<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> multiplier<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:28.590> a

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
what they do is a multiplier it's a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.130 
what they do is a multiplier it's a
multiplier<00:00:29.189> for<00:00:29.490> every<00:00:29.730> single<00:00:30.029> relic<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.449> 20%

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
multiplier for every single relic is 20%

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.130 
multiplier for every single relic is 20%
more<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.430> nine<00:00:32.759> routes<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.540> earn<00:00:33.780> two

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
more so with nine routes you earn two

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.750 
more so with nine routes you earn two
hundred<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.829> eighty<00:00:35.190> percent<00:00:35.489> score<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
hundred and eighty percent score and

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.709 
hundred and eighty percent score and
let's<00:00:38.760> get<00:00:39.059> started

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
let's get started

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.080 
let's get started
drill<00:00:40.290> protection<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.280> way<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.670> works<00:00:41.879> is

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
drill protection the way it works is

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.660 
drill protection the way it works is
that<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.660> every<00:00:43.020> hit<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.530> drill<00:00:43.800> takes<00:00:44.100> so

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that for every hit the drill takes so

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.700 
that for every hit the drill takes so
you<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> drill<00:00:45.690> health<00:00:45.960> will<00:00:46.260> either<00:00:46.440> be

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
you see the drill health will either be

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.080 
you see the drill health will either be
a<00:00:46.739> 100<00:00:47.610> or<00:00:47.870> 125<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.680> every<00:00:50.100> hit<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.610> takes<00:00:50.879> so

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
a 100 or 125 for every hit it takes so

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.360 
a 100 or 125 for every hit it takes so
okay<00:00:51.300> every<00:00:51.899> little<00:00:52.440> bit<00:00:52.590> goes<00:00:52.890> down

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
okay every little bit goes down

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.549 
okay every little bit goes down
you<00:00:53.730> are<00:00:53.940> gonna<00:00:54.120> lose<00:00:54.390> quite<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> bit<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.230> score

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
you are gonna lose quite a bit of score

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.479 
you are gonna lose quite a bit of score
now<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.940> works<00:00:57.360> off<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.440> decimal<00:00:59.219> place

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
now this works off of a decimal place

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.740 
now this works off of a decimal place
also<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.660> basically<00:01:01.579> even<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.420> two

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
also so basically even if you have two

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.289 
also so basically even if you have two
drills<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.920> same<00:01:05.159> area<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.090> same

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
drills in the same area that the same

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.240 
drills in the same area that the same
exact<00:01:06.780> jaha<00:01:07.080> doesn't<00:01:07.560> guarantee<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:08.130> they

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
exact jaha doesn't guarantee that they

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.410 
exact jaha doesn't guarantee that they
earn<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.610> same<00:01:08.880> amount<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.180> score

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
earn you the same amount of score

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.899 
earn you the same amount of score
because<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> percentage<00:01:11.340> works<00:01:11.640> um

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
because it's like a percentage works um

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.910 
because it's like a percentage works um
it's<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.049> little<00:01:13.320> bit<00:01:13.409> different<00:01:13.619> than

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
it's it's a little bit different than

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.649 
it's it's a little bit different than
it's<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.189> it's<00:01:14.430> not<00:01:14.610> for<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> flat<00:01:15.299> base

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it's like it's not for a flat base

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.749 
it's like it's not for a flat base
number<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.409> goes<00:01:16.830> into<00:01:17.040> like<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.610> could<00:01:17.729> be

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
number it goes into like so it could be

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.060 
number it goes into like so it could be
like<00:01:19.310> 123<00:01:20.310> point<00:01:20.820> 5<00:01:21.320> will<00:01:22.320> be<00:01:22.439> different<00:01:22.890> so

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
like 123 point 5 will be different so

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.490 
like 123 point 5 will be different so
but<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.060> won't<00:01:24.270> see<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> decimal<00:01:25.110> place

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
but you won't see like the decimal place

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.160 
but you won't see like the decimal place
that's<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.130> thing<00:01:26.340> about<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.780> gotta

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
that's the thing about it so you gotta

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.840 
that's the thing about it so you gotta
watch<00:01:28.380> out<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.220> want<00:01:29.490> don't

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
watch out for that so you want don't

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.649 
watch out for that so you want don't
want<00:01:30.060> them<00:01:30.180> touching<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.810> drill<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.530> all

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
want them touching it the drill at all

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.640 
want them touching it the drill at all
next<00:01:33.659> ah<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.979> gonna<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.939> teamwork<00:01:36.869> teamwork<00:01:37.320> is

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
next ah is gonna be teamwork teamwork is

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.670 
next ah is gonna be teamwork teamwork is
split<00:01:38.070> into<00:01:38.310> three<00:01:38.549> different<00:01:39.240> factors<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
split into three different factors the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.060 
split into three different factors the
first<00:01:40.979> factor<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.729> gonna<00:01:42.210> be<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:43.860> amount

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
first factor is gonna be the amount

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.830 
first factor is gonna be the amount
damage<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.030> gotta<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> certain

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
damage to do you gotta do a certain

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.080 
damage to do you gotta do a certain
amount<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.110> damage<00:01:46.320> kills<00:01:47.220> increase<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
amount of damage kills increase the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.030 
amount of damage kills increase the
value<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.689> damage<00:01:48.990> done<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.530> like<00:01:49.829> if

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
value of the damage done so like if

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.440 
value of the damage done so like if
you're<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.430> doing<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.700> bunch<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.000> damage<00:01:51.180> but

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
you're just doing a bunch of damage but

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.999 
you're just doing a bunch of damage but
you're<00:01:51.540> not<00:01:51.630> getting<00:01:51.780> any<00:01:51.899> kills<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.770> might

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
you're not getting any kills you might

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.580 
you're not getting any kills you might
not<00:01:53.220> be<00:01:53.369> able<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:53.759> max<00:01:54.060> teamwork<00:01:54.590> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
not be able to get max teamwork the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.330 
not be able to get max teamwork the
kills<00:01:55.890> really<00:01:56.310> do<00:01:56.490> help<00:01:56.880> out<00:01:57.740> but<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:59.070> not

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
kills really do help out but it's not

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.490 
kills really do help out but it's not
only<00:01:59.579> kill<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.390> could<00:02:00.659> still<00:02:00.930> get<00:02:01.079> perfect

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
only kill so you could still get perfect

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.499 
only kill so you could still get perfect
teamwork<00:02:01.680> without<00:02:02.100> getting<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.969> single<00:02:03.119> kill

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
teamwork without getting a single kill

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
but whenever you get a kill it does

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.359

teamwork which is support drums the way
it<00:02:26.970> works<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.689> it's<00:02:27.900> for<00:02:28.109> everything<00:02:28.769> you

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
it works is that it's for everything you

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.190 
it works is that it's for everything you
pick<00:02:29.129> up<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.549> throw<00:02:29.909> down<00:02:30.120> besides<00:02:30.659> money<00:02:30.959> if

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
pick up and throw down besides money if

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
you pick up money it counts as one of

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.929 
you pick up money it counts as one of
the<00:02:34.079> ten<00:02:34.290> drops<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.769> you<00:02:34.859> need<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.670> if<00:02:35.819> you

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
the ten drops that you need but if you

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.119 
the ten drops that you need but if you
drop<00:02:36.239> money<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.750> does<00:02:37.079> not<00:02:37.260> count<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:37.829> what<00:02:37.980> you

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
drop money it does not count so what you

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.740 
drop money it does not count so what you
do<00:02:38.340> technically<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.120> or<00:02:39.269> get<00:02:39.420> perfect

do technically in or get perfect

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.809 
do technically in or get perfect
teamwork<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:40.170> have<00:02:40.379> all<00:02:40.590> your<00:02:40.799> teammates<00:02:41.159> drop

money for you right before you start a

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.460 
money for you right before you start a
hive<00:02:44.159> and<00:02:44.579> then<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:45.389> pick<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.870> up<00:02:45.989> as<00:02:46.230> soon<00:02:46.409> as

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
hive and then you pick it up as soon as

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.379 
hive and then you pick it up as soon as
the<00:02:46.560> high<00:02:46.709> begins<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.790> that's<00:02:48.000> three<00:02:48.209> things

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
the high begins so that's three things

let's buy two more things so that's five

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.929 
let's buy two more things so that's five
things<00:02:58.019> out<00:02:58.260> in<00:02:58.620> like<00:02:58.859> the<00:02:59.010> first<00:02:59.280> 10<00:02:59.579> seconds

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
very beginning and you just start with

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.410 
very beginning and you just start with
down<00:03:09.260> next<00:03:10.260> uh<00:03:10.379> and<00:03:10.889> then<00:03:11.220> if<00:03:11.519> you<00:03:12.090> want<00:03:12.329> to

cancel that down you just got throw a
bunch<00:03:14.370> more<00:03:14.609> drops<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.269> sometimes<00:03:16.169> works<00:03:16.319> and

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
bunch more drops it sometimes works and

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.530 
bunch more drops it sometimes works and
sometimes<00:03:17.010> doesn't<00:03:17.250> it's<00:03:17.549> inconsistent<00:03:18.389> but

out in your personal skill it's part of
it<00:04:04.979> now<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:07.760> exact<00:04:08.760> xual<00:04:09.090> personal<00:04:09.510> skill

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
it now the exact xual personal skill

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.780 
it now the exact xual personal skill
with<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.019> score<00:04:10.319> that<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.560> lose<00:04:10.829> when<00:04:11.729> you

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
with the score that you lose when you

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.750 
with the score that you lose when you
have<00:04:12.449> a<00:04:12.659> zero<00:04:13.199> percent<00:04:13.379> accuracy<00:04:13.979> so<00:04:14.400> say<00:04:14.639> if

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
have a zero percent accuracy so say if

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.430 
have a zero percent accuracy so say if
you're<00:04:14.940> on<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.329> Grenadier<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.139> you

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
you're on the Grenadier and you

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.649 
you're on the Grenadier and you
accidentally<00:04:16.859> shoot<00:04:16.949> a<00:04:17.159> bullet<00:04:17.579> while<00:04:18.389> ends

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
accidentally shoot a bullet while ends

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.599 
accidentally shoot a bullet while ends
up<00:04:18.750> happy<00:04:19.049> is<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:19.200> it's<00:04:19.529> basically<00:04:19.739> equal<00:04:20.370> to

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
up happy is that it's basically equal to

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.440 
up happy is that it's basically equal to
losing<00:04:21.239> at

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
losing at

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.240 
losing at
Challenge<00:04:21.870> so<00:04:22.110> you<00:04:22.440> do<00:04:22.680> not<00:04:22.800> want<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.130> have

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
Challenge so you do not want to have

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.540 
Challenge so you do not want to have
that<00:04:23.430> zero<00:04:23.760> percent<00:04:24.120> accuracy<00:04:24.600> so<00:04:25.340> if<00:04:26.340> you

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
that zero percent accuracy so if you

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.710 
that zero percent accuracy so if you
notice<00:04:26.850> that<00:04:26.880> you<00:04:27.030> show<00:04:27.210> you<00:04:27.270> a<00:04:27.330> couple<00:04:27.510> of

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
notice that you show you a couple of

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.080 
notice that you show you a couple of
bullets<00:04:28.190> while<00:04:29.190> trying<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.640> grab<00:04:29.790> on<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.970> your

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
bullets while trying to grab on to your

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.820 
bullets while trying to grab on to your
grenades<00:04:30.450> right<00:04:30.690> what<00:04:31.170> you<00:04:31.290> would<00:04:31.470> do<00:04:31.650> is<00:04:31.800> that

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
grenades right what you would do is that

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.040 
grenades right what you would do is that
you<00:04:32.070> would<00:04:32.160> throw<00:04:32.400> out<00:04:32.490> a<00:04:32.550> flare<00:04:33.000> and<00:04:33.270> then<00:04:33.720> you

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
you would throw out a flare and then you

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.660 
you would throw out a flare and then you
would<00:04:34.170> just<00:04:34.200> pump<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.800> few<00:04:34.980> bullets<00:04:35.340> into<00:04:35.550> like

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
would just pump a few bullets into like

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.150 
would just pump a few bullets into like
a<00:04:35.790> hunter<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:36.450> that<00:04:36.510> will<00:04:37.380> usually<00:04:37.560> get<00:04:37.980> your

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
a hunter and that will usually get your

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.040 
a hunter and that will usually get your
accuracy<00:04:38.580> high<00:04:38.880> enough<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.570> the<00:04:39.660> point<00:04:39.900> where

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
accuracy high enough to the point where

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.140 
accuracy high enough to the point where
and<00:04:40.200> they<00:04:40.290> gates<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.800> actual<00:04:41.340> accuracy<00:04:41.790> Wells

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
and they gates the actual accuracy Wells

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.020 
and they gates the actual accuracy Wells
from<00:04:42.450> missing<00:04:42.780> those<00:04:42.960> few<00:04:43.170> bullets<00:04:43.790> so<00:04:44.790> it's

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
from missing those few bullets so it's

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.410 
from missing those few bullets so it's
very<00:04:45.180> important<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.750> actually<00:04:45.900> do<00:04:46.260> that<00:04:46.440> now

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
very important to actually do that now

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.420 
very important to actually do that now
for<00:04:48.420> the<00:04:48.720> next<00:04:49.140> part<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.620> personal<00:04:50.040> skill<00:04:50.250> is

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
for the next part of personal skill is

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.750 
for the next part of personal skill is
taking<00:04:51.120> damage<00:04:51.680> now<00:04:52.680> if<00:04:52.920> you<00:04:53.070> have<00:04:53.190> armor<00:04:53.640> you

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
taking damage now if you have armor you

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.150 
taking damage now if you have armor you
only<00:04:53.880> take<00:04:54.150> about<00:04:54.300> 10%<00:04:54.810> of<00:04:55.350> actually<00:04:55.890> what

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
only take about 10% of actually what

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.090 
only take about 10% of actually what
you're<00:04:56.370> supposed<00:04:56.850> to<00:04:56.970> lose<00:04:57.210> so<00:04:58.100> it's

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
you're supposed to lose so it's

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.130 
you're supposed to lose so it's
essential<00:05:00.000> to<00:05:00.060> actually<00:05:00.510> have<00:05:00.630> armor<00:05:01.020> on

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
essential to actually have armor on

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.720 
essential to actually have armor on
while<00:05:01.380> going<00:05:01.650> for<00:05:01.830> high<00:05:01.950> scores<00:05:02.280> because<00:05:02.610> if

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
while going for high scores because if

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.010 
while going for high scores because if
you<00:05:02.820> don't<00:05:02.910> have<00:05:03.090> armor<00:05:03.480> on<00:05:03.630> you're<00:05:03.810> gonna<00:05:03.930> be

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
you don't have armor on you're gonna be

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.130 
you don't have armor on you're gonna be
losing<00:05:04.590> a<00:05:04.770> ton<00:05:05.190> of<00:05:05.430> damage<00:05:05.880> if<00:05:06.450> you<00:05:06.780> get<00:05:06.930> hit<00:05:07.110> by

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
losing a ton of damage if you get hit by

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.230 
losing a ton of damage if you get hit by
a<00:05:07.290> scorpion<00:05:07.950> when<00:05:08.130> you<00:05:08.280> don't<00:05:08.640> have<00:05:08.790> armor<00:05:09.150> on

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
a scorpion when you don't have armor on

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.180 
a scorpion when you don't have armor on
that<00:05:09.510> could<00:05:09.660> be<00:05:09.750> up<00:05:09.930> to<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:10.170> thousand<00:05:10.980> base

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
that could be up to a thousand base

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.240 
that could be up to a thousand base
cores<00:05:11.580> sometimes<00:05:12.120> that<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:13.140> lose<00:05:13.410> and<00:05:13.680> with

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
cores sometimes that you lose and with

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.160 
cores sometimes that you lose and with
relics<00:05:14.610> that<00:05:14.730> can<00:05:14.910> be<00:05:15.000> up<00:05:15.120> to<00:05:15.150> like<00:05:15.420> 3000

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
relics that can be up to like 3000

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.170 
relics that can be up to like 3000
scores<00:05:16.410> so<00:05:16.620> it's<00:05:16.860> a<00:05:17.010> lot<00:05:17.310> of<00:05:17.460> score<00:05:17.700> loss<00:05:17.880> for

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
scores so it's a lot of score loss for

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.670 
scores so it's a lot of score loss for
when<00:05:18.330> you<00:05:18.450> get<00:05:18.630> hit<00:05:18.840> so<00:05:18.870> you<00:05:19.080> don't<00:05:19.380> want<00:05:19.560> to

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
when you get hit so you don't want to

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.540 
when you get hit so you don't want to
get<00:05:19.800> hit<00:05:19.980> by<00:05:20.010> things<00:05:20.460> so<00:05:21.240> when<00:05:21.930> you<00:05:22.290> are<00:05:22.650> at<00:05:23.340> the

out for your teammates to throw armor or

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.420 
out for your teammates to throw armor or
when<00:05:31.080> you<00:05:31.290> should<00:05:31.530> throw<00:05:31.680> armor<00:05:32.070> if<00:05:32.220> you're

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
when you should throw armor if you're

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.210 
when you should throw armor if you're
the<00:05:32.550> armor<00:05:32.910> thrower<00:05:33.980> now<00:05:35.000> for<00:05:36.000> uh<00:05:36.980> so<00:05:37.980> that's

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
the armor thrower now for uh so that's

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.650 
the armor thrower now for uh so that's
where<00:05:38.520> that<00:05:38.670> part<00:05:38.910> of<00:05:39.000> personal<00:05:39.300> skill<00:05:39.480> and

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
where that part of personal skill and

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.680 
where that part of personal skill and
both<00:05:39.990> combined<00:05:40.410> will<00:05:40.710> be<00:05:40.920> a<00:05:41.240> quite<00:05:42.240> a<00:05:42.270> bit<00:05:42.600> of

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
both combined will be a quite a bit of

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.000 
both combined will be a quite a bit of
score<00:05:42.960> so<00:05:43.140> you<00:05:43.170> want<00:05:43.410> to<00:05:43.500> make<00:05:43.620> sure<00:05:43.650> that<00:05:43.920> you

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
score so you want to make sure that you

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.650 
score so you want to make sure that you
always<00:05:44.160> have<00:05:44.250> that<00:05:44.550> under<00:05:44.790> control<00:05:44.820> the

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
always have that under control the

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.330 
always have that under control the
damaged<00:05:46.170> part<00:05:46.440> where<00:05:46.590> you<00:05:46.710> take<00:05:46.890> damage

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
damaged part where you take damage

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.540 
damaged part where you take damage
should<00:05:48.090> be<00:05:48.510> uh<00:05:48.810> it<00:05:49.290> would<00:05:49.590> be<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:49.890> main<00:05:50.190> part

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
should be uh it would be the main part

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.460 
should be uh it would be the main part
where<00:05:50.700> you<00:05:50.850> would<00:05:51.030> lose<00:05:51.300> score<00:05:51.690> on<00:05:51.930> a<00:05:51.960> co-op

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
where you would lose score on a co-op

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.070 
where you would lose score on a co-op
game<00:05:52.760> the<00:05:53.760> drill<00:05:54.030> protection<00:05:54.480> on<00:05:54.570> a<00:05:54.600> co-op<00:05:54.930> and

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
game the drill protection on a co-op and

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.140 
game the drill protection on a co-op and
teamwork<00:05:55.320> should<00:05:55.560> almost<00:05:55.860> always<00:05:56.160> be<00:05:56.610> perfect

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
teamwork should almost always be perfect

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.670 
teamwork should almost always be perfect
the<00:05:57.240> only<00:05:57.300> thing<00:05:57.570> that<00:05:57.720> you<00:05:57.810> might<00:05:57.960> lack<00:05:58.350> in<00:05:58.590> a

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
the only thing that you might lack in a

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.650 
the only thing that you might lack in a
little<00:05:58.890> bit<00:05:59.010> is<00:05:59.130> personal<00:06:00.030> but<00:06:00.210> the<00:06:00.390> score

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
little bit is personal but the score

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.180 
little bit is personal but the score
that<00:06:00.750> you're<00:06:00.900> losing<00:06:01.230> is<00:06:01.350> so<00:06:01.530> minimum<00:06:01.950> it

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
that you're losing is so minimum it

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.510 
that you're losing is so minimum it
should<00:06:02.400> not<00:06:02.580> matter<00:06:03.590> then<00:06:04.590> for<00:06:05.250> the<00:06:05.340> final

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
should not matter then for the final

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.730 
should not matter then for the final
part<00:06:05.880> it<00:06:06.090> is<00:06:06.360> challenge<00:06:07.020> completion

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
part it is challenge completion

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.410 
part it is challenge completion
challenge<00:06:08.070> completion<00:06:08.490> is<00:06:08.580> very<00:06:08.790> basic<00:06:09.210> it<00:06:09.360> is

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:09.420 
challenge completion is very basic it is

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.020 
challenge completion is very basic it is
worth<00:06:09.900> quite<00:06:10.260> a<00:06:10.320> bit<00:06:10.530> or<00:06:10.860> when<00:06:11.730> you<00:06:11.820> start

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
worth quite a bit or when you start

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.100 
worth quite a bit or when you start
getting<00:06:12.210> to<00:06:12.270> the<00:06:12.300> end<00:06:12.510> of<00:06:12.570> the<00:06:12.630> game<00:06:12.750> and<00:06:12.930> it

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
getting to the end of the game and it

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.290 
getting to the end of the game and it
could<00:06:13.350> make<00:06:13.710> or<00:06:14.010> break<00:06:14.040> a<00:06:14.310> run<00:06:14.700> a<00:06:14.910> lot<00:06:15.090> of<00:06:15.210> the

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
could make or break a run a lot of the

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.900 
could make or break a run a lot of the
time<00:06:15.510> if<00:06:15.720> you<00:06:15.900> get<00:06:16.380> a<00:06:16.440> bad<00:06:16.830> challenge<00:06:17.520> it<00:06:17.700> could

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
time if you get a bad challenge it could

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.140 
time if you get a bad challenge it could
actually<00:06:18.120> spoil<00:06:18.840> run<00:06:19.670> but<00:06:20.670> you<00:06:20.790> want<00:06:20.970> to<00:06:21.000> make

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
actually spoil run but you want to make

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.640 
actually spoil run but you want to make
sure<00:06:21.180> you<00:06:21.390> gain<00:06:21.570> completions<00:06:22.260> whenever

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
sure you gain completions whenever

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.290 
sure you gain completions whenever
you're<00:06:22.830> doing<00:06:22.950> a<00:06:23.160> high<00:06:23.310> score<00:06:23.640> run<00:06:23.850> because

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
you're doing a high score run because

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.900 
you're doing a high score run because
family<00:06:24.840> that<00:06:24.960> challenge<00:06:25.350> is<00:06:25.470> Oh<00:06:25.800> score<00:06:26.700> loss

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
family that challenge is Oh score loss

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.080 
family that challenge is Oh score loss
so<00:06:27.780> this<00:06:28.230> is<00:06:28.500> basically<00:06:29.010> all<00:06:29.310> the<00:06:29.550> mechanics

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
so this is basically all the mechanics

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.200 
so this is basically all the mechanics
of<00:06:30.210> score<00:06:30.480> is<00:06:30.660> very<00:06:31.080> basic<00:06:31.560> it's

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
of score is very basic it's

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.200 
of score is very basic it's
very<00:06:32.360> simple<00:06:32.949> it's<00:06:33.949> actually<00:06:34.190> a<00:06:34.460> lot<00:06:35.000> less

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
very simple it's actually a lot less

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.520 
very simple it's actually a lot less
complicated<00:06:35.479> than<00:06:35.780> everybody<00:06:36.229> thought<00:06:36.380> it

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
complicated than everybody thought it

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.590 
complicated than everybody thought it
was<00:06:36.710> so<00:06:37.400> basically<00:06:37.819> if<00:06:38.000> you<00:06:38.030> want<00:06:38.210> to<00:06:38.330> get<00:06:38.449> high

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
was so basically if you want to get high

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.430 
was so basically if you want to get high
scores<00:06:38.960> the<00:06:39.650> plan<00:06:40.340> is<00:06:40.550> nobody<00:06:41.180> go<00:06:41.300> down<00:06:41.509> don't

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
scores the plan is nobody go down don't

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.469 
scores the plan is nobody go down don't
take<00:06:42.620> much<00:06:42.800> damage<00:06:42.979> always<00:06:43.669> have<00:06:43.849> armor<00:06:44.270> only

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 
take much damage always have armor only

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:47.620 
take much damage always have armor only
use<00:06:45.020> grenades<00:06:45.410> or<00:06:45.620> it<00:06:45.740> get<00:06:46.250> ten<00:06:46.550> drops<00:06:46.849> in<00:06:47.180> that

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
use grenades or it get ten drops in that

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.659 
use grenades or it get ten drops in that
drops<00:06:47.930> count<00:06:48.289> for<00:06:48.560> a<00:06:48.590> total<00:06:48.919> thrown<00:06:49.370> and

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669 
drops count for a total thrown and

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:52.900 
drops count for a total thrown and
picked<00:06:50.330> up<00:06:50.569> but<00:06:51.220> dropping<00:06:52.220> money<00:06:52.550> doesn't

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.910 
picked up but dropping money doesn't

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.790 
picked up but dropping money doesn't
count<00:06:53.060> but<00:06:53.240> picking<00:06:53.599> up<00:06:53.750> money<00:06:54.020> does<00:06:54.319> that's<00:06:54.620> a

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
count but picking up money does that's a

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.010 
count but picking up money does that's a
big<00:06:55.009> thing<00:06:55.250> dropping<00:06:56.120> money<00:06:56.300> doesn't<00:06:56.870> count

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020 
big thing dropping money doesn't count

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.659 
big thing dropping money doesn't count
but<00:06:57.289> picking<00:06:57.680> up<00:06:57.800> money<00:06:58.009> does<00:06:59.229> and<00:07:00.229> then<00:07:00.740> do

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:01.669 
but picking up money does and then do

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:04.029 
but picking up money does and then do
enough<00:07:01.940> damage<00:07:01.970> and<00:07:02.539> then<00:07:02.750> boom<00:07:03.080> you<00:07:03.530> will<00:07:03.770> get

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:04.039 
enough damage and then boom you will get

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:06.909 
enough damage and then boom you will get
a<00:07:04.069> perfect<00:07:04.460> score<00:07:05.000> every<00:07:05.630> single<00:07:05.960> time<00:07:06.139> it<00:07:06.440> is

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919 
a perfect score every single time it is

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:09.550 
a perfect score every single time it is
a<00:07:06.949> lot<00:07:07.310> easier<00:07:07.690> it's<00:07:08.690> a<00:07:08.780> lot<00:07:09.020> harder<00:07:09.289> than<00:07:09.410> it

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.560 
a lot easier it's a lot harder than it

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.830 
a lot easier it's a lot harder than it
sounds<00:07:09.979> but<00:07:10.130> it's<00:07:10.310> not<00:07:10.520> that<00:07:10.880> complicated<00:07:11.360> and

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 
sounds but it's not that complicated and

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.990 
sounds but it's not that complicated and
I<00:07:12.139> believe<00:07:12.650> it's<00:07:12.919> within<00:07:13.160> everybody's<00:07:13.580> reach

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 
I believe it's within everybody's reach

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.110 
I believe it's within everybody's reach
to<00:07:14.150> get<00:07:14.330> a<00:07:14.360> pretty<00:07:14.720> decent<00:07:14.780> high<00:07:15.259> score<00:07:16.120> hope

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 
to get a pretty decent high score hope
