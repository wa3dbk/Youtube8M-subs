it gets near the ends it feels a little

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.580 
it gets near the ends it feels a little
almost<00:03:16.500> dry<00:03:17.129> so<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.760> hairline<00:03:18.150> isn't<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.959> the

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
almost dry so the hairline isn't and the

almost dry so the hairline isn't and the
one<00:03:19.799> thing<00:03:20.159> I<00:03:20.400> will<00:03:20.519> say<00:03:20.760> as<00:03:21.299> far<00:03:21.599> as<00:03:21.810> cons<00:03:22.260> to

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
one thing I will say as far as cons to

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.569 
one thing I will say as far as cons to
this<00:03:22.680> unit<00:03:23.280> is<00:03:23.750> this<00:03:24.980> almost<00:03:25.980> line<00:03:26.340> of

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
this unit is this almost line of

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.509 
this unit is this almost line of
demarcation<00:03:26.790> as<00:03:27.629> if<00:03:27.870> this<00:03:28.590> is<00:03:28.799> some<00:03:29.010> relaxed

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
demarcation as if this is some relaxed

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.569 
demarcation as if this is some relaxed
hair<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.030> this<00:03:30.209> was<00:03:30.769> this<00:03:31.769> was<00:03:31.829> you<00:03:32.280> know<00:03:32.400> it's

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
hair and this was this was you know it's

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.369 
hair and this was this was you know it's
just<00:03:32.669> a<00:03:32.819> different<00:03:33.030> texture<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.810> must<00:03:34.200> be

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
just a different texture it must be

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.470 
just a different texture it must be
something<00:03:34.650> as<00:03:35.040> far<00:03:35.400> as<00:03:35.489> how<00:03:35.700> they<00:03:35.909> process<00:03:36.209> the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
something as far as how they process the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.089 
something as far as how they process the
hair<00:03:36.989> because<00:03:37.799> i<00:03:38.000> am<00:03:39.000> not<00:03:39.719> accustomed<00:03:40.590> to

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
hair because i am not accustomed to

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.720 
hair because i am not accustomed to
seeing<00:03:41.370> this<00:03:41.700> with<00:03:42.359> a<00:03:42.389> lot<00:03:42.719> of<00:03:42.750> textured<00:03:43.379> wig

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.750 

a<00:03:47.110> little<00:03:48.110> bit<00:03:48.319> further<00:03:49.069> back<00:03:49.400> than<00:03:49.459> my

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
a little bit further back than my

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:58.660 
a little bit further back than my
hairline<00:03:50.440> it<00:03:51.440> is<00:03:52.330> very<00:03:53.330> straight<00:03:53.810> across<00:03:57.670> not

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
hairline it is very straight across not

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.399 
hairline it is very straight across not
too<00:03:59.000> many<00:03:59.150> dips<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.659> curves<00:03:59.840> in<00:04:00.080> the<00:04:00.200> hairline

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
too many dips and curves in the hairline

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:05.589 
too many dips and curves in the hairline
is<00:04:01.720> extremely<00:04:02.720> full<00:04:03.340> so<00:04:04.340> for<00:04:04.819> a<00:04:04.849> more<00:04:05.090> natural

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
is extremely full so for a more natural

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.619 
is extremely full so for a more natural
look<00:04:06.010> definitely<00:04:07.030> taking<00:04:08.030> out<00:04:08.180> some<00:04:08.390> of<00:04:08.540> the

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
look definitely taking out some of the

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.619 
look definitely taking out some of the
hairs<00:04:08.930> or<00:04:09.790> taking<00:04:10.790> out<00:04:10.940> some<00:04:11.150> of<00:04:11.299> your<00:04:11.450> own

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
hairs or taking out some of your own

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.050 
hairs or taking out some of your own
hair<00:04:11.959> in<00:04:12.110> the<00:04:12.230> front<00:04:12.410> could<00:04:13.160> make<00:04:13.459> it<00:04:13.610> work<00:04:13.819> a

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
hair in the front could make it work a

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.719 
hair in the front could make it work a
lot<00:04:14.239> better<00:04:14.450> for<00:04:14.810> you<00:04:14.959> even<00:04:15.200> though<00:04:15.590> I<00:04:15.950> like

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
lot better for you even though I like

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.569 
lot better for you even though I like
lace<00:04:17.389> fronts<00:04:17.989> or<00:04:18.139> full<00:04:18.859> lace<00:04:19.070> wigs<00:04:19.370> where<00:04:19.549> I

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
lace fronts or full lace wigs where I

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.770 
lace fronts or full lace wigs where I
don't<00:04:19.729> have<00:04:19.820> to<00:04:19.910> take<00:04:20.090> out<00:04:20.239> here<00:04:20.419> I<00:04:20.449> think<00:04:20.539> that

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
don't have to take out here I think that

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.659 
don't have to take out here I think that
defeats<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.109> purpose<00:04:21.440> you<00:04:22.070> can<00:04:22.250> get<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.430> nice

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
defeats the purpose you can get a nice

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.060 
defeats the purpose you can get a nice
look<00:04:23.030> at<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.479> hair<00:04:23.720> texture<00:04:24.289> this<00:04:24.590> has<00:04:24.830> no

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
look at the hair texture this has no

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.370 
look at the hair texture this has no
product<00:04:25.550> on<00:04:25.729> it<00:04:25.940> straight<00:04:26.630> out<00:04:26.810> of<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.169> box

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
product on it straight out of the box

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.330 
product on it straight out of the box
okay<00:04:28.539> now<00:04:29.539> one<00:04:29.810> thing<00:04:29.840> that<00:04:30.260> I<00:04:30.289> noticed<00:04:30.919> about

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
okay now one thing that I noticed about

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.740 
okay now one thing that I noticed about
the<00:04:31.610> hair<00:04:32.620> straight<00:04:33.620> away<00:04:33.889> was<00:04:34.550> that<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:35.150> hair

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
the hair straight away was that the hair

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.740 
the hair straight away was that the hair
texture<00:04:36.410> is<00:04:36.620> not<00:04:37.010> consistent<00:04:37.699> from<00:04:38.300> the<00:04:38.479> base

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
texture is not consistent from the base

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.820 
texture is not consistent from the base
or<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.490> roots<00:04:40.539> all<00:04:41.539> the<00:04:41.600> way<00:04:42.199> to<00:04:42.350> the<00:04:42.590> end

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
or the roots all the way to the end

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.909 
or the roots all the way to the end
