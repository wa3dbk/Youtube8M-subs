like have treats every now and then like

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.900 
like have treats every now and then like
it's<00:02:45.800> not<00:02:45.950> like<00:02:46.070> we<00:02:46.190> eat<00:02:46.340> like<00:02:46.520> this<00:02:46.700> every

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
it's not like we eat like this every

single day and it's true and it is okay
it's<00:02:51.260> just<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.800> guess<00:02:52.580> it's<00:02:52.910> hard<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.300> accept

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
it's just I guess it's hard to accept

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.229 
it's just I guess it's hard to accept
and<00:02:54.050> I'm<00:02:54.830> learning<00:02:55.160> how<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.340> accept<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:55.970> but

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
and I'm learning how to accept it but

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.710 
and I'm learning how to accept it but
it's<00:02:56.570> still<00:02:56.989> difficult<00:02:57.730> but<00:02:58.730> anyway<00:02:59.180> yeah<00:02:59.420> so

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
it's still difficult but anyway yeah so
