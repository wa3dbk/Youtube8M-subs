00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
very first thing we're going to do is

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.709 
very first thing we're going to do is
I'm<00:00:51.809> going<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.020> come<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.710> put<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.719> some

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
I'm going to come in and put in some

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.340 
I'm going to come in and put in some
actual<00:00:55.559> walls<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:56.910> can<00:00:57.120> really<00:00:57.899> jump<00:00:58.170> on

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
actual walls that we can really jump on

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.340 
actual walls that we can really jump on
because<00:00:58.770> right<00:00:58.980> now<00:00:59.160> there's<00:01:00.050> not<00:01:01.050> really

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
because right now there's not really

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.250 
because right now there's not really
much<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.180> jump<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.809> I'm<00:01:03.870> going<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.049> change

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
much to jump on so I'm going to change

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.950 
much to jump on so I'm going to change
our<00:01:04.379> x<00:01:04.589> snap<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.519> 16<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.510> because<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.810> feel

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
our x snap to 16 just because I feel

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.480 
our x snap to 16 just because I feel
like<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.470> game<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.979> works<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.340> little

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
like with this game it works a little

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.010 
like with this game it works a little
bit<00:01:08.729> better<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> wall<00:01:09.570> that's<00:01:09.840> a

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
bit better to have a wall that's a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.219 
bit better to have a wall that's a
little<00:01:10.260> thicker<00:01:10.729> so<00:01:11.729> we'll<00:01:11.909> go<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.240> and

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.410 

I'm<00:01:16.229> actually<00:01:16.439> going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.860> put<00:01:17.180> one<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.299> these

you know what I'm going to put one of

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.090 
you know what I'm going to put one of
these<00:01:26.759> right<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.590> make<00:01:28.740> things<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
these right here just to make things a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.350 
these right here just to make things a
little<00:01:29.220> interesting<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:31.670> we've<00:01:32.670> edited<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
for a wall jump now come into the player

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.249 
for a wall jump now come into the player
object<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:39.439> go<00:01:40.439> into<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.799> step<00:01:41.189> event<00:01:41.369> and

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
object and go into the step event and

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.389 
object and go into the step event and
the<00:01:43.259> only<00:01:43.530> thing<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.070> we're<00:01:44.189> going<00:01:44.310> to

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the only thing that we're going to

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.060 
the only thing that we're going to
change<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.329> moving<00:01:45.689> right<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.290> moving

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
change is the moving right and moving

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.399 
change is the moving right and moving
left<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.479> moving<00:01:48.840> right<00:01:49.049> we're<00:01:49.290> going

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
left so in the moving right we're going

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.800 
left so in the moving right we're going
to<00:01:49.470> add<00:01:49.590> some<00:01:49.890> code<00:01:50.159> down<00:01:50.399> here<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.600> it's

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
to add some code down here and it's

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.819 
to add some code down here and it's
going<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.049> be<00:01:52.399> left<00:01:53.420> wall<00:01:54.420> jump<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.680> we're

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
going to be left wall jump so we're

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.560 
going to be left wall jump so we're
actually<00:01:56.040> jumping<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> right<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.420> we're

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
actually jumping to the right but we're

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.749 
actually jumping to the right but we're
jumping<00:01:57.810> off<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> wall<00:01:58.649> that's<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.130> our<00:01:59.159> left

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
jumping off a wall that's to our left

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:08.900 
jumping off a wall that's to our left
so<00:01:59.969> if<00:02:01.070> place<00:02:02.270> meeting<00:02:03.270> x<00:02:04.009> -1<00:02:05.750> Y<00:02:07.039> object<00:02:08.039> solid

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
so if place meeting x -1 Y object solid

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.350 
so if place meeting x -1 Y object solid
and

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.540 

not<00:02:13.160> place<00:02:14.660> meeting<00:02:15.710> X<00:02:17.030> y<00:02:18.030> plus<00:02:18.060> one<00:02:19.550> object

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
not place meeting X y plus one object

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.700 
not place meeting X y plus one object
solid<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:23.720> oops<00:02:24.720> that's<00:02:24.930> too<00:02:25.560> many

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
solid and oops that's too many

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:34.970 
solid and oops that's too many
ampersands<00:02:26.460> and<00:02:26.840> not<00:02:27.920> elke<00:02:32.300> I<00:02:33.950> forgot<00:02:34.950> a

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
ampersands and not elke I forgot a

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.680 
ampersands and not elke I forgot a
parenthesis<00:02:35.160> right<00:02:35.820> here<00:02:36.710> sweet<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:39.060> what<00:02:39.540> is

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
parenthesis right here sweet so what is

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.660 
parenthesis right here sweet so what is
that<00:02:39.720> going<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.440> do<00:02:40.910> well<00:02:42.710> we<00:02:43.710> are<00:02:43.740> going<00:02:44.250> to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
that going to do well we are going to

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.430 
that going to do well we are going to
change<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.420> vertical<00:02:45.780> speed<00:02:45.990> we're<00:02:46.260> going<00:02:46.380> to

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
change the vertical speed we're going to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.280 
change the vertical speed we're going to
jump<00:02:46.770> basically<00:02:47.700> V<00:02:48.060> speed<00:02:49.490> equals<00:02:50.490> negative<00:02:51.290> J

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
jump basically V speed equals negative J

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.750 
jump basically V speed equals negative J
speed<00:02:52.850> okay<00:02:54.709> so<00:02:55.709> what<00:02:55.920> does<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.190> say<00:02:56.490> this

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
speed okay so what does this say this

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.390 
speed okay so what does this say this
says<00:02:57.060> if<00:02:57.270> place<00:02:57.750> meeting<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.680> left<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.280> if

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
says if place meeting to the left so if

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.300 
says if place meeting to the left so if
we're<00:02:59.580> touching<00:02:59.760> a<00:03:00.030> wall<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.920> not<00:03:01.920> place

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
we're touching a wall and not place

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.640 
we're touching a wall and not place
meeting<00:03:02.760> underneath<00:03:03.330> us<00:03:03.570> so<00:03:04.410> if<00:03:04.500> we're

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
meeting underneath us so if we're

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.949 
meeting underneath us so if we're
touching<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.070> wall<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.640> we're<00:03:06.480> not<00:03:06.630> on<00:03:06.810> the

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
touching a wall and we're not on the

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.090 
touching a wall and we're not on the
ground<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:08.990> we're<00:03:09.990> not<00:03:10.170> pressing<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.860> left

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
ground and we're not pressing the left

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.800 
ground and we're not pressing the left
key<00:03:11.430> anymore<00:03:11.850> because<00:03:12.060> if<00:03:12.240> they're<00:03:12.420> pressing

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
key anymore because if they're pressing

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.570 
key anymore because if they're pressing
the<00:03:12.930> left<00:03:13.170> key<00:03:13.470> still<00:03:13.709> up<00:03:13.890> against<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.340> wall

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
the left key still up against the wall

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.910 
the left key still up against the wall
and<00:03:14.990> then<00:03:15.990> press<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.350> right<00:03:16.500> key<00:03:16.530> then

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
and then press the right key then

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.350 
and then press the right key then
they'll<00:03:17.040> just<00:03:17.220> shoot<00:03:17.489> straight<00:03:17.730> up<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.239> we

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
they'll just shoot straight up so we

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.030 
they'll just shoot straight up so we
want<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.570> make<00:03:18.660> sure<00:03:18.690> they're<00:03:18.959> not<00:03:19.650> pressing

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
want to make sure they're not pressing

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.410 
want to make sure they're not pressing
the<00:03:20.310> left<00:03:20.519> key<00:03:20.820> anymore<00:03:21.120> they're<00:03:21.269> now

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
the left key anymore they're now

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.630 
the left key anymore they're now
pressing<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.019> right<00:03:22.170> key<00:03:22.440> then<00:03:23.310> we<00:03:23.459> just

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
pressing the right key then we just

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.070 
pressing the right key then we just
change<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.090> vertical<00:03:24.540> speed<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:24.989> you'll

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
change the vertical speed and you'll

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.860 
change the vertical speed and you'll
notice<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.560> didn't<00:03:25.830> use<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.100> curly<00:03:26.489> braces<00:03:26.870> you

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
notice I didn't use the curly braces you

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.380 
notice I didn't use the curly braces you
can<00:03:28.260> write<00:03:28.620> here<00:03:28.980> but<00:03:29.670> because<00:03:29.910> there's<00:03:30.269> only

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
can write here but because there's only

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.870 
can write here but because there's only
one<00:03:30.750> line<00:03:31.080> after<00:03:31.380> this<00:03:31.769> if<00:03:32.010> statement<00:03:32.190> I'm<00:03:32.640> not

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
one line after this if statement I'm not

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.400 
one line after this if statement I'm not
going<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.090> use<00:03:33.269> them<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:33.780> there's<00:03:34.110> a<00:03:34.200> little

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
going to use them so there's a little

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.800 
going to use them so there's a little
trick<00:03:34.620> for<00:03:34.800> you<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:35.070> you<00:03:35.160> can<00:03:35.310> do<00:03:35.540> now<00:03:36.540> let's

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
trick for you that you can do now let's

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:47.090 
trick for you that you can do now let's
do<00:03:38.180> write<00:03:39.260> wall<00:03:40.260> jump<00:03:42.290> if<00:03:43.580> place<00:03:44.930> needing<00:03:46.100> X

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
do write wall jump if place needing X

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.190 
do write wall jump if place needing X
plus<00:03:47.910> 1<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:48.450> time<00:03:48.630> because<00:03:48.870> it's<00:03:49.019> to<00:03:49.170> the

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
plus 1 this time because it's to the

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.490 
plus 1 this time because it's to the
right

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
right

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.860 
right
y<00:03:49.980> objects<00:03:50.970> solid<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:53.510> not<00:03:54.510> place<00:03:55.459> needing<00:03:56.459> I

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
y objects solid and not place needing I

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.620 
y objects solid and not place needing I
love<00:03:57.870> wall<00:03:58.110> jumps<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:58.739> am<00:03:59.430> super<00:04:00.090> excited<00:04:00.120> for

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
love wall jumps I am super excited for

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.290 
love wall jumps I am super excited for
this<00:04:00.989> tutorial<00:04:01.170> I<00:04:01.709> was<00:04:02.400> really<00:04:02.730> proud<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.030> it

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
this tutorial I was really proud of it

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.810 
this tutorial I was really proud of it
even<00:04:03.720> though<00:04:03.810> it's<00:04:03.959> really<00:04:04.530> simple<00:04:04.830> like<00:04:05.610> it's

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
even though it's really simple like it's

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.640 
even though it's really simple like it's
not<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.060> hard<00:04:06.480> tutorial<00:04:07.170> it's<00:04:07.980> really<00:04:08.310> easy<00:04:08.549> I

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
not a hard tutorial it's really easy I

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.830 
not a hard tutorial it's really easy I
really<00:04:10.650> like<00:04:10.860> wall<00:04:11.130> jumps<00:04:11.549> I<00:04:11.790> think<00:04:12.690> one<00:04:12.810> of

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
really like wall jumps I think one of

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.660 
really like wall jumps I think one of
the<00:04:12.989> first<00:04:13.170> wall<00:04:13.500> jump<00:04:13.769> games<00:04:14.190> that<00:04:14.430> I<00:04:14.519> ever

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
the first wall jump games that I ever

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.219 
the first wall jump games that I ever
saw<00:04:14.940> was<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.959> Super<00:04:16.859> Mario<00:04:17.100> Sunshine<00:04:18.140> for<00:04:19.140> the

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
saw was a Super Mario Sunshine for the

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.039 
saw was a Super Mario Sunshine for the
Gamecube<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:19.979> that<00:04:20.250> was<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.669> fun<00:04:21.209> game<00:04:21.539> and<00:04:21.810> I

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
Gamecube and that was a fun game and I

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.900 
Gamecube and that was a fun game and I
thought<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:22.680> was<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.100> cool<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:23.400> you<00:04:23.700> could

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
thought it was so cool that you could

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.650 
thought it was so cool that you could
jump<00:04:24.150> off<00:04:24.330> of<00:04:24.360> walls<00:04:24.750> and

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
jump off of walls and

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.720 
jump off of walls and
wish<00:04:25.780> I<00:04:25.900> could<00:04:26.050> do<00:04:26.140> it<00:04:26.170> in<00:04:26.290> real<00:04:26.470> life<00:04:26.710> but<00:04:27.160> that

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
wish I could do it in real life but that

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.220 
wish I could do it in real life but that
doesn't<00:04:28.420> really<00:04:28.510> work<00:04:28.810> so<00:04:29.850> okay<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.170> this<00:04:32.170> is

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
doesn't really work so okay and this is

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.440 
doesn't really work so okay and this is
basically<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.950> same<00:04:33.130> thing<00:04:33.430> only<00:04:33.580> for<00:04:34.360> the

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
basically the same thing only for the

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.570 
basically the same thing only for the
other<00:04:34.600> direction<00:04:34.900> so<00:04:35.680> now<00:04:36.010> let's<00:04:36.250> come<00:04:36.430> into

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
right and we can test it out hopefully
