discussion<00:01:26.340> began<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.270> come<00:01:27.450> about<00:01:27.689> because

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
discussion began to come about because

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.620 
discussion began to come about because
to<00:01:28.229> me<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:28.950> illogical<00:01:29.430> as<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.450> why

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
to me it is just illogical as to why

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.120 
to me it is just illogical as to why
that<00:01:30.869> would<00:01:30.930> even<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> thing<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
that would even be a thing and the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.300 
that would even be a thing and the
reason<00:01:32.520> why<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.820> say<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.750> because<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.530> you

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
reason why I say this is because if you

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.789 
reason why I say this is because if you
pay<00:01:35.850> attention<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> lot<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.780> shit<00:01:36.840> Super

Saiyan<00:01:38.070> God<00:01:38.390> is<00:01:39.390> not<00:01:39.630> even<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.350> not<00:01:40.560> stronger

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
Saiyan God is not even is not stronger
