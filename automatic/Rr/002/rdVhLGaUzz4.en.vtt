00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
leave it's that one and something should

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.100 
leave it's that one and something should
open<00:01:44.869> there's<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.960> book<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.229> there<00:01:47.180> and<00:01:48.180> use

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
open there's a book in there and use

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.899 
open there's a book in there and use
that<00:01:49.380> book<00:01:51.500> slice<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.799> there

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
that book slice it in there

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.249 
that book slice it in there
and<00:01:54.680> I'll<00:01:55.680> just<00:01:55.740> solve<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.490> puzzle<00:01:57.259> that's

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
and I'll just solve that puzzle that's

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.810 
and I'll just solve that puzzle that's
pretty<00:01:58.469> much<00:01:58.619> what<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:58.979> have<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.340> here<00:01:59.549> is

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
pretty much what you have to do here is

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.999 
pretty much what you have to do here is
just<00:01:59.850> match<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.200> picture<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.509> yeah<00:02:04.009> then

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
just match this picture so yeah then

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.330 
just match this picture so yeah then
once<00:02:05.220> you<00:02:05.369> do<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:07.049> door<00:02:07.289> opens<00:02:07.560> and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
once you do that the door opens and

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.620 
once you do that the door opens and
you're<00:02:08.580> done

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
you're done

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.300 
you're done
and<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.259> reason<00:02:10.530> why<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.679> said<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
and the reason why I said this is the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.979 
and the reason why I said this is the
hardest<00:02:11.430> one<00:02:12.150> because<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.569> don't<00:02:12.750> really

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
hardest one because I don't really

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.160 
hardest one because I don't really
understand<00:02:13.650> how<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:13.980> get<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:15.170> four

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
understand how you get the four

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.360 
understand how you get the four
different<00:02:17.690> bricks<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:19.650> open<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.040> treasure

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
different bricks to open that treasure

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.190 
different bricks to open that treasure
chest<00:02:20.489> but<00:02:21.000> that's<00:02:21.599> pretty<00:02:21.780> much<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.170> guys

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
chest but that's pretty much it guys

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.320 
chest but that's pretty much it guys
