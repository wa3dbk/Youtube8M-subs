that<00:02:20.459> movie<00:02:20.910> but<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.269> always<00:02:21.599> worry<00:02:21.900> about<00:02:22.110> the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
that movie but I always worry about the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.100 
that movie but I always worry about the
voices<00:02:22.760> like<00:02:23.760> for<00:02:23.970> example<00:02:24.480> if<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:24.840> saw<00:02:25.049> the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
voices like for example if you saw the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.160 
voices like for example if you saw the
movie<00:02:25.500> everywhere<00:02:26.099> Gene<00:02:26.340> Robinson<00:02:26.760> played<00:02:27.209> an

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
movie everywhere Gene Robinson played an

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.759 
movie everywhere Gene Robinson played an
Egyptian<00:02:28.890> official<00:02:29.599> now<00:02:30.599> do<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.560> think

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
Egyptian official now do you think

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.470 
Egyptian official now do you think
that's<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> way<00:02:32.160> he<00:02:32.310> really<00:02:32.489> sound<00:02:32.849> our

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
that's the way he really sound our

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.390 
that's the way he really sound our
Messiah

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
Messiah

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.740 
Messiah
I<00:02:36.799> don't<00:02:37.799> think<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.190> Charlton<00:02:38.610> Heston<00:02:39.180> did<00:02:39.569> not

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
I don't think so Charlton Heston did not

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.069 
I don't think so Charlton Heston did not
sound<00:02:40.079> like<00:02:40.170> Moses<00:02:41.030> Sommers<00:02:42.030> say<00:02:42.299> that<00:02:42.540> Moses

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
sound like Moses Sommers say that Moses

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.410 
sound like Moses Sommers say that Moses
actually<00:02:43.349> had<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.310> speech<00:02:44.610> impediment<00:02:45.000> he

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
actually had a speech impediment he

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.990 
actually had a speech impediment he
stuttered<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:47.190> actually<00:02:47.819> he<00:02:47.970> probably

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
stuttered so actually he probably

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.830 
stuttered so actually he probably
sounded<00:02:48.660> more<00:02:48.780> like<00:02:48.840> Porky<00:02:49.500> Pig<00:02:49.530> than<00:02:50.040> he<00:02:50.220> did

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
sounded more like Porky Pig than he did

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.619 
sounded more like Porky Pig than he did
Charlton<00:02:51.840> Heston<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:53.239> that's<00:02:54.239> all<00:02:54.420> they

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
Charlton Heston and that's all they

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.750 
Charlton Heston and that's all they
wrote<00:02:54.840> that's<00:02:55.500> probably<00:02:56.100> closer<00:02:56.400> with<00:02:56.700> the

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
wrote that's probably closer with the

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.440 
wrote that's probably closer with the
way

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
way

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.150 
way
now<00:02:59.450> he<00:02:59.510> was<00:02:59.780> Hebrew<00:03:00.260> maybe<00:03:00.590> sounded<00:03:01.070> like

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
now he was Hebrew maybe sounded like

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.430 
now he was Hebrew maybe sounded like
Jackie<00:03:01.460> Mason<00:03:01.760> now<00:03:02.570> look<00:03:02.780> we've<00:03:02.990> already<00:03:03.140> got

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
Jackie Mason now look we've already got

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.780 
Jackie Mason now look we've already got
boiled<00:03:03.830> so<00:03:03.920> we've<00:03:04.010> got<00:03:04.160> flies<00:03:04.400> we've<00:03:04.640> got

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
boiled so we've got flies we've got

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.520 
boiled so we've got flies we've got
bupkis<00:03:05.240> we've<00:03:05.420> got<00:03:05.510> frogs<00:03:05.750> would<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.350> really

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
bupkis we've got frogs would it really

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.730 
bupkis we've got frogs would it really
hurt<00:03:06.770> to<00:03:06.950> let<00:03:07.070> my<00:03:07.190> people<00:03:07.250> go<00:03:08.260> that's<00:03:09.260> probably

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
hurt to let my people go that's probably

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.410 
hurt to let my people go that's probably
more<00:03:09.920> accurate<00:03:10.490> if<00:03:10.610> you<00:03:10.700> think<00:03:10.940> about<00:03:11.060> it<00:03:13.120> now

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
more accurate if you think about it now

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.060 
more accurate if you think about it now
