00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
for a good strong tackle but that seemed

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.580 
for a good strong tackle but that seemed
to<00:01:30.000> swing<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> balance<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> play<00:01:31.020> back

we had a little bit of drama that I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.260 
we had a little bit of drama that I
think<00:01:43.920> our<00:01:44.070> cameras<00:01:44.460> might<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:45.000> caught

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
think our cameras might have just caught

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.730 
think our cameras might have just caught

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.910 
Christopher may look like he put his
hands<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> referee<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.380> gave<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> bit<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.860> a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
hands on the referee and gave a bit of a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920 
hands on the referee and gave a bit of a
shove<00:01:50.159> he<00:01:50.549> received<00:01:50.970> his<00:01:51.060> marching<00:01:51.329> orders<00:01:51.600> so
