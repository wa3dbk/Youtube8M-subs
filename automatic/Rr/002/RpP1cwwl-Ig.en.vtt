server series that I'm doing the

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.970

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
because I have seen quite a few comments

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.160 
because I have seen quite a few comments
more<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.820> past<00:00:15.000> but<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.570> few<00:00:15.929> have<00:00:16.049> been

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
more so in the past but a few have been

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.859 
more so in the past but a few have been
popping<00:00:16.590> up<00:00:16.680> recently<00:00:17.180> not<00:00:18.180> directed<00:00:18.630> at<00:00:18.720> me

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
popping up recently not directed at me

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.750 
popping up recently not directed at me
but<00:00:19.170> I'm<00:00:19.619> taking<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.039> into<00:00:20.189> my<00:00:20.279> own<00:00:20.310> hands<00:00:20.640> that

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
but I'm taking it into my own hands that

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.019 
but I'm taking it into my own hands that
be<00:00:21.090> able<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.270> answer<00:00:21.570> them<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.789> today<00:00:23.789> I'm

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
be able to answer them so today I'm

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.310 
be able to answer them so today I'm
going<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.300> teach<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.539> how<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.840> actually

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
going to teach you how to actually

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.320 
going to teach you how to actually
enable<00:00:25.980> others<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.519> connect<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.029> your<00:00:27.119> server

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
enable others to connect to your server

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.630 
enable others to connect to your server
because<00:00:28.050> usually<00:00:28.320> you're<00:00:29.039> able<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.429> connect

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
because usually you're able to connect

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.420 
because usually you're able to connect
to<00:00:29.670> your<00:00:29.849> server<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.960> when<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.260> give<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:32.099> IP

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
to your server but when you give the IP

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.520 
to your server but when you give the IP
to<00:00:32.460> someone<00:00:32.850> else<00:00:33.079> they<00:00:34.079> are<00:00:34.230> unable<00:00:34.350> to

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
to someone else they are unable to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.420 
to someone else they are unable to
connect<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.600> what<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.930> need<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.430> go

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
connect to it so what you need to do go

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.100 
connect to it so what you need to do go
into<00:00:38.550> server<00:00:39.230> take<00:00:40.230> down<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:42.020> remember<00:00:43.020> this

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
into server take down this remember this

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.569 
into server take down this remember this
it<00:00:43.350> usually<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.340> always<00:00:44.640> 2<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.210> 5<00:00:45.450> 5<00:00:45.719> 6<00:00:46.079> 5<00:00:46.579> but

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
it usually is always 2 to 5 5 6 5 but

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.150 
it usually is always 2 to 5 5 6 5 but
some<00:00:48.090> people<00:00:48.420> decide<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.809> change<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.950> just

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
some people decide to change it so just

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
need to find the ipv4 address which is

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.230 
need to find the ipv4 address which is
usually<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.260> second<00:03:05.740> one<00:03:05.860> that<00:03:06.040> appears<00:03:06.400> in

usually the second one that appears in

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.640 
usually the second one that appears in
this<00:03:07.360> case<00:03:07.600> it's<00:03:08.760> 192.168.0<00:03:09.760> point

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
this case it's 192.168.0 point

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.570 
this case it's 192.168.0 point
so<00:03:11.650> what<00:03:11.739> I'm<00:03:11.830> going<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:11.980> do<00:03:12.130> is<00:03:12.280> I'm<00:03:12.400> going<00:03:12.520> to

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.030 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
come<00:03:12.760> over<00:03:12.790> here<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.360> in<00:03:14.050> here<00:03:14.320> it<00:03:14.500> says<00:03:14.650> local

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
come over here and in here it says local

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.320 
come over here and in here it says local
IP<00:03:15.370> address<00:03:15.660> it's<00:03:16.660> already<00:03:16.900> got<00:03:17.020> the

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
IP address it's already got the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.640 
IP address it's already got the
192.168.0<00:03:19.360> so<00:03:19.989> I've<00:03:20.080> got<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.290> change<00:03:20.440> that

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
192.168.0 so I've got to change that

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.420 
192.168.0 so I've got to change that
last<00:03:20.980> digit<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.610> an<00:03:21.730> 8<00:03:22.530> now<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.590> starting<00:03:24.190> port

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
last digit to an 8 now the starting port

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.260 
last digit to an 8 now the starting port
was<00:03:25.030> that<00:03:25.209> port<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:25.780> we<00:03:26.700> saw<00:03:27.700> earlier<00:03:28.060> which

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
was that port that we saw earlier which

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.820 
was that port that we saw earlier which
was<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.570> 25565

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
was the 25565

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.199 
was the 25565
the<00:03:30.760> end<00:03:30.910> port<00:03:31.209> two<00:03:32.140> five<00:03:32.350> five<00:03:32.530> six<00:03:32.830> five<00:03:33.209> now

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
the end port two five five six five now

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.340 
the end port two five five six five now
with<00:03:34.360> protocol<00:03:34.900> is<00:03:35.530> TCP<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.430> UDP<00:03:37.140> we<00:03:38.140> need

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
with protocol is TCP and UDP we need

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.009 
with protocol is TCP and UDP we need
both<00:03:38.739> so<00:03:39.640> if<00:03:39.880> you're<00:03:40.060> only<00:03:40.209> able<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:40.540> do<00:03:40.780> one

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
both so if you're only able to do one

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.220 
both so if you're only able to do one
you<00:03:41.260> need<00:03:42.070> to<00:03:42.190> make<00:03:42.310> two<00:03:42.850> custom<00:03:43.390> rules<00:03:43.600> to

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
you need to make two custom rules to

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.009 
you need to make two custom rules to
enable<00:03:44.590> it<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:44.950> activate<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.519> across<00:03:45.730> both<00:03:46.019> you

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
enable it to activate it across both you

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.540 
enable it to activate it across both you
can<00:03:47.170> name<00:03:47.350> this<00:03:47.500> whatever<00:03:47.709> you<00:03:47.980> like<00:03:48.220> I

can name this whatever you like I

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.790 
can name this whatever you like I
usually<00:03:49.060> keep<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.720> related<00:03:50.200> like<00:03:50.440> all<00:03:50.620> your
