that<00:04:43.000> is<00:04:43.120> one<00:04:43.300> of<00:04:43.420> the<00:04:43.480> lightest<00:04:43.930> electric

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
that is one of the lightest electric

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.580 
that is one of the lightest electric
bikes<00:04:44.650> I<00:04:45.100> think<00:04:45.880> that<00:04:46.060> was<00:04:46.270> here<00:04:46.930> besides<00:04:47.410> the

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
bikes I think that was here besides the

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.610 
bikes I think that was here besides the
really<00:04:47.830> solid<00:04:48.160> holding<00:04:48.520> one<00:04:48.670> source<00:04:48.910> of

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
really solid holding one source of

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.580 
really solid holding one source of
as<00:04:49.919> beautified<00:04:50.400> talk

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
as beautified talk

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.740 
as beautified talk
so<00:04:53.160> you<00:04:53.460> know<00:04:53.550> one<00:04:53.760> thing<00:04:53.970> I've<00:04:54.090> noticed<00:04:54.270> with

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
so you know one thing I've noticed with

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.020 
so you know one thing I've noticed with
a<00:04:55.170> more<00:04:55.530> aggressive<00:04:55.770> design<00:04:56.340> like<00:04:56.640> this<00:04:56.760> where

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
a more aggressive design like this where

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.480 
a more aggressive design like this where
you<00:04:57.180> know<00:04:57.270> it<00:04:57.420> is<00:04:57.690> set<00:04:58.230> up<00:04:58.320> more<00:04:58.530> like<00:04:58.770> a<00:04:59.010> road

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
you know it is set up more like a road

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.160 
you know it is set up more like a road
bike<00:04:59.730> it<00:05:00.060> doesn't<00:05:00.480> have<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.630> drops<00:05:00.930> or

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
bike it doesn't have the drops or

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.450 
bike it doesn't have the drops or
anything<00:05:01.440> but<00:05:01.560> it's<00:05:01.710> you're<00:05:01.890> leaning<00:05:02.190> forward

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
anything but it's you're leaning forward

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.540 
anything but it's you're leaning forward
a<00:05:02.490> little<00:05:02.580> bit<00:05:02.670> more<00:05:03.890> having<00:05:04.890> having<00:05:05.280> a<00:05:05.430> bike

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
a little bit more having having a bike

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.220 
a little bit more having having a bike
that's<00:05:05.760> a<00:05:06.000> little<00:05:06.210> bit<00:05:06.330> lighter<00:05:06.570> it's<00:05:07.050> also

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
that's a little bit lighter it's also

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.170 
that's a little bit lighter it's also
got<00:05:07.530> these<00:05:07.740> smith<00:05:08.130> tires<00:05:08.490> and<00:05:08.820> stuff<00:05:08.940> so

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
got these smith tires and stuff so

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.820 
got these smith tires and stuff so
there's<00:05:09.360> low<00:05:09.510> rolling<00:05:09.750> resistance<00:05:10.050> it's

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
there's low rolling resistance it's

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.760 
there's low rolling resistance it's
probably<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.370> last<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:11.760> ride<00:05:12.260> if<00:05:13.260> you<00:05:13.680> are
