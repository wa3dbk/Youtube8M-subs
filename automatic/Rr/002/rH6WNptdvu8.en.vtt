00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
to read and go yeah that kind of makes a

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.220

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
little bit of sint la be a law make sure

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.589 
little bit of sint la be a law make sure
why<00:03:42.440> not<00:03:42.700> maybe<00:03:43.700> you<00:03:43.849> and<00:03:43.970> I<00:03:44.060> can<00:03:44.120> get<00:03:44.359> up<00:03:44.480> there

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
why not maybe you and I can get up there

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.270 
why not maybe you and I can get up there
and<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:45.169> move<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.889> American

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
and and and move the the American

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.920 
and and and move the the American
American<00:03:46.790> judicial<00:03:46.910> system<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:47.599> much<00:03:47.720> well<00:03:47.900> I

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
American judicial system so much well I

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.330 
American judicial system so much well I
think<00:03:48.049> most<00:03:48.349> people<00:03:48.650> would<00:03:48.680> agree<00:03:48.829> to<00:03:49.160> a

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
think most people would agree to a

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.680 
think most people would agree to a
certain<00:03:49.639> extent<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.120> American<00:03:50.540> judicial

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
certain extent the American judicial

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.830 
certain extent the American judicial
system<00:03:51.319> is<00:03:51.440> broken<00:03:51.739> I<00:03:52.040> mean<00:03:52.940> is<00:03:53.090> it<00:03:53.359> broken<00:03:53.599> to

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
system is broken I mean is it broken to

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.210 
system is broken I mean is it broken to
the<00:03:53.930> point<00:03:54.139> that<00:03:54.260> we<00:03:54.319> need<00:03:54.590> this<00:03:54.769> kind<00:03:54.950> of<00:03:55.069> an

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
the point that we need this kind of an

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.069 
the point that we need this kind of an
overhaul<00:03:55.609> too<00:03:55.790> but<00:03:55.970> you<00:03:56.090> know<00:03:56.150> I<00:03:56.239> think<00:03:56.630> so<00:03:56.750> I

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
overhaul too but you know I think so I

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.300 
overhaul too but you know I think so I
think<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:57.560> I<00:03:57.650> think<00:03:57.739> there<00:03:58.040> needs<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.250> be

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
think so I think there needs to be

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.890 
think so I think there needs to be
significant<00:03:58.849> change<00:03:59.030> done<00:03:59.269> somebody's<00:03:59.750> got

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
significant change done somebody's got

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.319 
significant change done somebody's got
to<00:03:59.930> do<00:04:00.079> something<00:04:00.109> you<00:04:00.980> just<00:04:01.639> can't<00:04:01.940> go<00:04:02.180> and

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
to do something you just can't go and

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.280 
to do something you just can't go and
get<00:04:02.450> away<00:04:02.660> with<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:02.900> things<00:04:03.109> that<00:04:03.230> were

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
get away with the things that were

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.750 
get away with the things that were
getting<00:04:03.410> away<00:04:03.620> with<00:04:03.799> today<00:04:03.950> and<00:04:04.280> I<00:04:04.519> think

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
getting away with today and I think

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
getting away with today and I think
someone<00:04:04.970> needs<00:04:05.000> to<00:04:05.150> do<00:04:05.239> something<00:04:05.269> about<00:04:05.599> it

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
someone needs to do something about it

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.690 
someone needs to do something about it
yeah<00:04:06.109> aside<00:04:06.980> from<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.250> book<00:04:07.430> are<00:04:07.609> you
