six<00:01:47.030> points<00:01:47.359> UAV<00:01:48.109> can<00:01:48.350> almost<00:01:48.560> get<00:01:49.009> you<00:01:49.250> system

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
six points UAV can almost get you system

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.929 
six points UAV can almost get you system
act<00:01:49.909> you<00:01:50.420> might<00:01:50.600> have<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.840> get<00:01:50.990> one<00:01:51.289> kill<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:52.909> I

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
act you might have to get one kill and I

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.270 
act you might have to get one kill and I
like<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.179> run<00:01:53.329> hard<00:01:53.630> line<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.049> my<00:01:54.200> UAV<00:01:54.710> with<00:01:55.100> the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
like to run hard line so my UAV with the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.370 
like to run hard line so my UAV with the
assist<00:01:55.640> points<00:01:55.880> it's<00:01:56.030> 350<00:01:56.810> so<00:01:56.929> it's<00:01:57.079> a<00:01:57.170> four

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
assist points it's 350 so it's a four

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.590 
assist points it's 350 so it's a four
kill<00:01:57.679> and<00:01:58.369> that<00:01:58.520> takes<00:01:58.700> me<00:01:58.820> up<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.390> takes

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
kill and that takes me up the that takes

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.169 
kill and that takes me up the that takes
me<00:01:59.750> up<00:01:59.840> to<00:01:59.960> 450<00:02:00.710> point<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:01.460> it<00:02:01.579> takes<00:02:01.820> me<00:02:01.969> up<00:02:02.060> to

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
me up to 450 point and it takes me up to

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.649 
me up to 450 point and it takes me up to
a<00:02:02.500> 400<00:02:03.500> points<00:02:03.679> and<00:02:04.039> system<00:02:04.670> hack<00:02:04.850> right<00:02:05.390> there

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
a 400 points and system hack right there

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.219 
a 400 points and system hack right there
as<00:02:05.780> a<00:02:05.810> 600<00:02:06.710> kill<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.670> UAV<00:02:08.420> usually<00:02:08.960> will<00:02:09.110> net

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
as a 600 kill so UAV usually will net

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.140 
as a 600 kill so UAV usually will net
you<00:02:09.259> about<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.560> hundred<00:02:10.039> to<00:02:10.100> 130<00:02:10.610> points<00:02:10.820> one

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
you about a hundred to 130 points one

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.000 
you about a hundred to 130 points one
more<00:02:11.330> kill<00:02:11.540> which<00:02:11.690> is<00:02:11.840> five<00:02:12.080> get<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:12.860> the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
more kill which is five get you the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.680 
more kill which is five get you the
system<00:02:13.340> axe<00:02:13.550> so<00:02:13.760> essentially<00:02:14.210> this<00:02:14.480> whole

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
system axe so essentially this whole

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.630 
system axe so essentially this whole
kill<00:02:14.930> streak<00:02:15.200> setup<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.680> 5<00:02:15.950> kill<00:02:16.250> setup

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
kill streak setup is a 5 kill setup

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.000 
kill streak setup is a 5 kill setup
because<00:02:17.540> once<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.080> system<00:02:18.440> hat<00:02:18.590> goes<00:02:18.769> live

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
because once the system hat goes live

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.160 
because once the system hat goes live
with<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:19.610> extra<00:02:20.060> status<00:02:20.300> points<00:02:20.720> on<00:02:20.840> it

with the extra status points on it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.710 
with the extra status points on it
well<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:22.400> will<00:02:22.670> give<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.180> bombing<00:02:23.510> run

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
well it will give you the bombing run

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.960 
well it will give you the bombing run
dead<00:02:24.380> serious<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:24.950> UAV<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.370> should<00:02:25.580> still<00:02:25.849> be

will be running together and they will

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.710 
will be running together and they will
get<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:30.860> bonny<00:02:31.099> bombing<00:02:31.670> run<00:02:31.849> damn<00:02:32.450> near

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
get you that bonny bombing run damn near

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.410 
get you that bonny bombing run damn near
every<00:02:33.110> time<00:02:33.319> you<00:02:34.040> don't<00:02:34.160> have<00:02:34.489> to<00:02:34.640> move<00:02:34.790> in<00:02:35.030> the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
bombing run which is 725 will usually

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.540 
bombing run which is 725 will usually
get<00:02:39.140> you<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:40.569> aerial<00:02:41.569> assault<00:02:41.930> drone<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:43.370> not

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
get you the aerial assault drone and not

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.640 
get you the aerial assault drone and not
all<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.940> time<00:02:44.150> but<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.780> fact<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.440> might

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
all the time but the fact is you might

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.170 
all the time but the fact is you might
have<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:45.950> get<00:02:46.040> an<00:02:46.190> assist<00:02:46.520> or<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.730> kill<00:02:46.970> at<00:02:47.150> the

have to get an assist or a kill at the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
end of it but the UAB and system hack if

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.759 
end of it but the UAB and system hack if
done<00:02:49.310> correctly<00:02:49.690> will<00:02:50.690> run<00:02:51.080> into<00:02:51.380> it<00:02:51.470> as<00:02:51.590> well

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
done correctly will run into it as well

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.740 
done correctly will run into it as well
just<00:02:51.980> watch<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.370> gameplay<00:02:52.580> here<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.239> you'll

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
just watch the gameplay here and you'll

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.199 
just watch the gameplay here and you'll
see<00:02:54.019> this<00:02:54.410> in<00:02:54.680> full<00:02:55.010> effect<00:02:55.160> how<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:55.970> works

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
see this in full effect how it works

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.400 
see this in full effect how it works
because<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.660> actually<00:02:56.870> go<00:02:57.170> through<00:02:57.290> the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
because I actually go through the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.559 
because I actually go through the
streaks<00:02:57.739> twice<00:02:58.069> so<00:02:58.819> I<00:02:58.850> think<00:02:58.910> some<00:02:59.209> actually

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
streaks twice so I think some actually

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.800 
streaks twice so I think some actually
leaves<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.870> leaves<00:03:00.230> during<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.340> game<00:03:01.810> and

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
leaves the leaves during the game and

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.320 
leaves the leaves during the game and
let<00:03:03.709> me<00:03:03.799> tell<00:03:03.950> you<00:03:04.069> why<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.340> aerial<00:03:04.850> drone<00:03:05.090> and

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
let me tell you why the aerial drone and

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.670 
let me tell you why the aerial drone and
what<00:03:05.420> I<00:03:05.450> have<00:03:05.660> on<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:05.959> aerial<00:03:06.260> drone<00:03:06.410> I<00:03:06.530> don't

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
what I have on the aerial drone I don't

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
what I have on the aerial drone I don't
have<00:03:06.769> anything<00:03:06.950> on<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.190> bottom<00:03:07.430> of<00:03:07.489> ground

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
have anything on the bottom of ground

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.009 
have anything on the bottom of ground
this<00:03:07.760> is<00:03:07.819> standard<00:03:08.299> but<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.510> aerial<00:03:08.810> drone<00:03:08.989> I

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
this is standard but the aerial drone I

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.130 
this is standard but the aerial drone I
have<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.620> a<00:03:09.650> our<00:03:10.040> reality<00:03:10.970> HUD<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:11.959> have

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
have the a our reality HUD and I have

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.229 
have the a our reality HUD and I have
the<00:03:12.260> Rockets<00:03:12.709> you<00:03:13.489> can<00:03:13.640> get<00:03:13.760> about<00:03:13.910> nine

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
the Rockets you can get about nine

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.479 
the Rockets you can get about nine
sometimes<00:03:15.140> twelve<00:03:15.560> depending<00:03:16.010> on<00:03:16.130> how<00:03:16.250> fast

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
sometimes twelve depending on how fast

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.610 
sometimes twelve depending on how fast
you<00:03:16.670> shoot<00:03:16.910> rockets<00:03:17.900> off<00:03:18.080> so<00:03:18.319> that's<00:03:18.440> about

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
you shoot rockets off so that's about

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.410 
you shoot rockets off so that's about
how<00:03:19.010> many<00:03:19.220> how<00:03:19.430> many<00:03:19.459> Rockets<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.209> can<00:03:20.330> get

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
how many how many Rockets you can get

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.780 
how many how many Rockets you can get
off<00:03:20.540> just<00:03:20.750> go<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.019> say<00:03:21.170> it's<00:03:21.319> nine<00:03:21.670> so<00:03:22.670> you're

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
off just go and say it's nine so you're

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.690 
off just go and say it's nine so you're
gonna<00:03:22.880> get<00:03:23.060> anywhere<00:03:23.330> between<00:03:23.540> four<00:03:24.319> to<00:03:24.700> four

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
gonna get anywhere between four to four

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.849 
gonna get anywhere between four to four
to<00:03:25.880> nine<00:03:26.120> kills<00:03:26.600> so<00:03:26.870> I<00:03:26.930> want<00:03:27.109> to<00:03:27.200> say<00:03:27.320> ten<00:03:27.620> but

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
to nine kills so I want to say ten but

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.770 
to nine kills so I want to say ten but
it<00:03:28.430> all<00:03:28.549> depends<00:03:28.880> on<00:03:28.970> how<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:29.180> roll<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.690> if

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
it all depends on how you roll and if

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.479 
it all depends on how you roll and if
people<00:03:29.930> standing<00:03:30.380> together<00:03:30.530> obviously<00:03:31.340> go

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
people standing together obviously go

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.039 
people standing together obviously go
and<00:03:31.609> get<00:03:31.730> more<00:03:31.910> kills<00:03:32.150> on<00:03:32.510> games<00:03:32.870> like

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
and get more kills on games like

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.750 
and get more kills on games like
domination<00:03:33.680> or<00:03:33.859> momentum<00:03:34.130> where<00:03:34.519> they<00:03:34.609> have

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
domination or momentum where they have

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.970 
domination or momentum where they have
people<00:03:35.019> funneling<00:03:36.019> towards<00:03:36.320> the<00:03:36.410> spawn<00:03:36.650> point

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
people funneling towards the spawn point

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.490 
people funneling towards the spawn point
and<00:03:37.190> here's<00:03:37.790> why<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.570> assault<00:03:39.019> drone<00:03:39.170> is<00:03:39.320> good

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
and here's why the assault drone is good

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.400 
and here's why the assault drone is good
first<00:03:39.859> off<00:03:40.070> it<00:03:40.340> is<00:03:40.820> very<00:03:40.880> very<00:03:41.420> very<00:03:41.900> hard<00:03:42.260> to

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
first off it is very very very hard to

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.220 
first off it is very very very hard to
hit<00:03:42.560> I've<00:03:43.519> used<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:44.000> thing<00:03:44.209> for<00:03:44.660> a<00:03:44.690> prestige

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
hit I've used the thing for a prestige

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.990 
hit I've used the thing for a prestige
now<00:03:45.440> I<00:03:45.620> think<00:03:45.680> I've<00:03:45.920> had<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.190> shot<00:03:46.430> down<00:03:46.459> one

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
now I think I've had it shot down one

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.670 
now I think I've had it shot down one
time<00:03:47.239> that<00:03:47.630> entire<00:03:47.989> time<00:03:48.350> of<00:03:48.590> those

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
time that entire time of those

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.949 
time that entire time of those
prestigious<00:03:49.060> nobody<00:03:50.060> uses<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.570> stingers

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
prestigious nobody uses the stingers

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.270 
prestigious nobody uses the stingers
because<00:03:51.170> all<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:51.440> other<00:03:51.590> kill<00:03:51.829> streaks<00:03:52.130> are

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
because all the other kill streaks are

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.240 
because all the other kill streaks are
very<00:03:52.579> much<00:03:52.850> worthless<00:03:53.170> so<00:03:54.170> you<00:03:55.010> don't<00:03:55.160> really

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
very much worthless so you don't really

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.170 
very much worthless so you don't really
have<00:03:55.340> to<00:03:55.459> worry<00:03:55.579> about<00:03:55.670> anybody<00:03:55.910> with<00:03:56.150> a

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
have to worry about anybody with a

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.759 
have to worry about anybody with a
lock-on<00:03:56.570> launcher<00:03:57.019> coming<00:03:57.350> after<00:03:57.650> you're

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
lock-on launcher coming after you're

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.830 
lock-on launcher coming after you're
getting<00:03:58.130> it<00:03:58.280> either<00:03:58.519> and<00:03:58.850> most<00:03:59.420> of<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.630> time

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
getting it either and most of the time

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.720 
getting it either and most of the time
when<00:04:00.019> people<00:04:00.049> put<00:04:00.440> in<00:04:00.560> a<00:04:00.650> Sarah<00:04:00.890> salt<00:04:01.310> drone<00:04:01.519> up

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
when people put in a Sarah salt drone up

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.300 
when people put in a Sarah salt drone up
they've<00:04:02.510> used<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:02.930> manual<00:04:03.410> one<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:03.769> it's

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
they've used the manual one and it's

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.729 
they've used the manual one and it's
pretty<00:04:04.489> much<00:04:04.609> like<00:04:04.850> an<00:04:04.970> RC<00:04:05.299> XD<00:04:05.690> and<00:04:06.350> people<00:04:06.650> are

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
pretty much like an RC XD and people are

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.380 
pretty much like an RC XD and people are
not<00:04:06.890> afraid<00:04:06.980> of<00:04:07.250> it<00:04:07.430> all<00:04:07.670> so<00:04:08.030> they<00:04:08.239> don't

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
not afraid of it all so they don't

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.289 
not afraid of it all so they don't
really<00:04:08.569> pay<00:04:08.840> any<00:04:08.870> attention<00:04:09.140> to<00:04:09.500> it<00:04:09.799> but<00:04:10.400> it's

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
really pay any attention to it but it's

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.120 
really pay any attention to it but it's
a<00:04:11.480> very<00:04:11.750> beastly<00:04:12.350> kill<00:04:12.590> streak<00:04:12.829> matter<00:04:13.040> of

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
a very beastly kill streak matter of

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.349 
a very beastly kill streak matter of
fact<00:04:13.250> let's<00:04:13.430> go<00:04:13.549> ahead<00:04:13.609> and<00:04:13.760> put<00:04:13.910> a<00:04:14.030> clip<00:04:14.329> in

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
fact let's go ahead and put a clip in

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.659 
fact let's go ahead and put a clip in
here<00:04:14.720> of<00:04:14.870> a<00:04:15.410> very<00:04:15.620> beastly<00:04:16.010> kill<00:04:16.220> streak<00:04:16.489> with

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
here of a very beastly kill streak with

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.210 
here of a very beastly kill streak with
it<00:04:16.820> so<00:04:17.630> this<00:04:17.780> is<00:04:17.840> what<00:04:18.079> the<00:04:18.260> a<00:04:18.470> our<00:04:18.739> reality

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
it so this is what the a our reality

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.949 
it so this is what the a our reality
hunt<00:04:19.430> does<00:04:19.609> it<00:04:19.910> kind<00:04:20.299> of<00:04:20.359> puts<00:04:20.600> these<00:04:20.690> red

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
hunt does it kind of puts these red

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.150 
hunt does it kind of puts these red
boxes<00:04:21.229> around<00:04:21.680> all

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
boxes around all

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.860 
boxes around all
and<00:04:22.610> you<00:04:22.670> get<00:04:22.790> three<00:04:23.060> rockets<00:04:23.480> and<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.690> three

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
and you get three rockets and the three

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.200 
and you get three rockets and the three
Rockets<00:04:24.230> replenished<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:25.580> you<00:04:25.670> can<00:04:25.940> very

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
Rockets replenished so you can very

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.820 
Rockets replenished so you can very
easily<00:04:26.300> even<00:04:27.050> if<00:04:27.140> they<00:04:27.230> don't<00:04:27.410> have<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:27.680> red

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
easily even if they don't have the red

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.890 
easily even if they don't have the red
boxes<00:04:28.220> on<00:04:28.340> them<00:04:28.460> you<00:04:28.550> can<00:04:28.700> kind<00:04:28.880> of<00:04:28.940> tell<00:04:29.180> when

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
boxes on them you can kind of tell when

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.420 
boxes on them you can kind of tell when
the<00:04:30.050> enemies<00:04:30.320> are<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:30.710> this<00:04:30.890> is<00:04:31.100> what<00:04:31.250> makes

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
the enemies are and this is what makes

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.650 
the enemies are and this is what makes
this<00:04:31.580> go<00:04:31.760> through<00:04:31.820> so<00:04:32.120> much<00:04:32.240> more<00:04:32.480> effective

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
this go through so much more effective

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.360 
this go through so much more effective
than<00:04:32.960> like<00:04:33.140> the<00:04:33.260> Falcon<00:04:33.500> or

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
than like the Falcon or

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.910 
than like the Falcon or
the<00:04:34.940> warbird<00:04:35.450> because<00:04:35.810> you<00:04:35.930> can't<00:04:36.200> really<00:04:36.470> see

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
the warbird because you can't really see

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.620 
the warbird because you can't really see
enemies<00:04:37.370> in<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.580> palette<00:04:37.850> under<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.210> warbird

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
enemies in the palette under the warbird

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.690 
enemies in the palette under the warbird
not<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:39.020> mention<00:04:39.170> warbird<00:04:39.830> lasts<00:04:40.490> like<00:04:40.640> a

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
not to mention warbird lasts like a

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.850 
not to mention warbird lasts like a
total<00:04:41.120> of<00:04:41.210> 15<00:04:41.600> seconds<00:04:42.080> I<00:04:42.140> haven't<00:04:42.380> timed<00:04:42.650> it

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
total of 15 seconds I haven't timed it

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.280 
total of 15 seconds I haven't timed it
but<00:04:43.490> it<00:04:43.640> damn<00:04:43.850> near<00:04:43.880> isn't<00:04:44.450> thirty<00:04:44.660> seconds<00:04:45.200> if

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
but it damn near isn't thirty seconds if

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.080 
but it damn near isn't thirty seconds if
it's<00:04:45.470> thirty<00:04:45.710> second<00:04:46.190> time<00:04:46.370> you<00:04:46.520> know<00:04:46.670> I'm<00:04:47.030> a

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
it's thirty second time you know I'm a

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.000 
it's thirty second time you know I'm a
monkey's<00:04:47.540> uncle<00:04:47.660> because<00:04:48.050> it<00:04:48.200> literally<00:04:48.830> it

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
monkey's uncle because it literally it

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.600 
monkey's uncle because it literally it
lasts<00:04:49.220> like<00:04:49.400> 15<00:04:49.820> seconds<00:04:53.290> but<00:04:54.290> as<00:04:55.100> you<00:04:55.400> see

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
lasts like 15 seconds but as you see

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.530 
lasts like 15 seconds but as you see
right<00:04:55.640> there<00:04:56.000> and<00:04:56.090> here's<00:04:56.270> that<00:04:56.390> here's

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
right there and here's that here's

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.660 
right there and here's that here's
another<00:04:56.870> clip<00:04:57.170> I<00:04:57.350> don't<00:04:57.530> think<00:04:57.710> this<00:04:57.830> one<00:04:58.010> is

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
another clip I don't think this one is

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
so easy you can just constantly get

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.700 
so easy you can just constantly get
kills<00:05:22.250> there's<00:05:22.520> kill<00:05:22.730> number<00:05:22.910> six<00:05:23.710> what's

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.140 
kills there's kill number six what's
over<00:05:24.950> here<00:05:24.980> and<00:05:25.520> we're<00:05:25.610> gonna<00:05:25.700> cook<00:05:25.910> it<00:05:26.060> some
