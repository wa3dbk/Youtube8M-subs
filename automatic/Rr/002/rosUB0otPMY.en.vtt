00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 what to do with animals that suffer 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.940
 ill-treatment and end up abandoned in 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.250
 streets 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.620
 the report that we are going to show is a 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.530
 flagrant of cruelty 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.800
 The dog was inside the stream with 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.439
 four paws and only with the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.869
 head out of water cruelly 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.850
 left to die even 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.560
 the boys caught the eye of 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.490
 staff of a school that is in 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.890
 front 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.470
 security and a student rescued the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.719
 Animal actually a female 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.790
 the bitch did not have the strength to 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.879
 get up or eat 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.660
 ss animal life was triggered by the mother 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.059
 of a student about five hours later 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.640
 the president of the NGO was revolted with 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.660
 ill- treatment and also the lack of 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.120
 assistance 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.590
 the least we can expect from a 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.180
 educational institution is to take a 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.850
 providence that would be cheap so a 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.020
 taxi the dog boat the dog there and send by 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.510
 a veterinarian 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.100
 if applicable and then contacted 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.539
 with you, we'll do our 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.619
 work now we 're doing it 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.659
 everyone's work 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.000
 already the board of directors claimed not to have 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.770
 conditions to rescue the animal 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.930
 I could hardly take one 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.580
 that the student inspector who 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.380
 You are here to take care of children takes 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.119
 a street dog at the vet 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.970
 the dog was taken to a clinic 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.460
 by volunteers from the NGO 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.280
 immediately was put to tears and 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.320
 medicated and received morphine for pain and 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.180
 a warm blanket 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.890
 according to the veterinarian the case was 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.329
 quite serious 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.490
 besides the tumor the animal of 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.520
 approximately five years 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.579
 weak and suffering too much without 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.100
 salvation was the option for euthanasia will 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.710
 how much time was there 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.600
 time that stayed at night in that stream 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.060
 Taking cold without eating without bp without anything 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.960
 without structure, do not take care of 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.680
 a sick animal to mistreat and mutilate 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.920
 kill 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.719
 are examples of environmental crimes 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.149
 punishment exists if the owner is 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.580
 identified he will be punished may go 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.009
 to the chain for up to one year beyond 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.410
 pay a fine of up to 3 thousand reais 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.140
 beyond the lack of awareness 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.240
 the case reveals a problem in the absence of 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.160
 assistance to animals that have been 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.290
 victims of ill-treatment 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.110
 the expectation is a partnership between 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.930
 and the NGO that would be responsible 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.390
 rescue and recovery center 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.970
 the area has already been chosen 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.340
 entity maintained by volunteers depends 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.680
 the effectiveness of partnership and money 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.780
 to start the work the animals will go 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.570
 to a recovery center for 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.750
 then be re-socialized and thus be 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.730
 available for adoption 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.130
 and in the late afternoon the agricultural technician 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.740
 joão antonio soler called our 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.170
 and also made an appeal on the avenue 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.210
 europe in the garden piza a dog that 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.400
 died after being hit by a pickup truck 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.880
 Sunday is still in the central 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.780
 of the avenue and was directed to connect the 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.600
 cmtu 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.910
 were three called and no solution in the 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.010
 third time an employee would have said 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.330
 for your joão do what he wanted 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.000
 with the animal 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.860
 unfortunately there are some visions every 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.160
 something you listen to right? 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.890
 each interview each statement like this is 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.260
 to shiver more leave 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.810
 the electoral campaign in who knows someone 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.000
 that you have a little more respect and 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.050
 love of animals can see a 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.440
 convincing proposal i have not seen so far 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.959
 We look sad is to see a situation 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.810
 that's why we're far away 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.480
 not solve the problem of animals 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.110
 loose in the first streets are the owners 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:56.970
 nor the second responsible of the animals 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:00.000
 dead there is no service is suitable is 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.160
 precarious time not suitable for 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.260
 collect the dead animals and bring them to 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.250
 indicated place 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.820
 is not an NGO that strives as it can and 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.760
 waiting for a bureaucratic 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.640
 do not leave the paper or the cow cough 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.440
 so we say and there we still have 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:25.350
 situation of absolute lack of 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.680
 awareness of people which yields 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.639
 beautiful 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:37.620
 marketing matters that yields beautiful 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:41.259
 images are not and captive audiences are 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.919
 walks with cute little dogs tidy 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:47.889
 what will be or reality is well 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.449
 different from what is 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.020
 marketing both in political marketing 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:55.410
 institutional marketing like me 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.639
 said yesterday about the comments of the 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:05.259
 electoral campaigns when it comes to 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:08.770
 it is marketing that puts what is good the 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:11.380
 who needs to appear what sounds good what 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.099
 is politically correct when it comes to 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:18.130
 take a practical attitude to give a 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:19.660
 example that costs almost nothing there 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.820
 people retreat 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.110
 I think this is a lesson for everyone. 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.750
 we are not 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.009
 it's that thing of not leaving the power 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.289
 public 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:35.610
 let's take our responsibility and 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:35.610
 let us escape is there for reflection
