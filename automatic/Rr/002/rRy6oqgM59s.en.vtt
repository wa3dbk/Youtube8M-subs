bug<00:07:00.310> causing<00:07:01.310> skeletons<00:07:01.940> to<00:07:02.030> miss<00:07:02.330> their

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:02.509 
bug causing skeletons to miss their

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:05.350 
bug causing skeletons to miss their
targets<00:07:03.020> on<00:07:03.199> occasion<00:07:03.800> what<00:07:04.400> what's<00:07:05.150> up

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 
targets on occasion what what's up

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.390

skeletons<00:07:06.020> never<00:07:06.319> miss<00:07:06.590> their<00:07:06.770> targets<00:07:07.129> and<00:07:07.280> I

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400 
skeletons never miss their targets and I

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.219 
skeletons never miss their targets and I
guess<00:07:07.669> so<00:07:07.879> so<00:07:08.150> we're<00:07:08.330> pretty<00:07:08.539> much<00:07:08.659> roasted

man even if we hide behind a tree the

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.339 
man even if we hide behind a tree the
arrows<00:07:11.180> gonna<00:07:11.360> be<00:07:11.419> like<00:07:11.539> what<00:07:11.690> you<00:07:11.930> bring
