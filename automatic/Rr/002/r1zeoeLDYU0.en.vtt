00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 look at the weather forecast 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.190
 from weerplaza.nl 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.560
 as far as I am concerned today 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.059
 encountered sunshine few showers that 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.950
 one fell where not expected either 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.540
 so that all went well but the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.139
 temperature did what it needed 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.850
 from 20 degrees to the sea and 23 to 25 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.510
 it got stuck in the north of limburg 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.270
 local 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.590
 27 degrees and that high value that 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.359
 do not expect you immediately in this weather 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.949
 but that has everything to do with 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.859
 hot air which is currently our side 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.849
 is sent on coming warm air 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.349
 our way 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.120
 due to low pressure flowing it 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.910
 low-pressure area that tomorrow for bad 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.040
 weather but today is a warm one 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.629
 sector soft air came our way and 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.399
 hence those high temperatures 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.260
 but the air was also pretty damp 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.329
 and that means again 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.809
 cloud fields but from a few showers 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.370
 they saw the movement move 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.410
 we do that, we were off through the holes 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.329
 the sun bridge is therefore here and there through 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.370
 to break and hence those differences 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.010
 in temperatures most sin in it 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.840
 east and south today or england 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.309
 and france see a lot of clouds 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.920
 that low-pressure area is always coming 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.080
 go closer to have a look at the card 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.369
 with the wind arrows low-pressure area is located 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.140
 here at brittany 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.030
 so that will follow a course along 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.710
 the coast our way 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.409
 and if he does and then we will see 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.909
 how the wind will develop 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.830
 after white light behavior tomorrow in the loop 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.200
 from the night close to Zeeland 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.740
 according to this model and then we see that the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.659
 wind 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.460
 then increases considerably and even a red one 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.430
 arrows appear and that is wind force 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.170
 9 steam and during the day 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.600
 then pull that wins slowly along the coast 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.210
 to end up in the evenings and through 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.350
 pull the balls area away 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.140
 and then the low pressure area is above 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.570
 denmark it this is the calculation of 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.939
 the own weather plaza model but running 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.009
 u much more weather models mens come on 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.360
 what else off course it 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.549
 low pressure area is uncertain 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.780
 for that from the low pressure area and that 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.130
 everything then ensures that the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.649
 profit forecast also quite substantial 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.149
 uncertain is this moment we assume 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.040
 please link the seven eight 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.009
 hard to stormy at the sea with 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.990
 gusts of wind from 80 to 100 km per hour 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.880
 and there is a 50% chance of one 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.099
 northwestern storm and then the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.599
 winds still be heavier love 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.739
 the weather reports for that matter 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.290
 watch tomorrow 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.660
 tonight the wind is still calm though 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.830
 something 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.200
 in strength and still blowing out of it 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.520
 east more power 2 to 4 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.680
 are still in the soft ones 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.500
 air so temperatures half way through the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.300
 evening of around 21 degrees 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.280
 hermen there can fall a shower most 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.900
 places dry 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.520
 that does not apply to the night because late 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.440
 in the evening and at night the 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.330
 buiigheid far can also be a heavy shower 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.760
 we are struck by thunder 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.680
 the wind starts turning south and 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.950
 the temperature is not too low 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.660
 around and 17 degrees contractor in the after 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.940
 night and morning and regi area to it 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.220
 north after that the clear wind comes 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.200
 is still quiet and in the loop 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.640
 this morning the wind starts in zealand 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.560
 later in South Holland and North Holland 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.600
 and then it rises up 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.150
 wind force 9 being here 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.150
 So that is still a 50% chance of waiting 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.520
 actually gusts of wind 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.160
 inland throughout a country 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.530
 there they will be around between 50 and 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.290
 80 kilometers per hour 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.120
 and in the area closer to the sea 80 to 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.100
 100 km per hour 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.860
 and by the way i have a flevoland here and 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.530
 not signed, it is better to draw like this 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.090
 that does more justice to the situation 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.709
 temperatures 18 to 20 degrees that is 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.790
 only in the morning when the sun is still down 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.560
 how to break through 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.540
 in the afternoon if it again some time 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.530
 when it starts raining, the mercury drops to 15 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.440
 degrees 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.090
 no lovely summer day tomorrow then 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.590
 the sun a bit better out of the sun 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.810
 the wind is shining again 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.060
 calmer temperature is more than 20 to 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.750
 22 degrees can take a few showers 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.300
 fall 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.950
 especially the afternoon and evening Monday and 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.840
 Tuesdays are simply hit and miss with 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.580
 full chance of a thunderstorm on Monday 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.190
 temperatures barely 20 degrees 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.140
 then we look further ahead 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.480
 we still see that later in the week 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.550
 The trend back up is that we will again 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.500
 exceed 20 degrees 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.270
 also argues that from Wednesday the 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.160
 Flexibility therefore also decreases 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.800
 mostly dry weather in the course of 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.000
 great prospects next week 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.330
 but first a very tomorrow 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.250
 stormy wind and I'll say it again 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.420
 keep an eye on the weather forecast tomorrow 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.260
 especially if you go outside activities 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.260
 go and start severin of weather plaza
