00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
kind of a transformer nerd these ones

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.290 
kind of a transformer nerd these ones
are<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:46.320> i<00:02:47.100> can't<00:02:47.670> remem<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.030> name<00:02:48.180> of

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
up these I know some people were

interested<00:05:04.440> in<00:05:04.770> them<00:05:04.889> some<00:05:05.400> people<00:05:05.639> probably

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
interested in them some people probably

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.400

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
but I think that's the beauty of so many

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.730 
but I think that's the beauty of so many
releases<00:05:09.360> that<00:05:09.570> they've<00:05:09.750> had<00:05:09.780> recently<00:05:10.289> it

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
releases that they've had recently it

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.230 
releases that they've had recently it
has<00:05:10.800> been<00:05:11.099> overwhelming<00:05:11.639> but<00:05:11.759> they've<00:05:11.880> had<00:05:12.030> so

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
has been overwhelming but they've had so

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.600 
has been overwhelming but they've had so
many<00:05:12.330> dope<00:05:12.570> things<00:05:12.870> that<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:13.410> allows<00:05:14.280> me<00:05:14.310> to

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
many dope things that it allows me to

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.680 
many dope things that it allows me to
pick<00:05:14.759> up<00:05:14.849> some<00:05:15.090> things<00:05:15.300> here<00:05:15.479> and<00:05:15.539> there<00:05:15.599> that
