00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.589
 you legacy of 13 hours find themselves 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.150
 today for a video resale purchase 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.700
 so that's the first technique 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.460
 we found with a friend to 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.880
 of the purchase resale on fip to 15 after 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.830
 this update that severely breaks 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.830
 balls so here is the resale purchase 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.490
 is not mark holmes as it is 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.460
 thought all 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.470
 there is still a little hope it's more 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.140
 Monumental and colossal profits 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.859
 that profits can be 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.680
 up to a maximum of 5000 credit so here I have 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.160
 done with boateng the 85 and not the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.030
 people 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.010
 simply because his fork 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.500
 of price is quite interesting she is 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.879
 is between 1000 and 11000 see there 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.050
 I can buy toys I try 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.940
 to buy players not very expensive for 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.649
 try dresses signed 7 seems so 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.059
 always to technique of always have the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.500
 same technique uses the 59th minute 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.920
 sends I'm really expecting it's going two 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.090
 minutes and 59 59th second of course because 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.430
 otherwise they would be gone for 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.199
 long time 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.180
 so here it is necessary to wait there I try 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.589
 to find a good offer 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.909
 it is true that it is long it is true that 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:12.020
 it's tedious but not even two 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.479
 hours I realized 60 me of profit 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.729
 it is true that it is not huge but 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.600
 frankly it's already more than doing 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.400
 matches we see there it's as long as 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.570
 waste time or not take 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.820
 a lot of fun is better to do 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.710
 of buying resale at least go on 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.900
 earns a lot more credit already nothing 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.850
 only on that one I will not do 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.430
 evil I do about 2000 which 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.409
 is not bad it's 5 it's been 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.020
 four games pretty much so that's me 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.909
 saves almost an hour 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.560
 good unless I have bonuses but for that 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.950
 it's not very important there what is 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.740
 What is important is to make them the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.149
 normal matches so with a match with 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.570
 a normal match it looked like 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.490
 400-500 big maximum there I am making 2000 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.100
 good credit that's it's the math is 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.869
 quickly, we gain a lot more so 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.219
 this is the only technique that for 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.049
 the moment allows you to make 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.870
 earnings 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:12.820
 they also walk with falcao 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:17.170
 here sirigu it works also casias it 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.840
 also works arturo vidal ozil Ã§a 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.100
 walk too 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.120
 so here with these players there it's 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.260
 always players a bit of the same 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.790
 style to more than 82 82 general koscielny 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.040
 also I think it can work I 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.660
 not too much tried aulas and so 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.130
 I have an ad to make you good 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.230
 this is not at all related to 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.610
 the resale purchase but I have a friend who 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.770
 try to sell an evil that lives since 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.290
 six days so here it is really at 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.030
 price of the contract him at 1099 contract and the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.280
 99 of form it is in number 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.050
 so here it is really galley and 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.840
 would like someone in the chain to have 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.460
 seeing that no one can buy him holy 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.210
 because no one here can spot 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.470
 his club would be nice that you 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.110
 try to buy him I do not know 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.520
 how but hey we have to find a 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.720
 little arrangement on twitter I you 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.760
 would put his twitter in the description 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.410
 to try to arrange you if you 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.600
 you are interested in maldini near the 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.590
 market and that you can it's him 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.810

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.780
 please, so here I hope you 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.670
 will you feast on mach to resell 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.410
 So that's true it will not be 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.739
 huge it will be long but you can 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.050
 to do 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.260
 so here's so I leave you out 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.640
 this end of clip where I still see the 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.010
 players so do not worry and are going 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.170
 all leave they leave in the five 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.880
 ten minutes and if the prices go down they 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.400
 leave in the eure simply 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.330
 because the guys do not 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.030
 watch what they buy 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.320
 directly now it's true that 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.370
 it's weird because she before he 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.870
 was careful taking and that's 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.700
 to buy the cheapest all that is 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.980
 true that now all that is lost 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.050
 they really buy anything and 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.920
 there are more too many people doing 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.110
 resale purchases because all the 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.220
 world think it's dead so that's it 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.010
 I hope you like this technique 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.940
 that she will serve you enormously me 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.870
 would like the next for others 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.870
 videos holds everyone
