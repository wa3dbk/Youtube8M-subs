 so on this site you will be able to already 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.160
 at first see your stats 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.989
 see the stadiums of your crew and you 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.059
 will also be able to compare the stats 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.760
 with other players or with others 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.870
 Or simply 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.640
 then you will be able to create yourself 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.860
 a banner with the head of your 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.729
 player the level and your stats that you 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.010
 will have chosen 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.990
 you will also be able to import 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.229
 pictures of the synaptic to put them in 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.420
 bottom of your banner and you can 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.549
 also find that there is a 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.340
 ranking of players without cheats 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.780
 so for those who want to see the see 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.630
 where they are compared to others 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.729
 besides the cheaters and well you 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.810
 will have a ranking provided for this purpose 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.150
 So we go there so I use a 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.759
 account my first account on xbox 360 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.460
 and that is completely chic and so does not 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.110
 do not pay attention to statistics that 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.240
 have nothing to do with what they are 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.640
 actually knowing that they were 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.680
 reset for some certain 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.420
 stage not everything but tip stuff and 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.280
 reset I was banished to from 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.380
 multiple times I was using to for 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.600
 of finally banished it was the time of 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.509
 dns challenges crewe you can 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.490
 see with the money so I have you 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.409
 will have the stadiums general stages 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.780
 money from criminal activities 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.539
 the stages of time the distances etc 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.940
 hkd weapons activities and sport and what 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.130
 is related to the content publisher 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.960
 so as you can see a 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.720
 jet of revenue 184 billion dollars 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.780
 good brief it's walking stadiums 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.970
 but damn it does not matter, there are plenty of 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.590
 buggy stuff like you'll see it a he 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.420
 is full of all the all objects 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.490
 stolen they are at zero stuff like that 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.140
 while forget all the stuff 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.850
 exploded as if I were a good 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.520
 samaritan I had never done anything 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.500
 explode the game in everything is at zero but 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.270
 this is not the case and you if you have 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.190
 an account that is not green shit and 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.160
 as mine could have been 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.400
 you should have stats pretty much 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.020
 normal so here I hope that you 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.430
 please 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.740
 and then, well, if you have stats 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.100
 who are not quite normal dances and 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:02.520
 so what if we already have that it's not already 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.540
 wrong so so that's it for what is 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.280
 stadiums two good players 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.500
 personally me it's because he 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.970
 to interest you higher to discover the 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.150
 site and then to know that you are going 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.910
 to be able to discover your own stats and 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.830
 compare them with other players and 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.480
 So here we go for the khroub 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.970
 so that's a group I created 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.310
 at the base expressly for the crew challenges that 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.750
 was at a point 0.9 which had a 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.810
 bug so cleach that was found so 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.440
 which allowed for more shopping 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.140
 important 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.130
 and I had found how to 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.130
 multiply his earnings up to 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.350
 billion and also participate in my 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.840
 own challenges of the coup I had created this 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.180

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.250

 to participate in challenges completely 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.209
 cited at the time we could create 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.209
 30 seconds and 30 seconds 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.310

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.989
 participant wins and his billion you 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.480
 can repeat it as many times as 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.190
 wish so it was really something 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.640
 sick but hey that was the good 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.440
