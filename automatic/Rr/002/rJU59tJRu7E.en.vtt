have<00:01:16.780> a<00:01:16.810> lot<00:01:17.020> of<00:01:17.080> consciousness<00:01:17.770> here<00:01:17.950> that

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
have a lot of consciousness here that

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.270 
have a lot of consciousness here that
has<00:01:18.250> a<00:01:18.280> lot<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.580> learn<00:01:18.790> and<00:01:19.470> our<00:01:20.470> societies<00:01:21.130> our

has a lot to learn and our societies our
culture's<00:01:21.730> our<00:01:21.910> governments<00:01:22.540> all<00:01:23.550> reflect

culture's our governments all reflect
who<00:01:25.330> we<00:01:25.360> are<00:01:25.890> who<00:01:26.890> we<00:01:26.920> are<00:01:27.130> for<00:01:27.310> people<00:01:27.760> so<00:01:28.390> you

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
who we are who we are for people so you

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.940 
who we are who we are for people so you
see<00:01:28.720> all<00:01:28.840> that<00:01:28.960> violence<00:01:29.229> and<00:01:29.619> you<00:01:29.680> see<00:01:29.860> all

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
see all that violence and you see all

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.320 
see all that violence and you see all
that<00:01:29.979> crime<00:01:30.369> and<00:01:30.610> you<00:01:30.670> see<00:01:30.820> all<00:01:30.880> that<00:01:30.910> mean

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
that crime and you see all that mean

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.660 
that crime and you see all that mean
this<00:01:31.680> that's<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.860> way<00:01:32.950> we<00:01:33.100> are<00:01:33.130> that's<00:01:33.490> the

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
this that's the way we are that's the

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.640 
this that's the way we are that's the
level<00:01:33.850> of<00:01:34.090> which<00:01:34.240> consciousness<00:01:34.479> is<00:01:34.990> here<00:01:35.260> on

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
level of which consciousness is here on

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.280 
level of which consciousness is here on
this<00:01:36.040> plane<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.640> so<00:01:37.360> that's<00:01:37.510> what<00:01:37.720> we<00:01:37.810> get<00:01:38.020> and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
this plane and so that's what we get and

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.650 
this plane and so that's what we get and
when<00:01:39.130> you<00:01:39.250> get<00:01:39.430> a<00:01:39.460> mob<00:01:39.850> together<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.479> know<00:01:40.600> you

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
when you get a mob together you know you

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.630 
when you get a mob together you know you
get<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.110> mob<00:01:41.290> psychology<00:01:41.710> which<00:01:42.190> means<00:01:42.460> the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
get the mob psychology which means the

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.410 
get the mob psychology which means the
my<00:01:42.790> back's<00:01:43.140> kind<00:01:44.140> of<00:01:44.580> in<00:01:45.580> constants<00:01:46.090> with<00:01:46.300> the

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
my back's kind of in constants with the

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.930 
my back's kind of in constants with the
lowest<00:01:46.600> common<00:01:46.960> denominator<00:01:47.710> well<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:48.850> know

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
lowest common denominator well you know

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.580 
lowest common denominator well you know
that<00:01:49.090> mob<00:01:49.300> thing<00:01:49.570> works<00:01:49.780> two<00:01:49.990> ways<00:01:50.020> you<00:01:50.200> get<00:01:50.560> a

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
that mob thing works two ways you get a

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.840 
that mob thing works two ways you get a
bunch<00:01:50.830> of<00:01:50.920> people<00:01:51.220> who<00:01:51.310> are<00:01:51.400> learning<00:01:51.550> and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
bunch of people who are learning and

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.460 
bunch of people who are learning and
growing<00:01:52.030> together<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:52.750> they<00:01:52.960> actually<00:01:53.140> help

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
growing together and they actually help

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.930 
growing together and they actually help
each<00:01:53.619> other<00:01:53.770> no<00:01:54.220> it's<00:01:54.399> the<00:01:54.490> hundredth<00:01:54.729> monkey

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
each other no it's the hundredth monkey

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.419 
each other no it's the hundredth monkey
thing<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.660> vibes<00:01:55.869> be<00:01:56.170> each<00:01:56.350> other<00:01:56.590> so<00:01:57.280> if<00:01:57.340> you

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
thing the vibes be each other so if you

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:58.710 
thing the vibes be each other so if you
get<00:01:57.520> into<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.789> group<00:01:58.000> like<00:01:58.179> this<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:58.660> the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
get into a group like this and the

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.150 
get into a group like this and the
energy<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.080> good<00:01:59.320> you<00:01:59.590> just<00:01:59.770> feel<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.009> energy

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
energy is good you just feel the energy

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.770 
energy is good you just feel the energy
and<00:02:00.640> you<00:02:00.759> can<00:02:00.880> walk<00:02:01.030> out<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.270> here<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.600> feel

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
and you can walk out of here and feel

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.540 
and you can walk out of here and feel
like<00:02:01.990> you're<00:02:02.259> renewed<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:02.860> wow<00:02:03.009> I<00:02:03.039> can<00:02:03.369> hope

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
like you're renewed and wow I can hope

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.160 
like you're renewed and wow I can hope
I'm<00:02:03.759> gonna<00:02:03.910> do<00:02:04.060> something<00:02:04.509> well<00:02:05.020> that's

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
I'm gonna do something well that's

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.450 
I'm gonna do something well that's
because<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.500> energy<00:02:05.619> that<00:02:05.860> gets<00:02:06.039> going<00:02:06.310> in

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
because the energy that gets going in

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.940 
because the energy that gets going in
here<00:02:07.110> hopefully<00:02:08.110> a<00:02:08.140> week<00:02:08.320> later<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:08.649> still

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
here hopefully a week later you still

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.370 
here hopefully a week later you still
feel<00:02:09.160> that<00:02:09.190> way<00:02:09.369> but<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.570> opposite<00:02:10.929> works<00:02:11.200> as

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
feel that way but the opposite works as

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.940 
feel that way but the opposite works as
well<00:02:11.910> fear<00:02:12.910> gets<00:02:13.330> passed<00:02:13.600> around<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.470> know

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
well fear gets passed around and I know

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.310 
well fear gets passed around and I know
governments<00:02:15.880> like<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.390> create<00:02:16.660> fear<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.260> a

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
governments like to create fear in a

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.600 
governments like to create fear in a
population<00:02:17.920> because<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.310> makes<00:02:18.430> the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
population because it makes the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.210 
population because it makes the
population<00:02:19.180> easy<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.600> control<00:02:20.040> fear<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.190> a

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
population easy to control fear is a

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.850 
population easy to control fear is a
handle<00:02:21.760> by<00:02:21.910> which<00:02:22.150> anyone<00:02:23.050> can<00:02:23.319> be<00:02:23.470> controlled

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
handle by which anyone can be controlled

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.830 
handle by which anyone can be controlled
if<00:02:24.040> you're<00:02:24.190> fearful<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.790> something<00:02:24.840> you're

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
if you're fearful of something you're

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.080 
if you're fearful of something you're
easy<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.200> control<00:02:26.590> all<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.610> have<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.850> do<00:02:27.970> to

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
easy to control all you have to do to

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.800 
easy to control all you have to do to
manipulate<00:02:28.569> that<00:02:28.720> fear<00:02:29.069> so<00:02:30.480> part<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.569> it<00:02:31.690> is

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
manipulate that fear so part of it is

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.510 
manipulate that fear so part of it is
just<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.290> way<00:02:32.410> we<00:02:32.590> are<00:02:32.800> part<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.400> we're

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
just the way we are part of that we're

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.430 
just the way we are part of that we're
being<00:02:33.700> taken<00:02:34.000> advantage<00:02:34.120> of<00:02:34.630> because<00:02:35.020> fear<00:02:35.319> is

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
being taken advantage of because fear is

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.330 
being taken advantage of because fear is
a<00:02:35.470> as<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.890> controller<00:02:37.440> but<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:39.100> know<00:02:39.190> we

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
a as a controller but you know we

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.010 
a as a controller but you know we
couldn't<00:02:39.580> be<00:02:39.700> taken<00:02:40.030> advantage<00:02:40.120> of<00:02:40.540> if<00:02:40.810> we

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
couldn't be taken advantage of if we

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.780 
couldn't be taken advantage of if we
refer<00:02:41.319> this<00:02:41.500> we<00:02:42.100> couldn't<00:02:42.370> be<00:02:42.490> taken
