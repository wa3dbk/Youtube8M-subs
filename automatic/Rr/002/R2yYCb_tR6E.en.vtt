00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
right so if you remember from some

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.130 
right so if you remember from some
previous<00:05:05.230> hurrah<00:05:05.620> cheese<00:05:06.040> that<00:05:06.250> back<00:05:06.520> strap

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
previous hurrah cheese that back strap

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.780 
previous hurrah cheese that back strap
wasn't<00:05:08.140> molded<00:05:08.710> or<00:05:09.010> had<00:05:09.160> like<00:05:09.340> a<00:05:09.370> little<00:05:09.670> bit

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
wasn't molded or had like a little bit

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.300 
wasn't molded or had like a little bit
of<00:05:09.850> a<00:05:09.970> mesh<00:05:10.210> it's<00:05:10.660> the<00:05:10.810> same<00:05:11.080> on<00:05:11.320> those<00:05:11.530> very

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
of a mesh it's the same on those very

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.560 
of a mesh it's the same on those very
much<00:05:12.490> the<00:05:12.700> same<00:05:13.740> however<00:05:14.740> on<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.610> brown<00:05:15.970> is

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
much the same however on the brown is

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.110 
much the same however on the brown is
that<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:16.960> og<00:05:17.440> Karachi

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
that the og Karachi

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.400 
that the og Karachi
so<00:05:19.120> that<00:05:19.330> what<00:05:19.540> that<00:05:19.690> can<00:05:19.840> take<00:05:20.020> a<00:05:20.050> bit<00:05:20.230> of<00:05:20.260> a

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
so that what that can take a bit of a

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.960 
so that what that can take a bit of a
battering<00:05:20.590> and<00:05:21.160> it's<00:05:21.280> not<00:05:21.400> that<00:05:21.550> thin<00:05:21.790> I

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
battering and it's not that thin I

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.900 
battering and it's not that thin I
believe<00:05:22.360> anyway<00:05:23.490> there's<00:05:24.490> my<00:05:24.670> personal

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
believe anyway there's my personal

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.440 
believe anyway there's my personal
favorite<00:05:25.630> are<00:05:25.780> these<00:05:26.550> so<00:05:27.550> these<00:05:27.940> don't<00:05:28.210> have<00:05:28.420> a

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
favorite are these so these don't have a

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.620

fine that's what it's about in it

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.760 
fine that's what it's about in it
sharing<00:05:34.780> knowledge<00:05:35.520> so<00:05:36.520> it's<00:05:36.700> got<00:05:36.970> that<00:05:37.770> black
