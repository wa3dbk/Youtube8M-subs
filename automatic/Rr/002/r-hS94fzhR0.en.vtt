00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
ones and stuff so I guess I just brought

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:36.939 
ones and stuff so I guess I just brought
this<00:05:35.030> I<00:05:35.270> didn't<00:05:36.080> even<00:05:36.199> know<00:05:36.289> this<00:05:36.409> is<00:05:36.590> in<00:05:36.740> here

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 
this I didn't even know this is in here

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:38.800 
this I didn't even know this is in here
but<00:05:37.130> then<00:05:37.580> I<00:05:37.669> have<00:05:37.849> a<00:05:37.880> little<00:05:38.270> pencil<00:05:38.630> case

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
but then I have a little pencil case

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.529 
but then I have a little pencil case
thing<00:05:39.050> and<00:05:39.440> the<00:05:40.430> reason<00:05:40.699> why<00:05:40.789> I<00:05:40.820> have<00:05:41.090> a<00:05:41.120> pencil

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
thing and the reason why I have a pencil

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.300 
thing and the reason why I have a pencil
case<00:05:41.900> is<00:05:42.110> because<00:05:42.470> I<00:05:42.500> used<00:05:42.830> to<00:05:42.889> not<00:05:43.099> have<00:05:43.280> one

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
case is because I used to not have one

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.920 
case is because I used to not have one
and<00:05:43.729> then<00:05:43.909> I<00:05:43.940> would<00:05:44.090> always<00:05:44.210> lose<00:05:44.389> my<00:05:44.570> pens<00:05:44.780> and

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
and then I would always lose my pens and

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.029 
and then I would always lose my pens and
pencils<00:05:45.050> and<00:05:45.380> I<00:05:45.470> would<00:05:45.620> never<00:05:45.740> know<00:05:45.919> where

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
pencils and I would never know where

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:48.640 
pencils and I would never know where
they<00:05:46.130> were<00:05:46.220> so<00:05:47.090> this<00:05:47.330> is<00:05:47.479> very<00:05:47.720> convenient<00:05:48.139> so
