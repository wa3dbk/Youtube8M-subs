practice<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.029> family<00:00:18.980> and<00:00:20.180> I<00:00:21.180> always

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
practice in the family and I always

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.300 
practice in the family and I always
thought<00:00:21.750> records<00:00:22.350> are<00:00:22.470> there<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.769> be<00:00:22.890> broken<00:00:23.010> I

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
thought records are there to be broken I

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.160 
thought records are there to be broken I
mean<00:00:23.460> obviously<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.600> didn't<00:00:26.390> have<00:00:27.390> statistics

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
mean obviously I didn't have statistics

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.320 
mean obviously I didn't have statistics
in<00:00:28.289> my<00:00:28.439> mind<00:00:28.740> when<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:28.980> was<00:00:29.250> racing<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:30.150> was

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
in my mind when I was racing it was

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.939 
in my mind when I was racing it was
always<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.630> consequence<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.529> was<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> nice

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
always a consequence it was a nice

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.190 
always a consequence it was a nice
consequence<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.940> enjoyed<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.630> afterwards

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
consequence I enjoyed that afterwards

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.440 
consequence I enjoyed that afterwards
but<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:35.190> wasn't<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.820> reason<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.149> was<00:00:36.270> racing

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
but it wasn't the reason I was racing

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.869 
but it wasn't the reason I was racing
for<00:00:37.910> there's<00:00:38.910> no<00:00:39.059> reason<00:00:39.420> why<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:41.309> limits<00:00:41.700> I

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
for there's no reason why the limits I

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.330 
for there's no reason why the limits I
set<00:00:42.180> will<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.110> will<00:00:43.620> be<00:00:43.649> different<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:44.160> one

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
set will be will be different at one

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.560 
set will be will be different at one
point<00:00:44.550> because<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.180> whole<00:00:45.300> environment

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
point because the whole environment

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.380 
point because the whole environment
changes<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.320> mean<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.649> past<00:00:46.680> we<00:00:47.039> had<00:00:47.390> 16

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
changes I mean in the past we had 16

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.510 
changes I mean in the past we had 16
races<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:49.050> 20<00:00:49.350> races<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.399> more

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
races now we have 20 races so it's more

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.389 
races now we have 20 races so it's more
easy<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.820> win<00:00:51.059> more<00:00:51.210> races<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.840> season

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
easy to win more races in a season

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.209 
easy to win more races in a season
there's<00:00:53.660> various<00:00:54.890> statistics<00:00:55.890> they<00:00:56.039> run

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
there's various statistics they run

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.700 
there's various statistics they run
around<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:59.840> people<00:01:00.840> arrive<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> lot<00:01:01.500> younger

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
around and people arrive a lot younger

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.680 
around and people arrive a lot younger
in<00:01:02.100> these<00:01:02.340> days<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.730> Formula<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.539> they

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
in these days in Formula one so they

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.240 
in these days in Formula one so they
have<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> longer<00:01:04.260> time<00:01:04.500> they<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.979> probably

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
have a longer time they can probably

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.020 
have a longer time they can probably
spend<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.820> Formula<00:01:06.210> one<00:01:07.520> there's<00:01:08.520> all<00:01:08.729> all

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
spend in Formula one there's all all

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.060 
spend in Formula one there's all all
sorts<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.659> things<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.110> do<00:01:10.470> change<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:12.830> it<00:01:13.830> was

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
sorts of things that do change so it was

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.570 
sorts of things that do change so it was
different

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
different

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.609 
different
obviously<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.330> found<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.780> myself<00:01:15.960> because

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
obviously we found you in myself because

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.510 
obviously we found you in myself because
you<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.430> not<00:01:17.640> compare<00:01:17.850> his<00:01:18.210> five<00:01:18.479> title<00:01:19.189> to<00:01:20.189> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
you can not compare his five title to to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.289 
you can not compare his five title to to
the<00:01:20.729> seven<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:22.049> achieved<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
the seven that I have achieved and

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.249 
the seven that I have achieved and
therefore<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.979> always<00:01:25.979> rigged<00:01:26.340> always<00:01:27.180> made<00:01:28.140> it

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
therefore I always rigged always made it

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.670 
therefore I always rigged always made it
clear<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:30.840> those

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
clear that that I think those

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.039 
clear that that I think those
achievements<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.750> woman

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
achievements that woman

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.060 
achievements that woman
Fangio<00:01:34.820> was<00:01:35.820> able<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.210> achieve<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:37.229> his<00:01:37.470> time<00:01:37.740> I

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
Fangio was able to achieve in his time I

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.890 
Fangio was able to achieve in his time I
think<00:01:38.369> they<00:01:38.520> are<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:38.970> unique<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.600> special

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
think they are so unique so special

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.840 
think they are so unique so special
because<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.070> look<00:01:41.220> at<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> cars<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.790> I

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
because if you look at the cars and I

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.249 
because if you look at the cars and I
have<00:01:42.000> been<00:01:42.150> occasionally<00:01:42.689> sitting<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.110> those

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
have been occasionally sitting in those

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.710 
have been occasionally sitting in those
cars<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.860> mean<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.270> greatest<00:01:45.509> respect

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
cars I mean I have the greatest respect

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.440 
cars I mean I have the greatest respect
on<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.350> earth<00:01:46.500> for<00:01:46.950> what<00:01:47.520> those<00:01:47.670> guys<00:01:47.880> were

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
on the earth for what those guys were

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.480 
on the earth for what those guys were
doing<00:01:48.479> at<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.990> time<00:01:49.079> do<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.799> think<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.340> am

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
doing at the time do you think that am

Sebastian is is almost in your seat now

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.590 
Sebastian is is almost in your seat now
in<00:01:54.509> terms<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.290> how<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.799> German<00:01:56.340> public<00:01:56.759> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
in terms of how the German public and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.709 
in terms of how the German public and
media<00:01:57.810> treat<00:01:58.259> him<00:01:58.549> he<00:01:59.549> is<00:02:00.149> obviously<00:02:00.570> doing

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
media treat him he is obviously doing

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.219 
media treat him he is obviously doing

I<00:02:07.789> don't<00:02:08.789> think<00:02:08.850> there's<00:02:09.240> ever<00:02:09.479> going<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.810> be<00:02:09.869> a

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
I don't think there's ever going to be a

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.340 
I don't think there's ever going to be a
full<00:02:11.039> comparison<00:02:11.720> possible<00:02:12.720> but<00:02:13.200> it's

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
full comparison possible but it's

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.610 
full comparison possible but it's
probably<00:02:13.590> one<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.070> is<00:02:14.160> very<00:02:14.310> close
