00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.190
 the paper clip one day before sun and moon 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.490
 other man made up 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.630
 the big one the little pepper 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.559
 in another man's sun 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:10.899
 the owner-occupied home 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:13.899
 and another men 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.109
 I don't understand a thing about it 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:25.380
 we sell 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.380
 I already know that station reports the time 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.300
 what a drama 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.300
 it is large 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.340
 seems more like a giant night out 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.220
 it looks like you can actually use tsonga in a new way 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.450
 you can do well 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.480
 the touches can be a nice deal with your hands yes because come first 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.900
 just have to be on a computer 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.520
 is possible now 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.580
 the difference with the nature of the threat than of course that because it is so large 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.730
 so you can be with several people at the same time, it now goes with several 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.410
 people to small out of a screen and watch 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.260
 one main actually not it must be a turkish 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.840
 but the fact that it is also multimusic 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.840
 yes we can now right now 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.540
 with several people 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.540
 do several things but why is it still in its infancy 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.250
 yes that is actually a bit crazy for the technique is quite possible that the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.290
 The technology behind these principles has been removed 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.820
 and already 20 years old 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.130
 and 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.780
 but that is only the last few years since the film minority report that it 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.009
 has really gone wrong 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.850
 for this reason people started picking them up like apples 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.850
 and now it is suddenly everywhere in heart and soul and want it 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.920
 and not with those cries 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.460
 the latter of smit years think it is easier to tell if 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.840
 fifth parent the first our first prototype show that I also what 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.720
 easier to pick up 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.980
 perhaps freezer 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.980
 an antique kitchen block was once sad 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.500
 after just giving up gave the performance and then we actually had yes we are 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.980
 all first prototypes don't really say anything 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.539
 and you are in red, you can't see how it just comes out 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:12.529
 and that goes 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:16.819
 in a plexiglass platini was assumed and that lies with it 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.879
 bouncing around a bit if nobody touches it 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.469
 toyota year after year it reflects off your finger and nest and it sits 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:25.399
 a camera 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:27.759
 that was just the past 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:30.159
 is now you are not busy 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.129
 and we have pictures to watch here 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.330
 yes no points indicates a bit missed was on these pictures today 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.389
 can view 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.799
 if I just pasted a chip on my phone that's for now 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.480
 my identification 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.920
 soon I have the intention that everyone has such a trip in his phone and 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.920
 if I didn't have my phone on the table 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:55.969
 these are my photos this is my agenda 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:59.379
 and in that way you can also go to every table you come to 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.829
 open in your own agenda and compare it with the one next to you 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.829
 also insists that is the idea yes indeed that is the beginning of 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.289
 of that kind 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:10.219
 it off 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:14.310
 you now have on and completely empty and that this delay and you come to a company 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:17.669
 unable to put whatever you do on a sergei phone 

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:21.909
 then you already see contacts or one for the contacts that are not running for you 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.059
 filled in as long as I do 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:25.909
 lay the phone on 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.589
 you will see the networks connect to it 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:29.749
 the city 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:32.499
 vincent in this case 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:35.499
 through vincent I am now connected with your eyes 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.379
 it is completely worked out that you never know 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.950
 that is the image you know of offices that you are all soft 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.879
 stare at a small screen 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.879
 I hope so is the market 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.509
 the
