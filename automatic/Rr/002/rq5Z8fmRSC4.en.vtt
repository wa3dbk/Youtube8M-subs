00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.269
 story adaptation of this film already 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.910
 there was a lot there even one popular 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.650
 Soviet and now once again and 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.539
 filmed only in 3d

 new this is a fantasy thriller with 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.489
 horror elements based on the story 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.989
 Gogol grounded by the ears 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.360
 director of the film Oleg Stepchenko 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.190
 by the way the film was filmed since 2005 and 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.800
 him his last role played Valery 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.480
 Zolotukhin early 18th century cartographer 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.430
 Jonathan Green Jason is playing 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.660
 Fleming you can do on movie 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.640
 cards two trunks money 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.710
 will make an expedition to Ukraine where 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.480
 falls into a small village in it 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.309
 strange people live 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.140
 church large fence and crosses 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.030
 residents claim this place 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.370
 damned guard to guard against 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.500
 evil some local tell 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.049
 fleming horrible story about home brute 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.909
 moths iwi who settled there and 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.649
 Fleming of course tries to raze all 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.960
 I'll start with the pluses of the film I liked 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.060
 high-quality costume and makeup 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.710
 high enough acting 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.000
 games all this gave fabulousness 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.380
 film and immersed me in 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.119
 appropriate atmosphere 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.709
 as for special effects they are not 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.780
 only liked chasing wolves for 

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:29.359
 fleming and you can still find fault with 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.280
 similarity sticks with the heroine calls in 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.079
 the rest of the order is also full to me 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.000
 I liked the script for you 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.189
 interesting idea of ​​the authors about 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.219
 churches are essentially a church put up like 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.840
 form of power it was very relevant 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:44.149
 thin interesting i liked how 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.369
 The authors presented this idea to two large 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.590
 minus the picture so it is overly tightened 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.060
 and unnecessary scenes for which the plot 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.399
 sagged by the middle of the movie 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.379
 and the end is so general elm and the second is 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.629
 mounting in places so ragged that with 

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:58.610
 hard to capture the essence of what is happening in 

00:01:56.629 --> 00:02:00.590
 the result is a film stuck in empty scenes 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.849
 plenty of information and got pretty 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.709
 crumpled finish 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:06.020
 such that after watching you try 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.030
 Himself live all on the shelves and understand 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.069
 that many things do not converge from small 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.810
 cons this constant boo they and all 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.030
 there were real heroes of the film 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.760
 many scenes cut in general would say 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.700
 that the film is atmospheric overly lengthy 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.590
 heaped son of the genre is not shit for sure 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.540
 if we consider that this is our movie so generally 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.760
 ok but we still didn't like 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.410
 advise will not go down into the well, I think not 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.989
 upset and strong now in movies and 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.540
 blown more shitty movies if you compare 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.030
 I am a Frankenstein and much better than him 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.269
 meaning there are nice people watching 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.280
 until tyrants are king amphitrion which 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.319
 performed by martial arts master scott edkins 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.569
 I thirst for more power to seize 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.669
 another city then his wife the queen 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.669
 Alcmene Roxanne Macchi becomes discouraged
