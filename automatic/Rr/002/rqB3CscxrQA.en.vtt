00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.400
 good yes yes yes illusion I think that we 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.400
 do all 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:21.040
 the first home game in particular is 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.020
 very nice to come back after that time 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:28.540
 I did not know if I was going to be here or not and 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.980
 happy with the desire to start and that we 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.810
 go very well in the first game and 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.680
 throughout the season at home we 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.600
 it was difficult I think to go in with the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.690
 4-1 is always complicated with a team 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.270
 that usually has the position and there was 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.120
 much chance to touch the ball or 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.520
 of having options to create danger myself 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.250
 I think it was difficult you can not get out 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.910
 a conclusion 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.910
 important in this game 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.050
 and good now that we will have to do better 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.810
 the things I do not personal I find 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:06.020
 very well 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:09.390
 every time I am much better and willing and 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.690
 available to the coach to 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.970
 anything if I forgot because the 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.060
 long league we can not stay thinking 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.430
 in a game obviously 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.180
 to me as no one of the team we like 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.690
 lose and it always tastes bad 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.460
 and he made us home with 5 goals but there 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.610
 that pass page you have to work for 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.760
 that does not happen again and on Saturday 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.070
 start with a good foot at home and hopefully and 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.200
 we can get the three points and already 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.300
 I'm fine, I 'll have everything 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.660
 normal and I feel very well and now it's going to 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.260
 be the coach's decision if I do everything to 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:54.290
 play 90 or less and not play I think that 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:56.250
 I am already at the orders of him and what he 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.210
 consider what is best for the team 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.660
 that we're going to do if the idea is that 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.630
 continue like this or always improve every year 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.810
 you start with the illusion of doing better 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.810
 the things that the year that happened today that the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.940
 intention to work hard to 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.630
 overcome in all aspects what is 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.940
 did last season and 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.690
 and doing things well help the team 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.900
 as much as possible and have the people 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.030
 happy hopefully and follow 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.750
 happy with my job to follow 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.400
 enjoying and I'm going to work for that 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.760
 I think so much so I do not think that in 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.019
 Overall the team has created expectations 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.980
 good and we like that because people 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:50.200
 values ​​our work sees us from a 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.879
 positive way and that always motivates 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.370
 to the whole group to try to do it 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.340
 very good shape and that follow the people 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.910
 enjoying supporting and together we can 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.390
 do something important no no I did not notice 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.980
 in that but hopefully and it will touch the people 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.810
 enjoy many goals this season 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:18.400
 and that follow that affection that we have mutual 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:21.220
 the hobby and I, because that will have to 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.610
 say the coach obviously the 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.540
 people 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:30.700
 always everyone has their tastes will want 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.320
 let him play whoever he thinks is best 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.010
 but I think that every one has to do his 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.630
 work in that aspect is mountain the one 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.270
 decides who are the ones who play and there are 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.069
 to respect and who has to be 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.079
 inside 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.480
 and take advantage of the opportunities that will 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:51.590
 be difficult with so many good players 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:54.170
 there is in the template and there is no other 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.310
 to work hard and take the team 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.290
 ahead 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.810
 yes many I think that 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.540
 last year already the way with the 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.909
 additions that were made this year are 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.879
 two but of great quality and that makes 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:13.060
 the team has more competition but that 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.799
 it's good because we know that the one 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.370
 play is going to do well and not 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:21.639
 we depend on few players no no no 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.120
 I feel happiness for my companions 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.699
 for my country because I think that people 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.349
 Mexico enjoys when we enjoy the 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:34.660
 achievements of the selection and there is no more 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:37.919
 to congratulate the people who were there 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.509
 who made a great paper that brought out the gold and 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.240
 I as an amateur enjoyed it as much as 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:46.860
 any Mexican who was watching the 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.840
 Olympic games we have also started 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.889
 and analyze the start, I think 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.659
 tomorrow but I think it 's a team that 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.220
 It's going to be complicated because always 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:59.550
 what 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:03.000
 they climb the first vision they come with a lot 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.430
 very hungry with desire to show that 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.620
 can be in this in this league and I think 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.440
 it will be a tough game must 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.050
 work very hard as we do with 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.260
 any team and always respecting the 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.260
 rival 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.129
 and do what we know and believe 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.229
 what can we do 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.229
 and do things do good things
