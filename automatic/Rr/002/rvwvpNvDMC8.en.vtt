hi<00:00:01.380> everyone<00:00:01.890> today's<00:00:02.669> project<00:00:03.120> is<00:00:03.659> a

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
hi everyone today's project is a

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.460 
hi everyone today's project is a
basement<00:00:04.700> the<00:00:05.700> customer<00:00:06.660> has<00:00:06.870> got<00:00:07.140> at<00:00:07.290> his

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
basement the customer has got at his

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.459 
basement the customer has got at his
basement<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.450> we're<00:00:09.450> gonna<00:00:09.599> add<00:00:09.900> some<00:00:09.929> spray

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
basement and we're gonna add some spray

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.370 
basement and we're gonna add some spray
foam<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.980> it<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:12.000> one<00:00:12.300> problem<00:00:13.110> with<00:00:13.259> the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
foam to it so one problem with the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.799 
foam to it so one problem with the
concrete<00:00:13.830> basement<00:00:14.190> as<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.910> wall<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.389> always

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
concrete basement as the wall is always

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.740 
concrete basement as the wall is always
cold<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.760> you're<00:00:17.760> gonna<00:00:17.940> have<00:00:18.180> condensation

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
cold and you're gonna have condensation

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.460 
cold and you're gonna have condensation
in<00:00:19.380> your<00:00:20.100> wall<00:00:20.340> if<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:21.180> use<00:00:21.390> fiberglass<00:00:21.930> plain

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
in your wall if you use fiberglass plain

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.029 
in your wall if you use fiberglass plain
example<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:24.230> here's<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.410> fiberglass<00:00:26.010> that

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
example and here's the fiberglass that

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.029 
example and here's the fiberglass that
was<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.519> before<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.119> can<00:00:27.269> already<00:00:27.510> see<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
was in before you can already see the

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.070 
was in before you can already see the
water<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.220> condensation<00:00:29.910> damage<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.900> in

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
water a condensation damage to it in

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.620 
water a condensation damage to it in
that<00:00:31.560> corner<00:00:32.040> especially<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.270> always

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
that corner especially and it's always

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.750 
that corner especially and it's always
the<00:00:33.750> corners<00:00:34.170> are<00:00:34.320> always<00:00:34.829> worse<00:00:35.130> than

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
the corners are always worse than

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.850 
the corners are always worse than
anywhere<00:00:36.149> else<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.630> bottom<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.649> can<00:00:37.829> see

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
anywhere else on the bottom you can see

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.790 
anywhere else on the bottom you can see
you<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.280> water<00:00:38.520> marks<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.680> we're<00:00:40.680> gonna

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
you have water marks and we're gonna

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.479 
you have water marks and we're gonna
separate<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.879> cold<00:00:42.390> concrete<00:00:43.010> by<00:00:44.010> adding

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
separate this cold concrete by adding

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.510 
separate this cold concrete by adding
two<00:00:44.700> inches<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.300> foam<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:47.129> reason<00:00:47.399> we're

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
two inches of foam and the reason we're

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.700 
two inches of foam and the reason we're
only<00:00:47.700> doing<00:00:47.940> two<00:00:48.239> inches<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.660> foam<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.050> because

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
only doing two inches of foam is because

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.590 
only doing two inches of foam is because
there's<00:00:49.980> lots<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.550> room<00:00:50.789> here<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.390> can<00:00:51.420> see

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
there's lots of room here as you can see

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.410 
there's lots of room here as you can see
there's<00:00:52.590> lots<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:53.070> room<00:00:53.340> between<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.030> edge<00:00:54.149> of

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
there's lots of room between the edge of

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.770 
there's lots of room between the edge of
the<00:00:54.539> stud<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:56.670> concrete<00:00:57.120> wall<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.690> we

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the stud and the concrete wall so we

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.330 
the stud and the concrete wall so we
just<00:00:57.930> had<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.109> add<00:00:58.230> two<00:00:58.440> inches<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.890> foam<00:00:59.070> and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
just had to add two inches of foam and

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.220 
just had to add two inches of foam and
then<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> homeowner<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.420> gonna<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.020> rest

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
then the homeowner is gonna do the rest

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.910 
then the homeowner is gonna do the rest
with<00:01:01.350> fiberglass<00:01:02.750> that's<00:01:03.750> when<00:01:04.290> fiberglass

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
with fiberglass that's when fiberglass

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.640 
with fiberglass that's when fiberglass
is<00:01:05.250> useful<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.360> completely<00:01:06.960> separated

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
is useful as it's completely separated

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.100 
is useful as it's completely separated
then<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.310> live<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.030> its<00:01:09.299> potential<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
then it can live up to its potential and

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.940 
then it can live up to its potential and
so<00:01:11.150> he's<00:01:12.150> gonna<00:01:12.330> save<00:01:12.600> money<00:01:12.869> by<00:01:13.170> by<00:01:13.799> only

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
so he's gonna save money by by only

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.800 
so he's gonna save money by by only
doing<00:01:14.070> two<00:01:14.400> inches<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.850> foam<00:01:15.030> he's<00:01:15.600> gonna

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
doing two inches of foam he's gonna

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.539 
doing two inches of foam he's gonna
completely<00:01:16.259> separate<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.009> cold<00:01:17.250> concrete

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
completely separate the cold concrete

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.450 
completely separate the cold concrete
from<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.060> warm<00:01:18.360> living<00:01:18.600> area<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.259> then<00:01:19.920> add

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
from the warm living area and then add

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.980 
from the warm living area and then add
his<00:01:21.030> remaining<00:01:21.930> hour<00:01:22.290> value<00:01:22.890> with<00:01:23.990> with

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
his remaining hour value with with

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.660 
his remaining hour value with with
fiberglass<00:01:25.439> he<00:01:25.950> doesn't<00:01:26.250> need<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.400> vapor

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
fiberglass he doesn't need a vapor

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.910 
fiberglass he doesn't need a vapor
barrier<00:01:26.990> because<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.380> said<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> two

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
barrier because like I said the two

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.929 
barrier because like I said the two
temperatures<00:01:29.549> can't<00:01:30.619> can't<00:01:31.619> meet<00:01:32.280> then

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
temperatures can't can't meet then

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.600 
temperatures can't can't meet then
creating<00:01:33.720> vapors<00:01:33.900> or<00:01:34.380> condensation<00:01:34.979> so

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
creating vapors or condensation so

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.490 
creating vapors or condensation so
there's<00:01:35.820> no<00:01:36.000> need<00:01:36.210> for<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.540> vapor<00:01:36.720> barrier<00:01:36.869> so

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
there's no need for a vapor barrier so

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.440 
there's no need for a vapor barrier so
we're<00:01:37.619> gonna<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.890> two<00:01:38.100> inches<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.610> foam<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
we're gonna have two inches of foam to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.289 
we're gonna have two inches of foam to
the<00:01:39.479> whole<00:01:39.750> basement<00:01:40.710> all<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.820> way<00:01:41.939> around

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
the whole basement all the way around

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.450 
the whole basement all the way around
there's<00:01:43.290> air<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.799> ripping<00:01:44.520> out<00:01:45.320> the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
there's air and ripping out the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.429 
there's air and ripping out the
fiberglass<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.880> top<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.720> see<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.259> off

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
fiberglass on top so we can see that off

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.170 
fiberglass on top so we can see that off
it's<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> fairly<00:01:51.079> big<00:01:52.079> basement<00:01:53.030> 1,300<00:01:54.030> square

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
it's a fairly big basement 1,300 square

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.709 
it's a fairly big basement 1,300 square
feet<00:01:54.540> at<00:01:54.750> least<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.840> Spree<00:01:58.700> area<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.540> yeah

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
feet at least of the Spree area and yeah

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.020 
feet at least of the Spree area and yeah
we'll<00:02:01.079> take<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.530> look<00:02:01.770> at<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.219> after<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:02.759> done

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
we'll take a look at it after it's done

00:02:03.030 --> 00:03:34.740 
we'll take a look at it after it's done
and<00:02:04.159> we<00:02:05.159> will<00:02:06.149> see<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.659> difference

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.960 

hey<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:36.020> we're<00:03:36.170> back<00:03:36.380> so<00:03:36.920> our<00:03:36.950> project<00:03:37.520> is

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
hey and we're back so our project is

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.790 
hey and we're back so our project is
done<00:03:38.180> we<00:03:39.080> have<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.319> good<00:03:41.020> two<00:03:42.020> and<00:03:42.050> A<00:03:42.530> two<00:03:42.770> two

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
done we have a good two and A two two

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.949 
done we have a good two and A two two
and<00:03:43.160> a<00:03:43.220> half<00:03:43.400> inches<00:03:43.850> over<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.569> whole

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
and a half inches over the whole

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.340 
and a half inches over the whole
basement<00:03:45.500> here<00:03:46.600> completely<00:03:47.600> sealing<00:03:47.930> off

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
basement here completely sealing off

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.150 
basement here completely sealing off
that<00:03:48.650> concrete<00:03:49.190> and<00:03:49.720> like<00:03:50.720> I<00:03:50.750> said<00:03:50.870> before

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
that concrete and like I said before

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.150 
that concrete and like I said before
concrete<00:03:52.160> is<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.490> very<00:03:53.030> bad<00:03:53.540> conductor<00:03:54.380> in<00:03:54.560> the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
concrete is a very bad conductor in the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.090 
concrete is a very bad conductor in the
summertime<00:03:55.760> it'll<00:03:56.150> conduct<00:03:56.630> cool<00:03:57.530> because

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
summertime it'll conduct cool because

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.280 
summertime it'll conduct cool because
it's<00:03:58.459> Underground<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.360> in<00:03:59.870> the<00:03:59.989> wintertime

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
it's Underground and in the wintertime

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.290 
it's Underground and in the wintertime
it'll<00:04:00.860> kind<00:04:01.070> of<00:04:01.160> your<00:04:01.400> basement<00:04:01.820> will<00:04:01.940> be<00:04:02.030> even

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
it'll kind of your basement will be even

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.059 
it'll kind of your basement will be even
colder<00:04:02.330> because<00:04:03.290> not<00:04:03.650> only<00:04:03.680> is<00:04:04.040> it

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
colder because not only is it

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.790 
colder because not only is it
underground<00:04:04.600> but<00:04:05.600> it's<00:04:05.870> also<00:04:06.459> frozen<00:04:07.459> so<00:04:08.030> and

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
underground but it's also frozen so and

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.890 
underground but it's also frozen so and
it's<00:04:09.800> really<00:04:10.010> cold<00:04:10.250> outside<00:04:10.810> basements<00:04:11.810> are

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
it's really cold outside basements are

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.870 
it's really cold outside basements are
really<00:04:12.260> cold<00:04:12.500> because<00:04:12.739> of<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.190> conch<00:04:13.489> the

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
really cold because of the conch the

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.220 
really cold because of the conch the
concrete<00:04:14.630> conducting<00:04:15.320> cold<00:04:15.650> air<00:04:16.010> or<00:04:16.280> cold

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
concrete conducting cold air or cold

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.500 
concrete conducting cold air or cold
into<00:04:18.230> the<00:04:18.260> basement<00:04:18.859> plus<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.459> joist<00:04:19.730> rim

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
into the basement plus the joist rim

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.690 
into the basement plus the joist rim
joist<00:04:20.810> isn't<00:04:21.320> insulated<00:04:21.980> most<00:04:22.190> of<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.460> time

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
joist isn't insulated most of the time

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.200 
joist isn't insulated most of the time
so<00:04:23.540> let<00:04:24.440> me<00:04:24.560> just<00:04:24.740> get<00:04:24.860> in<00:04:25.040> there<00:04:25.220> show<00:04:25.970> you<00:04:26.030> how

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
so let me just get in there show you how

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.240 
so let me just get in there show you how
we<00:04:26.270> completely<00:04:26.900> sealed<00:04:27.350> off<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.830> rim<00:04:28.010> joist

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
we completely sealed off the rim joist

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.040 
we completely sealed off the rim joist
it's<00:04:28.550> a<00:04:28.610> little<00:04:28.820> bit<00:04:28.970> dark<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.419> can't<00:04:29.660> see<00:04:29.870> it

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
it's a little bit dark you can't see it

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.200 
it's a little bit dark you can't see it
so<00:04:31.900> yeah<00:04:32.900> so<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:34.220> only<00:04:34.460> way<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:34.640> do<00:04:34.850> it<00:04:34.880> is<00:04:35.090> to

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
so yeah so the only way to do it is to

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.300 
so yeah so the only way to do it is to
completely<00:04:35.600> seal<00:04:35.960> off<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.410> concrete<00:04:36.650> and

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
completely seal off the concrete and

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.480 
completely seal off the concrete and
prevent<00:04:38.090> it<00:04:38.300> from<00:04:38.330> conducting<00:04:39.229> cold<00:04:39.890> into

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
prevent it from conducting cold into

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.690 
prevent it from conducting cold into
your<00:04:40.669> basement<00:04:41.120> area<00:04:41.710> then<00:04:42.910> your<00:04:44.890> furnace<00:04:45.890> can

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
your basement area then your furnace can

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.420 
your basement area then your furnace can
produce<00:04:47.240> heat<00:04:47.780> which<00:04:48.110> will<00:04:48.410> easily<00:04:49.040> heat<00:04:49.250> this

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
produce heat which will easily heat this

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.940 
produce heat which will easily heat this
area<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.000> because<00:04:50.330> heat<00:04:50.540> rises<00:04:50.690> you'll<00:04:51.650> save

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
area and because heat rises you'll save

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.860 
area and because heat rises you'll save
a<00:04:52.130> lot<00:04:52.160> on<00:04:52.460> your<00:04:52.610> energy<00:04:52.970> bills<00:04:53.950> because<00:04:55.870> it

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
a lot on your energy bills because it

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.460 
a lot on your energy bills because it

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
has no problem heating the basement so I

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.490 
has no problem heating the basement so I
expect<00:05:01.280> this<00:05:01.460> customer<00:05:02.090> to<00:05:02.330> have<00:05:02.600> significant

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
because of the insulated and sealed off

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.700 
because of the insulated and sealed off
concrete<00:05:10.550> in<00:05:10.729> the<00:05:11.240> basement<00:05:11.720> so<00:05:12.470> yeah<00:05:12.620> it
