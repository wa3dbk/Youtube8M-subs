00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
come down here you can see brown tomato

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.299 
come down here you can see brown tomato
bottom<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.750> blossom<00:00:43.230> end<00:00:43.379> rot<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:44.129> is

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
bottom that is blossom end rot this is

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.639 
bottom that is blossom end rot this is
the<00:00:44.430> blossom<00:00:44.820> end<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.750> plant<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.230> Browns

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
the blossom end of the plant it Browns

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.340 
the blossom end of the plant it Browns
it<00:00:47.070> dies<00:00:47.489> back<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.629> usually<00:00:48.960> comes<00:00:49.260> from

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
it dies back and that usually comes from

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.830 
it dies back and that usually comes from
a<00:00:49.530> calcium<00:00:49.980> deficiency<00:00:50.270> or<00:00:51.270> watering

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
a calcium deficiency or watering

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.650 
a calcium deficiency or watering
deficiency<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.160> see<00:00:53.510> lots<00:00:54.510> of

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
deficiency and you can see lots of

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.920 
deficiency and you can see lots of
tomatoes<00:00:56.420> have<00:00:58.190> these<00:00:59.190> brown<00:00:59.550> bottoms<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.300> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
tomatoes have these brown bottoms in a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.240 
tomatoes have these brown bottoms in a
way<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.320> treat<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.800> can<00:01:02.010> look<00:01:02.129> at

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
way that you treat that you can look at

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.070 
way that you treat that you can look at
my<00:01:02.340> other<00:01:02.460> video<00:01:02.820> about<00:01:03.120> using<00:01:03.359> limestone<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
my other video about using limestone and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.230 
my other video about using limestone and
calcium<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.100> put<00:01:05.280> calcium<00:01:05.700> into<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> soil

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
calcium is to put calcium into the soil

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.750 
calcium is to put calcium into the soil
that<00:01:06.450> helps<00:01:06.869> get<00:01:07.530> what<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.830> needed<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
that helps get what is needed to the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.730 
that helps get what is needed to the
tomato<00:01:09.090> plant<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.630> because<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:10.590> is

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
tomato plant and because this one is

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.590 
tomato plant and because this one is
actually<00:01:10.890> growing<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.670> well<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.150> think<00:01:12.270> you

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
actually growing so well I think you

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.719 
actually growing so well I think you
just<00:01:12.630> outpaced<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> nutrients<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.310> soil

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
just outpaced the nutrients in the soil

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.090 
just outpaced the nutrients in the soil
I<00:01:15.150> forgot<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.600> put<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> calcium<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.680> I

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
I forgot to put the calcium in and I

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.920 
I forgot to put the calcium in and I
have<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> lot<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.490> tomatoes<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.450> brown

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
have a lot of tomatoes that have brown

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.450 
have a lot of tomatoes that have brown
bottoms<00:01:19.320> these<00:01:19.500> tomatoes<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.189> thrown

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
bottoms these tomatoes have to be thrown

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.990 
bottoms these tomatoes have to be thrown
out<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:21.270> with<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> addition<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.110> calcium

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
out but with the addition of the calcium

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.850 
out but with the addition of the calcium
through<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.180> limestone<00:01:24.409> being<00:01:25.409> poured<00:01:25.680> into

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
through the limestone being poured into

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.190 
through the limestone being poured into
this<00:01:26.070> container<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.729> future<00:01:27.360> tomatoes<00:01:27.840> will

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
this container the future tomatoes will

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.090 
this container the future tomatoes will
turn<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.650> okay<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.780> this<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.170> let<00:01:31.829> me<00:01:31.920> just

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
turn out okay and this is a let me just

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.609 
turn out okay and this is a let me just
think<00:01:32.220> what<00:01:32.430> variety<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.320> this<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.470> my

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
think what variety it is this is my

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.350 
think what variety it is this is my
black<00:01:34.890> plum<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.180> just

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
black plum so this is going to be just

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.390 
black plum so this is going to be just
lots<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.840> plum<00:01:37.229> sized<00:01:37.500> tomatoes<00:01:37.950> coming<00:01:38.280> and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
lots of plum sized tomatoes coming and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.160 
lots of plum sized tomatoes coming and
it<00:01:38.490> will<00:01:38.610> grow<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> whole<00:01:39.630> season

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
it will grow for the whole season

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.600 
it will grow for the whole season
the<00:01:40.439> other<00:01:40.560> thing<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.009> want<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.430> show

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
the other thing that I just want to show

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.050 
the other thing that I just want to show
you<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:42.170> your<00:01:43.170> tomato<00:01:43.560> plant<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.250> vine<00:01:44.759> and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
you is your tomato plant is a vine and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.410 
you is your tomato plant is a vine and
all<00:01:45.240> these<00:01:46.189> stems<00:01:47.189> here<00:01:47.610> are<00:01:47.790> these<00:01:48.119> bumps

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
all these stems here are these bumps

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.990 
all these stems here are these bumps
coming<00:01:48.750> out<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.200> stem<00:01:49.439> are<00:01:49.700> would<00:01:50.700> become

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
coming out of the stem are would become

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.639 
coming out of the stem are would become
roots<00:01:51.299> if<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.659> fell<00:01:51.869> over<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.229> landed<00:01:52.560> on
