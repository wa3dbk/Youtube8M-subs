00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
but I thought I was a cute clock I've

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.390 
but I thought I was a cute clock I've
never<00:03:52.420> seen<00:03:52.720> Seth<00:03:53.020> Thomas<00:03:53.349> make<00:03:53.830> like<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.069> newer

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
never seen Seth Thomas make like a newer

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.120 
never seen Seth Thomas make like a newer
style<00:03:55.030> clock<00:03:55.360> with<00:03:55.690> movement<00:03:56.200> before<00:03:56.560> so<00:03:57.010> I

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
style clock with movement before so I

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.850 
style clock with movement before so I
just<00:04:00.130> thought<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.340> was<00:04:00.520> cool<00:04:01.620> that's<00:04:02.620> all<00:04:02.800> I

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
just thought it was cool that's all I

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.150 
just thought it was cool that's all I
got<00:04:03.040> YouTube<00:04:03.400> I<00:04:03.520> hope<00:04:03.670> you<00:04:03.819> enjoyed
