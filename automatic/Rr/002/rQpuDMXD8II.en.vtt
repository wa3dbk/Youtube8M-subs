00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
one you get really hilly one side I kind

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.580 
one you get really hilly one side I kind
of<00:00:53.820> I'd<00:00:54.059> rather<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:54.539> one<00:00:54.960> two<00:00:55.199> out<00:00:55.350> for

selection of do gap size of these when
it's<00:01:01.980> really<00:01:02.280> dry<00:01:02.489> we'd<00:01:02.750> file<00:01:03.750> tread<00:01:04.049> or<00:01:04.920> when

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
it's really dry we'd file tread or when

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.700 
it's really dry we'd file tread or when

and<00:01:14.320> that's<00:01:14.500> pretty<00:01:14.710> much<00:01:14.829> for<00:01:15.100> use<00:01:15.630> most<00:01:16.630> of

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
and that's pretty much for use most of

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
the time most of the season because it's

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.130 
the time most of the season because it's
just<00:01:18.310> such<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.520> versatile<00:01:18.969> time<00:01:19.240> I<00:01:19.509> prefer<00:01:19.780> rim

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
just such a versatile time I prefer rim

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.419 
just such a versatile time I prefer rim
bags<00:01:20.380> just<00:01:20.679> because<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:21.009> get<00:01:21.070> a<00:01:21.159> bit<00:01:21.280> more

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:21.429 
bags just because you get a bit more

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:22.889 
bags just because you get a bit more
consistency<00:01:21.969> with<00:01:22.210> it<00:01:22.329> and<00:01:22.450> it's<00:01:22.600> more<00:01:22.750> what

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
consistency with it and it's more what

consistency with it and it's more what
I'm<00:01:23.020> used<00:01:23.229> to

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
I'm used to

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.709 
I'm used to
I've<00:01:24.219> not<00:01:24.609> really<00:01:24.969> had<00:01:25.000> too<00:01:25.270> much<00:01:25.359> experience

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
I've not really had too much experience

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.109 
I've not really had too much experience
with<00:01:25.869> the<00:01:25.990> disc<00:01:26.140> brake<00:01:26.350> and<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.399> Shimano<00:01:27.700> CX

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
with the disc brake and the Shimano CX

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.749 
with the disc brake and the Shimano CX
70<00:01:28.509> brakes<00:01:28.750> are<00:01:29.189> perfect<00:01:30.189> now<00:01:30.280> knows<00:01:30.429> what<00:01:30.670> we

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
70 brakes are perfect now knows what we

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.620 
70 brakes are perfect now knows what we
do

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.600 

I<00:01:35.659> think<00:01:36.229> just<00:01:36.439> brakes<00:01:36.619> are<00:01:36.740> very<00:01:36.920> is<00:01:37.189> very<00:01:37.460> new

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
I think just brakes are very is very new

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.550 
I think just brakes are very is very new
