 The model I saw on the internet offers 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:04.320

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.840

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.450
 the pilot himself had screw here and 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.340

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:21.489
 complete then do what 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.610
 the first thing is to remove all 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.519

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.030
 I managed to get up 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.140

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.900
 You came back to rock beauty leaves her. 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.450
 and come 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.739
 on the bottom of the box again 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.160
 underneath you will do what ? 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.040
 the same procedure on the machine slowly 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.260
 will suspend for up 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.040
 slowly he supports the hand and finally one more 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.160
 little inside 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.760
 the screwdriver started working there 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.849
 up to secure support with car 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.590
 euros and comes with a screwdriver 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.250
 by pressing up and 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.739
 top 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:47.500
 detail between the wood and the 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.609
 The lid plastic has a tape that 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.220
 stay here 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:56.319
 this tape she has a problem glue does not 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.329
 will give no problem with the box 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.380
 So this tape is down here. 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.980
 hold the cover 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.970
 So you have to come slowly pulling 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.970
 for all the others tape 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.010
 with the hand of manga and pulling strength to 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.239
 top 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:18.799
 slow what caught the same 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:22.200
 procedure comes with the screwdriver 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:34.200
 puts down the model and lighter than 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:39.270
 drives up wandering and a 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:41.190
 turn only at the bottom and 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:05:03.510
 top 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:05:08.130
 the next wave up and could not 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:11.940
 to vote the case once until the end of 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:20.070
 cornet association here and you the end of 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:23.490
 led well below the LED is I have 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.260
 had released the difficulty is to 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.640
 Release but as I already released 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.310
 but I'll show you why 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.710
 difficulty is as follows 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.229
 usually these tabs are so tight 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.240
 understood with the key is the key of 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.910
 crevice that used the factory on it 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.100
 you will see that in the middle and will rotate the 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.440
 key will spin 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.070
 so you will require us will force it to 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.900
 Open 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.560
 She comes, it's not easier to shoot. 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:52.110
 understood if she picks up spin on day strength and she 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.690
 will open the same case if that 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.210
 also have you line up feather show 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.340
 like the days here is the plate taken care of 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.160
 This plate here can break then 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:05.310
 tries to give as much support as possible to 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.370
 force the plate on top and turn it turned if 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:12.360
 picks up and pulls down the beauty that the 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.740
 second part the part of it of the led is 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.690
 down here 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.990
 I can start to get up already 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:21.570

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.920
 that you are here is what is the 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.780
 dispute and glue 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.440

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.390
 low can sign for a waza it you 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.860
 can turn off the LED has for him 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:37.080
 move out 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:38.700
 the care details that it is already in danger 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.550
 Anything that falls can be another
