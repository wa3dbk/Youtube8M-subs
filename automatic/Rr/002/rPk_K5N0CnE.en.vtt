00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
think I you know had a bit of a struggle

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.049 
think I you know had a bit of a struggle
to<00:00:10.019> get<00:00:10.139> into<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.469> match<00:00:10.650> he<00:00:11.490> definitely<00:00:11.820> no

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
to get into the match he definitely no

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.910 
to get into the match he definitely no
did<00:00:12.300> play<00:00:12.540> well<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.929> return<00:00:13.259> extremely<00:00:13.769> well

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
did play well the return extremely well

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.589 
did play well the return extremely well
I<00:00:13.950> thought<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.580> know<00:00:14.700> he<00:00:14.790> took<00:00:15.000> my<00:00:15.179> second

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
I thought you know he took my second

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.650 
I thought you know he took my second
serve<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.260> return<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.859> really<00:00:17.220> easily<00:00:17.369> and

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
serve and return it really easily and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.970 
serve and return it really easily and
made<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.779> hard<00:00:18.960> for<00:00:19.020> me<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.260> know<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.560> thought

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
made it hard for me you know I thought

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.310 
made it hard for me you know I thought
he<00:00:20.189> was<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> better<00:00:20.580> player<00:00:20.869> over<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.109> first

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
he was a better player over on the first

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.920 
he was a better player over on the first
set<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.830> had<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.160> kind<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.880> find<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.510> way<00:00:24.869> to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
set and I had to kind of find a way to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.200 
set and I had to kind of find a way to
come<00:00:25.260> back<00:00:25.320> into<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.830> match<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.820> was

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
come back into the match and I was

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.910 
come back into the match and I was
important<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.660> get<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.109> early<00:00:28.560> break<00:00:28.769> in

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
important to get to the early break in

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.099 
important to get to the early break in
the<00:00:29.010> second<00:00:29.369> set<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.820> started<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.300> play<00:00:30.480> all<00:00:30.869> so

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
the second set I started to play all so

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.900 
the second set I started to play all so
much<00:00:31.289> better<00:00:31.560> he<00:00:31.859> let<00:00:32.009> go<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> little<00:00:32.340> bit<00:00:32.579> and

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
much better he let go a little bit and

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.940 
much better he let go a little bit and
all<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.690> sudden<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:34.050> know<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> was<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> roll

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
all of a sudden you know I was on a roll

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.920 
all of a sudden you know I was on a roll
and<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.219> think<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:35.880> hard<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.180> him<00:00:36.450> then<00:00:36.719> to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and I think it was hard for him then to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.619 
and I think it was hard for him then to
stop<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.940> yeah<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:38.969> think<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.300> got<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> little

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
stop that yeah I think I got a little

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.360 
stop that yeah I think I got a little
bit<00:00:39.960> lucky<00:00:40.230> today<00:00:40.410> because<00:00:40.890> he<00:00:40.980> was<00:00:41.129> really

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
bit lucky today because he was really

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.280 
bit lucky today because he was really
playing<00:00:41.579> well<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.450> turn<00:00:42.719> them<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.110> match

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
playing well so to turn them that match

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.410 
playing well so to turn them that match
around<00:00:43.620> i<00:00:43.739> think<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.489> huge<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:44.850> me<00:00:45.090> because

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
around i think is is huge for me because

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.790 
around i think is is huge for me because
we<00:00:45.570> need<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.750> first<00:00:46.050> mention<00:00:46.320> around<00:00:46.530> Robin

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
we need the first mention around Robin

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.400 
we need the first mention around Robin

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
what's in your view did you feel that

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.850 
what's in your view did you feel that
you<00:00:50.910> needed<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.660> do<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.989> change<00:00:52.170> things<00:00:52.469> after

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
you needed to do to change things after

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.160 
you needed to do to change things after
that<00:00:52.980> first<00:00:53.219> set<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:54.300> know<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.719> had<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
that first set you know I had the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.360 
that first set you know I had the
feeling<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.770> was<00:00:55.920> under<00:00:56.160> such<00:00:56.340> pressure

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
feeling that I was under such pressure

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.189 
feeling that I was under such pressure
from<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> baseline<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.420> he<00:00:57.629> was<00:00:57.780> absolutely

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
from the baseline that he was absolutely

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.770 
from the baseline that he was absolutely
dominating<00:00:58.980> me<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.579> had<00:01:00.030> maybe<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.539> little<00:01:00.629> bit

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
dominating me I had maybe a little bit

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.029 
dominating me I had maybe a little bit
problem<00:01:01.140> with<00:01:01.230> my<00:01:01.379> movement<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.010> know

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
problem with my movement you know

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.910 
problem with my movement you know
because<00:01:02.489> maybe<00:01:03.059> haven't<00:01:03.390> played<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:04.140> match<00:01:04.680> for

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
because maybe haven't played a match for

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.039 
because maybe haven't played a match for
two<00:01:05.070> weeks<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:06.030> means<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> same<00:01:06.540> frame<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:07.020> I

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
two weeks it means the same frame but I

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.960 
two weeks it means the same frame but I
just<00:01:07.290> had<00:01:07.409> finger<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.400> took<00:01:08.580> me<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> bit<00:01:08.760> longer

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
just had finger it took me a bit longer

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.870 
just had finger it took me a bit longer
to<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.360> into<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.369> just<00:01:11.369> tried<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.700> make

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
to get into it and I just tried to make

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.550 
to get into it and I just tried to make
less<00:01:12.090> errors<00:01:12.479> try<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.930> serve<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> little<00:01:13.470> bit

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
less errors try to serve a little bit

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.530 
less errors try to serve a little bit
better<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.670> know<00:01:14.760> make<00:01:14.939> more<00:01:15.180> returns

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
better and you know make more returns

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.480 
better and you know make more returns
and<00:01:15.869> these<00:01:16.320> three<00:01:16.650> little<00:01:16.890> things<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.460> know

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
and these three little things you know

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.609 
and these three little things you know
made<00:01:17.790> made<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> match<00:01:18.420> turn<00:01:18.630> around<00:01:18.930> did<00:01:19.530> you

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
made made the match turn around did you

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.140 
made made the match turn around did you
feel<00:01:19.799> comfortable<00:01:20.280> playing<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.880> surface

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
feel comfortable playing on that surface

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.480 
feel comfortable playing on that surface
yeah<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> mean<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.380> think<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.860> fair<00:01:23.009> surface

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
yeah I mean I think it's a fair surface

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.950 
yeah I mean I think it's a fair surface
for<00:01:23.670> everybody<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.090> think<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.509> quite<00:01:24.630> slow

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
for everybody I think it's quite slow

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.200 
for everybody I think it's quite slow
actually<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.680> week<00:01:25.970> maybe<00:01:26.970> I'm<00:01:27.090> going

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
actually here this week maybe I'm going

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.490 
actually here this week maybe I'm going
to<00:01:27.270> say<00:01:27.390> something<00:01:27.450> else<00:01:27.900> obviously<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.439> I

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
to say something else obviously if I

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.350 
to say something else obviously if I
play<00:01:28.710> Lou<00:01:29.280> bachchan<00:01:29.790> Roddick<00:01:30.090> when<00:01:30.240> they're

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
play Lou bachchan Roddick when they're

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.510 
play Lou bachchan Roddick when they're
going<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.540> serve<00:01:30.689> all<00:01:30.900> all<00:01:31.409> those<00:01:31.619> aces<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.220> I

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
going to serve all all those aces but I

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.730 
going to serve all all those aces but I
still<00:01:32.759> feel<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.150> think<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> fair<00:01:34.020> chord<00:01:34.380> slice

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
still feel I think is a fair chord slice

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.010 
still feel I think is a fair chord slice
stays<00:01:35.040> nice<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.310> load<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.270> topspin<00:01:36.720> takes

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
stays nice and load the topspin takes

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.990 
stays nice and load the topspin takes
you<00:01:37.470> know<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.740> kick<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:37.979> everything<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.759> I

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
you know the kick and everything so I

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.310 
you know the kick and everything so I
think<00:01:39.420> that's<00:01:39.750> what<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.049> are<00:01:40.200> most

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
think that's what we are most

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.810 
think that's what we are most
comfortable<00:01:40.560> playing<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.369> all<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> players

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
comfortable playing on all the players

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.120 
comfortable playing on all the players
there<00:01:42.659> are<00:01:42.750> myself<00:01:42.990> all<00:01:43.439> there<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.770> rest<00:01:43.920> as

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
there are myself all there the rest as

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.440 
there are myself all there the rest as
well<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.579> that's<00:01:44.670> why<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.939> think<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.329> good

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
well and that's why I think it's a good

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.719 
well and that's why I think it's a good
surface<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> different<00:01:47.250> kind<00:01:47.610> of

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
surface and is it a different kind of

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.980 
surface and is it a different kind of
pressure<00:01:48.000> when<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.329> go<00:01:48.479> into<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.780> match

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
pressure when you go into a match

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.960 
pressure when you go into a match
knowing<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.280> round-robin<00:01:50.549> format

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
knowing that it's a round-robin format

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.940 
knowing that it's a round-robin format
and<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.020> another<00:01:52.259> chance<00:01:52.590> does<00:01:52.829> it

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
and you do have another chance does it

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.289 
and you do have another chance does it
make<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.189> feel<00:01:53.220> differently<00:01:53.820> approach<00:01:54.119> it

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
make you feel differently approach it

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.850 
make you feel differently approach it
differently<00:01:54.420> yeah<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.680> definitely

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
differently yeah and you definitely

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.230 
differently yeah and you definitely
approach<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.399> bit<00:01:56.579> different<00:01:56.939> because<00:01:57.000> you

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
approach a bit different because you

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.760 
approach a bit different because you
talk<00:01:57.450> about<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.840> much<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.170> know<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.469> with<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
talk about it much you know it with the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.410 
talk about it much you know it with the
press<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.219> go<00:01:59.369> through<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.790> what<00:01:59.969> happens<00:02:00.299> if

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
press you go through it what happens if

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.179 
press you go through it what happens if
you<00:02:00.509> lose<00:02:00.540> what<00:02:01.049> happens<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.560> win<00:02:01.710> usually

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
you lose what happens if you win usually

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.319 
you lose what happens if you win usually
don't<00:02:02.369> talk<00:02:02.520> about<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:03.000> at<00:02:03.210> other

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
don't talk about this at other

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.969 
don't talk about this at other
tournaments<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.049> lose<00:02:04.229> you're<00:02:04.439> out<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.799> go

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
tournaments you lose you're out you go

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.399 
tournaments you lose you're out you go
home<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.399> know<00:02:05.689> so<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:06.990> obviously<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
home you know so this is obviously a

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.869 
home you know so this is obviously a
change<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:08.009> then<00:02:08.160> even<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.429> know<00:02:08.580> when<00:02:08.789> you

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
change but then even you know when you

change but then even you know when you
lose<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.179> first<00:02:09.390> set<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.780> think<00:02:09.989> well<00:02:10.140> it's

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
lose the first set you think well it's

not that bad you know because I could

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.970 
not that bad you know because I could
