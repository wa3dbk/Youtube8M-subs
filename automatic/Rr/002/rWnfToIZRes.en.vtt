00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.030 

at<00:00:02.280> this<00:00:03.270> point<00:00:03.570> I'm<00:00:03.840> beginning<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.350> run<00:00:04.620> into

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
at this point I'm beginning to run into

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.460 
at this point I'm beginning to run into
another<00:00:05.279> problem<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:06.000> tradition<00:00:06.569> here<00:00:07.350> are

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
another problem of tradition here are

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.860 
another problem of tradition here are
the<00:00:07.620> four<00:00:07.859> synoptic<00:00:08.429> Gospels<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.420> primary

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
the four synoptic Gospels the primary

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.629 
the four synoptic Gospels the primary
difference<00:00:10.230> between<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.740> four<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.340> mark

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
difference between the four is that mark

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.910 
difference between the four is that mark
and<00:00:11.790> Mark<00:00:12.059> II<00:00:12.210> on<00:00:12.330> have<00:00:12.630> no<00:00:12.870> infancy<00:00:13.349> narrative

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
and Mark II on have no infancy narrative

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.650 
and Mark II on have no infancy narrative
and<00:00:14.130> while<00:00:14.549> all<00:00:14.759> four<00:00:15.089> have<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.360> passion

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
and while all four have a passion

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.750 
and while all four have a passion
narrative<00:00:16.080> it's<00:00:16.740> highly<00:00:17.130> debatable<00:00:17.730> whether

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
narrative it's highly debatable whether

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.710 
narrative it's highly debatable whether
or<00:00:18.119> not<00:00:18.210> mark<00:00:18.539> has<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> resurrection<00:00:19.529> story<00:00:19.859> in

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
or not mark has a resurrection story in

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.660 
or not mark has a resurrection story in
my<00:00:21.720> last<00:00:21.930> video<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.529> located<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.100> gospel<00:00:23.580> of

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
my last video I located the gospel of

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.150 
my last video I located the gospel of
James<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.689> gospel<00:00:25.199> explains<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.800> infancy

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
James this gospel explains the infancy

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.710 
James this gospel explains the infancy
narratives<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.060> differences<00:00:27.510> between

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
narratives and the differences between

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.169 
narratives and the differences between
the<00:00:28.109> stories<00:00:28.560> even<00:00:29.250> though<00:00:29.519> Luke<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.029> Matthew

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the stories even though Luke and Matthew

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.299 
the stories even though Luke and Matthew
are<00:00:30.390> quite<00:00:30.900> different<00:00:31.140> from<00:00:31.380> each<00:00:31.590> other<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
are quite different from each other the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.190 
are quite different from each other the
two<00:00:32.489> accounts<00:00:32.790> are<00:00:33.030> actually<00:00:33.480> consistent<00:00:34.079> in

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
two accounts are actually consistent in

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.590 
two accounts are actually consistent in
the<00:00:34.320> gospel<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.770> James<00:00:35.010> account<00:00:35.370> both<00:00:36.180> stories

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the gospel of James account both stories

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.330 
the gospel of James account both stories
are<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> part<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.500> single<00:00:37.710> narrative<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
are a part of a single narrative and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.760 
are a part of a single narrative and
James<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:39.149> excludes<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.899> genealogy<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
James this excludes the genealogy and

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.160 
James this excludes the genealogy and
the<00:00:41.040> manger<00:00:41.399> story<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.510> most<00:00:42.719> likely

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the manger story the most likely

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.200 
the manger story the most likely
explanation<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:43.980> James<00:00:44.399> has<00:00:44.640> priority

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
explanation is that James has priority

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.569 
explanation is that James has priority
over<00:00:45.239> Luke<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.870> Matthew<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:47.129> Matthew

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
over Luke and Matthew and that Matthew

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.490 
over Luke and Matthew and that Matthew
was<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.910> first<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.270> introduce<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.780> genealogy

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
was the first to introduce a genealogy

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.330 
was the first to introduce a genealogy
but<00:00:50.100> that's<00:00:50.309> still<00:00:50.520> not<00:00:50.579> quite<00:00:50.940> clear<00:00:52.340> taking

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
but that's still not quite clear taking

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.160 
but that's still not quite clear taking
a<00:00:53.430> very<00:00:53.579> similar<00:00:53.940> approach<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.719> applying<00:00:55.050> it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
a very similar approach and applying it

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.110 
a very similar approach and applying it
to<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.440> passion<00:00:55.890> narrative<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.760> find<00:00:57.059> that

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
to the passion narrative we find that

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.970 
to the passion narrative we find that
there<00:00:57.329> are<00:00:57.390> all<00:00:57.629> kinds<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.199> inconsistencies

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
there are all kinds of inconsistencies

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.220 
there are all kinds of inconsistencies
between<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.640> four<00:00:59.820> Gospels<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:01.020> is

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
between the four Gospels this is

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.290 
between the four Gospels this is
generally<00:01:01.710> problematic<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.550> no<00:01:02.850> one<00:01:03.030> seems

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
generally problematic and no one seems

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.490 
generally problematic and no one seems
to<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.570> good<00:01:03.780> answer<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
to have a good answer for the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.219 
to have a good answer for the
inconsistencies<00:01:05.869> however<00:01:06.869> I've<00:01:07.200> been

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
inconsistencies however I've been

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.080 
inconsistencies however I've been
running<00:01:07.590> through<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> gospel<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.460> Peter<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
running through the gospel of Peter the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.630 
running through the gospel of Peter the
gospel<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.960> Peter<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> single<00:01:11.040> passion

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
gospel of Peter is a single passion

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.000 
gospel of Peter is a single passion
resurrection<00:01:12.360> narrative<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.080> once<00:01:13.560> again<00:01:13.710> we

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
resurrection narrative and once again we

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.200 
resurrection narrative and once again we
have<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> document<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.790> could<00:01:15.090> potentially

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
have a document that could potentially

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.410 
have a document that could potentially
produce<00:01:15.750> all<00:01:16.080> force<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.890> optic<00:01:17.189> stories<00:01:17.640> one

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
produce all force and optic stories one

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.420 
produce all force and optic stories one
of<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.570> curious<00:01:19.020> things<00:01:19.350> about<00:01:19.590> Peter<00:01:19.890> versus

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
of the curious things about Peter versus

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.640 
of the curious things about Peter versus
the<00:01:20.549> Synoptics<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.900> while<00:01:22.110> all<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the Synoptics is that while all the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.499 
the Synoptics is that while all the
Synoptics<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.369> problems<00:01:23.820> between<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.330> four

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
Synoptics have problems between the four

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.780 
Synoptics have problems between the four
accounts<00:01:24.960> most<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.770> those<00:01:25.890> inconsistent

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
accounts most of those inconsistent

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.850 
accounts most of those inconsistent
objects<00:01:27.330> are<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.930> gospel<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.409> Peter<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
objects are in the gospel of Peter and

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.590 
objects are in the gospel of Peter and
they're<00:01:29.159> told<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.640> single<00:01:29.939> narrative<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
they're told in a single narrative and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.319 
they're told in a single narrative and
everything<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.229> consistent<00:01:31.970> again<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.180> most

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
everything is consistent again the most

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.359 
everything is consistent again the most
likely<00:01:33.780> explanation<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.740> gospel<00:01:35.250> of

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
likely explanation is that the gospel of

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.310 
likely explanation is that the gospel of
Peter<00:01:35.549> has<00:01:35.850> priority<00:01:36.540> over<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.780> synoptic

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
Peter has priority over the synoptic

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.050 
Peter has priority over the synoptic
Gospels<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.610> four<00:01:38.820> authors

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
Gospels and that the four authors

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.420 
Gospels and that the four authors
compress<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.079> narrative<00:01:40.439> down<00:01:40.680> into<00:01:41.130> smaller

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
compress the narrative down into smaller

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.639 
compress the narrative down into smaller
stories<00:01:41.820> each<00:01:42.329> borrowing<00:01:42.990> different<00:01:43.350> parts

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
stories each borrowing different parts

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.160 
stories each borrowing different parts
of<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.829> gospel<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.369> Peter<00:01:44.960> before<00:01:45.960> going

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
of the gospel of Peter before going

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.749 
of the gospel of Peter before going
through<00:01:46.500> Justin<00:01:46.890> Martyr<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.369> had<00:01:47.579> not

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
through Justin Martyr I had not

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.429 
through Justin Martyr I had not
considered<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.479> gospel<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.020> Peter<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
considered the gospel of Peter and

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.440 
considered the gospel of Peter and
unfortunately<00:01:50.280> because<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.060> sharp
