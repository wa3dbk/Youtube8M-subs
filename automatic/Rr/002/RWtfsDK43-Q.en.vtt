00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
pregnant Matano said you know what time

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.720 
pregnant Matano said you know what time
it<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.560> now<00:03:05.000> yes<00:03:09.350> yes<00:03:10.350> look<00:03:11.250> at<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.490> clock<00:03:11.700> and

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
it is now yes yes look at the clock and

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.450 
it is now yes yes look at the clock and
tell<00:03:12.030> me<00:03:12.150> what<00:03:12.270> time<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.630> is<00:03:16.160> actually<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.280> was

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
tell me what time it is actually it was

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.930 
tell me what time it is actually it was
still<00:03:17.730> about<00:03:18.060> quarter<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:18.750> 5:00<00:03:19.820> can<00:03:20.820> the

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
still about quarter to 5:00 can the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.030 
still about quarter to 5:00 can the
clock<00:03:21.150> ever<00:03:21.390> become<00:03:21.780> accurate<00:03:22.260> yes<00:03:22.860> while

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
clock ever become accurate yes while

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.740 
clock ever become accurate yes while
it's<00:03:23.190> breaking<00:03:23.580> down<00:03:24.620> well<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:26.510> clock<00:03:27.510> is

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
it's breaking down well the clock is

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.050 
it's breaking down well the clock is
accurate<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.500> mean<00:03:29.490> the<00:03:29.580> function<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:30.000> the

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
improvements to the mall do you think

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.690 
improvements to the mall do you think
it's<00:03:50.790> worth<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:51.240> much<00:03:52.160> yeah<00:03:54.470> yeah<00:03:55.470> so<00:03:56.250> as<00:03:56.520> you

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
it's worth that much yeah yeah so as you

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.250 
it's worth that much yeah yeah so as you
turn<00:03:56.940> around<00:03:57.270> and<00:03:57.450> look<00:03:57.510> at<00:03:57.630> this<00:03:57.840> where's<00:03:58.110> the

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
turn around and look at this where's the

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.990 
turn around and look at this where's the
value<00:03:58.470> for<00:03:58.770> money<00:03:58.920> what<00:03:59.160> do<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.340> see<00:03:59.580> well<00:03:59.940> I

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
value for money what do you see well I

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.479 
value for money what do you see well I
think<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.390> would<00:04:00.480> cling<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:01.140> us<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:01.680> if<00:04:02.340> that

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
think it would cling to us and if that

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.300 
think it would cling to us and if that
being<00:04:02.730> tourists<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:04.050> business<00:04:04.800> people<00:04:05.040> will

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
being tourists the business people will

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.550 
being tourists the business people will
make<00:04:05.430> more<00:04:05.700> money<00:04:05.880> whatever<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.989> critics<00:04:07.350> may

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
make more money whatever the critics may

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.400 
make more money whatever the critics may
say<00:04:07.890> it's<00:04:08.340> certainly<00:04:08.940> different<00:04:09.270> and<00:04:10.230> there's

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
say it's certainly different and there's

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.320 
say it's certainly different and there's
no<00:04:10.620> shortage<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.190> people<00:04:11.400> eager<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.120> have<00:04:12.300> a
