little<00:00:03.180> beta<00:00:03.510> video<00:00:03.870> today<00:00:04.860> we're<00:00:05.009> going<00:00:05.040> to

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
little beta video today we're going to

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.769 
little beta video today we're going to
taking<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.490> look<00:00:05.640> at<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.819> two<00:00:06.060> new<00:00:06.210> engineering

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
taking a look at the two new engineering

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.690 
taking a look at the two new engineering
mounts<00:00:07.170> coming<00:00:07.470> into<00:00:07.650> the<00:00:07.770> game<00:00:07.980> with<00:00:08.490> the

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
mounts coming into the game with the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.090 
mounts coming into the game with the
mists<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.059> pandaria<00:00:09.200> expansion

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.100 
mists of pandaria expansion

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.670 
mists of pandaria expansion
the<00:00:12.790> first<00:00:13.300> one<00:00:13.540> is<00:00:13.570> the<00:00:13.930> geosynchronous

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
the first one is the geosynchronous

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.820 
the first one is the geosynchronous
world<00:00:15.370> spinner<00:00:15.790> which<00:00:16.690> definitely<00:00:17.560> has<00:00:17.800> a

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
world spinner which definitely has a

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.050 
world spinner which definitely has a
gnomish<00:00:18.520> engineering<00:00:19.330> feel<00:00:19.570> to<00:00:19.810> it<00:00:20.850> we'll<00:00:21.850> see

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
gnomish engineering feel to it we'll see

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.130 
gnomish engineering feel to it we'll see
why<00:00:22.210> in<00:00:22.240> just<00:00:22.360> a<00:00:22.570> little<00:00:22.690> minute<00:00:22.990> with<00:00:23.080> the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
why in just a little minute with the

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.019 
why in just a little minute with the
other<00:00:23.260> one<00:00:23.440> but<00:00:24.010> this<00:00:24.100> one's<00:00:24.340> kind<00:00:24.610> of<00:00:24.700> wacky

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
other one but this one's kind of wacky

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.880 
other one but this one's kind of wacky
looking<00:00:25.330> like<00:00:25.450> a<00:00:25.480> gnome<00:00:25.750> you<00:00:26.560> know<00:00:26.650> it<00:00:26.740> looks

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
looking like a gnome you know it looks

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.850 
looking like a gnome you know it looks
like<00:00:26.950> something<00:00:27.189> an<00:00:27.400> omen<00:00:27.760> build<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:29.500> a<00:00:29.530> side

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
like something an omen build on a side

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.700 
like something an omen build on a side
note<00:00:29.890> they<00:00:30.820> finally<00:00:31.150> got<00:00:31.390> the<00:00:31.600> mount<00:00:31.960> and<00:00:32.230> pet

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
note they finally got the mount and pet

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
account bound clearly it's not going to

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.200 
account bound clearly it's not going to
work<00:00:40.690> with<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:42.129> know<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.430> racial<00:00:43.000> mouths

anything<00:00:43.690> like<00:00:43.870> that<00:00:43.900> but<00:00:44.320> back<00:00:45.010> to<00:00:45.159> the

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
anything like that but back to the

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.700 
anything like that but back to the
engineering<00:00:45.670> mounts<00:00:46.409> here<00:00:47.409> is<00:00:47.559> the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
engineering mounts here is the

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.290 
engineering mounts here is the
geosynchronous<00:00:48.250> world<00:00:48.640> spinner<00:00:48.909> which<00:00:49.089> has<00:00:49.269> a

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
geosynchronous world spinner which has a

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.490 
geosynchronous world spinner which has a
lovely<00:00:49.900> looking<00:00:50.559> model<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.930> almost<00:00:53.110> like<00:00:53.470> a

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
lovely looking model it's almost like a

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.600 
lovely looking model it's almost like a
50<00:00:54.159> style<00:00:54.460> twat<00:00:55.030> rock<00:00:55.330> of<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.629> etsy<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:57.489> like

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
50 style twat rock of the etsy but like

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.729 
50 style twat rock of the etsy but like
I<00:00:57.729> said<00:00:57.790> still<00:00:58.239> has<00:00:58.360> that<00:00:58.510> that<00:00:59.260> no<00:00:59.589> wish

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
I said still has that that no wish

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.280 
I said still has that that no wish
engineering<00:01:00.280> feel<00:01:00.519> to<00:01:00.729> it<00:01:00.760> my<00:01:01.720> only<00:01:01.870> gripe<00:01:02.110> of

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
engineering feel to it my only gripe of

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.049 
engineering feel to it my only gripe of
the<00:01:02.379> model<00:01:02.710> is<00:01:02.890> your<00:01:03.280> feet<00:01:03.549> hang<00:01:03.729> through<00:01:03.970> the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
the model is your feet hang through the

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.810 
the model is your feet hang through the
bottom<00:01:04.360> of<00:01:04.479> it<00:01:04.600> but<00:01:04.839> aside<00:01:05.590> from<00:01:05.650> that<00:01:05.860> great

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
bottom of it but aside from that great

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.149 
bottom of it but aside from that great
looking<00:01:07.150> model<00:01:07.479> does<00:01:08.229> kind<00:01:08.590> of<00:01:08.680> pale<00:01:08.950> in

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
looking model does kind of pale in

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.370 
looking model does kind of pale in
comparison<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.780> other<00:01:10.990> one<00:01:11.170> in<00:01:11.260> my

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
comparison to the other one in my

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.770 
comparison to the other one in my
opinion<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:13.090> that's<00:01:13.270> just<00:01:13.390> gonna<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.690> other

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
opinion but that's just gonna the other

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.410 
opinion but that's just gonna the other
one<00:01:13.900> looks<00:01:14.080> badass<00:01:14.909> if<00:01:15.909> we're<00:01:16.119> going<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.329> get

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
one looks badass if we're going to get

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.570 
one looks badass if we're going to get
to<00:01:16.539> that<00:01:16.659> one<00:01:16.869> right<00:01:17.170> now

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
to that one right now

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.810 
to that one right now
that<00:01:19.180> is<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.720> depleted<00:01:20.470> Hyperion<00:01:21.400> rocket

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
that is the depleted Hyperion rocket

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.810 
that is the depleted Hyperion rocket
which<00:01:22.510> look<00:01:22.900> at<00:01:23.050> this<00:01:23.200> thing<00:01:23.500> it<00:01:24.430> doesn't<00:01:24.700> have

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
which look at this thing it doesn't have

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.850 
which look at this thing it doesn't have
a<00:01:24.910> fire<00:01:25.360> that's<00:01:25.780> as<00:01:27.210> pronounced<00:01:28.210> as<00:01:28.360> the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
a fire that's as pronounced as the

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.290 
a fire that's as pronounced as the
the<00:01:30.430> other<00:01:30.790> mount<00:01:31.090> but<00:01:31.960> it<00:01:32.200> is<00:01:32.560> it<00:01:33.520> has<00:01:34.090> more

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
the other mount but it is it has more

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.850 
the other mount but it is it has more
than<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.510> make<00:01:34.720> more<00:01:35.080> than<00:01:35.260> that<00:01:35.380> to<00:01:35.530> make<00:01:35.560> up

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
than a make more than that to make up

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.300 
than a make more than that to make up
for<00:01:36.100> it<00:01:36.510> this<00:01:37.510> thing<00:01:37.660> has<00:01:37.750> a<00:01:37.780> gun<00:01:38.130> Spike's<00:01:39.130> a

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
for it this thing has a gun Spike's a

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.940 
for it this thing has a gun Spike's a
nice<00:01:39.460> big<00:01:39.700> skull<00:01:40.180> on<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.390> front<00:01:40.950> got

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
nice big skull on the front got

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.520 
nice big skull on the front got
lightning<00:01:42.250> bolts<00:01:42.730> on<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.880> sides

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.190 

just<00:01:47.190> look<00:01:47.430> at<00:01:47.580> this<00:01:47.729> thing<00:01:47.940> seems<00:01:48.900> far<00:01:49.170> more

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
just look at this thing seems far more

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.550 
just look at this thing seems far more
detailed<00:01:49.799> than<00:01:49.860> another<00:01:50.280> one

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.300 

in<00:01:54.340> addition<00:01:54.610> to<00:01:54.850> that<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:56.229> have<00:01:56.439> bombs<00:01:56.979> in

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
in addition to that you have bombs in

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.540 
in addition to that you have bombs in
the<00:01:57.399> bag

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
the bag

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.820 
the bag
which<00:02:00.120> is<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.330> geek<00:02:00.900> as<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.410> tell<00:02:01.470> with

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
which is the geek as you can tell with

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.200 
which is the geek as you can tell with
the<00:02:01.950> explosives<00:02:02.520> all<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.030> that

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the explosives all this and that

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.410 
the explosives all this and that
definitely<00:02:04.140> has<00:02:04.470> a<00:02:04.970> goblin<00:02:05.970> engineering

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
definitely has a goblin engineering

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.180
