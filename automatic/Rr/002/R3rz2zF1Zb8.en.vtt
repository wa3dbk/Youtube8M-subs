00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.910 

let's<00:00:03.720> continue<00:00:03.929> talking<00:00:04.380> about<00:00:04.650> the

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
let's continue talking about the

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.889 
let's continue talking about the
periodic<00:00:05.370> table<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:05.940> more<00:00:06.330> specifically

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
periodic table and more specifically

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.450 
periodic table and more specifically
let's<00:00:07.020> talk<00:00:07.500> about<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.980> properties<00:00:08.429> of

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
let's talk about the properties of

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.759 
let's talk about the properties of
transition<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.450> inner<00:00:09.719> transition<00:00:10.349> metals

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
transition and inner transition metals

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.459 
transition and inner transition metals
so<00:00:11.460> we<00:00:11.849> call<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.059> transition<00:00:12.960> metals<00:00:13.259> are

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
so we call that transition metals are

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.770 
so we call that transition metals are
groups<00:00:14.009> 3<00:00:14.370> through<00:00:14.400> 12<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.240> they're<00:00:15.360> right<00:00:15.540> in

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
groups 3 through 12 and they're right in

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.420 
groups 3 through 12 and they're right in
the<00:00:15.839> middle<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.379> periodic<00:00:16.800> table<00:00:17.130> now

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
the middle of the periodic table now

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.000 
the middle of the periodic table now
points<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:17.940> out<00:00:18.000> momentarily<00:00:18.590> and<00:00:19.590> they<00:00:19.770> have

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
points it out momentarily and they have

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.390 
points it out momentarily and they have
d<00:00:20.720> orbitals<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.960> inner<00:00:22.650> transition<00:00:23.160> metals

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
d orbitals and inner transition metals

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.890 
d orbitals and inner transition metals
are<00:00:23.580> located<00:00:24.060> at<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.269> bottom<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.779> the

are located at the bottom of the
periodic<00:00:25.140> table<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.680> those<00:00:26.160> guys<00:00:26.430> have<00:00:26.730> F

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
periodic table and those guys have F

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.790 
periodic table and those guys have F
orbitals<00:00:27.420> remember<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.230> D<00:00:28.380> orbitals

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
orbitals remember that D orbitals

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.250 
orbitals remember that D orbitals
maximally<00:00:29.429> hold<00:00:29.640> ten<00:00:30.029> valence<00:00:30.599> electrons<00:00:31.019> and

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
F orbitals hold a maximum of 14 so all

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.760 
F orbitals hold a maximum of 14 so all
these<00:00:36.390> guys<00:00:36.600> both<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.079> transition<00:00:37.530> metals

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
these guys both the transition metals

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.740 
these guys both the transition metals
and<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.190> inner<00:00:38.370> transition<00:00:38.940> metals<00:00:39.180> exhibit

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
and the inner transition metals exhibit

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.780 
and the inner transition metals exhibit
properties<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.829> other<00:00:40.980> metals<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.520> we

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
properties of the other metals that we

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.910 
properties of the other metals that we
see<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> periodic<00:00:42.629> table<00:00:42.750> meaning<00:00:43.620> they

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
see on the periodic table meaning they

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.580 
see on the periodic table meaning they
are<00:00:44.760> good<00:00:44.940> conductors<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.360> electricity<00:00:45.590> they

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
are good conductors of electricity they

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.410 
are good conductors of electricity they
have<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> nice<00:00:47.039> luster<00:00:47.309> quality<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.000> them<00:00:48.149> and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
have a nice luster quality to them and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.240 
have a nice luster quality to them and
they're<00:00:48.899> malleable<00:00:49.469> which<00:00:49.710> means<00:00:49.980> they're

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
they're malleable which means they're

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.970 
they're malleable which means they're
soft<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.879> kind<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.210> pliable<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:52.559> across<00:00:52.860> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
soft and kind of pliable so across a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.150 
soft and kind of pliable so across a
period<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.420> transition<00:00:54.960> metals<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
period in the transition metals and the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160 
period in the transition metals and the
inner<00:00:56.430> transition<00:00:56.969> metals<00:00:57.300> remember<00:00:57.750> periods

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
inner transition metals remember periods

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.170 
inner transition metals remember periods
are<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.559> rows<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.370> going<00:00:59.579> across<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> row

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
are the rows so going across a row

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.240 
are the rows so going across a row
there's<00:01:00.809> little<00:01:01.140> variation<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> atomic

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
there's little variation in the atomic

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.329 
there's little variation in the atomic
size<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.300> electronegativity<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
size in the electronegativity and in the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.310 
size in the electronegativity and in the
ionization<00:01:05.670> energy<00:01:06.030> however<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:07.170> are

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
ionization energy however there are

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.230 
ionization energy however there are
differences<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.430> physical<00:01:08.790> properties

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
differences in the physical properties

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.300 
differences in the physical properties
and<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.930> those<00:01:10.380> differences<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.189> physical

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and so those differences in physical

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.219 
and so those differences in physical
properties<00:01:11.760> are<00:01:12.030> determined<00:01:12.930> by<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
properties are determined by the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.560 
properties are determined by the
electron<00:01:13.860> configurations<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.270> various

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
electron configurations of the various

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.719 
electron configurations of the various
elements<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.080> fall<00:01:16.409> within<00:01:16.590> these<00:01:17.460> two

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
elements that fall within these two

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.480 
elements that fall within these two
groups<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:19.320> when<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.650> say<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.130> electron

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
groups and so when I say the electron

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.490 
groups and so when I say the electron
configurations<00:01:21.090> I'm<00:01:21.390> referring<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.290> fact

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
configurations I'm referring to the fact

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.080 
configurations I'm referring to the fact
that<00:01:22.590> if<00:01:22.740> they<00:01:22.860> were<00:01:22.920> unpaired<00:01:23.400> electrons<00:01:23.880> it

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
that if they were unpaired electrons it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.060 
that if they were unpaired electrons it
causes<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> physical<00:01:25.259> properties<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
causes the physical properties to be a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.539 
causes the physical properties to be a
little<00:01:26.430> bit<00:01:26.610> different<00:01:27.060> within<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.049> family

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
little bit different within the family

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.969 
little bit different within the family
so<00:01:29.549> transition<00:01:30.360> metals<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.810> lose<00:01:31.049> 2's

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
so transition metals can lose 2's

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.050 
so transition metals can lose 2's
electrons<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.240> become<00:01:33.360> 2<00:01:33.990> plus<00:01:34.350> ions<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.220> they

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
electrons to become 2 plus ions and they

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.060 
electrons to become 2 plus ions and they
can<00:01:36.210> also<00:01:36.360> form<00:01:36.659> multiple<00:01:37.170> oxidation<00:01:37.380> states

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
can also form multiple oxidation states

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.210 
can also form multiple oxidation states
so<00:01:38.579> it's<00:01:38.670> something<00:01:38.970> different<00:01:39.119> from<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:41.070> s

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
so it's something different from the s

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.340 
so it's something different from the s
block<00:01:41.490> elements<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.119> P<00:01:42.270> block<00:01:42.360> elements<00:01:42.930> they

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
block elements and P block elements they

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.490 
block elements and P block elements they
usually<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:44.329> one<00:01:45.329> oxidation<00:01:46.049> state<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
usually have one oxidation state that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.560 
usually have one oxidation state that
they<00:01:46.770> prefer<00:01:47.189> within<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.820> transition<00:01:48.299> metals

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
they prefer within the transition metals

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.359 
they prefer within the transition metals
though<00:01:48.720> they<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.140> form<00:01:49.380> numerous<00:01:49.799> oxidation

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
though they can form numerous oxidation

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.940 
though they can form numerous oxidation
states<00:01:50.610> for<00:01:51.270> instance<00:01:51.299> vanadium<00:01:52.020> which<00:01:52.439> is

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
states for instance vanadium which is

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.340 
states for instance vanadium which is
here<00:01:53.220> atomic<00:01:53.610> number<00:01:53.640> 23<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.689> can<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.229> an

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
here atomic number 23 it can have an

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.780 
here atomic number 23 it can have an
oxidation<00:01:55.860> state<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.100> 2<00:01:56.420> 3<00:01:57.420> 4<00:01:57.930> &amp;<00:01:58.200> 5<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.979> 2<00:01:59.040> plus<00:01:59.460> 3

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
oxidation state of 2 3 4 &amp; 5 so 2 plus 3

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.539 
oxidation state of 2 3 4 &amp; 5 so 2 plus 3
plus<00:01:59.909> 4<00:02:00.030> plus<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.750> 5<00:02:01.110> plus<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.189> all<00:02:02.430> of

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
plus 4 plus and 5 plus and so all of

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.789 
plus 4 plus and 5 plus and so all of
those<00:02:02.640> different<00:02:03.060> oxidation<00:02:03.689> states<00:02:04.140> if<00:02:04.350> you

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
those different oxidation states if you

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.080 
those different oxidation states if you
were<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.040> make<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.219> solution<00:02:05.700> with<00:02:05.850> vanadium

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
were to make a solution with vanadium

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.510 
were to make a solution with vanadium
you<00:02:06.659> could<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.770> oxidation<00:02:08.160> state

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
you could know that the oxidation state

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.190 
you could know that the oxidation state
was<00:02:08.640> changing<00:02:09.030> because<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.509> colors<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
was changing because the colors of the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.810 
was changing because the colors of the
solution<00:02:10.619> would<00:02:10.739> change<00:02:10.979> drastically<00:02:12.080> so

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
solution would change drastically so

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.150 
solution would change drastically so
the<00:02:14.540> transition<00:02:14.990> metals<00:02:15.230> can<00:02:15.500> also<00:02:15.680> exhibit

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
the transition metals can also exhibit

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.970 
the transition metals can also exhibit
magnetic<00:02:16.880> properties<00:02:17.330> as<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.720> result<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.440> being

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
magnetic properties as a result of being

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.600 
magnetic properties as a result of being
able<00:02:19.070> to<00:02:19.220> have<00:02:19.490> unpaired<00:02:20.150> electrons<00:02:20.660> so<00:02:21.260> if<00:02:21.610> in

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
able to have unpaired electrons so if in

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.490 
able to have unpaired electrons so if in
the<00:02:22.970> electron<00:02:23.360> configuration<00:02:23.960> you<00:02:24.470> have

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
the electron configuration you have

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.700 
the electron configuration you have
paired<00:02:25.100> electrons<00:02:25.640> then<00:02:26.270> we<00:02:26.420> call<00:02:26.630> that

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
paired electrons then we call that

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.320 
paired electrons then we call that
diamagnetic<00:02:27.710> and<00:02:27.950> if<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.790> actually<00:02:29.000> have

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
diamagnetic and if you actually have

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.600 
diamagnetic and if you actually have
unpaired<00:02:29.780> electrons<00:02:30.260> then<00:02:30.830> we<00:02:30.980> say<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.250> that

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
unpaired electrons then we say that that

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.090 
unpaired electrons then we say that that
element<00:02:32.060> or<00:02:32.210> compound<00:02:32.360> exhibits

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
element or compound exhibits

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.550 
element or compound exhibits
paramagnetic<00:02:34.100> properties<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.870> iron<00:02:36.170> cobalt

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
paramagnetic properties so iron cobalt

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.420 
paramagnetic properties so iron cobalt
and<00:02:36.860> nickel<00:02:36.920> which<00:02:37.820> are<00:02:38.060> located<00:02:39.220> here<00:02:40.220> here

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
and nickel which are located here here

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.910 
and nickel which are located here here
and<00:02:41.120> here

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
and here

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.810 
and here
these<00:02:42.920> guys<00:02:43.160> are<00:02:43.460> what<00:02:43.580> we<00:02:43.670> call

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
these guys are what we call

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.450 
these guys are what we call
ferromagnetic<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:45.320> they<00:02:45.500> form<00:02:45.890> permanent

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
ferromagnetic so they form permanent

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.340 
ferromagnetic so they form permanent
magnets<00:02:46.850> so<00:02:47.180> they're<00:02:47.540> unpaired<00:02:47.930> electrons

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
magnets so they're unpaired electrons

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.640 
magnets so they're unpaired electrons
kind<00:02:48.980> of<00:02:49.070> line<00:02:49.280> up<00:02:49.460> in<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.300> pole<00:02:50.570> when<00:02:51.080> they<00:02:51.410> come

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
kind of line up in a pole when they come

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.500 
kind of line up in a pole when they come
in<00:02:51.770> contact<00:02:51.980> with<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.370> magnetic<00:02:52.970> field<00:02:53.240> and

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
in contact with a magnetic field and

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.020 
in contact with a magnetic field and
they<00:02:54.110> remain<00:02:54.530> in<00:02:54.830> that<00:02:54.920> formation<00:02:55.670> which

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
they remain in that formation which

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.080 
they remain in that formation which
causes<00:02:56.450> them<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.660> form<00:02:57.050> a<00:02:57.140> permanent<00:02:57.590> magnet

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
causes them to form a permanent magnet

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.580 
causes them to form a permanent magnet
so<00:02:59.090> just<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.480> little<00:02:59.720> bit<00:02:59.840> then<00:03:00.020> about<00:03:00.230> the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
so just a little bit then about the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.110 
so just a little bit then about the
inner<00:03:00.860> transition<00:03:01.400> metals<00:03:01.640> which<00:03:01.910> are<00:03:02.030> the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
inner transition metals which are the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.240 
inner transition metals which are the
guys<00:03:02.300> located<00:03:02.840> at<00:03:02.960> the<00:03:03.080> bottom<00:03:03.380> that<00:03:03.560> have<00:03:04.100> the

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
guys located at the bottom that have the

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.460 
guys located at the bottom that have the
two<00:03:04.460> periods<00:03:04.940> period<00:03:05.480> six<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:06.020> lanthanide

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
two periods period six the lanthanide

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.440 
two periods period six the lanthanide
series<00:03:06.500> in<00:03:07.130> period<00:03:07.520> seven<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:08.000> actinide

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
series in period seven the actinide

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.260 
series in period seven the actinide
series<00:03:08.830> so<00:03:09.830> with<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.220> lanthanides<00:03:10.670> there's

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
series so with the lanthanides there's

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.540 
series so with the lanthanides there's
little<00:03:11.630> variation<00:03:12.140> in<00:03:12.290> properties<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:13.040> in

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
little variation in properties and in

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.520 
little variation in properties and in
nature<00:03:13.940> they're<00:03:14.330> kind<00:03:14.570> of<00:03:14.660> all<00:03:14.930> mixed

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
nature they're kind of all mixed

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.050 
nature they're kind of all mixed
together<00:03:15.800> and<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:16.370> they're<00:03:16.520> difficult<00:03:16.700> to

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
together and so they're difficult to

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.640 
together and so they're difficult to
separate<00:03:17.450> so<00:03:17.750> we<00:03:17.900> don't<00:03:18.050> talk<00:03:18.230> about<00:03:18.380> them

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
separate so we don't talk about them

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.280 
separate so we don't talk about them
very<00:03:18.890> much<00:03:19.450> then<00:03:20.450> we<00:03:20.540> have<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.810> actinides

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
very much then we have the actinides

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.350 
very much then we have the actinides
which<00:03:21.560> are<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.770> period<00:03:22.100> sevens<00:03:22.459> located<00:03:23.270> at

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
which are the period sevens located at

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.850 
which are the period sevens located at
the<00:03:23.450> very<00:03:23.570> bottom<00:03:23.810> of<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.200> periodic<00:03:24.440> table

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
the very bottom of the periodic table

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.340 
the very bottom of the periodic table
and<00:03:25.040> these<00:03:25.550> are<00:03:25.880> your<00:03:26.030> radioactive<00:03:26.840> elements

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
and these are your radioactive elements

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.199 
and these are your radioactive elements
and<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:28.070> only<00:03:28.340> three<00:03:28.730> of<00:03:28.820> them<00:03:29.000> actually

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
and so only three of them actually

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.229 
and so only three of them actually
exists<00:03:30.080> in<00:03:30.170> nature<00:03:30.410> and<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.700> others<00:03:31.970> are<00:03:32.209> all

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
exists in nature and the others are all

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.720 
exists in nature and the others are all
synthetic<00:03:33.110> and<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.800> synthetic<00:03:34.010> ones<00:03:34.280> are

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
synthetic and so the synthetic ones are

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.960 
synthetic and so the synthetic ones are
starting<00:03:35.390> here<00:03:35.930> at<00:03:36.890> uranium<00:03:37.370> which<00:03:37.580> is<00:03:37.700> atomic

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
starting here at uranium which is atomic

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.440 
starting here at uranium which is atomic
number<00:03:38.420> 92<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:39.410> so<00:03:40.010> we<00:03:40.489> call<00:03:40.670> those<00:03:40.910> guys<00:03:40.940> from

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
number 92 and so we call those guys from

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.170 
number 92 and so we call those guys from
uranium<00:03:41.810> on<00:03:42.170> to<00:03:42.830> the<00:03:42.950> end<00:03:43.100> they're<00:03:43.790> trans

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
uranium on to the end they're trans

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.150 
uranium on to the end they're trans
uranium<00:03:44.660> series<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:45.709> those<00:03:45.890> are<00:03:45.920> all<00:03:46.070> the

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
uranium series and so those are all the

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.090 
uranium series and so those are all the
guys<00:03:46.400> with<00:03:46.640> atomic<00:03:46.910> number<00:03:47.300> greater<00:03:47.930> than<00:03:48.110> 92

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
guys with atomic number greater than 92

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.390 
guys with atomic number greater than 92
all<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.820> ones<00:03:50.000> that<00:03:50.180> have<00:03:50.300> to<00:03:50.330> be<00:03:50.480> created<00:03:50.720> in

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
all the ones that have to be created in

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.680 
all the ones that have to be created in
particle<00:03:52.400> accelerators<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.239> things<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.660> that

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
particle accelerators and things of that

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.979 
particle accelerators and things of that
