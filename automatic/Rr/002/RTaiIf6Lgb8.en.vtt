00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.079
 mates and mates 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:11.570
 and this is a complete program is a 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.370
 complete program that is nietita state 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.689
 with the question of how the matÃ­ is how 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:20.180
 Does mate as is mate 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:22.580
 the mate is an excellent digestive ok 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.260
 when you take mate take what you're 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.810
 doing is allowing your body 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.100
 that digests all foods better 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.100
 apart from being an antioxidant 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.330
 the mate allows you degreaser 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.330
 basically good because in fat and 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:46.070
 you know that this 'rating' of the body you 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.040
 you take it off the fat he hears and you 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.170
 Feel you go and do not tell me anymore because look 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.360
 that all the people who help you 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.940
 I already claimed that it is another as the 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:01.040
 quesito and they told me then the 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.970
 gaucho took mate and there was the 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.660
 tradition there he 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.220
 if mate is more mate mate mate 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.150
 it is this that is here that is here 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.150
 it's called light bulb 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.230
 so that the herbs do not pass 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.230
 exactly then you are going to put here 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.600
 the grass this grass 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.940
 I'm going to quickly put the mashed potatoes in my pan 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.210
 of carrot that is already the only 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.790
 missing add is 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.240
 butter a teaspoon that we have 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.369
 today and the herbs 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.369
 of smell and now yes 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:51.280
 but you're going to take it as if to get 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.409
 leave the feeling that what is 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.200
 empty because the herbs then swells 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.780
 when it goes when it goes down when it's going 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.610
 by throwing the hot water the grass leaves 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.860
 swelling getting stained and it 's the place that 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.030
 is passive and what must have been cheated 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.580
 cheat is everything 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.429
 there they were created space as empty 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.739
 and then we can say that that is the 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.080
 measured to the act the grass is dry and 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.920
 Now when you pour the hot water 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.420
 forward you will be able to take the first 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.120
 mate let's be a little bit more because 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.250
 still still the first mate they say 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.080
 let it dry be matted from the egg to see 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.430
 when on Tuesday the world of mate is 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.860
 a social issue is taken in 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.450
 South America more than anything for the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.340
 moments of family reunion when 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.410
 you are studying with friends and the first 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.800
 mate when you prepare a mate it is said that 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.720
 It's the bobo mate because it's what 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.310
 the one that is coldest actually still 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.260
 it did not really heat up but you're 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.330
 pouring hot water now but first 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.210
 It is poured with a little cold water to 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.210
 let the grass sit cold water 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.040
 but the first one the first one gets 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.340
 cold water for the grass to settle and 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.800
 then you are pouring hot water 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.870
 but station is sitting every line that 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.940
 has seen exactly this 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.360
 sitting there is sitting yesterday with the 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.610
 villa and then now we can now 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.120
 you're going to nail the bulb until 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.670
 this is never ready now you make a 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.739
 hole to declare the bulb and 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.840
 when you're baiting that you're going with a 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.209
 thermos the water has to go running 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.470
 by the light bulb is you never throw it 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.569
 directly because if the done 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.239
 directly you're going the mate is 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.299
 say that already a demonstration that does not 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.620
 it's hot well then even what 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.980
 can tilt because I do not have a thermos 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.720
 then there's there you see there I go jal 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.790
 carrying against the optense bulb 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.490
 when the bulb and already then I take 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.010
 the first mate seattle exposed badly 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.690
 touch without touching the straw because it does not 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.300
 knows mate who does not know about mate 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.800
 I showed off the pot and that's how I went 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.810
 Stirs like the handle of the car nolan 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.260
 the straw does not touch the one who knows about mate 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.880
 does not touch the boots and there enters the tuta 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.170
 exactly but you have to take everything 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.240
 until every noise 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.610
 there you can pass the bat to the one who is 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.840
 baiting because if the other does not make noise 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.730
 is going to take your dribble then you have 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.340
 to make noise because if they do not serve us 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.049
 it works there to be if it does not make noise in 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.930
 others will not win the mate because 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:25.050
 you are going to go take it well remnant 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.550
 and it's something social that is taken between 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.720
 you guys because you're drinking mate 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.280
 told the world on the street you can 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.080
 imagine not everyone is putting 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:36.200
 the mouth and where you put it then with 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.639
 this we go to the following information 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.400
 This guy was very interesting 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.470
 stable migrant and already after taking the 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.080
 second the second perfect I love 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.600
 he mate his greeting for our son tito 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.930
 and that a chef is far away if you have to bring 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.930
 one day
