 resolutions below the HDD is fine. 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.720
 highest 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.430
 We are showing here on the map that 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.430
 has an inner part of the outside 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:26.190
 How's gameplay going? 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:29.780
 we saw that it is around 55 in 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:34.819
 heavier maps like shine a light 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.819
 fell a little bit fpf that in the range of 40 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:45.299
 who want to play with the Castilla and 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.889
 medium with graphic quality is a 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.510
 cheaper machine we are 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.400
 considering that it is a brand I came with a 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.389
 most affordable price is not a 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.310
 video powerful bitch but who wants 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:59.569
 have a machine to have fun at home 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:03.060
 It's great, love. 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.410
 You do not have to have a two thousand cat. 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.780
 more for a video card 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.790
 more powerful a stronger set if 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.060
 with this machine you already play 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.459
 It was very good we are showing 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.750
 here I think twice the environment 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.459
 internal but we will if you can 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.269
 make a species not only to show 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.269
 once for the guys 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:37.560
 as I mentioned before , 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:40.860
 50 feet all high on 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.530
 if you will play on other maps it will 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:56.789
 to range between 40 and 50 people 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:05:04.229
 tested here how to get there for 24 years and 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:06.180
 People are making several videos today that 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.330
 the server changed the map was playing 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:13.199
 a little more I arrived but the can 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.270
 buy legal that brand to play will not 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:30.050
 if it bothers you, she will not be calm 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:30.050
 ok 40 50 and 60 but totally positive 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:44.090
 When I come back with the result the 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.090
 friends and kills an hour that appears 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:56.099
 remembering that if you are to play others 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:58.440
 games like csn on fire eooo face de 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.300
 Good, relax, give it to the three of us. 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.830

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:07.590
 graphic quality that the average Portuguese 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:13.120

 You guys are going to try to show here. 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:28.240
 both side and closed 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:30.490
 Why does this side cover have to go? 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.410
 then the plastic is an acrylic 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.080
 blue that you can see after the 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.150
