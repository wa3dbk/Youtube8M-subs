another<00:01:53.909> change<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.329> want<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.630> talk<00:01:54.840> about<00:01:54.990> is

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
another change I want to talk about is

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.109 
another change I want to talk about is
the<00:01:55.439> phone<00:01:55.649> pricing<00:01:56.219> structure<00:01:56.640> because<00:01:56.909> that

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
the phone pricing structure because that

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.459 
the phone pricing structure because that
looks<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.540> it's<00:01:57.750> changing<00:01:58.170> as<00:01:58.259> well

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
looks like it's changing as well

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.350 
looks like it's changing as well
typically<00:01:59.369> when<00:01:59.490> you're<00:01:59.640> under<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> contract

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
you get a good deal on a phone because

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.469 
you get a good deal on a phone because
you're<00:02:02.280> locked<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.759> with<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.060> carrier

you're locked in with that carrier

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.719 
you're locked in with that carrier

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
unless you break your contract since

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.340 
unless you break your contract since
you're<00:02:05.909> not<00:02:06.090> under<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> contract<00:02:06.930> with<00:02:07.140> tmobile
