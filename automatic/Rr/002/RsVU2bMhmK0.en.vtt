00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
announced it

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.539 
announced it
this<00:01:24.540> being<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> Apple<00:01:25.200> watch<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.009> an<00:01:26.220> event

this being the Apple watch and an event

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.850 
this being the Apple watch and an event
like<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.210> but<00:01:27.750> those<00:01:27.900> Hollywood<00:01:28.110> guys<00:01:28.350> just

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
like this but those Hollywood guys just

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.340 
like this but those Hollywood guys just
would've<00:01:29.070> leaked<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.369> anyway<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.350> celebrities

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
would've leaked it anyway so celebrities

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.690 
would've leaked it anyway so celebrities
were<00:01:31.470> involved<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> Apple<00:01:32.159> launch<00:01:32.310> perhaps

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
were involved the Apple launch perhaps

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.390 
were involved the Apple launch perhaps
that's<00:01:32.939> why<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.180> was<00:01:33.360> announced<00:01:33.810> way<00:01:34.140> early<00:01:34.710> so

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
that's why it was announced way early so

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.230 
that's why it was announced way early so
I<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.490> not<00:01:35.640> think<00:01:35.759> it's<00:01:35.909> gonna<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.119> another

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
I do not think it's gonna be another

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.840 
I do not think it's gonna be another
