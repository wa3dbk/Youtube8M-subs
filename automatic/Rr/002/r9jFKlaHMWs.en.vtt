00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and Nathan Harris right now you'd have

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.780 
and Nathan Harris right now you'd have
to<00:01:51.149> say<00:01:51.390> cottman<00:01:52.320> would<00:01:52.439> be<00:01:52.590> ahead<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:53.009> Nathan

Harris<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.149> pecking<00:01:54.360> order<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.110> think

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
Harris in the pecking order so I think

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.590 
Harris in the pecking order so I think
he<00:01:55.619> will<00:01:55.799> get<00:01:55.920> test<00:01:56.159> match<00:01:56.340> time<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.790> June<00:01:57.390> and

been key for them and that's why they're

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.640 
been key for them and that's why they're
going<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.239> well<00:03:00.419> they've<00:03:00.780> been<00:03:00.900> known<00:03:01.109> to<00:03:01.169> fade

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
going so well they've been known to fade

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.589 
going so well they've been known to fade
towards<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.489> playoffs<00:03:02.909> what<00:03:03.359> do<00:03:03.419> you<00:03:03.450> think

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
towards the playoffs what do you think

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:04.909 
towards the playoffs what do you think
they<00:03:03.689> need<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.049> do<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.290> ensure<00:03:04.709> that<00:03:04.829> that

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:04.919 
they need to do to ensure that that

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:06.170 
they need to do to ensure that that
doesn't<00:03:05.129> happen<00:03:05.250> well<00:03:05.669> that's<00:03:05.819> all<00:03:05.969> that's

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
doesn't happen well that's all that's

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.059 
doesn't happen well that's all that's
about<00:03:06.359> depth<00:03:06.840> normally<00:03:07.349> we<00:03:07.530> would<00:03:07.709> get<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:07.950> the

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
about depth normally we would get to the

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.649 
about depth normally we would get to the
stage<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.519> season<00:03:08.700> we've<00:03:09.000> had<00:03:09.180> seven<00:03:09.480> or

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
eight injuries and we haven't got enough

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.649 
eight injuries and we haven't got enough
depth<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.669> the<00:03:11.700> Highlanders<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.299> be<00:03:12.389> able<00:03:12.480> to

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
depth and the Highlanders to be able to

have enough of those good players coming
through<00:03:14.780> right<00:03:15.780> now<00:03:15.840> we<00:03:16.169> struggled<00:03:16.859> a<00:03:16.919> bit<00:03:16.950> in

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
through right now we struggled a bit in

the second half against the the lines on
Saturday<00:03:21.000> band<00:03:21.239> that<00:03:21.389> was<00:03:21.510> probably<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.989> depth

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
Saturday band that was probably a depth

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.780

we had a cup through three out with
injury<00:03:25.769> I<00:03:25.979> think<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.430> few<00:03:26.489> of<00:03:26.609> those<00:03:26.699> players

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
injury I think a few of those players

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.789

this<00:03:33.870> year's<00:03:34.139> Super<00:03:34.500> Rugby<00:03:34.799> campaign<00:03:35.189> look<00:03:35.909> I

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
this year's Super Rugby campaign look I

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.659 
this year's Super Rugby campaign look I
love<00:03:36.510> us<00:03:36.689> to<00:03:36.870> make<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.169> playoffs<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.769> don't

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
love us to make the playoffs I don't

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.929 
love us to make the playoffs I don't
know<00:03:38.879> if<00:03:39.030> we<00:03:39.209> will<00:03:39.389> I<00:03:40.109> think<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.889> I<00:03:41.189> think<00:03:41.819> the

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:41.939 
know if we will I think the I think the

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.819 
know if we will I think the I think the
way<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.239> Crusaders<00:03:42.870> are<00:03:42.900> going<00:03:43.319> they'll<00:03:43.590> go

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
way the Crusaders are going they'll go

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.710 
way the Crusaders are going they'll go
in<00:03:43.889> as<00:03:44.069> favourites<00:03:44.099> to<00:03:44.759> to<00:03:45.180> make<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:45.449> playoffs

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
in as favourites to to make the playoffs

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.629 
in as favourites to to make the playoffs
I<00:03:45.840> think<00:03:46.049> there'll<00:03:46.229> be<00:03:46.259> a<00:03:46.379> number<00:03:46.650> one<00:03:46.769> side<00:03:47.159> if

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
I think there'll be a number one side if

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.369 
I think there'll be a number one side if
the<00:03:47.879> Crusaders<00:03:48.389> go<00:03:48.599> through<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.019> number<00:03:49.229> one

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
the Crusaders go through the number one

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.909 
the Crusaders go through the number one
side<00:03:49.849> it'll<00:03:50.849> be<00:03:50.939> between<00:03:51.319> obviously<00:03:52.319> now<00:03:52.500> the

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
side it'll be between obviously now the

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.069 
side it'll be between obviously now the
Hurricanes<00:03:53.189> the<00:03:54.060> Chiefs<00:03:54.479> and<00:03:54.780> the

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
Hurricanes the Chiefs and the

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.379 
Hurricanes the Chiefs and the
Highlanders<00:03:55.739> for<00:03:55.889> that<00:03:55.979> next<00:03:56.159> spot<00:03:56.459> look<00:03:57.209> I

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
Highlanders for that next spot look I

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.149 
Highlanders for that next spot look I
really<00:03:57.599> hope<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:57.989> Huracan<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.769> Highlanders

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
really hope the Huracan the Highlanders

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.679 
really hope the Huracan the Highlanders
make<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.459> place<00:03:59.669> I<00:03:59.849> don't<00:04:00.150> see<00:04:00.389> them<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:00.629> only

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
further than that they're probably

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.159 
further than that they're probably
