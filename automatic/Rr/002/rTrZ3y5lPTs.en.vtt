00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
 chapter 10 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.550
 Truly I tell you, the one who does not enter through the door into the fold of 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.019
 sheep but climbs on the other hand that is a thief and robber 

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:13.710
 plus the one who enters through the door 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.879
 the shepherd of the sheep is 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.510
 to this one opens the doorman and the sheep hear added 2 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.489
 He calls his sheep by name and takes it out 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.130
 and when he has taken out all his own 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.680
 go ahead of them 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.789
 and the sheep follow him because they know his 'box' 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.820
 massa missed him they will not follow 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.730
 if there were no because they do not know the voice of strangers 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.910
 this allegory Jesus told them but they did not understand what it was that 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.130
 He said 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.300
 Jesus returned to tell them 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.310
 desert deserts 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.750
 I am the door of the sheep 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.970
 all those who came before me thieves are and robbers 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.410
 but I'm not 'they hurt the sheep 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.900
 I am the door 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.730
 who for as long as he will be saved and will enter and leave already yara pastures 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.350
 the thief comes only to abort and kill and destroy 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.159
 I have come for you to have life 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.790
 and so that they have it in abundance 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.510
 I am the good shepherd 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.510
 the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.840
 plus the salaried employee and who is not the pastor 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.010
 whose sheep are not their own 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.710
 must go to the wolf and leave the sheep and run away 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.630
 and the back snatches the sheep and scatters them 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.659
 so the wage earner flees 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.110
 because he is a salaried worker and does not care about sheep 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.570
 and I am the good shepherd and I know my sheep and the girls know me as well as 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.539
 the father knows me and I know the father and I put my life for the sheep 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.210
 I also have other sheep that are not from this fold 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.450
 those I must also bring and I will be alive 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.799
 and there will be a flock and a shepherd that's why my father loves me because I put my life 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.540
 to take it again 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.710
 nobody takes it from me but I put it myself 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.360
 I have power to put it and I have power to take it again 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.790
 this commandment I received from my father 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.040
 He again saw dissension among the Jews for these words 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:12.850
 many of them said 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.010
 demon has and is out of his mind because lewis 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:19.999
 others said these words are not forgetful 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.879
 can the devil open the eyes of the blind 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:28.049
 celebrates more in Jerusalem the feast of dedication 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.889
 it was winter and jesus walked in the temple through the portico of Solomon 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.179
 and the Jews surrounded him and told him 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:37.289
 even when you turn your soul 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:40.589
 if you are the christ, tell us openly 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:44.049
 Jesus answered them I told you and you do not believe 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.349
 the works that I do in my father's name they give testimony of me 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.910
 but you would not believe 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.909
 because it's not just from my sheep as has been said 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.709
 my sheep alive today 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.569
 and I know them and they follow me 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.370
 and I give them eternal life 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.870
 and they will never perish and no one will snatch them out of my hand 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.030
 my father who gave them to me is greater than all and nobody can take them from the 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:08.609
 my father's hand 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.979
 me and the father one are 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:14.269
 then the Jews again took stones to stone Lee 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.479
 Jesus answered them 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.429
 many good works or shown of my father 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:21.769
 which one should be stoned 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.519
 the Jews answered by saying good deeds do not stone you but by 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:27.390
 blasphemy 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.349
 because you being a man you become god 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.219
 Jesus replied 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:34.289
 it is not written in your law 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:36.729
 and I said god that I did 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:40.999
 if I call gods those who came to the word of God and writing 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:42.849
 it can not be broken 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.390
 whom the father sanctified and sent to the world you say 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.769
 You see issues because I said son of God today 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.970
 If I do not do my father's works, do not believe me anymore and I'll do them 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.840
 even if you do not believe me amin believe the works so that he knows and if he believes is that 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.809
 the father is in me and I in the father 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:03.700
 they tried another to let go 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.179
 but he escaped from his hands 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:10.269
 and he went again to the other side of the Jordan to the place where he had first 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.629
 been baptizing john and he stayed there 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.699
 and many came to him and said 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:20.590
 Juan the truth, no sign was made but all Juan said about it was 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.650
 true 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.480
 and many believed in the year
