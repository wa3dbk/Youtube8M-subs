00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
one and I'm kind of playing around with

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.690 
one and I'm kind of playing around with
it<00:01:40.110> because<00:01:40.229> as<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.890> know<00:01:41.100> from<00:01:41.460> previous

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
it because as you know from previous

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.480 
it because as you know from previous
times<00:01:42.300> have<00:01:43.020> not<00:01:43.320> had<00:01:43.530> good<00:01:43.830> experience<00:01:44.340> which

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
role in my hair I did decide to roll my

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.960 
role in my hair I did decide to roll my
hair<00:01:48.270> dry<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:49.680> from<00:01:49.979> advice<00:01:50.430> from<00:01:50.700> other

hair dry just from advice from other

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.090 
hair dry just from advice from other
people<00:01:51.390> from<00:01:51.510> the<00:01:51.690> last<00:01:52.020> time<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.560> rolled<00:01:52.979> my

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
people from the last time I rolled my

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.539 
people from the last time I rolled my
hair<00:01:53.360> damp<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:55.020> took<00:01:55.260> forever<00:01:55.530> for<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.280> dry

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
hair damp it took forever for it to dry

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.060 
hair damp it took forever for it to dry
and<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.360> why<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.570> chose<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.229> roll<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.740> dry

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
and that is why I chose to roll it dry

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.310 
and that is why I chose to roll it dry
this<00:01:59.130> time<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.909> reduce<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.479> amount<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.869> time<00:02:01.110> I

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
this time to reduce the amount of time I

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:12.850 
this time to reduce the amount of time I
have<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.590> spend<00:02:01.860> under<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.369> rollers

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.560 

now<00:02:13.860> ruling<00:02:14.190> my<00:02:14.490> hair<00:02:14.820> was<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> little<00:02:15.450> bit

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
now ruling my hair was a little bit

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.960 
now ruling my hair was a little bit
difficult<00:02:15.840> for<00:02:16.170> me<00:02:16.350> just<00:02:16.950> because<00:02:17.340> this

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
difficult for me just because this

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.970 
difficult for me just because this
rollers<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.870> way<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.050> little<00:02:19.170> bit<00:02:19.320> harder<00:02:19.950> to

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
rollers the way a little bit harder to

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.520 
rollers the way a little bit harder to
manipulate<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.150> can<00:02:21.390> see<00:02:21.690> me<00:02:21.900> rolling<00:02:22.380> in

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
manipulate so you can see me rolling in

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.010 
manipulate so you can see me rolling in
the<00:02:22.680> opposite<00:02:23.190> direction<00:02:23.580> this<00:02:24.000> time<00:02:24.360> just

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
the opposite direction this time just

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.930 
the opposite direction this time just
because<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.440> found<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.830> much<00:02:26.070> more<00:02:26.280> easier<00:02:26.760> to

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
because I found it much more easier to

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.330 
because I found it much more easier to
roll<00:02:27.120> my<00:02:27.360> hair<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.380> crown<00:02:28.650> area<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:29.190> my

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
roll my hair in the crown area of my

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.140 
roll my hair in the crown area of my
head<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.880> way<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:35.310> after<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.640> was<00:02:35.820> done<00:02:36.090> with

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
head that way so after I was done with

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.770 
head that way so after I was done with
this<00:02:36.600> section<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.440> moved<00:02:37.860> on<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.160> my<00:02:39.030> right<00:02:39.450> side

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
this section I moved on to my right side

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.410 
this section I moved on to my right side
of<00:02:39.840> my<00:02:39.990> hair<00:02:40.590> using<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.310> smaller<00:02:41.790> rollers

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
of my hair using the smaller rollers

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.020 
of my hair using the smaller rollers
with<00:02:43.050> those<00:02:43.320> rollers<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.100> was<00:02:44.400> easier<00:02:44.790> for<00:02:44.820> me

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
with those rollers it was easier for me

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.480 
with those rollers it was easier for me
to<00:02:45.300> roll<00:02:45.540> upwards<00:02:46.410> towards<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.160> ceiling

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
to roll upwards towards the ceiling

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.880 
to roll upwards towards the ceiling

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.820 
on the dryer and I sat on a dryer for 20
minutes<00:03:10.850> so<00:03:11.850> when<00:03:12.120> my<00:03:12.330> hair<00:03:12.630> was<00:03:12.660> done<00:03:13.230> drying

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
minutes so when my hair was done drying

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.400 
minutes so when my hair was done drying
it<00:03:14.220> dried<00:03:14.520> really<00:03:15.030> quickly<00:03:15.510> unlike<00:03:15.960> the<00:03:16.140> last

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
it dried really quickly unlike the last

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.950 
it dried really quickly unlike the last
time<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:17.430> didn't<00:03:17.760> dry<00:03:17.910> quickly<00:03:18.240> you<00:03:18.510> can<00:03:18.720> see

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
time it didn't dry quickly you can see

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.950 
time it didn't dry quickly you can see
how<00:03:19.110> smooth<00:03:19.470> my<00:03:19.710> hair<00:03:20.040> was<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:21.120> just<00:03:21.390> really

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
how smooth my hair was and I just really

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.930 
how smooth my hair was and I just really
liked<00:03:22.320> how<00:03:22.590> smooth<00:03:22.920> my<00:03:22.950> hair<00:03:23.100> was<00:03:23.550> at<00:03:23.760> this

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
liked how smooth my hair was at this

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.180 
liked how smooth my hair was at this
point<00:03:24.270> I<00:03:24.600> actually<00:03:24.690> wanted<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.320> stop<00:03:25.740> at<00:03:26.010> this

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
point I actually wanted to stop at this

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.240 
point I actually wanted to stop at this
point<00:03:26.360> but<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.660> conclude<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.350> experiment<00:03:29.070> I

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
point but to conclude this experiment I

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.610 
point but to conclude this experiment I
knew<00:03:29.490> I<00:03:29.520> had<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.060> go<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.750> next<00:03:30.990> step<00:03:31.320> which

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
knew I had to go to the next step which

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.330 
knew I had to go to the next step which
was<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.760> use<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.180> saran<00:03:33.540> wrap<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.950> root<00:03:35.160> of

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
was to use the saran wrap so the root of

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.790 
was to use the saran wrap so the root of
my<00:03:35.520> hair<00:03:35.550> was<00:03:36.030> not<00:03:36.060> as<00:03:36.780> straight<00:03:37.170> but<00:03:37.560> that's

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
my hair was not as straight but that's

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.580 
my hair was not as straight but that's
okay<00:03:38.310> because<00:03:38.880> we<00:03:39.540> hope<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.960> saran<00:03:40.350> wrap

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
okay because we hope the saran wrap

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.490 
okay because we hope the saran wrap
would<00:03:40.830> do<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.130> job<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:42.240> issue<00:03:42.540> I<00:03:42.900> had<00:03:43.200> with

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
would do the job the issue I had with

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.470 
would do the job the issue I had with
this<00:03:43.740> light<00:03:44.160> pan<00:03:44.640> was<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.240> it<00:03:45.300> was

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
this light pan was that it was

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.320 
this light pan was that it was
constantly<00:03:46.020> getting<00:03:46.320> cut<00:03:46.740> in<00:03:46.920> my<00:03:47.250> hair<00:03:47.610> which

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
constantly getting cut in my hair which

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.740 
constantly getting cut in my hair which
I<00:03:48.510> didn't<00:03:49.050> like<00:03:49.290> at<00:03:49.500> all

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.690 

so<00:03:54.750> this<00:03:54.900> is<00:03:55.080> what<00:03:55.260> my<00:03:55.440> hair<00:03:55.740> looks<00:03:56.040> like<00:03:56.160> after

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
so this is what my hair looks like after

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.400 
so this is what my hair looks like after
I<00:03:56.880> took<00:03:57.090> out<00:03:57.240> the<00:03:57.360> role<00:03:57.600> as<00:03:57.780> you<00:03:57.870> can<00:03:58.050> see<00:03:58.230> it's

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
I took out the role as you can see it's

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.940 
I took out the role as you can see it's
pretty<00:03:58.770> much<00:03:58.950> straight<00:03:59.450> but<00:04:00.830> let's<00:04:01.830> move<00:04:02.100> on

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
natural hair no straighten boy - just a

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.450 
natural hair no straighten boy - just a
lot<00:04:33.540> of<00:04:33.690> hair<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:34.080> walk<00:04:34.350> with<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:35.040> I<00:04:35.340> was

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
lot of hair to walk with and I was

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:59.809 
lot of hair to walk with and I was
trying<00:04:35.790> not<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:36.000> use<00:04:36.150> a<00:04:36.240> brush

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:03.210 

so<00:05:00.819> after<00:05:01.210> struggling<00:05:01.630> with<00:05:01.930> wrapping<00:05:02.860> up<00:05:03.009> my

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
so after struggling with wrapping up my

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.270 
so after struggling with wrapping up my
hair<00:05:03.639> I<00:05:03.970> proceeded<00:05:04.870> choosing<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.590> saran<00:05:06.009> wrap

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
hair I proceeded choosing the saran wrap

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.350 
hair I proceeded choosing the saran wrap
just<00:05:06.699> to<00:05:06.910> wrap<00:05:07.180> all<00:05:07.840> my<00:05:08.319> hair<00:05:08.710> and<00:05:08.979> it<00:05:09.880> was<00:05:10.120> even

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
just to wrap all my hair and it was even

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.120 
just to wrap all my hair and it was even
harder<00:05:10.780> to<00:05:10.960> put<00:05:11.169> the<00:05:11.259> saran<00:05:11.500> wrap<00:05:11.740> because<00:05:11.889> he

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
harder to put the saran wrap because he

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.270 
harder to put the saran wrap because he
kept<00:05:12.370> on<00:05:12.550> slipping<00:05:13.150> off<00:05:13.330> and<00:05:13.660> at<00:05:14.530> this<00:05:14.710> point<00:05:15.039> I

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
kept on slipping off and at this point I

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.129 
kept on slipping off and at this point I
was<00:05:15.430> nearly<00:05:15.699> gonna<00:05:16.030> give<00:05:16.300> up<00:05:16.479> but<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:16.720> decided

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
was nearly gonna give up but I decided

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.080 
was nearly gonna give up but I decided
not<00:05:17.560> to<00:05:19.889> so<00:05:20.889> I<00:05:20.949> started<00:05:21.250> really<00:05:21.400> dry<00:05:21.729> for

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
not to so I started really dry for

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.230 
not to so I started really dry for
another<00:05:22.330> 15<00:05:22.750> minutes<00:05:22.780> and<00:05:23.319> afterwards<00:05:24.240> my

versus<00:05:44.050> when<00:05:44.289> I<00:05:44.319> first<00:05:44.770> took<00:05:44.949> it<00:05:45.069> out<00:05:45.250> of<00:05:45.430> the

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
versus when I first took it out of the

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.790 
versus when I first took it out of the
rollers<00:05:46.060> out<00:05:46.300> of<00:05:46.690> the<00:05:46.840> rollers<00:05:47.199> it<00:05:47.349> did<00:05:47.500> feel

rollers out of the rollers it did feel

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.339 
rollers out of the rollers it did feel
smoother<00:05:48.310> but<00:05:48.970> after<00:05:49.240> I<00:05:49.300> sat<00:05:49.659> under<00:05:49.960> the<00:05:50.080> dryer

smoother but after I sat under the dryer
I<00:05:50.710> think<00:05:50.949> just<00:05:51.220> the<00:05:51.430> sweatiness<00:05:52.240> and

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630
