better<00:01:59.490> handling<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.329> actually<00:02:00.420> think<00:02:00.600> it

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
better handling and I actually think it

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.859 
better handling and I actually think it
looks<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.960> lot<00:02:01.079> better<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:02.490> um<00:02:02.729> let's<00:02:03.540> get<00:02:03.659> into

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
performance coding is I think I heard

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.550 
performance coding is I think I heard
Laura<00:03:19.150> said<00:03:19.389> Marie<00:03:19.599> says<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:20.169> is<00:03:20.290> like<00:03:20.440> the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
Laura said Marie says it is like the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.129 
Laura said Marie says it is like the
magic<00:03:20.709> finish<00:03:21.190> or<00:03:21.340> something<00:03:21.870> either<00:03:22.870> way<00:03:23.109> I

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
magic finish or something either way I

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.420 
magic finish or something either way I
think<00:03:23.349> it<00:03:23.560> feels<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.799> lot<00:03:23.919> better<00:03:24.069> than<00:03:24.310> air

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
think it feels a lot better than air

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.920 
think it feels a lot better than air

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
look real good especially with some

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.500 
look real good especially with some
design<00:06:03.160> they<00:06:03.340> have<00:06:03.370> around<00:06:03.760> the<00:06:03.880> edges<00:06:04.270> you

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
design they have around the edges you

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.230 
design they have around the edges you
get<00:06:05.260> a<00:06:05.289> little<00:06:05.590> bit<00:06:05.740> of<00:06:06.280> a<00:06:06.400> nicer<00:06:06.760> fan<00:06:07.030> because

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
get a little bit of a nicer fan because

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:15.150 
get a little bit of a nicer fan because
of<00:06:07.570> that<00:06:09.750> you<00:06:10.750> can<00:06:10.900> see<00:06:11.080> right<00:06:11.200> there<00:06:13.590> the<00:06:14.590> the

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
of that you can see right there the the

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.250 
of that you can see right there the the
stock<00:06:15.460> they<00:06:15.640> use<00:06:15.820> it's<00:06:16.360> a<00:06:16.539> little<00:06:16.720> bit<00:06:16.810> thinner

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260 
stock they use it's a little bit thinner

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.500 
stock they use it's a little bit thinner
it<00:06:17.650> feels<00:06:17.860> a<00:06:18.010> little<00:06:18.070> bit<00:06:18.280> flimsier<00:06:18.820> but<00:06:19.390> then

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
it feels a little bit flimsier but then

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.000 
it feels a little bit flimsier but then
again<00:06:19.600> that's<00:06:19.810> okay<00:06:20.229> that<00:06:20.440> makes<00:06:20.800> for

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
again that's okay that makes for

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.560 
again that's okay that makes for
actually<00:06:21.430> easier<00:06:21.820> double<00:06:22.120> lifts<00:06:22.360> in<00:06:22.450> my

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
actually easier double lifts in my

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.190 
actually easier double lifts in my
opinion<00:06:22.930> but<00:06:24.660> there's<00:06:25.660> advantages<00:06:26.080> and

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
opinion but there's advantages and

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.659 
opinion but there's advantages and
disadvantages<00:06:26.770> to<00:06:26.830> thinner<00:06:27.130> stock<00:06:27.460> it

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
disadvantages to thinner stock it

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:28.920 
disadvantages to thinner stock it
depending<00:06:28.120> on<00:06:28.180> what<00:06:28.330> you'd<00:06:28.450> like<00:06:28.479> I

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
personally like it you might not if so

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:32.909 
personally like it you might not if so
it's<00:06:31.660> not<00:06:31.750> this<00:06:31.900> not<00:06:32.140> maybe<00:06:32.380> that<00:06:32.470> not<00:06:32.680> your

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
much better than the black it just it's

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.689 
much better than the black it just it's
a<00:06:50.270> much<00:06:50.570> cleaner<00:06:50.900> and<00:06:51.229> the<00:06:52.130> black<00:06:52.340> is<00:06:52.490> a<00:06:52.520> little

good<00:07:13.580> job<00:07:13.639> with<00:07:13.850> this<00:07:14.090> deck<00:07:14.330> and<00:07:14.600> I<00:07:15.560> could<00:07:15.889> say

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.070 
good job with this deck and I could say

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.760 
good job with this deck and I could say
it's<00:07:16.250> definitely<00:07:16.520> one<00:07:16.880> of<00:07:16.910> my<00:07:17.000> favorite<00:07:17.389> decks

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:17.770 
it's definitely one of my favorite decks

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.050 
it's definitely one of my favorite decks
and<00:07:18.770> I<00:07:18.860> have<00:07:19.010> not<00:07:19.280> been<00:07:19.400> using<00:07:19.610> it<00:07:19.820> for<00:07:19.970> that

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.060 
and I have not been using it for that

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.390 
and I have not been using it for that
long<00:07:20.350> it<00:07:21.350> look<00:07:21.620> it<00:07:21.740> seems<00:07:21.979> like<00:07:22.160> it'd<00:07:22.280> be

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 
long it look it seems like it'd be

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.189 
long it look it seems like it'd be
pretty<00:07:22.550> durable<00:07:22.880> it<00:07:23.180> I<00:07:23.300> don't<00:07:23.840> think<00:07:23.930> this

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:24.199 
pretty durable it I don't think this

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:27.939 
pretty durable it I don't think this
deck<00:07:24.500> will<00:07:24.740> like<00:07:24.919> it<00:07:25.160> start<00:07:26.110> to<00:07:27.110> degrade<00:07:27.560> in

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:27.949 
deck will like it start to degrade in

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:29.680 
deck will like it start to degrade in
its<00:07:28.070> handling<00:07:28.340> capability<00:07:28.910> very<00:07:29.150> soon<00:07:29.449> I

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:29.690 
its handling capability very soon I

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.589 
its handling capability very soon I
think<00:07:30.320> it<00:07:30.680> will<00:07:30.770> be<00:07:30.860> very<00:07:31.070> good<00:07:31.160> and<00:07:31.910> it<00:07:32.479> should

00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:32.599 
think it will be very good and it should

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:34.480 
think it will be very good and it should
last<00:07:32.750> a<00:07:32.930> long<00:07:33.080> time<00:07:33.349> I'll<00:07:34.099> probably<00:07:34.220> get<00:07:34.430> a

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:34.490 
last a long time I'll probably get a

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.680 
last a long time I'll probably get a
couple<00:07:34.669> more<00:07:34.970> of<00:07:35.030> these<00:07:35.120> and<00:07:35.360> play<00:07:35.539> around

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:35.690 
couple more of these and play around

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.180 
couple more of these and play around
with<00:07:35.810> a<00:07:35.900> little<00:07:35.990> bit<00:07:36.110> more<00:07:36.349> and<00:07:36.590> if<00:07:36.949> need<00:07:37.160> be

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.190 
with a little bit more and if need be

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.920 
with a little bit more and if need be
like<00:07:37.580> a<00:07:37.669> second<00:07:38.060> review<00:07:38.300> on<00:07:38.389> this<00:07:38.570> or<00:07:38.810> I'll
