00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.810 

the<00:00:38.300> back<00:00:38.539> view<00:00:40.600> all<00:00:41.600> right<00:00:42.370> how<00:00:43.370> this<00:00:43.519> thing

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
the back view all right how this thing

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.790 
the back view all right how this thing
works<00:00:44.649> is<00:00:45.879> four<00:00:46.879> buttons<00:00:47.329> each<00:00:47.659> button<00:00:48.649> to

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
works is four buttons each button to

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:58.170 
works is four buttons each button to
make<00:00:48.920> a<00:00:48.979> different<00:00:49.489> sound<00:00:50.379> so

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:08.350

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.440 

I<00:01:08.830> think<00:01:09.830> that<00:01:09.980> was<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.280> power<00:01:10.670> rangers<00:01:10.820> theme
