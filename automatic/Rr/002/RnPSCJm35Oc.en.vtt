failures perfectly you know that's some
people<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.150> only<00:01:30.299> criteria<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:32.159> run

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
people that the only criteria is one run

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.940 
people that the only criteria is one run
on<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.759> hill<00:01:32.939> other<00:01:33.780> things<00:01:34.079> we've<00:01:34.290> done<00:01:34.530> put

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
on the hill other things we've done put

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.550 
on the hill other things we've done put
a<00:01:34.979> heavy-duty<00:01:35.280> radiator<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:36.180> her<00:01:36.329> she<00:01:37.320> didn't

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
a heavy-duty radiator in her she didn't

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.010 
a heavy-duty radiator in her she didn't
run<00:01:37.650> hot<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.549> factory<00:01:39.180> radiator<00:01:39.540> cracked

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
run hot but the factory radiator cracked

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.859 
run hot but the factory radiator cracked
so<00:01:40.409> i'm<00:01:40.560> not<00:01:40.710> quite<00:01:40.950> sure<00:01:41.009> why<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:41.939> that's

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
so i'm not quite sure why but that's

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.550 
so i'm not quite sure why but that's
basically<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.880> other<00:01:45.060> thing<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.630> i'm

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
basically it the other thing is i'm

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.399 
basically it the other thing is i'm
playing<00:01:46.890> with<00:01:47.009> another<00:01:47.220> little<00:01:47.700> kids<00:01:47.909> quad

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
something high-performance like this is

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.920 
something high-performance like this is
probably<00:01:53.579> where<00:01:53.759> I'm<00:01:53.850> more<00:01:54.030> suited<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.479> riding

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930
