be talking about how to take a regular
photo<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.260> make<00:00:11.070> it<00:00:11.219> look<00:00:11.400> like<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.969> was<00:00:12.210> taken

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
photo and make it look like it was taken

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:13.759 
photo and make it look like it was taken
as<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:12.990> Polaroid

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
as a Polaroid

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.289 
as a Polaroid
so<00:00:13.980> there<00:00:14.280> are<00:00:14.309> few<00:00:14.460> steps<00:00:14.700> for<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.240> I'll

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
so there are few steps for that and I'll

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.390 
so there are few steps for that and I'll
show<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.570> how<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.750> do<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.049> right<00:00:16.410> now<00:00:16.440> so

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
show you how to do this right now so

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.890 
show you how to do this right now so
here<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.699> are<00:00:17.730> we<00:00:17.970> just<00:00:18.000> have<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.300> regular<00:00:18.690> photo

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
here we are we just have a regular photo

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.599 
here we are we just have a regular photo
that<00:00:19.170> we<00:00:19.289> want<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.560> make<00:00:19.680> into<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> Polaroid<00:00:20.400> and

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
that we want to make into a Polaroid and

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.609 
that we want to make into a Polaroid and
the<00:00:21.060> first<00:00:21.270> step<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.960> actually<00:00:22.289> make<00:00:22.439> this

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
the first step is to actually make this

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.080 
the first step is to actually make this
a<00:00:22.680> square<00:00:23.070> image<00:00:23.250> because<00:00:23.760> as<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:23.970> know

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
a square image because as you know

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.599 
a square image because as you know
Polaroids<00:00:24.539> are<00:00:24.689> square<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.439> image<00:00:25.650> itself<00:00:25.949> so

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
Polaroids are square the image itself so

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.880 
Polaroids are square the image itself so
what<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.849> want<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.090> do<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.330> get<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.289> make<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
what I want to do is get this make the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.859 
what I want to do is get this make the
rectangular<00:00:29.490> marquee<00:00:29.640> marquee<00:00:30.449> tool<00:00:30.689> here

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
rectangular marquee marquee tool here

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.639 
rectangular marquee marquee tool here
and<00:00:31.250> with<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.399> shift<00:00:32.460> key<00:00:32.850> down<00:00:33.540> I'm<00:00:33.840> going<00:00:34.440> to

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
and with the shift key down I'm going to

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.060 
and with the shift key down I'm going to
drag<00:00:35.640> click<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.300> drag<00:00:36.480> until<00:00:37.050> I'm<00:00:37.469> selecting

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
drag click and drag until I'm selecting

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.220 
drag click and drag until I'm selecting
the<00:00:38.550> height<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> image<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.540> essentially

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
the height of the image so essentially

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.889 
the height of the image so essentially
it's<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:41.160> naor<00:00:41.700> one-to-one<00:00:42.270> ratio<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.750> it

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
it's just on naor one-to-one ratio so it

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.139 
it's just on naor one-to-one ratio so it
makes<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.469> square<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.040> now<00:00:44.760> I'm<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:44.910> gonna

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
makes a square and now I'm just gonna

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.910 
makes a square and now I'm just gonna
position<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.350> roughly<00:00:46.680> here

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
position this so that it's roughly here

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.920 
position this so that it's roughly here
to<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> image<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.420> part<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.840> image

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
to the image that the part of the image

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.290 
to the image that the part of the image
that<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.170> want<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.890> will<00:00:50.579> select<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.030> part

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
that I want so I will select this part

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.319 
that I want so I will select this part
here<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.690> go<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.989> image<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.710> crop<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:54.149> there

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
here and go to image and crop so there

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.590 
here and go to image and crop so there
we<00:00:54.449> are

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
we are

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.930 
we are
I'll<00:00:54.930> deselect<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.309> first<00:00:56.520> step<00:00:56.699> is

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
I'll deselect this and the first step is

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.209 
I'll deselect this and the first step is
just<00:00:57.239> having<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.570> square<00:00:57.870> image<00:00:58.020> now<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.100> we

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
just having a square image now what we

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.369 
just having a square image now what we
want<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> do<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.789> go<00:01:00.660> over<00:01:00.690> here<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.170> layers

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
want to do is go over here to the layers

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.349 
want to do is go over here to the layers
palette<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.980> I'm<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.910> double<00:01:03.270> click

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
palette and I'm going to double click

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.030 
palette and I'm going to double click
where<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.019> says<00:01:04.080> background<00:01:04.439> I'm<00:01:04.860> gonna

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
where it says background I'm gonna

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.560 
where it says background I'm gonna
double<00:01:05.339> click<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.939> just<00:01:06.270> click<00:01:06.420> OK

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
double click on this and just click OK

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.440 
double click on this and just click OK
and<00:01:07.229> what<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:07.979> does<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.580> removes<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.150> from

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
and what this does is it removes it from

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.450 
and what this does is it removes it from
being<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.960> background<00:01:10.530> layer<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:10.770> I'll<00:01:11.250> just

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
being a background layer so I'll just

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.010 
being a background layer so I'll just
don't<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.850> for<00:01:12.030> now<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.420> as<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:12.960> see

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
don't do this for now and as you can see

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.800 
don't do this for now and as you can see
a<00:01:13.140> background<00:01:13.530> layer<00:01:13.650> here<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.040> locked<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.909> if

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
a background layer here is locked and if

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.810 
a background layer here is locked and if
I<00:01:16.049> double<00:01:16.110> click<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.040> will<00:01:17.340> unlock

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
I double click on this it will unlock

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.700 
I double click on this it will unlock
that<00:01:18.090> layer<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:19.080> reason<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.650> is

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
that layer and the reason for this is

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.679 
that layer and the reason for this is
for<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> next<00:01:20.549> step<00:01:20.759> we're<00:01:21.240> going<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.540> go<00:01:21.630> to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
for the next step we're going to go to

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.530 
for the next step we're going to go to
image<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.320> canvas<00:01:22.770> size<00:01:23.119> and<00:01:24.119> we're<00:01:24.240> going<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
image and canvas size and we're going to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.020 
image and canvas size and we're going to
crease<00:01:24.810> increase<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.979> canvas<00:01:26.340> size<00:01:26.490> for<00:01:26.820> at

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
crease increase the canvas size for at

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.789 
crease increase the canvas size for at
the<00:01:27.180> moment<00:01:27.479> that's<00:01:27.570> at<00:01:27.750> 5:30<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.409> just<00:01:28.619> want

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
the moment that's at 5:30 I just want

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.440 
the moment that's at 5:30 I just want
something<00:01:29.130> bigger<00:01:29.310> because<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.610> need<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.850> you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
something bigger because I need to you

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.210 
something bigger because I need to you
know<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.750> more<00:01:30.930> space<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.470> create<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
know have more space to create the the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.789 
know have more space to create the the
Polaroid<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.689> I'll<00:01:33.750> just<00:01:33.900> add<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.290> too<00:01:34.530> for

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
Polaroid so I'll just add this too for

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.620 
Polaroid so I'll just add this too for
example<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.369> 800<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.090> arbitrarily

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
example just to 800 just arbitrarily

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.880 
example just to 800 just arbitrarily
just<00:01:36.750> something<00:01:37.170> that's<00:01:37.290> more<00:01:37.619> than<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
just something that's more than the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.819 
just something that's more than the
image<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.140> here<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.229> are<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
image that I have and here we are the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.969 
image that I have and here we are the
reason<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.430> did<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.299> double<00:01:43.229> clicking<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
reason we did the double clicking on the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.460 
reason we did the double clicking on the
layer<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.299> layer<00:01:45.479> now<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:46.020> just

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
layer is so that the layer now is just

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.740 
layer is so that the layer now is just
it's<00:01:46.710> independent<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:48.210> increased

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
it's independent of this increased

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.109 
it's independent of this increased
canvas<00:01:49.439> size<00:01:49.649> otherwise<00:01:50.549> if<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.880> had<00:01:51.000> done

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
canvas size otherwise if you had done

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.030 
canvas size otherwise if you had done
this<00:01:51.299> without<00:01:51.540> doing<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.799> would<00:01:52.950> have

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
this without doing this you would have

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.830 
this without doing this you would have
seen<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.460> would<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:53.700> added<00:01:53.909> white<00:01:54.299> to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
seen that you would have added white to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.240 
seen that you would have added white to
the<00:01:54.960> canvas<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.649> would<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.860> had<00:01:55.979> white

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
the canvas and you would have had white

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.800 
the canvas and you would have had white
stuck<00:01:56.610> around<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.000> image<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.360> we<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.600> want<00:01:57.750> a

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
stuck around the image so we just want a

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.690 
stuck around the image so we just want a
floating<00:01:58.200> image<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.710> that's<00:01:59.159> what<00:01:59.490> this

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
floating image and that's what this

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.850 
floating image and that's what this
checker<00:02:00.270> pattern<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:01.020> showing<00:02:01.320> us<00:02:01.439> as<00:02:01.590> it's

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
checker pattern is showing us as it's

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.069 
checker pattern is showing us as it's
transparent<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.820> that's<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.659> first<00:02:03.899> good

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
transparent so that's the first good

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.029 
transparent so that's the first good
step<00:02:04.320> now<00:02:05.070> what<00:02:05.250> we<00:02:05.399> want<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.670> do<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.409> just<00:02:07.409> add

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
step now what we want to do is just add

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.219 
step now what we want to do is just add
some<00:02:08.640> white<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.660> we're<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.020> add

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
some white to this so we're going to add

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.040 
some white to this so we're going to add
another<00:02:10.560> layer<00:02:10.860> clicking<00:02:11.550> on<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.760> new<00:02:12.060> layer

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
another layer clicking on the new layer

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.190 
another layer clicking on the new layer
button<00:02:13.830> here<00:02:13.980> drag<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.150> down<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:15.990> we

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
button here drag this down so that we

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.770 
button here drag this down so that we
have<00:02:16.350> that<00:02:16.500> layer<00:02:16.710> below<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.460> image<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.360> I'm

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
have that layer below the image and I'm

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.080 
have that layer below the image and I'm
going<00:02:18.960> to<00:02:19.080> use<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.200> shortcut<00:02:19.760> ctrl<00:02:20.760> backspace

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
going to use a shortcut ctrl backspace

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.260 
going to use a shortcut ctrl backspace
to<00:02:21.720> fill<00:02:22.080> in<00:02:22.410> white<00:02:22.680> because<00:02:23.310> white<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:23.940> my

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
to fill in white because white is my

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.160 
to fill in white because white is my
background<00:02:24.720> color<00:02:25.350> here<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:26.630> so<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.660> have<00:02:27.930> the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
background color here and so I have the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.990 
background color here and so I have the
image<00:02:28.440> on<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:29.130> white<00:02:29.400> sheet<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.730> paper<00:02:29.760> so

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
image on a white sheet of paper so

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.870 
image on a white sheet of paper so
that's<00:02:30.180> good<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:30.560> visually<00:02:31.560> we<00:02:31.770> we've<00:02:32.700> gone

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
that's good so visually we we've gone

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.940 
that's good so visually we we've gone
off<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.300> good<00:02:33.420> starting<00:02:33.780> point<00:02:33.990> now<00:02:34.650> what<00:02:34.830> we

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
off to a good starting point now what we

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.590 
off to a good starting point now what we
need<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.220> do<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.550> actually<00:02:36.090> make<00:02:36.450> that

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
need to do is actually make that

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.310 
need to do is actually make that
selection<00:02:36.870> for<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:38.870> for<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.930> poll<00:02:40.110> all<00:02:40.230> right

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
selection for the for the poll all right

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.350 
selection for the for the poll all right
so<00:02:40.590> what<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:40.950> want<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.130> do<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.400> just<00:02:41.580> with<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
so what you want to do is just with the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.850 
so what you want to do is just with the
cursor<00:02:42.690> here<00:02:42.840> just<00:02:43.020> pay<00:02:43.140> attention<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.590> what

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
cursor here just pay attention that what

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.000 
cursor here just pay attention that what
you<00:02:43.980> want<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.220> do<00:02:44.340> is<00:02:44.960> be<00:02:45.960> roughly<00:02:46.320> at<00:02:46.560> an<00:02:46.680> equal

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
you want to do is be roughly at an equal

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.840 
you want to do is be roughly at an equal
distance<00:02:47.040> from<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.670> top<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.540> left<00:02:48.780> so

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
distance from the top and to the left so

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.260 
distance from the top and to the left so
the<00:02:50.850> area<00:02:51.090> okay<00:02:51.480> that's<00:02:51.660> pretty<00:02:51.810> good<00:02:52.160> and

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
the area okay that's pretty good and

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.520 
the area okay that's pretty good and
just<00:02:54.270> envision<00:02:54.630> really<00:02:55.050> just<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.320> polar

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
just envision really just the polar

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.200 
just envision really just the polar
right<00:02:55.680> that's<00:02:55.950> basically<00:02:56.580> how<00:02:56.760> Polaroid

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
right that's basically how Polaroid

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.690 
right that's basically how Polaroid
looks<00:02:57.420> it's<00:02:57.660> just<00:02:57.900> longer<00:02:58.440> at<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.620> bottom<00:02:58.890> so

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
looks it's just longer at the bottom so

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.400 
looks it's just longer at the bottom so
there<00:02:59.880> we<00:02:59.970> are<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.270> surf<00:03:00.450> selection<00:03:00.930> I'll

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
there we are that surf selection I'll

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.000 
there we are that surf selection I'll
create<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.800> new<00:03:01.860> layer<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:03.380> drag<00:03:04.380> this<00:03:04.560> below

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
create a new layer and drag this below

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.760 
create a new layer and drag this below
the<00:03:05.520> image<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:06.270> it<00:03:06.570> is<00:03:06.750> in<00:03:06.900> between<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.620> two

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
the image so it is in between the two

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.340 
the image so it is in between the two
layers<00:03:07.950> here<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.460> I'm<00:03:09.330> again<00:03:09.750> going<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:10.080> fill

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
layers here and I'm again going to fill

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.290 
layers here and I'm again going to fill
this<00:03:10.500> with<00:03:10.800> whites<00:03:11.160> because<00:03:11.640> obviously<00:03:11.970> a

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
this with whites because obviously a

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.480 
this with whites because obviously a
Polaroid<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.140> know<00:03:13.230> roughly<00:03:13.620> white<00:03:13.890> so

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
Polaroid is you know roughly white so

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.910 
Polaroid is you know roughly white so
I'm<00:03:14.550> gonna<00:03:14.700> go<00:03:14.940> arm<00:03:15.440> control<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.590> backspace

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
I'm gonna go arm control and backspace

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
I'm gonna go arm control and backspace
and<00:03:17.900> deselect<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.380> now<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:19.860> see<00:03:20.190> that<00:03:20.220> didn't

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
and deselect and now you see that didn't

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.220 
and deselect and now you see that didn't
make<00:03:21.030> much<00:03:21.270> of<00:03:21.330> a<00:03:21.480> difference<00:03:21.570> but<00:03:21.959> on<00:03:22.110> this

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
make much of a difference but on this

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.880 
make much of a difference but on this
layer<00:03:22.470> we<00:03:22.650> have<00:03:22.800> it<00:03:22.980> here<00:03:23.160> if<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.400> unselect<00:03:24.030> the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
layer we have it here if I unselect the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.870 
layer we have it here if I unselect the
background<00:03:25.890> layer<00:03:26.010> there<00:03:26.340> we<00:03:26.430> are<00:03:26.580> we<00:03:26.730> have

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
background layer there we are we have

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.300 
background layer there we are we have
our<00:03:26.910> Polaroid<00:03:27.510> essentially<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.650> now<00:03:28.980> what<00:03:29.160> we

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
our Polaroid essentially and now what we

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.610 
our Polaroid essentially and now what we
want<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.520> do<00:03:29.670> is<00:03:29.880> add<00:03:30.630> an<00:03:30.840> effect<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.410> we're

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
want to do is add an effect to it we're

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.890 
want to do is add an effect to it we're
going<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.830> add<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:32.250> layer<00:03:32.940> style<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.450> this<00:03:33.690> I'll

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
going to add a layer style to this I'll

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.420 
going to add a layer style to this I'll
just<00:03:34.050> go<00:03:34.170> ahead<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.500> turn<00:03:34.680> on<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:34.890> background

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
just go ahead and turn on the background

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.220 
just go ahead and turn on the background
right<00:03:35.580> here<00:03:35.760> just<00:03:35.940> for<00:03:36.090> a<00:03:36.120> second<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:36.989> can

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
right here just for a second so you can

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.890 
right here just for a second so you can
see<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:38.430> effects<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:38.940> we're<00:03:39.209> applying<00:03:39.660> and

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
see the effects that we're applying and

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.680 
see the effects that we're applying and
how<00:03:40.050> we're<00:03:40.230> going<00:03:40.320> to<00:03:40.440> make<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:40.770> pump<00:03:41.690> so

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
how we're going to make this pump so

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.550 
how we're going to make this pump so
what<00:03:42.900> we<00:03:43.020> want<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.230> do<00:03:43.350> here<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.620> just<00:03:44.430> create<00:03:44.700> a

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
what we want to do here is just create a

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.830 
what we want to do here is just create a
drop<00:03:46.560> shadow<00:03:46.770> first<00:03:47.100> of<00:03:47.280> all<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:48.690> drop

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
drop shadow first of all and the drop

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.840 
drop shadow first of all and the drop
shadow<00:03:49.080> I<00:03:49.320> want<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:49.800> to<00:03:50.010> go<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.550> other

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
shadow I want it to go the other

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.240 
shadow I want it to go the other
direction<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.510> want<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.840> drop<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.860> go<00:03:52.980> from

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
direction I want the drop to go from

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.040 
direction I want the drop to go from
that<00:03:53.640> direction<00:03:54.090> here<00:03:54.239> so<00:03:54.450> I'll<00:03:54.660> just<00:03:54.870> select

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
that direction here so I'll just select

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.260 
that direction here so I'll just select
the<00:03:55.320> angle<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:56.280> something<00:03:56.640> like<00:03:56.790> a<00:03:56.850> hundred

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
the angle to something like a hundred

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.540 
the angle to something like a hundred
and<00:03:57.300> thirty<00:03:57.510> degrees<00:03:57.690> there<00:03:58.230> yeah<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:58.890> what<00:03:59.520> I

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
and thirty degrees there yeah and what I

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.870 
and thirty degrees there yeah and what I
also<00:03:59.790> want<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.180> do<00:04:00.300> is<00:04:01.130> increase<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.430> size<00:04:02.670> of

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
also want to do is increase the size of

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.420 
also want to do is increase the size of
it<00:04:03.060> now<00:04:03.180> we're<00:04:03.840> limited<00:04:04.380> here<00:04:04.590> for<00:04:04.830> space<00:04:05.070> but

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
it now we're limited here for space but

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.610 
it now we're limited here for space but
I'll<00:04:05.670> just<00:04:05.880> increase<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.420> size<00:04:06.660> and<00:04:07.140> as<00:04:07.530> you

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
I'll just increase the size and as you

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.130 
I'll just increase the size and as you
can<00:04:07.770> see<00:04:08.100> with<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.880> size<00:04:09.060> originally<00:04:09.930> it's

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
can see with the size originally it's

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.850 
can see with the size originally it's
just<00:04:10.410> it's<00:04:11.090> just<00:04:12.090> at<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.450> drop<00:04:12.750> but<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.769> know

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
just it's just at the drop but you know

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.140 
just it's just at the drop but you know
the<00:04:13.980> part<00:04:14.130> of<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.340> drop<00:04:14.519> shadow<00:04:14.760> but<00:04:14.910> if<00:04:15.030> we

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
the part of the drop shadow but if we

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.640 
the part of the drop shadow but if we
increase<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.600> size<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:16.109> see<00:04:16.290> that<00:04:16.470> it<00:04:16.560> starts

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
increase the size you see that it starts

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.909 
increase the size you see that it starts
bleeding<00:04:17.640> in<00:04:17.970> slightly<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.620> making<00:04:19.620> it<00:04:19.709> seem

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
bleeding in slightly and making it seem

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.870 
bleeding in slightly and making it seem
like<00:04:20.160> this<00:04:20.880> is<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.600> know<00:04:21.720> a<00:04:22.310> Polaroid<00:04:23.310> off<00:04:23.550> a

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
like this is a you know a Polaroid off a

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.760 
like this is a you know a Polaroid off a
sheet<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.180> paper<00:04:24.360> so<00:04:24.720> we<00:04:25.169> want<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.500> little<00:04:25.530> bit

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
sheet of paper so we want a little bit

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.600 
sheet of paper so we want a little bit
of<00:04:25.860> this<00:04:26.070> 2x

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
of this 2x

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.119 
of this 2x
show<00:04:26.849> the<00:04:27.419> dimensions<00:04:27.960> of<00:04:28.259> the<00:04:28.620> of<00:04:29.009> the

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
show the dimensions of the of the

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:30.679 
show the dimensions of the of the
Polaroid<00:04:29.400> actually<00:04:29.969> decreased<00:04:30.330> this<00:04:30.479> year

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:30.689 
Polaroid actually decreased this year

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:34.129 
Polaroid actually decreased this year
slightly<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:32.030> there<00:04:33.030> we<00:04:33.150> are<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:33.389> now<00:04:33.990> what

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
slightly and there we are and now what

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.629 
slightly and there we are and now what
we<00:04:34.289> also<00:04:34.319> want<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.710> do<00:04:34.800> is<00:04:34.979> just<00:04:35.159> create<00:04:35.430> a

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
we also want to do is just create a

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.209 
we also want to do is just create a
gradient<00:04:36.030> overlay<00:04:36.389> so<00:04:37.020> over<00:04:37.349> here<00:04:37.500> just<00:04:37.680> click

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:38.219 
gradient overlay so over here just click

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:41.869 
gradient overlay so over here just click
on<00:04:38.460> gradient<00:04:38.969> overlay<00:04:39.530> select<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:40.889> and<00:04:41.069> as<00:04:41.849> you

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:41.879 
on gradient overlay select it and as you

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.249 
on gradient overlay select it and as you
can<00:04:41.969> see<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.360> overlay<00:04:42.689> what<00:04:42.870> it's<00:04:43.020> doing

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
can see the overlay what it's doing

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.379 
can see the overlay what it's doing
right<00:04:43.379> now<00:04:43.439> is<00:04:43.800> just<00:04:43.830> adding<00:04:44.310> white<00:04:44.759> to<00:04:44.789> black

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
right now is just adding white to black

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.300 
right now is just adding white to black
and<00:04:45.719> all<00:04:46.319> I<00:04:46.349> want<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.650> do<00:04:46.710> is<00:04:46.830> just<00:04:46.979> to<00:04:47.069> give<00:04:47.280> a

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
and all I want to do is just to give a

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.469 
and all I want to do is just to give a
slight<00:04:47.849> hint<00:04:48.240> of<00:04:48.509> an<00:04:49.199> uneven<00:04:49.759> lighting<00:04:50.759> so<00:04:51.449> I

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
slight hint of an uneven lighting so I

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.929 
slight hint of an uneven lighting so I
want<00:04:51.870> to<00:04:51.960> have<00:04:52.139> it<00:04:52.319> from<00:04:52.560> white<00:04:52.919> to<00:04:53.280> very<00:04:53.610> light

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:53.939 
want to have it from white to very light

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:56.059 
want to have it from white to very light
gray<00:04:54.419> here<00:04:54.870> so<00:04:55.169> that<00:04:55.379> it<00:04:55.469> just<00:04:55.680> seems<00:04:55.919> like

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
gray here so that it just seems like

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:58.219 
gray here so that it just seems like
there's<00:04:56.280> a<00:04:56.340> bit<00:04:56.460> of<00:04:56.550> a<00:04:56.639> cast<00:04:56.879> shadow<00:04:57.300> being

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
there's a bit of a cast shadow being

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.420 
there's a bit of a cast shadow being
cast<00:04:58.319> on<00:04:59.279> you<00:05:00.029> know<00:05:00.150> on<00:05:00.389> the<00:05:00.919> Polaroid<00:05:01.919> itself

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
cast on you know on the Polaroid itself

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.730 
cast on you know on the Polaroid itself
so<00:05:03.300> I'll<00:05:03.389> change<00:05:03.569> the<00:05:03.840> opacity<00:05:03.990> to<00:05:04.379> something

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
so I'll change the opacity to something

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.830 
so I'll change the opacity to something
very<00:05:04.770> very<00:05:05.069> low<00:05:05.490> so<00:05:06.090> it'll<00:05:06.419> probably<00:05:06.449> be<00:05:06.810> in

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
very very low so it'll probably be in

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.019 
very very low so it'll probably be in
the<00:05:06.990> 3%<00:05:07.319> mark<00:05:07.919> and<00:05:08.129> so<00:05:08.310> forth<00:05:08.520> so<00:05:08.729> there<00:05:08.909> we<00:05:09.000> are

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:09.029 
the 3% mark and so forth so there we are

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:12.559 
the 3% mark and so forth so there we are
it's<00:05:09.240> just<00:05:09.389> a<00:05:09.509> very<00:05:09.810> slight<00:05:11.569> differentiation

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
it's just a very slight differentiation

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.869 
it's just a very slight differentiation
here<00:05:12.719> and<00:05:12.960> I<00:05:13.500> want<00:05:13.680> to<00:05:13.740> put<00:05:13.889> this<00:05:14.039> slightly<00:05:14.580> at

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:14.879 
here and I want to put this slightly at

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:18.350 
here and I want to put this slightly at
an<00:05:15.029> angle<00:05:15.360> so<00:05:16.610> roughly<00:05:17.610> at<00:05:17.729> this<00:05:17.879> angle<00:05:18.180> here

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
an angle so roughly at this angle here

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.290 
an angle so roughly at this angle here
that's<00:05:18.569> that's<00:05:19.110> pretty<00:05:19.379> good<00:05:19.529> okay<00:05:19.800> now<00:05:20.300> now

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300

our<00:05:22.889> drop<00:05:23.129> shadow<00:05:23.370> and<00:05:23.610> our<00:05:23.699> gradient<00:05:23.939> overlay

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
our drop shadow and our gradient overlay

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.010 
our drop shadow and our gradient overlay
at<00:05:24.810> just<00:05:25.169> the<00:05:25.289> three<00:05:25.469> percent<00:05:25.860> I'll<00:05:26.159> click<00:05:26.430> OK

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
at just the three percent I'll click OK

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.959 
at just the three percent I'll click OK
and<00:05:28.129> now<00:05:29.129> what<00:05:29.310> we're<00:05:29.430> going<00:05:29.550> to<00:05:29.610> do<00:05:29.729> is

for the free transform tool and holding
down<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:53.099> shift<00:05:53.310> I'm<00:05:53.550> just<00:05:53.849> going<00:05:54.060> to<00:05:54.120> make

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
down the shift I'm just going to make

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.809 
down the shift I'm just going to make
this<00:05:54.479> text<00:05:54.930> to<00:05:55.889> the<00:05:55.979> size<00:05:56.189> that<00:05:56.400> I<00:05:56.430> need<00:05:56.520> it<00:05:56.789> to
