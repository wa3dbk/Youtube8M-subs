half<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.739> point<00:02:20.950> there<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.310> comfort<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:21.970> think

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
half a point there and comfort I think

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.300 
half a point there and comfort I think
that<00:02:22.690> this<00:02:22.870> thumb<00:02:23.140> needs<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.830> be<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.950> little<00:02:24.099> bit

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
that this thumb needs to be a little bit

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.030 
that this thumb needs to be a little bit
longer<00:02:25.019> because<00:02:26.019> it<00:02:26.260> doesn't<00:02:26.560> fit<00:02:26.650> me<00:02:26.769> I<00:02:26.830> don't

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
longer because it doesn't fit me I don't

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.680 
longer because it doesn't fit me I don't
even<00:02:27.099> have<00:02:27.340> monster<00:02:27.909> hands<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.390> know<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.510> don't

have Paul Rayville hands all right so

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.759 
have Paul Rayville hands all right so
maybe<00:02:31.180> maybe<00:02:31.599> this<00:02:31.780> could<00:02:32.200> be<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.379> little<00:02:32.650> bit

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
maybe maybe this could be a little bit

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.789 
maybe maybe this could be a little bit
bigger<00:02:33.010> that<00:02:33.430> thumb<00:02:33.700> area<00:02:33.909> my<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.500> my<00:02:35.650> thumb

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
protective they are durable they stand

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.250 
protective they are durable they stand
up<00:05:49.710> to<00:05:49.740> abuse<00:05:50.370> and<00:05:50.640> they<00:05:51.120> are<00:05:51.300> comfortable<00:05:51.690> you

up to abuse and they are comfortable you

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.220 
up to abuse and they are comfortable you
know<00:05:52.320> I<00:05:52.560> don't<00:05:52.980> love<00:05:53.250> the<00:05:53.520> thumb<00:05:53.790> I<00:05:54.030> do<00:05:54.450> love

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
know I don't love the thumb I do love

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.710 
know I don't love the thumb I do love
the<00:05:55.710> pinky<00:05:56.130> and<00:05:56.700> then<00:05:57.210> when<00:05:57.330> it<00:05:57.420> comes<00:05:57.540> to

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
the pinky and then when it comes to

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.450 
the pinky and then when it comes to
value<00:05:57.870> I<00:05:58.080> think<00:05:58.200> the<00:05:58.500> price<00:05:58.740> is<00:05:58.770> a<00:05:58.980> little<00:05:59.100> high

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
value I think the price is a little high

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.760 
value I think the price is a little high
but<00:06:00.210> again<00:06:00.570> this<00:06:00.840> is<00:06:00.990> kind<00:06:01.230> of<00:06:01.320> the<00:06:01.440> standard

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
but again this is kind of the standard

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.350 
but again this is kind of the standard
glove<00:06:02.220> that<00:06:02.370> you're<00:06:02.490> looking<00:06:02.760> at<00:06:02.850> across<00:06:03.180> the
