00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.010 
league dark so I think that that would
be<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.219> really<00:00:41.579> awesome<00:00:41.850> combination<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.780> sort

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
be a really awesome combination to sort

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.080 
be a really awesome combination to sort
of<00:00:43.110> introduce<00:00:43.920> her<00:00:44.190> into<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> Cinematic

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
of introduce her into the Cinematic

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.090 
of introduce her into the Cinematic
Universe<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.600> then<00:00:45.750> maybe<00:00:45.989> they<00:00:46.649> can<00:00:46.860> kind<00:00:47.010> of

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
Universe and then maybe they can kind of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.950 
Universe and then maybe they can kind of
go<00:00:47.250> off<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:47.850> do<00:00:48.090> their<00:00:48.270> own<00:00:48.300> thing<00:00:48.510> I
