00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.230 
issues in a Moorhead on way than caddie
woodlawn<00:05:29.750> des<00:05:30.020> and<00:05:30.320> so<00:05:30.770> far<00:05:31.070> I<00:05:31.430> definitely

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
woodlawn des and so far I definitely

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.350 
woodlawn des and so far I definitely
think<00:05:32.630> that<00:05:32.810> had<00:05:33.650> a<00:05:33.680> big<00:05:33.950> sky<00:05:34.340> was<00:05:35.120> more

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
think that had a big sky was more

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.480 
think that had a big sky was more
deserving<00:05:35.810> of<00:05:36.230> an<00:05:36.500> actual<00:05:36.920> newbery<00:05:37.370> medal

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
deserving of an actual newbery medal

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.670 
deserving of an actual newbery medal
then<00:05:38.090> caddie<00:05:38.450> woodlawn<00:05:38.900> and<00:05:39.140> maybe<00:05:39.380> that's

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
then caddie woodlawn and maybe that's

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.130 
then caddie woodlawn and maybe that's
heresy<00:05:40.670> I<00:05:40.910> don't<00:05:41.150> know<00:05:41.270> but<00:05:41.510> that's<00:05:41.780> just<00:05:41.990> how

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
heresy I don't know but that's just how

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.840 
heresy I don't know but that's just how
I<00:05:42.170> feel<00:05:42.560> you<00:05:42.770> might<00:05:42.920> remember<00:05:43.100> that<00:05:43.370> in<00:05:43.670> my

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
I feel you might remember that in my

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.080 
I feel you might remember that in my
februari<00:05:44.360> wrap<00:05:44.750> up<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.170> said<00:05:45.980> I<00:05:46.040> wanted<00:05:46.430> to<00:05:46.610> read

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
februari wrap up I said I wanted to read

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.530 
februari wrap up I said I wanted to read
the<00:05:47.270> books<00:05:47.450> of<00:05:47.660> dave<00:05:47.990> eggers<00:05:48.500> next<00:05:49.190> and

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
the books of dave eggers next and

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.300 
the books of dave eggers next and
obviously<00:05:50.540> I<00:05:51.080> didn't<00:05:51.620> read<00:05:51.770> a<00:05:51.800> single<00:05:52.040> one

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
obviously I didn't read a single one

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.250 
obviously I didn't read a single one
maybe<00:05:52.820> I'll<00:05:53.000> get<00:05:53.180> to<00:05:53.300> them<00:05:53.390> in<00:05:53.450> April<00:05:54.050> but

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
maybe I'll get to them in April but

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.860 
maybe I'll get to them in April but
maybe<00:05:54.590> it'll<00:05:54.860> just<00:05:55.100> take<00:05:55.310> me<00:05:55.370> all<00:05:55.880> of<00:05:56.180> April<00:05:56.540> to

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
maybe it'll just take me all of April to

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.230 
maybe it'll just take me all of April to
finish<00:05:57.350> the<00:05:57.680> fires<00:05:57.920> of<00:05:58.040> heaven<00:05:58.370> and<00:05:58.640> honestly

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
I'll be okay if that happens because I

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.080
