00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
to the thing on eBay but I guess you

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.120 
to the thing on eBay but I guess you
could<00:01:29.210> look<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.479> up<00:01:29.570> as<00:01:29.860> stainless<00:01:30.860> steel

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
could look it up as stainless steel

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.190 
could look it up as stainless steel
simmer<00:01:31.580> ring<00:01:32.470> suitable<00:01:33.470> for<00:01:33.680> Swedish<00:01:34.190> army<00:01:34.670> I

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
simmer ring suitable for Swedish army I

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.480 
simmer ring suitable for Swedish army I
guess<00:01:36.200> just<00:01:36.409> look<00:01:36.560> up<00:01:36.740> stainless<00:01:37.280> steel

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
guess just look up stainless steel

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.050 
guess just look up stainless steel
simmering<00:01:39.040> boy<00:01:40.040> lighter<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:40.610> I<00:01:40.700> thought<00:01:40.939> it

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
simmering boy lighter and I thought it

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:52.210 
simmering boy lighter and I thought it
would<00:01:41.150> be<00:01:44.950> a<00:01:47.650> stainless<00:01:48.650> steel<00:01:50.080> simmering<00:01:51.220> for

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
would be a stainless steel simmering for

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.899 
would be a stainless steel simmering for
the<00:01:52.369> military<00:01:52.850> style<00:01:53.380> Trangia<00:01:54.380> I<00:01:57.460> was<00:01:58.460> talking

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
the military style Trangia I was talking

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.899 
the military style Trangia I was talking
with<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.150> guy<00:01:59.350> emailing<00:02:00.350> them<00:02:00.650> and<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.640> sounds

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
with the guy emailing them and it sounds

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.520 
with the guy emailing them and it sounds
like<00:02:01.939> they<00:02:02.180> get<00:02:02.330> these<00:02:02.540> from<00:02:03.049> somewhere

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
like they get these from somewhere

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.690 
like they get these from somewhere
overseas<00:02:03.799> and<00:02:04.340> they<00:02:05.150> bring<00:02:05.360> them<00:02:05.540> in<00:02:05.689> I

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
overseas and they bring them in I

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.859 
overseas and they bring them in I
thought<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:07.820> was<00:02:07.939> a<00:02:07.970> little<00:02:08.149> expensive

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
thought it was a little expensive

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.280 
thought it was a little expensive
I<00:02:09.399> bit<00:02:10.399> up<00:02:10.549> to<00:02:10.759> 15<00:02:11.269> with<00:02:11.870> 1550<00:02:12.739> on<00:02:12.920> this<00:02:13.959> which<00:02:14.959> I

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
I bit up to 15 with 1550 on this which I

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.260 
I bit up to 15 with 1550 on this which I
don't<00:02:15.560> know<00:02:15.620> if<00:02:16.190> it<00:02:16.459> works<00:02:16.670> good<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.000> guess

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
don't know if it works good I guess

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.330 
don't know if it works good I guess
it'll<00:02:17.480> be<00:02:17.540> worth<00:02:17.810> it

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
it'll be worth it

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.420 
it'll be worth it
so<00:02:19.640> let's<00:02:19.910> see<00:02:20.180> how<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.599> fits<00:02:20.980> also<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.280> other

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
so let's see how it fits also the other

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.640 
so let's see how it fits also the other
thing<00:02:22.670> that's<00:02:22.819> missing<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.450> don't<00:02:24.380> know<00:02:24.590> if

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
thing that's missing I don't know if

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.900 
thing that's missing I don't know if
this<00:02:24.800> will<00:02:24.920> work<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.430> was<00:02:25.550> thinking<00:02:25.819> this

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
this will work it I was thinking this

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.699 
this will work it I was thinking this
would<00:02:26.060> work<00:02:26.270> as<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.480> snuffer<00:02:27.110> but<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.380> don't<00:02:27.560> not

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
would work as a snuffer but I don't not

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.790 
would work as a snuffer but I don't not
sure<00:02:27.890> if<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.099> would<00:02:28.280> have<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.330> see<00:02:29.569> so<00:02:30.500> anyway

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
sure if it would have to see so anyway

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.360 
sure if it would have to see so anyway
it<00:02:30.920> goes<00:02:31.040> on<00:02:31.190> just<00:02:31.430> like<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:33.130> hopefully<00:02:34.130> you

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
it goes on just like that hopefully you

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.290 
it goes on just like that hopefully you
can<00:02:34.459> see<00:02:34.700> it<00:02:34.790> in<00:02:34.880> this<00:02:34.970> light<00:02:37.030> shimmer<00:02:38.030> ring

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
can see it in this light shimmer ring

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.839 
can see it in this light shimmer ring
moves<00:02:39.019> from<00:02:39.260> side<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.530> side<00:02:40.569> it<00:02:41.569> fits<00:02:42.019> on<00:02:42.290> the

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
moves from side to side it fits on the

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.160 
moves from side to side it fits on the
raised<00:02:43.849> part<00:02:44.330> of<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.750> Trangia<00:02:46.930> pretty<00:02:47.930> cool

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
raised part of the Trangia pretty cool

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.780 
raised part of the Trangia pretty cool
