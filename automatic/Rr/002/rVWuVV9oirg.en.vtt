 the 300th for this bike the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.190

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.309

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.199
 can gather that he is ready for the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.760

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.729
 variety of road conditions

 the key to getting ready for any type 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.140
 driving and the right combination of the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.790
 power and manipulation and this is 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.740
 exactly what the engineers of 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.869
 honda have designed in this bike to 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.470
 know more here is Canadian champion of 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.590
 superbike 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.570
 johnny christ and hi I got on 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.460
 the 300 m on the track and I can you 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.869
 say that the engine was designed to 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.909
 offer a very large band of 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.950
 power with usable power 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.259
 is idling at the red line 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.329
 if you are experienced engine you 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.460
 know what it ends up if you're not 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.530
 not let me explain when you 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.030
 turn the accelerator on this bike the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.469
 power and acceleration are the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.750
 exactly as you do 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.700
 do not wait for erratic departure or a 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.259
 sudden increase in power and 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.659
 you will not miss any acceleration 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.220
 when you want it predictability and 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.439
 control are some of the things 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.000
 the most important this eliminates all 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.710
 Safe delivery kinds of safe 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.009
 and you can avoid these terminals to 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.380
 fire 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.929
 the cbr 300r also has a stage 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.369
 the cost increase compared to the 250 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.349
 this is a key element for the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.760
 bigouden all environment makes you 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.530
 frequent stops and starts 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.030
 have grabbed as the amount of 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.720
 greatly that a motorcycle produces when 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.090
 you want to go there 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.870
 the 300th also has enough power 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.120
 for the highway 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.010
 and yes even for the race track more 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.380
 being a honda means he has a 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.049
 exceptional fuel economy while 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.630
 simply the best of both worlds 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.310
 thank you jolly the 300r cbr is also vain 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.060
 pounds lighter than the competitor 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.920
 the closest 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.590
 combine that with a center of gravity 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.480
 down a seat height and lower a 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.760
 media section and 3 and you have a 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.299
 motorcycle extremely agile and easy to 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.430
 manipulate 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.109
 it's the same actors who give the 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.299
 new engine a strong sense of 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.769
 control comfort and confidence 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.630
 this is necessary for all 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.850
 engines at all levels or cause or 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.889
 that the cbr 300 r is a bit too big 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.810
 for you honda a france iej size 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.670
 a lower thumb is narrower 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.680
 so for the engines a little shorter 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.180
