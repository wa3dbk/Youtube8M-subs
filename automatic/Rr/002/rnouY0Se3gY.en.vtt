00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
remember which episode but it was one of

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.270 
remember which episode but it was one of
them<00:01:33.900> involving<00:01:34.320> Percy<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> title<00:01:35.159> was

them involving Percy and the title was
named<00:01:35.549> after<00:01:36.180> Percy<00:01:36.960> here<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.369> see<00:01:38.520> it's

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
named after Percy here you can see it's

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.310 
named after Percy here you can see it's
kind<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.060> dirty<00:01:39.409> up<00:01:40.409> there<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:42.049> it's<00:01:43.049> probably

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
kind of dirty up there and it's probably

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.200 
kind of dirty up there and it's probably
like<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.770> easiest<00:01:44.189> one<00:01:44.520> for<00:01:44.759> them<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.030> make

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
like the easiest one for them to make

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.370 
like the easiest one for them to make
because<00:01:45.360> they<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.020> make<00:01:46.140> first

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
because they just have to make first

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.649 
because they just have to make first
