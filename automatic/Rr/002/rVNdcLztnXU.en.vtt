here<00:02:10.130> in<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.280> city<00:02:10.490> but<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.030> railroad<00:02:11.210> says

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
here in the city but the railroad says

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.670 
here in the city but the railroad says
that<00:02:11.570> could<00:02:11.660> actually<00:02:11.810> end<00:02:12.140> up<00:02:12.200> expanding

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
that could actually end up expanding

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.710 
that could actually end up expanding
those<00:02:13.040> yards<00:02:13.370> if<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.700> economy<00:02:14.030> rebalance

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
those yards if the economy rebalance

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.750 
those yards if the economy rebalance
which<00:02:14.900> could<00:02:15.110> actually<00:02:15.260> add<00:02:15.650> jobs<00:02:16.070> but<00:02:16.610> at

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
which could actually add jobs but at

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.040 
which could actually add jobs but at
this<00:02:16.880> point<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.330> railroad<00:02:17.600> says<00:02:17.810> that's<00:02:17.990> just

this point the railroad says that's just

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.450 
this point the railroad says that's just
a<00:02:18.230> possibility<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.070> not<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.700> set<00:02:19.940> plan<00:02:20.150> Lisa

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
a possibility and not a set plan Lisa
