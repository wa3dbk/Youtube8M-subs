00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
shiny he turns around so you can get the

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.069 
shiny he turns around so you can get the

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
different angles he goes very slowly so

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.410 
different angles he goes very slowly so
it's<00:01:56.229> easy<00:01:56.469> to<00:01:56.770> follow<00:01:57.040> and<00:01:57.430> then<00:01:57.939> you<00:01:58.060> repeat

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
it's easy to follow and then you repeat

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.300 
it's easy to follow and then you repeat
you<00:01:58.689> can<00:01:58.840> repeat<00:01:59.079> the<00:01:59.229> course<00:01:59.469> the<00:01:59.560> DVDs<00:02:00.070> and

you can repeat the course the DVDs and

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.580 
you can repeat the course the DVDs and
pause<00:02:00.579> them<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.119> so<00:02:01.659> it<00:02:02.049> was<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.409> next

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590

I<00:02:16.190> think<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.490> swing<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:16.970> what<00:02:17.120> was<00:02:17.240> really<00:02:17.510> a

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
I think the swing is what was really a

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.020 
I think the swing is what was really a
lot<00:02:17.690> of<00:02:17.840> fun<00:02:18.050> because<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.560> swing<00:02:18.830> can<00:02:19.010> be<00:02:19.160> but

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
lot of fun because the swing can be but

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.490 
lot of fun because the swing can be but
you<00:02:20.270> can<00:02:20.510> use<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:20.780> for<00:02:21.020> almost<00:02:21.140> anything

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
you can use that for almost anything

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.950 
you can use that for almost anything
it's<00:02:21.740> 4/4<00:02:22.160> time<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.640> easy<00:02:22.820> you<00:02:23.060> know<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.510> it's

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
it's 4/4 time and easy you know and it's

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.170 
it's 4/4 time and easy you know and it's
a<00:02:24.080> triple<00:02:24.320> swing<00:02:24.620> or<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.040> single<00:02:25.340> swing<00:02:25.910> and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
we're still learning I mean it's still a

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.970 
we're still learning I mean it's still a
lot<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.090> learn<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.690> Linda<00:02:39.350> sort<00:02:39.530> of<00:02:39.620> dance<00:02:39.800> as

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
lot to learn and Linda sort of dance as

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.620 
lot to learn and Linda sort of dance as
intuitively<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:41.060> dance<00:02:41.330> I'm<00:02:41.600> a

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.750 
intuitively and I dance I'm a
mathematician<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.650> dance<00:02:42.920> mathematically

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
mathematician and I dance mathematically

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.880 
mathematician and I dance mathematically
I<00:02:43.790> mean<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.150> count<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:44.630> know<00:02:44.690> one<00:02:45.020> two<00:02:45.290> three

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
I mean I count you know one two three

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.040 
I mean I count you know one two three
four<00:02:46.220> five<00:02:46.550> six<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:47.570> I've<00:02:47.690> got<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.930> get<00:02:47.990> a

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
four five six and so I've got to get a

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.420 
four five six and so I've got to get a
little<00:02:48.230> bit<00:02:48.320> away<00:02:48.500> from<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:48.770> and<00:02:49.130> Linda's

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
little bit away from that and Linda's

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.550 
little bit away from that and Linda's
got<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.820> sort<00:02:50.030> of<00:02:50.120> do<00:02:50.690> better<00:02:50.930> with<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.230> county

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
got to sort of do better with the county

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.949 
got to sort of do better with the county
so<00:02:51.860> we're<00:02:52.280> sort<00:02:52.459> of<00:02:52.550> compromise<00:02:53.360> on<00:02:53.570> that<00:02:53.750> but

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
so we're sort of compromise on that but

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.110 
so we're sort of compromise on that but
there's<00:02:54.140> still<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.320> lot<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.530> fun<00:02:54.740> learning

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
there's still a lot of fun learning

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.710 
there's still a lot of fun learning

and<00:03:13.060> I'll<00:03:14.060> be<00:03:14.240> honest<00:03:14.510> that<00:03:14.630> is<00:03:14.690> probably<00:03:15.320> the

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
and I'll be honest that is probably the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.380 
and I'll be honest that is probably the
most<00:03:15.830> difficult<00:03:16.100> thing<00:03:16.640> that<00:03:16.820> I<00:03:17.060> have<00:03:17.180> had<00:03:17.360> to

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
most difficult thing that I have had to

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.600 
most difficult thing that I have had to
learn<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:17.900> do<00:03:18.050> but<00:03:18.680> what<00:03:19.190> has<00:03:19.370> happened

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
learn to do but what has happened

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.150 
learn to do but what has happened
because<00:03:20.030> of<00:03:20.180> Shawn's<00:03:20.540> instruction<00:03:21.230> is<00:03:21.440> Bill

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
because of Shawn's instruction is Bill

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.190 
because of Shawn's instruction is Bill
has<00:03:22.489> learned<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:23.030> be<00:03:23.239> a<00:03:23.269> very<00:03:23.630> strong<00:03:23.930> leader

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
has learned to be a very strong leader

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.640 
has learned to be a very strong leader
so<00:03:24.560> now<00:03:24.860> when<00:03:25.670> I<00:03:26.030> want<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.810> do<00:03:26.930> what<00:03:27.110> I<00:03:27.140> want<00:03:27.560> to

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
he really does have the four point

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.240 
he really does have the four point
connection<00:03:37.850> that<00:03:38.420> makes<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:39.230> really<00:03:39.709> work<00:03:40.010> so

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
connection that makes it really work so

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.940 
connection that makes it really work so
I<00:03:40.280> really<00:03:40.670> know<00:03:40.900> exactly<00:03:41.900> what<00:03:42.320> direction<00:03:42.650> he
