00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
it's the best thing that I knew that I

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.039 
it's the best thing that I knew that I
thought<00:01:22.860> there's<00:01:23.490> no<00:01:23.549> way<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:24.119> Ponce

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
thought there's no way you can Ponce

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.190 
thought there's no way you can Ponce
around<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> streets<00:01:25.920> like<00:01:26.549> me<00:01:26.820> if<00:01:27.150> if<00:01:28.020> you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
around the streets like me if if you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.719 
around the streets like me if if you
