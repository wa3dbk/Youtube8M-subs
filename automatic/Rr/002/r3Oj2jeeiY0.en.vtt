to pick up a full playset of them I was
thinking<00:02:04.859> maybe<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.130> getting<00:02:05.520> one<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.789> each

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
thinking maybe just getting one of each

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.730 
thinking maybe just getting one of each
number<00:02:06.299> cards<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.780> playset<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.259> each<00:02:07.380> I

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
number cards have a playset of each I

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.490 
number cards have a playset of each I
might<00:02:08.220> make<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.490> little<00:02:08.520> bit<00:02:08.729> easier<00:02:09.060> and

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
might make it a little bit easier and

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.750 
might make it a little bit easier and
less<00:02:10.500> time-consuming<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.280> guess<00:02:11.460> I<00:02:11.580> don't<00:02:11.700> know

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760
