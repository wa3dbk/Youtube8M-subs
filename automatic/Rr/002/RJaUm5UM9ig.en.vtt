00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
create dimension you can do this by

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:44.969

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
hair when I think of doing this I think

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.379 
hair when I think of doing this I think
of<00:00:47.710> a<00:00:47.769> artist<00:00:48.249> drawing<00:00:48.670> a<00:00:48.850> black<00:00:49.089> and<00:00:49.299> white
