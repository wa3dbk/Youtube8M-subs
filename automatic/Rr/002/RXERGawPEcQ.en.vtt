00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.930 

one<00:00:02.680> of<00:00:02.770> the<00:00:02.860> obvious<00:00:03.070> advantages<00:00:03.880> of

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:03.940 
one of the obvious advantages of

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.240 
one of the obvious advantages of
capturing<00:00:04.600> images<00:00:04.840> in<00:00:05.290> the<00:00:05.380> raw<00:00:05.529> format<00:00:06.069> is

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.250 
capturing images in the raw format is

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.130 
capturing images in the raw format is
that<00:00:06.880> when<00:00:07.000> we<00:00:07.090> capture<00:00:07.300> images<00:00:07.870> in<00:00:08.050> this

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.140 
that when we capture images in this

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.169 
that when we capture images in this
format<00:00:08.530> we<00:00:08.680> have<00:00:08.889> a<00:00:08.920> lot<00:00:09.280> of<00:00:09.309> information

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:10.179 
format we have a lot of information

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.209 
format we have a lot of information
therefore<00:00:10.780> we<00:00:10.870> can<00:00:11.049> process<00:00:11.440> the<00:00:11.799> images<00:00:12.160> and

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:12.219 
therefore we can process the images and

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:13.890 
therefore we can process the images and
a<00:00:12.400> little<00:00:12.669> bit<00:00:12.790> more<00:00:12.969> of<00:00:13.059> an<00:00:13.150> aggressive<00:00:13.240> way

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
a little bit more of an aggressive way

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.650 
a little bit more of an aggressive way
now<00:00:14.620> as<00:00:14.769> I<00:00:14.860> mentioned<00:00:14.889> previously

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
now as I mentioned previously

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.940 
now as I mentioned previously
unfortunately<00:00:16.660> I<00:00:16.690> really<00:00:16.990> under<00:00:17.289> expose<00:00:17.710> this

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
unfortunately I really under expose this

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.009 
unfortunately I really under expose this
image<00:00:18.340> but<00:00:18.910> what<00:00:19.029> I<00:00:19.090> want<00:00:19.180> to<00:00:19.269> do<00:00:19.420> is<00:00:19.449> open<00:00:19.750> this

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:20.019 
image but what I want to do is open this

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.050 
image but what I want to do is open this
image<00:00:20.320> up<00:00:20.500> in<00:00:20.680> adobe<00:00:21.039> camera<00:00:21.220> raw<00:00:21.369> as<00:00:21.820> we've

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
image up in adobe camera raw as we've

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.480 
image up in adobe camera raw as we've
done<00:00:22.269> so<00:00:22.510> here<00:00:22.869> and<00:00:23.380> begin<00:00:23.650> to<00:00:23.769> take<00:00:23.980> a<00:00:24.010> look<00:00:24.340> at

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
done so here and begin to take a look at

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.790 
done so here and begin to take a look at
how<00:00:24.670> I<00:00:24.699> can<00:00:24.970> make<00:00:25.179> some<00:00:25.390> improvements<00:00:26.140> now

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
how I can make some improvements now

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.679 
how I can make some improvements now
before<00:00:27.189> I<00:00:27.220> make<00:00:27.460> my<00:00:27.490> improvements<00:00:28.390> I<00:00:28.480> want<00:00:28.630> to

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
before I make my improvements I want to

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.380 
before I make my improvements I want to
analyze<00:00:29.199> the<00:00:29.380> histogram<00:00:29.949> now<00:00:30.519> visually<00:00:31.210> this

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
analyze the histogram now visually this

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.150 
analyze the histogram now visually this
image<00:00:31.689> looks<00:00:31.929> underexposed<00:00:32.590> but<00:00:32.830> it<00:00:32.920> also

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
image looks underexposed but it also

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.860 
image looks underexposed but it also
looks<00:00:33.580> under<00:00:33.820> exposed<00:00:34.210> by<00:00:34.450> way<00:00:34.660> of<00:00:34.690> the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
looks under exposed by way of the

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.230 
looks under exposed by way of the
histogram<00:00:35.410> here<00:00:35.650> you<00:00:36.280> can<00:00:36.430> see<00:00:36.610> that<00:00:36.760> all<00:00:37.000> the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.240 
histogram here you can see that all the

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.230 
histogram here you can see that all the
data<00:00:37.510> leans<00:00:38.050> over<00:00:38.410> to<00:00:38.590> the<00:00:38.800> left<00:00:39.130> what<00:00:39.910> we<00:00:40.030> want

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.240 
data leans over to the left what we want

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.150 
data leans over to the left what we want
to<00:00:40.330> have<00:00:40.480> is<00:00:40.660> this<00:00:40.780> data<00:00:41.050> typically<00:00:41.560> equally

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
to have is this data typically equally

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.190 
to have is this data typically equally
distributed<00:00:42.790> around<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:43.510> entirety<00:00:44.050> of<00:00:44.080> this

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
distributed around the entirety of this

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.860 
distributed around the entirety of this
histogram<00:00:44.560> so<00:00:45.550> sometimes<00:00:46.090> we<00:00:46.300> may<00:00:46.450> look<00:00:46.630> at<00:00:46.780> an

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
histogram so sometimes we may look at an

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.290 
histogram so sometimes we may look at an
image<00:00:47.020> and<00:00:47.410> not<00:00:47.560> be<00:00:47.770> sure<00:00:48.040> is<00:00:48.310> this<00:00:48.550> off<00:00:48.790> or<00:00:49.120> not

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
image and not be sure is this off or not

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.780 
image and not be sure is this off or not
the<00:00:49.600> histogram<00:00:50.110> helps<00:00:50.920> to<00:00:51.070> start<00:00:51.310> us<00:00:51.460> evaluate

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
the histogram helps to start us evaluate

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.120 
the histogram helps to start us evaluate
that<00:00:52.300> now<00:00:53.080> one<00:00:53.260> of<00:00:53.290> the<00:00:53.410> first<00:00:53.740> things<00:00:53.860> we

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
that now one of the first things we

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.950 
that now one of the first things we
might<00:00:54.280> want<00:00:54.520> to<00:00:54.610> do<00:00:54.820> with<00:00:55.210> an<00:00:55.360> image<00:00:55.690> like<00:00:55.720> this

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
might want to do with an image like this

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.770 
might want to do with an image like this
is<00:00:56.410> simply<00:00:56.770> apply<00:00:57.250> some<00:00:57.550> auto<00:00:57.790> adjustments

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
is simply apply some auto adjustments

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.750 
is simply apply some auto adjustments
here<00:00:59.050> to<00:00:59.470> try<00:00:59.740> to<00:00:59.800> get<00:00:59.980> this<00:01:00.160> image<00:01:00.430> at<00:01:00.700> a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
here to try to get this image at a

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.760 
here to try to get this image at a
better<00:01:01.000> starting<00:01:01.510> point<00:01:01.810> there<00:01:02.500> are<00:01:02.590> a<00:01:02.620> couple

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
better starting point there are a couple

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.410 
better starting point there are a couple
of<00:01:02.980> different<00:01:03.310> ways<00:01:03.340> that<00:01:03.670> we<00:01:03.790> can<00:01:03.970> do<00:01:04.210> that

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
of different ways that we can do that

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.419 
of different ways that we can do that
one<00:01:05.140> technique<00:01:05.350> that<00:01:05.680> we<00:01:05.770> can<00:01:05.950> use<00:01:05.979> is<00:01:06.310> to

00:01:06.419 --> 00:01:06.429 
one technique that we can use is to

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:08.969 
one technique that we can use is to
simply<00:01:06.789> click<00:01:07.030> on<00:01:07.179> the<00:01:07.240> auto<00:01:07.539> button<00:01:07.990> or<00:01:08.469> we

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
simply click on the auto button or we

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.039 
simply click on the auto button or we
can<00:01:09.159> press<00:01:09.369> a<00:01:09.399> shortcut<00:01:10.030> this<00:01:10.659> is<00:01:10.840> one<00:01:11.020> of

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
can press a shortcut this is one of

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:12.389 
can press a shortcut this is one of
those<00:01:11.170> shortcuts<00:01:11.619> I<00:01:11.799> think<00:01:12.009> you<00:01:12.130> want<00:01:12.340> to

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
those shortcuts I think you want to

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.039 
those shortcuts I think you want to
write<00:01:12.549> down<00:01:12.759> because<00:01:13.149> it's<00:01:13.329> a<00:01:13.420> significant

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
write down because it's a significant

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.050 
write down because it's a significant
one<00:01:14.170> that<00:01:14.799> can<00:01:14.950> really<00:01:15.159> help<00:01:15.369> out<00:01:15.640> now<00:01:15.670> it's

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
one that can really help out now it's

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.270 
one that can really help out now it's
not<00:01:16.240> going<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.479> make<00:01:16.570> your<00:01:16.750> image<00:01:17.170> perfect<00:01:17.770> but

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
not going to make your image perfect but

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.219 
not going to make your image perfect but
it<00:01:18.369> can<00:01:18.549> be<00:01:18.700> a<00:01:18.729> good<00:01:18.969> starting<00:01:19.390> point<00:01:19.600> the

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
it can be a good starting point the

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.160 
it can be a good starting point the
shortcut<00:01:20.770> on<00:01:20.859> a<00:01:20.890> Mac<00:01:21.219> is<00:01:21.460> command<00:01:21.969> you<00:01:22.299> on<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.630> pc

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
shortcut on a Mac is command you on a pc

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.679 
shortcut on a Mac is command you on a pc
that's<00:01:23.409> control<00:01:24.009> you<00:01:24.280> now<00:01:25.090> when<00:01:25.240> you<00:01:25.329> press

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
that's control you now when you press

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:27.959 
that's control you now when you press
that<00:01:25.719> it's<00:01:26.200> equivalent<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:27.070> clicking<00:01:27.520> on<00:01:27.640> auto

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
that it's equivalent to clicking on auto

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.389 
that it's equivalent to clicking on auto
now<00:01:28.840> right<00:01:29.200> from<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:29.499> get-go<00:01:29.740> we<00:01:30.039> can<00:01:30.189> see

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
now right from the get-go we can see

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.160 
now right from the get-go we can see
that<00:01:30.520> yes<00:01:30.819> you<00:01:31.060> know<00:01:31.149> what<00:01:31.240> this<00:01:31.420> image<00:01:31.840> does

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
that yes you know what this image does

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.499 
that yes you know what this image does
have<00:01:32.439> potential<00:01:32.909> otherwise<00:01:33.909> when<00:01:34.149> I<00:01:34.179> first

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
have potential otherwise when I first

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.020 
have potential otherwise when I first
looked<00:01:34.749> at<00:01:34.960> it<00:01:35.140> it<00:01:35.590> didn't<00:01:36.009> look<00:01:36.280> very<00:01:36.520> good<00:01:36.670> I

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
looked at it it didn't look very good I

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.730 
looked at it it didn't look very good I
might<00:01:37.299> have<00:01:37.390> even<00:01:37.509> have<00:01:37.749> deleted<00:01:38.229> that<00:01:38.350> file

had<00:01:39.039> I<00:01:39.069> not<00:01:39.249> really<00:01:39.490> been<00:01:39.700> thinking<00:01:40.119> about<00:01:40.240> how

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
had I not really been thinking about how

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.800 
had I not really been thinking about how
I<00:01:40.630> could<00:01:40.960> tap<00:01:41.259> into<00:01:41.460> Adobe<00:01:42.460> Camera<00:01:42.700> Raw<00:01:42.969> now<00:01:43.689> of

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
I could tap into Adobe Camera Raw now of

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.230 
I could tap into Adobe Camera Raw now of
course<00:01:43.869> I<00:01:44.229> also<00:01:44.469> have<00:01:44.889> to<00:01:44.920> say<00:01:45.130> that<00:01:45.340> not<00:01:46.060> all

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
course I also have to say that not all

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.849 
course I also have to say that not all
of<00:01:46.359> your<00:01:46.509> images<00:01:46.689> are<00:01:47.139> going<00:01:47.289> to<00:01:47.350> need<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.710> have

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
of your images are going to need to have

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:49.830 
of your images are going to need to have
this<00:01:48.039> adjustment<00:01:48.609> applied<00:01:48.909> but<00:01:49.569> in<00:01:49.689> certain

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
this adjustment applied but in certain

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.959 
this adjustment applied but in certain
situations<00:01:50.139> this<00:01:51.009> auto<00:01:51.249> adjustment<00:01:51.850> can

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
situations this auto adjustment can

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:53.849 
situations this auto adjustment can
really<00:01:52.210> help<00:01:52.359> out<00:01:52.600> well<00:01:53.409> now<00:01:53.499> let's<00:01:53.679> take<00:01:53.829> a

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
really help out well now let's take a

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:55.679 
really help out well now let's take a
look<00:01:54.100> at<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.280> histogram<00:01:54.609> well<00:01:55.299> here<00:01:55.450> we<00:01:55.539> can

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
look at the histogram well here we can

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:56.969 
look at the histogram well here we can
see<00:01:55.840> that<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.079> tones<00:01:56.350> are<00:01:56.560> evenly

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
see that the tones are evenly

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.879 
see that the tones are evenly
distributed<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.789> much<00:01:58.240> better<00:01:58.539> exposure<00:01:59.079> all

00:01:59.879 --> 00:01:59.889 
distributed a much better exposure all

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:01.379 
distributed a much better exposure all
right<00:02:00.130> well<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.399> next<00:02:00.729> step<00:02:00.939> is<00:02:01.060> going<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:01.329> be

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:01.389 
right well the next step is going to be

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:03.749 
right well the next step is going to be
the<00:02:01.600> white<00:02:01.869> balance<00:02:02.109> this<00:02:02.409> photograph<00:02:02.950> we<00:02:03.549> can

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
the white balance this photograph we can

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.090 
the white balance this photograph we can
do<00:02:03.999> so<00:02:04.270> by<00:02:04.450> selecting<00:02:04.509> our<00:02:05.170> tool<00:02:05.409> up<00:02:05.679> here<00:02:05.920> in

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
do so by selecting our tool up here in

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
on a neutral point in the image and then

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.600 
on a neutral point in the image and then
successfully<00:02:11.170> white<00:02:11.350> balance<00:02:11.770> it<00:02:11.950> I'll<00:02:12.430> go
