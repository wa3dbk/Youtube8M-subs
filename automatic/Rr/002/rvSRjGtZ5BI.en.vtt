00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
Since my original ombre color has gone from a nice vibrant peacock green

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.260
to more of a swamp green, I decided last night that it would be a good idea to dye my hair  

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.120
this lovely shade of turquoise... and it turned out great. 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.954
Yeah... I'm totally f*cking with you guys. 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.020
So even though I have half of a bottle of the Beyond the Zone "Tripped Up Turquoise" left, there is obviously  

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.713
nothing that has been done to my hair. The original plan was to dye over these green ends

00:00:30.713 --> 00:00:36.294
and also go up these caramel highlights that I have because my roots are growing in with a vengance. 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.760
And that went over swimmingly well.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.020
The undersides of my thumbs are dyed blue, this towel is dyed blue, various bits of my tub

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.614
have blue splats on them, but NOTHING ended up in my hair, which is REALLY frustrating.

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:57.060
And I don't know why, but I guess it is because I'm a cheapskate and didn't want to pay

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.414
the $4 difference between this brand (around $6.50) and the Manic Panic ($10 or $11),

00:01:02.414 --> 00:01:08.174
it was really dumb of me to do that. Tonight I'm actually going to give it a second chance 

00:01:08.174 --> 00:01:13.467
and instead of following the directions, like I did before, which said let it process for 10-20 mintues

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:18.500
for desired intensity (I went with 15 and I got nothing), I'm actually going to leave it

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.114
on for a few HOURS. So... let's go ahead and do this and hopefully my thoughts on this product will change. 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.800
*glove snaps*

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.740
Und now, vee vait *crappy German accent*

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.400
No, but for real... I am going to be leaving this on for as long as humanly possible. 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.835
And since I am the oldest 21 year old on the face of the planet, I start to get ready for bed at about 8pm

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.260
so I'm going to stretch my boundaries and stay up until *dramatic gasp* 10 o'clock tonight 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.614
just so I can get four full hours of processing time.

00:01:53.614 --> 00:02:00.593
I'll see you guys after I wash all of this off at, like, 10-something. Until then... enjoy my Smurf-y fingers.

00:02:00.593 --> 00:02:08.093
After 4 excruciatingly boring hours, and THE coldest shower I've ever taken in 

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:13.634
October in order to preserve any color that may have stuck on my hair, this is the end result. 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.440
... and it is not super amazing. 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.680
Yes, my hair is darker than it was prior, and all of this caramel stuff in my hair has been

00:02:24.684 --> 00:02:30.733
dyed over, but you have to keep in mind that this said it should be on your hair for 10-20 MINUTES,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.380
NOT 4 hours. 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.180
If you actually go by their directions, you will get absolutely NO result. None whatsoever. 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.174
And honestly, I didn't even wait to wash all of this out of my hair. It was still kind of running blue by the time

00:02:46.174 --> 00:02:50.074
I got out. I just wanted to preserve any color that was still there, and you can bet your buttons

00:02:50.074 --> 00:02:53.080
that I'm gonna be sleeping in a disposable shower cap tonight, because I really don't 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.100
want anything that is on here transferring to my nice white pillows. 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.380
Also, I wasn't able to come out of this ordeal without looking at least a little like

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.980
Dr. Tobias Fuenke. My hands are blue, my knees are blue, the back of my feet are blue, there are

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.152
various other body parts that have been miraculously stained blue just by me standing

00:03:13.152 --> 00:03:14.872
in the shower and having that wash out of my hair

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:23.240
So this has been a huge nightmare. Thank God it was inexpensive at around $6.50.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.160
I know exactly where I'm putting this. 

00:03:29.195 --> 00:03:29.835
Goodbye!
