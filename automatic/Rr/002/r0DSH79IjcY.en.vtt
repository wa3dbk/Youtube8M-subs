00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
we first did this test on her even the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.779 
we first did this test on her even the
first<00:01:01.079> two<00:01:01.289> days<00:01:01.320> she<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.129> fell<00:01:02.399> straight

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
first two days she just fell straight

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.470 
first two days she just fell straight
back<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.329> doing

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.620 

very<00:01:09.260> solid<00:01:09.670> is<00:01:10.670> that<00:01:10.850> different<00:01:11.330> oh

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
very solid is that different oh

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.620 
very solid is that different oh
definitely<00:01:13.630> yeah<00:01:14.630> you<00:01:14.690> really<00:01:15.500> were<00:01:16.630> drifting

definitely yeah you really were drifting
backwards<00:01:17.960> even<00:01:18.620> with<00:01:18.830> light<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:20.000> pull<00:01:20.960> test

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
backwards even with light a pull test

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.240 
backwards even with light a pull test
and<00:01:22.030> because<00:01:23.030> I<00:01:23.210> tap<00:01:23.630> just<00:01:24.110> to<00:01:24.230> tap<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:24.800> your

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
and because I tap just to tap you your

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.870 
and because I tap just to tap you your
your<00:01:25.610> your<00:01:26.360> balance<00:01:26.840> was<00:01:27.050> very<00:01:27.290> very<00:01:27.710> off<00:01:27.950> and

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
your your balance was very very off and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.160 
your your balance was very very off and
very<00:01:29.720> steady<00:01:30.140> today<00:01:30.440> with<00:01:30.950> with<00:01:31.280> testing<00:01:32.170> is

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
very steady today with with testing is

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.080 
very steady today with with testing is
what<00:01:33.440> people<00:01:33.620> you've<00:01:34.100> done<00:01:34.370> with<00:01:34.790> a<00:01:35.860> chance<00:01:37.090> is

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
what people you've done with a chance is

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.630 
what people you've done with a chance is
we've<00:01:38.420> you've<00:01:39.200> regulated<00:01:40.190> her<00:01:40.340> brain's

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
we've you've regulated her brain's

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.020 
we've you've regulated her brain's
ability<00:01:40.820> to<00:01:41.300> oxygen<00:01:42.790> reestablished<00:01:43.790> more

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.410 

connected<00:01:47.869> system<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:48.740> tubular<00:01:49.420> area

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
connected system to this tubular area

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.940 
connected system to this tubular area
which<00:01:50.600> is<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.900> organs<00:01:51.320> in<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.530> year<00:01:51.799> that

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
which is the organs in the year that

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.660 
which is the organs in the year that
allow<00:01:52.250> us<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.700> have<00:01:53.030> balance<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:55.130> she's

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
allow us to have balance and so she's

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.149 
allow us to have balance and so she's
much<00:01:55.880> better

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
much better

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.590 
much better
what<00:01:57.460> we<00:01:57.579> want<00:01:57.759> to<00:01:57.820> do<00:01:57.939> is<00:01:58.060> want<00:01:58.299> to<00:01:58.390> drive

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
what we want to do is want to drive

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.620 
what we want to do is want to drive
these<00:01:58.810> patterns<00:01:59.200> it's<00:02:00.069> pathways<00:02:00.579> for<00:02:00.850> her<00:02:00.999> so

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
these patterns it's pathways for her so

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.510 
these patterns it's pathways for her so
that<00:02:01.749> she<00:02:01.929> stays<00:02:02.229> that<00:02:02.259> way<00:02:02.530> she<00:02:03.039> gets<00:02:03.069> even

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
that she stays that way she gets even

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.999 
that she stays that way she gets even
more<00:02:03.749> or<00:02:04.749> bets<00:02:04.960> going<00:02:05.109> to<00:02:05.200> prevent<00:02:05.590> lots<00:02:05.829> of

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
more or bets going to prevent lots of

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.460 
more or bets going to prevent lots of
Falls<00:02:06.840> injuries<00:02:07.840> it's<00:02:08.049> one<00:02:08.200> of<00:02:08.289> the<00:02:08.349> most

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
Falls injuries it's one of the most

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.130 
Falls injuries it's one of the most
common<00:02:08.950> costs<00:02:09.849> of<00:02:09.970> broken<00:02:10.330> bones<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.750> broken

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
common costs of broken bones and broken

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.820 
common costs of broken bones and broken
femurs<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:11.860> people<00:02:12.370> over<00:02:12.580> 65<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.560> this<00:02:14.680> is

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
femurs and people over 65 and so this is

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.320 
femurs and people over 65 and so this is
really<00:02:15.010> important<00:02:15.489> this<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.090> platform

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
really important this is the platform

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.610 
really important this is the platform
that<00:02:16.840> we<00:02:17.019> did<00:02:17.200> it's<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.400> bir<00:02:18.879> tek<00:02:19.620> balanced

this he ellipse was huge it was about

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.960 
this he ellipse was huge it was about
five<00:02:31.390> times<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:32.079> size<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.920> where<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.879> is
