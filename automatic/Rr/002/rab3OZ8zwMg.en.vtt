00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.110
 regards 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.760
 if you want you already know that for now 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.390
 comment here below and in the next 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.390
 video I did not love and that's why 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.720
 that I really needed to share and 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:58.180
 well in this time you've heard a lot 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:06.700
 about micellar water look for that is a 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:08.950
 micellar water micelles is a liquid for 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.710
 that we do not go so fast the same 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.660
 allow an insoluble liquid to 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.900
 dissolve training in miserable 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.950
 It allows to remove fat and among many 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.770
 other things that contain the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.710
 so 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.710
 for me as an exception 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.710
 There are few options and their costs are 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.649
 quite elevated 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.649
 so 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:53.960
 and did not know someone who has sold 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.210
 This brand does not think it is xavi can 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.490
 try to take them into account when you see the 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.979
 price of this micellar water is that it 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.020
 they have nothing compared to other 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.060
 waters or solar that are are in the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.560
 market and they are much more expensive and that 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.869
 only 50 is like in places 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.239
 specific and that the truth is that the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.280
 price range if it shoots a lot 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.459
 in the presentation of the product I 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.700
 It looked beautiful see you like this in this little box 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.980
 beautiful and brings 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.460
 There has been an instruction on the use of 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.209
 process 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:30.010
 but no 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.349
 and this I have already tried 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.709
 and let's say it's a project that to me 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:39.200
 love it surprises me quite and 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:41.030
 he really does not ask anything to anything else 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.209
 do not make us the skin does not leave a 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.430
 Soda sensation is an easy 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.489
 apply since they do not require szaggars 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.319
 then it's super easy how many times 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.540
 meat, cotton and have a roll 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.920
 the water accelerate and it's super indicated 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.459
 for sensitive skin since 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.459
 they contain very few things and at least 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.870
 better skin quality 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.959
 The truth is that I do notice a lot of skin 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.209
 more eliminated and completely clean already 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.340
 continue as the islands act as 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.370
 little magnets what he does is like 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.400
 eliminate and remove from the pretty everything 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.310
 which is fat society up excess of 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.069
 contamination of truth that extract it 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.550
 of your skin and your skin is completely 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:30.680
 clean refreshes you bleed and yamena 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.830
 it's also micellar water gives me a 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.049
 feeling of a more luminous skin a 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.790
 skin that looks young and looks healthy 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.970
 It really surprised me 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.069
 very much I use it at night and 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.630
 I love you can also explain 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.640
 for the day but good me at night 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.640
 I prefer that my skin than perfectly 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.130
 clean and me micellar water has 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.560
 delighted in Mexico in the market there is no 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.700
 like how much enough but good is 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.120
 an option that I found the data is 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.120
 magical 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.620
 questions about the products and 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.990
 He asks that the company asks that she 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.870
 I answered 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:17.290
 and those are good things to 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.290
 people 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:31.100
 it is because it is because it does not use 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.150
 tmf chemicals are the chemicals of gm 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.160
 r 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.320
 these chemicals in the cosmetic industry 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.180
 they are the mutagenic carcinogenic chemicals 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.940
 dangerous for the resolution then 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.760
 all the products were here 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.590
 are free of these chemicals then 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.530
 like that is very fine and this tempered 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.260
 as he begins to taste many of his 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:58.520
 products where I am delighted with 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:00.560
 this water the truth and where you live 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.270
 perhaps to see how so many options 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.699
 micellar water I really recommend you 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.340
 is your expression is excellent for the 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.550
 quantity of products that it brings and for 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.050
 the benefits that you will see in your skin 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.509
 since he remembers that a skin that is 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.940
 cleans a skin that cares for it is a skin 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:19.490
 that will require less makeup than 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.979
 makeup is the most beautiful city and 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.449
 well you know that this is like a 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.699
 new section that I want to make 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.440
 at least one day a week make a 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.710
 change a product that really 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.349

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.460

 where these two pictures of everything that I 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.670
 I find that is how they installed me 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:14.000
 staff and like there's so much mix of 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:17.870
 everything a little between schools between 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.220
