00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:09.810
 hello today I'll show you how 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.730
 make a dessert for mom to 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.520
 surprise her this May 10 is a 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.199
 malted that I hope you like it good 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.030
 let's see what ingredients we need 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.420
 and whatever 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.250
 what we are going to need is ice cream can 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.030
 be the quantity and taste that you 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.550
 you want milk 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:32.390
 a glass or container where to put our 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.930
 malted a spoon and if you want something 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.680
 to decorate it like cinnamon or confectionery 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.330
 and we're going to need a good blender 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.160
 let's see how the first thing we're going to 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:47.500
 to do is take the ice cream and go to 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.500
 empty it in our blender 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.270
 let's take all the reserved ice cream 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.470
 one or two tablespoons now we're going to 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.470
 drink milk 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.720
 and we're going to incorporate it 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.590
 but not much so that we do not stay very 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.149
 watery 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.939
 we want us to have one 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.939
 creamy consistency and we will liquefy it 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.950
 let's see that everything is already frothy and 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.770
 if you want you can add more ice cream or 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.820
 more milk now in our container or 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.650
 glass we are going to 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.650
 put the ice cream that was left over 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.920
 let's empty our shake 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.520
 and if we want we can sprinkle a 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.659
 little cinnamon powder just to give 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.830
 flavor or some 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.500
 confectionery pieces 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.060
 so it's a delicious dessert that 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.060
 you can give the mam and this May 10 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.660
 good and finally I forgot a 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.890
 greeting for my new facebook friend 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.330
