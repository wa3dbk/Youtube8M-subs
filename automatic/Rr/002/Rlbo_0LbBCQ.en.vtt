00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.809
 plus 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.660
 They can talk dolphins can 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.510
 decipher what the dolphins say to 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.430
 humans this is something that is already going 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.070
 to be able to come true because it has 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.660
 invented a mechanism an instrument 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.970
 called top scouts that consists of 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.089
 decipher those wave species that 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.270
 dolphins emit to be able to translate 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.460
 the to the human language as well you know 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.410
 the dolphins are one of the most 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.050
 intelligent of living beings that there are in 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.690
 the planet earth have even many 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.970
 more neurons than the human being have a 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.820
 brain twice as big in proportion 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.760
 to his body that the human being so in 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.910
 many aspects surpass us perhaps in the 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.070
 only that no, not that they do not surpass us 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.400
 it is in the presence of arms and others 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.200
 but you have to remember that they are 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.689
 aquatic animals are animals 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.830
 aquatic and do not need the presence of 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.710
 hands need 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.479
 fins to move with more speed 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.480
 let's say they have simply adapted 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.440
 to the environment but not having hands 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.410
 means that 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.360
 fools the dolphins after having 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.330
 used this apparatus called gap 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.730
 scouts have been shown to have a 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.280
 very complex language a language that 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.340
 are trying to decipher as if 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.800
 will Egyptian hieroglyphics a 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.170
 language in which every little sound 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.880
 depending on when you make the type 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.300
 of sound and the frequency of that 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.500
 sound can mean a greeting a 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.300
 I reject samples of affection 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.950
 this shows that the dolphins in 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.380
 reality they communicate like the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.030
 humans who use another type of 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.340
 language does not mean that you do not 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.100
 communicate they communicate in a way 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.510
 very varied using all kinds of 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.130
 words or sounds for them that they do not 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.110
 they are understandable to the human being but 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.560
 that is expected in the future to be 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.830
 understandable at the moment is being 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.250
 is still working on the tough task of 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:17.160
 decipher each of these sounds is 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.830
 anticipates that within a few years thanks to 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.870
 This machine is created another capable machine 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.600
 to make the same sounds as 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.910
 dolphins so we can talk to them 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.430
 in order to maintain a dialogue of being 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.409
 human with dolphin 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.019
 it's amazing to see how science advances 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:37.230
 and it allows us to know more and more of 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.799
 near the curious intelligence of these 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.799
 living beings
