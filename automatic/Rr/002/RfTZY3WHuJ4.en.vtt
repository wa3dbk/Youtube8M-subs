put on it feels like

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.300

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
it's really um easy to blend but now

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.070 
it's really um easy to blend but now
it's<00:02:14.550> getting<00:02:14.760> more<00:02:14.970> like<00:02:16.430> thickening<00:02:17.430> and

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
it's getting more like thickening and

lipstick there but as you can see it's

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.360 
lipstick there but as you can see it's
not<00:03:18.900> really<00:03:21.230> does<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.350> provide<00:03:22.680> coverage<00:03:23.160> on

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
not really does it provide coverage on

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.020 
not really does it provide coverage on
my<00:03:23.549> face<00:03:23.820> looks<00:03:24.239> glowy<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.980> gives<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.489> dewy

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
my face looks glowy so it gives a dewy

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.259

glow<00:03:27.450> which<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:27.900> kind<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.410> nice<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:29.269> basically

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
glow which is kind of nice so basically

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.800 
glow which is kind of nice so basically
I<00:03:30.390> think<00:03:30.690> this<00:03:30.840> is<00:03:31.019> more<00:03:31.230> um<00:03:32.390> I've<00:03:33.390> just<00:03:33.450> a

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
I think this is more um I've just a

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.410 
I think this is more um I've just a
moisturizer<00:03:34.380> because<00:03:34.829> it's<00:03:35.400> not<00:03:35.850> really<00:03:36.209> I

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
moisturizer because it's not really I

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.240 
moisturizer because it's not really I
wouldn't<00:03:36.720> even<00:03:36.780> let<00:03:37.530> me<00:03:37.620> just<00:03:37.799> fix<00:03:37.920> my<00:03:38.070> hair

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
wouldn't even let me just fix my hair

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.039 
wouldn't even let me just fix my hair
here<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.549> wouldn't<00:03:38.790> even<00:03:38.970> consider<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.690> really

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
here I wouldn't even consider it really

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.180 
here I wouldn't even consider it really
um<00:03:40.760> like<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.970> tinted<00:03:42.510> moisturizer<00:03:42.840> because<00:03:43.799> it

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
um like a tinted moisturizer because it

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.789 
um like a tinted moisturizer because it
doesn't<00:03:44.670> really<00:03:44.880> it<00:03:45.870> says<00:03:46.109> light<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.620> medium

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
doesn't really it says light to medium

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.289 
doesn't really it says light to medium
but<00:03:47.400> um<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.980> can't<00:03:50.190> see<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.519> on<00:03:50.640> my<00:03:50.790> skin<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.120> I

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
but um you can't see it on my skin and I

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.340 
but um you can't see it on my skin and I
still<00:03:51.570> look<00:03:51.690> very<00:03:51.750> pale<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:53.160> all<00:03:53.850> in<00:03:54.150> all<00:03:54.350> I'm

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
still look very pale so all in all I'm

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.319 
still look very pale so all in all I'm
not<00:03:55.890> really<00:03:56.280> how<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.519> present<00:03:56.700> impressed<00:03:57.150> with

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
not really how to present impressed with

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.449 
not really how to present impressed with
this<00:03:57.450> right<00:03:57.690> now<00:03:57.900> because<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:58.650> feel<00:03:58.950> like<00:03:58.980> in<00:03:59.340> my

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
this right now because I feel like in my

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.069 
this right now because I feel like in my
opinion<00:03:59.850> BB<00:04:00.150> cream<00:04:00.359> should<00:04:00.630> have<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:00.810> bit<00:04:01.049> more

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
opinion BB cream should have a bit more

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.640 
opinion BB cream should have a bit more
coverage<00:04:02.690> because<00:04:03.690> it<00:04:03.840> says<00:04:04.109> that<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.530> is

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
coverage because it says that it is

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.090 
coverage because it says that it is
supposed<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:06.079> cover<00:04:07.079> to<00:04:07.380> help<00:04:07.530> instantly

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
supposed to cover to help instantly

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.890 
supposed to cover to help instantly
improve<00:04:08.400> skin<00:04:08.670> appearance<00:04:09.030> while<00:04:09.389> it<00:04:09.600> didn't

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
improve skin appearance while it didn't

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.110 
improve skin appearance while it didn't
really<00:04:10.319> cover<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.859> just<00:04:10.980> made<00:04:11.400> my<00:04:11.609> skin<00:04:11.910> look

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
really cover it just made my skin look

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.840 
really cover it just made my skin look
glowy<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:13.519> um<00:04:15.919> so<00:04:16.919> I<00:04:16.950> I<00:04:17.190> don't<00:04:17.400> know<00:04:17.579> in<00:04:17.729> my

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
glowy and um so I I don't know in my

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.940 
glowy and um so I I don't know in my
opinion<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.329> should<00:04:18.359> cover<00:04:18.810> more<00:04:19.169> so<00:04:19.560> I<00:04:19.590> don't

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
opinion it should cover more so I don't

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.949 
opinion it should cover more so I don't
know<00:04:20.070> if<00:04:20.159> I'd<00:04:20.250> repurchase<00:04:20.849> this<00:04:21.030> but<00:04:21.299> for<00:04:21.900> a

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
know if I'd repurchase this but for a

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.080 
know if I'd repurchase this but for a
moisturizer<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:22.919> feels<00:04:23.190> really<00:04:23.580> nice<00:04:23.760> now

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
moisturizer it feels really nice now

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.830 
moisturizer it feels really nice now
that<00:04:24.300> it's<00:04:24.419> on<00:04:24.510> my

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
that it's on my

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.980 
that it's on my
skin<00:04:26.150> it<00:04:27.150> doesn't<00:04:27.419> feel<00:04:27.630> like<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.870> have

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
skin it doesn't feel like I have

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.689 
skin it doesn't feel like I have
anything<00:04:28.230> on<00:04:28.440> my<00:04:28.500> skin<00:04:28.860> it<00:04:28.980> just<00:04:29.190> feels<00:04:29.370> like<00:04:29.550> I

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
anything on my skin it just feels like I

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.480 
anything on my skin it just feels like I
put<00:04:29.970> just<00:04:30.240> my<00:04:31.139> regular<00:04:31.590> old<00:04:31.620> moisturizer<00:04:32.340> on

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
put just my regular old moisturizer on

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.900 
put just my regular old moisturizer on
so<00:04:32.880> it's<00:04:33.090> not<00:04:33.330> cakey<00:04:34.169> or<00:04:34.580> anything<00:04:35.580> like<00:04:35.850> that

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
so it's not cakey or anything like that

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.450 
so it's not cakey or anything like that
so<00:04:36.570> basically<00:04:37.110> I<00:04:37.500> would<00:04:37.740> consider<00:04:38.190> this<00:04:38.400> just

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
so basically I would consider this just

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.980 
so basically I would consider this just
a<00:04:39.560> moisturizer<00:04:40.560> because<00:04:41.490> again<00:04:41.880> no<00:04:42.479> coverage

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
a moisturizer because again no coverage

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.810 
a moisturizer because again no coverage
and<00:04:44.810> yeah<00:04:45.810> still<00:04:46.199> no<00:04:46.350> smell<00:04:46.710> I<00:04:47.010> mean<00:04:47.220> I<00:04:47.310> skin

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
and yeah still no smell I mean I skin

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.670 
and yeah still no smell I mean I skin
feels<00:04:48.060> very<00:04:48.240> fresh<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:48.660> hydrated<00:04:49.440> which<00:04:49.530> is

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
feels very fresh and hydrated which is

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.260 
feels very fresh and hydrated which is
nice<00:04:49.889> so<00:04:50.070> I<00:04:50.100> would<00:04:50.310> probably<00:04:50.490> still<00:04:50.970> wear<00:04:51.120> this

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
nice so I would probably still wear this

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.480 
nice so I would probably still wear this
under<00:04:51.570> my<00:04:51.720> makeup<00:04:51.930> but<00:04:52.830> I<00:04:52.860> wouldn't<00:04:53.220> wear<00:04:53.310> this

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
under my makeup but I wouldn't wear this

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.460 
under my makeup but I wouldn't wear this
alone<00:04:53.850> again<00:04:54.180> because<00:04:54.540> there's<00:04:54.810> like<00:04:54.990> no

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
alone again because there's like no

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.740 
alone again because there's like no
coverage<00:04:55.889> so<00:04:56.160> I<00:04:56.370> am<00:04:56.760> gonna<00:04:56.910> do<00:04:57.090> an<00:04:57.210> update<00:04:57.540> for

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
coverage so I am gonna do an update for

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.860 
coverage so I am gonna do an update for
you<00:04:57.840> guys<00:04:57.870> um<00:04:59.660> just<00:05:00.660> to<00:05:00.900> let<00:05:01.500> you<00:05:01.620> know<00:05:01.650> if<00:05:02.870> this

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
because it's a BB cream it's supposed to

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.060 
because it's a BB cream it's supposed to
improve<00:05:09.630> elasticity<00:05:10.229> and<00:05:10.560> all<00:05:10.650> that<00:05:10.830> stuff<00:05:11.040> so

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
what I feel about this but for right now

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.930 
what I feel about this but for right now
I<00:05:16.050> probably<00:05:16.740> wouldn't<00:05:17.130> repurchase<00:05:17.280> this<00:05:17.820> I

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
I probably wouldn't repurchase this I

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.469 
I probably wouldn't repurchase this I
mean<00:05:18.060> this<00:05:18.210> was<00:05:18.389> $13<00:05:19.229> at<00:05:19.500> the<00:05:19.620> drugstore<00:05:20.130> so

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
mean this was $13 at the drugstore so

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.909 
mean this was $13 at the drugstore so
that's<00:05:21.479> kind<00:05:21.750> of<00:05:21.810> expensive<00:05:22.260> for<00:05:22.320> drugstore

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
that's kind of expensive for drugstore

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.210 
that's kind of expensive for drugstore
and<00:05:23.570> for<00:05:24.570> a<00:05:24.600> BB<00:05:24.990> cream<00:05:25.020> I<00:05:25.380> mean<00:05:25.590> it's<00:05:25.770> just<00:05:25.889> like

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
and for a BB cream I mean it's just like

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.029 
and for a BB cream I mean it's just like
a<00:05:26.460> lightweight<00:05:26.729> moisturizer<00:05:27.389> it's<00:05:27.720> not

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
a lightweight moisturizer it's not

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.640 
a lightweight moisturizer it's not
coverage<00:05:29.090> anything<00:05:30.090> so<00:05:30.450> I<00:05:30.690> don't<00:05:31.410> think<00:05:31.530> I

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
coverage anything so I don't think I

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.900 
coverage anything so I don't think I
would<00:05:31.770> recommend<00:05:32.039> this<00:05:32.280> but<00:05:32.490> I'm<00:05:32.580> gonna<00:05:32.729> give

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.210 
would recommend this but I'm gonna give
it<00:05:32.940> give<00:05:33.419> it<00:05:33.450> a<00:05:33.570> try<00:05:33.600> a<00:05:33.810> few<00:05:33.990> more<00:05:34.139> times<00:05:34.410> wear

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220
