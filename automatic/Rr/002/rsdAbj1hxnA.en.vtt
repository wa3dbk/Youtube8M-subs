00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.700 
quick little relic iron farming route
for<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.359> guys<00:00:06.540> if<00:00:06.810> you<00:00:06.930> need<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.259> get<00:00:07.410> relic

iron which eventually you will once you
start<00:00:09.330> getting<00:00:09.360> legendary<00:00:09.929> gear<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:10.380> go<00:00:10.620> over

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
start getting legendary gear so go over

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.539 
start getting legendary gear so go over
to<00:00:11.190> Mars<00:00:11.550> load<00:00:12.450> into<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.960> patrol<00:00:13.559> mission<00:00:14.309> and

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
to Mars load into the patrol mission and

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.210 
to Mars load into the patrol mission and
follow<00:00:15.509> this<00:00:15.660> route<00:00:15.900> over<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> farming

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
follow this route over to the farming

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.550 
follow this route over to the farming
location<00:00:17.940> i<00:00:18.060> believe<00:00:18.300> it's<00:00:18.539> located<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.380> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
location i believe it's located in the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.470 
location i believe it's located in the
scablands<00:00:19.980> i<00:00:20.460> believe<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.789> style<00:00:21.090> yes<00:00:21.270> they

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
scablands i believe that style yes they

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.330 
scablands i believe that style yes they
write<00:00:21.600> their<00:00:21.689> scablands<00:00:22.020> okay<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:23.189> head<00:00:23.310> over

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
write their scablands okay so head over

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.060 
write their scablands okay so head over
to<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.609> scablands<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.949> essentially<00:00:25.949> you're

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
to the scablands and essentially you're

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.439 
to the scablands and essentially you're
going<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.250> follow<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.609> route<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.180> want

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
going to follow this route so you want

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.109 
going to follow this route so you want
to<00:00:27.510> check<00:00:27.720> all<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.170> buildings<00:00:28.560> around<00:00:28.680> here

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
to check all the buildings around here

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.939 
to check all the buildings around here
look<00:00:30.119> around<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.539> make<00:00:30.660> sure<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.990> can<00:00:31.199> check

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
look around and make sure you can check

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.920 
look around and make sure you can check
every<00:00:32.430> corner<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:33.030> try<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.270> find<00:00:33.480> chess

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
every corner to try to find chess

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.979 
every corner to try to find chess
essentially<00:00:34.500> chess<00:00:34.800> will<00:00:35.070> spawn<00:00:35.660> relic<00:00:36.660> irons

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
essentially chess will spawn relic irons

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.569 
essentially chess will spawn relic irons
which<00:00:37.290> again<00:00:37.620> are<00:00:37.680> used<00:00:37.980> for<00:00:38.129> upgrading<00:00:38.550> your

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
which again are used for upgrading your

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.760 
which again are used for upgrading your
legendary<00:00:39.090> gear<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.750> you're<00:00:40.410> going<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.649> need

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
legendary gear and you're going to need

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.979 
legendary gear and you're going to need
those<00:00:40.950> it's<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.910> part<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.660> game<00:00:42.809> that

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
those it's a part of the game that

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:43.880 
those it's a part of the game that
you're<00:00:43.050> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.469> go<00:00:43.559> around<00:00:43.800> and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
you're going to have to go around and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.830 
you're going to have to go around and
get<00:00:43.950> some<00:00:44.100> relic<00:00:44.370> iron<00:00:44.520> along<00:00:44.940> with<00:00:44.969> many

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
get some relic iron along with many

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.910 
get some relic iron along with many
other<00:00:46.700> materials<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.289> relic<00:00:49.289> iron<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> part

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
other materials but relic iron is a part

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.350 
other materials but relic iron is a part
of<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.250> essentially<00:00:50.910> again<00:00:51.149> you're<00:00:51.239> going

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
of it so essentially again you're going

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.639 
of it so essentially again you're going
to<00:00:51.420> follow<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.660> route<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.050> check<00:00:52.230> all<00:00:52.410> these

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
to follow this route and check all these

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.580 
to follow this route and check all these
buildings<00:00:52.920> for<00:00:53.460> real<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.300> iron<00:00:54.570> now<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.469> you

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
buildings for real like iron now if you

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.950 
buildings for real like iron now if you
get<00:00:55.829> here<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.399> there<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:56.969> other<00:00:57.270> people<00:00:57.719> here

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
get here and there are other people here

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.270 
get here and there are other people here
what<00:00:58.500> you're<00:00:58.620> going<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.800> want<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.100> is

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280

follow the route alongside them since

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.450 
follow the route alongside them since
chests<00:01:03.300> are<00:01:03.449> specific<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.860> zone<00:01:05.159> rather

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
chests are specific to the zone rather

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.640 
chests are specific to the zone rather
than<00:01:05.700> your<00:01:06.030> group<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.420> friends<00:01:06.780> or<00:01:06.900> your<00:01:07.380> fire

than your group of friends or your fire

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.130 
than your group of friends or your fire
team<00:01:07.920> rather<00:01:08.510> you<00:01:09.510> will<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
team rather you will get in the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.359 
team rather you will get in the
situation<00:01:10.260> where<00:01:10.830> you're<00:01:11.040> going<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> be

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
situation where you're going to be

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.440 
situation where you're going to be
checking<00:01:11.610> these<00:01:11.790> rooms<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.210> there's<00:01:12.330> going

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
checking these rooms and there's going

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.850 
checking these rooms and there's going
to<00:01:12.510> be<00:01:12.540> no<00:01:12.689> chest<00:01:13.020> spawning<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.590> might<00:01:13.770> be

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
to be no chest spawning that might be

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.230 
to be no chest spawning that might be
because<00:01:14.040> there's<00:01:14.400> other<00:01:14.549> people<00:01:14.880> there<00:01:14.909> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
because there's other people there and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.270 
because there's other people there and
again<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.170> chests<00:01:16.500> are<00:01:16.590> specific<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
again the chests are specific to the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.649 
again the chests are specific to the
zone<00:01:17.430> rather<00:01:17.729> than<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> group<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.420> other

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
zone rather than the group so other

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.330 
zone rather than the group so other
people<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:19.080> pick<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.350> chest<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.009> your

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
people can pick up chest and on your

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.450 
people can pick up chest and on your
screen<00:01:20.729> they'll<00:01:21.390> disappear<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.040> want<00:01:23.310> to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
screen they'll disappear so you want to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.310 
screen they'll disappear so you want to
make<00:01:23.520> sure<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.210> there<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> pack<00:01:24.869> moving

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
make sure that if there is a pack moving

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.140 
make sure that if there is a pack moving
around<00:01:25.500> try<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> stick<00:01:26.040> with<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.250> pack<00:01:26.430> rather

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
around try to stick with the pack rather

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.490 
around try to stick with the pack rather
than<00:01:27.360> being<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> other<00:01:28.020> side<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.320> this

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
than being on the other side of this

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.249 
than being on the other side of this
loop<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.100> not<00:01:30.090> getting<00:01:30.329> any<00:01:30.570> chest<00:01:30.840> again<00:01:31.110> you

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
loop and not getting any chest again you

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.340 
loop and not getting any chest again you
might<00:01:31.650> reach<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.549> route<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.180> not<00:01:33.840> find<00:01:34.170> any

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
might reach this route and not find any

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.899 
might reach this route and not find any
chest<00:01:34.710> whatsoever<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.460> first<00:01:35.729> couple

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
chest whatsoever for the first couple

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.370 
chest whatsoever for the first couple
minutes<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.450> that's<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.780> part<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.229> I

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
minutes and that's just part of it I

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.039 
minutes and that's just part of it I
mean<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:38.130> might<00:01:38.310> get<00:01:38.520> unlucky<00:01:38.790> since<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.810> was

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
mean you might get unlucky since I was

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.080 
mean you might get unlucky since I was
recording<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.710> obviously<00:01:41.130> got<00:01:41.460> unlucky<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.939> mean

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
recording I obviously got unlucky I mean

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.270 
recording I obviously got unlucky I mean
why<00:01:42.390> wouldn't<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.380> chest<00:01:43.680> stop<00:01:43.979> spawning

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
why wouldn't the chest stop spawning

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.039 
why wouldn't the chest stop spawning
when<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.579> start<00:01:44.790> recording<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.899> way

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
when I start recording it's just the way

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.200 
when I start recording it's just the way
it<00:01:46.170> works<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.189> can<00:01:47.280> see<00:01:47.399> here<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.759> do<00:01:48.000> get

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it works but you can see here we do get

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.120 
it works but you can see here we do get
a<00:01:48.240> bit<00:01:48.869> lucky<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.290> our<00:01:49.380> first<00:01:49.619> couple<00:01:49.920> rooms

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
a bit lucky in our first couple rooms

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.039 
a bit lucky in our first couple rooms
and<00:01:50.369> after<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.729> we<00:01:50.939> start<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.540> know<00:01:51.659> hidden

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
and after that we start you know hidden

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.219 
and after that we start you know hidden
some<00:01:52.259> misses<00:01:52.670> but<00:01:53.670> hidden<00:01:54.060> some<00:01:54.360> mrs.<00:01:54.659> what

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
some misses but hidden some mrs. what

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.139 
some misses but hidden some mrs. what
was<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:56.399> yeah<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.549> just<00:01:56.790> want<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.000> check

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
was that but yeah you just want to check

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.399 
was that but yeah you just want to check
all<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.420> rooms<00:01:57.540> make<00:01:57.780> sure<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.990> check<00:01:58.110> every

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
all the rooms make sure you check every

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.010 
all the rooms make sure you check every
corner<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.890> grab<00:01:59.759> those<00:01:59.969> relic<00:02:00.420> irons<00:02:00.750> now<00:02:00.869> as

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
corner and grab those relic irons now as

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.209 
corner and grab those relic irons now as
you<00:02:01.140> run<00:02:01.290> around<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.619> might<00:02:01.740> actually<00:02:01.890> find<00:02:02.100> a

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
you run around you might actually find a

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.840 
you run around you might actually find a
couple<00:02:02.340> nodes<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> ground<00:02:03.509> now<00:02:03.750> nodes<00:02:04.020> are

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
couple nodes on the ground now nodes are

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.609 
couple nodes on the ground now nodes are
essentially<00:02:05.850> these<00:02:06.030> little<00:02:06.540> copper<00:02:07.200> looking

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
essentially these little copper looking

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.469 
essentially these little copper looking
sprouts<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.459> come<00:02:08.640> up<00:02:08.759> they<00:02:08.910> glow<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> little

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
sprouts that come up they glow a little

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.390 
sprouts that come up they glow a little
bit<00:02:09.629> hold<00:02:10.349> X<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.709> them<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:10.920> you'll<00:02:11.039> be<00:02:11.129> able<00:02:11.220> to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
bit hold X on them and you'll be able to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.550 
bit hold X on them and you'll be able to
grab<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> relic<00:02:12.030> iron<00:02:12.209> or<00:02:12.450> two

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
grab a relic iron or two

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.080 
grab a relic iron or two
that<00:02:13.800> may<00:02:14.099> be<00:02:14.130> even<00:02:14.370> more<00:02:14.520> sometimes<00:02:14.940> when<00:02:15.030> you

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
that may be even more sometimes when you

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.610 
that may be even more sometimes when you
get<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.390> chest<00:02:15.599> too<00:02:15.870> you'll<00:02:16.200> you'll<00:02:16.470> get

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
get to the chest too you'll you'll get

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.530 
get to the chest too you'll you'll get
anywhere<00:02:16.890> between<00:02:17.010> one<00:02:17.370> relic<00:02:17.670> iron<00:02:17.849> to<00:02:18.150> up<00:02:18.480> to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
anywhere between one relic iron to up to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.900 
anywhere between one relic iron to up to
12<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.319> believe<00:02:19.560> 12<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.099> maximum<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.610> could<00:02:20.849> be

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
12 I believe 12 is a maximum I could be

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.059 
12 I believe 12 is a maximum I could be
wrong<00:02:21.090> there<00:02:21.300> but<00:02:21.959> you'll<00:02:22.080> also<00:02:22.260> have<00:02:23.010> a

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
wrong there but you'll also have a

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.949 
wrong there but you'll also have a
chance<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.489> getting<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.790> couple<00:02:24.330> anagrams<00:02:24.750> you

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
chance of getting a couple anagrams you

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.390 
chance of getting a couple anagrams you
might<00:02:25.110> even<00:02:25.140> get<00:02:25.440> some<00:02:25.620> legendary<00:02:26.040> ones

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
might even get some legendary ones

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.580 
might even get some legendary ones
you'll<00:02:26.640> get<00:02:26.819> other<00:02:27.239> stuff<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.870> it's<00:02:28.349> worth

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
you'll get other stuff so it's worth

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.140 
you'll get other stuff so it's worth
doing<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.190> even<00:02:29.459> if<00:02:29.550> you're<00:02:29.640> not<00:02:29.670> looking

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
doing this even if you're not looking

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.339 
doing this even if you're not looking
for<00:02:30.300> relic<00:02:30.540> irons<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:30.959> you<00:02:31.019> just<00:02:31.170> want<00:02:31.319> to

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
for relic irons and you just want to

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.750 
for relic irons and you just want to
farm<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.680> bunch<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.920> chess<00:02:32.190> again<00:02:32.489> there<00:02:32.640> are

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
farm a bunch of chess again there are

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.820 
farm a bunch of chess again there are
other<00:02:33.060> farming<00:02:33.540> locations<00:02:34.080> for<00:02:34.290> specific

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
other farming locations for specific

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.740 
other farming locations for specific
things<00:02:34.860> but<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.459> found<00:02:36.000> this<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.480> be<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.660> most

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
things but I found this to be the most

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.780 
things but I found this to be the most
effective<00:02:37.110> farming<00:02:37.709> route<00:02:37.860> for<00:02:38.160> relic<00:02:38.489> irons

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
effective farming route for relic irons

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.130 
effective farming route for relic irons
I<00:02:38.940> believe<00:02:39.120> there<00:02:39.269> are<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.420> couple<00:02:39.660> more<00:02:39.930> routes

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
I believe there are a couple more routes

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.589 
I believe there are a couple more routes
on<00:02:40.349> Mars<00:02:40.739> others<00:02:41.580> one<00:02:41.849> that's<00:02:42.030> right<00:02:42.209> next<00:02:42.480> the

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
on Mars others one that's right next the

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.750 
on Mars others one that's right next the
patrol<00:02:42.959> spawn<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.040> can<00:02:44.220> do<00:02:44.340> but<00:02:44.519> I<00:02:44.550> find

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
patrol spawn that you can do but I find

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.610 
patrol spawn that you can do but I find
that<00:02:44.790> one's<00:02:44.970> kind<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.180> boring<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.840> short<00:02:46.440> and

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
that one's kind of boring it's short and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.880 
that one's kind of boring it's short and
it<00:02:46.769> doesn't<00:02:47.130> have<00:02:47.310> as<00:02:47.549> much<00:02:47.790> relic<00:02:48.600> iron<00:02:48.840> on<00:02:49.200> it

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
it doesn't have as much relic iron on it

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.380 
it doesn't have as much relic iron on it
as<00:02:50.069> this<00:02:50.340> one<00:02:50.549> this<00:02:50.640> one<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:50.819> very<00:02:51.180> very

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
as this one this one is very very

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.229 
as this one this one is very very
effective<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.140> believe<00:02:52.350> within<00:02:52.799> one<00:02:53.100> hour<00:02:53.310> we

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
effective I believe within one hour we

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.420 
effective I believe within one hour we
had<00:02:54.360> around<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.900> hundred<00:02:55.200> relic<00:02:55.890> iron<00:02:56.130> maybe

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
had around a hundred relic iron maybe

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.150 
had around a hundred relic iron maybe
even<00:02:56.610> more<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.440> again<00:02:58.440> it<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.799> worth<00:02:58.980> doing

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
even more so again it is worth doing

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.160 
even more so again it is worth doing
bring<00:02:59.519> some<00:02:59.700> friends<00:02:59.819> too<00:03:00.180> because<00:03:00.540> it's<00:03:00.810> it's

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
bring some friends too because it's it's

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.199 
bring some friends too because it's it's
far<00:03:01.500> more<00:03:01.530> entertaining<00:03:02.010> when<00:03:02.940> you're<00:03:03.060> with

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
far more entertaining when you're with

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
jump right there you'll be a little bit

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.440 
jump right there you'll be a little bit
better<00:04:13.709> than<00:04:13.950> I<00:04:14.069> was<00:04:14.250> I<00:04:14.459> was<00:04:14.549> pretty<00:04:14.940> terrible

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
better than I was I was pretty terrible

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.960 
better than I was I was pretty terrible
and<00:04:15.690> making<00:04:16.320> that<00:04:16.470> one<00:04:16.650> jump<00:04:16.979> up<00:04:17.130> also<00:04:17.820> there

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
and making that one jump up also there

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.029 
and making that one jump up also there
is<00:04:18.000> a<00:04:18.180> park<00:04:18.600> or<00:04:18.900> route<00:04:19.109> you<00:04:19.320> can<00:04:19.470> take<00:04:19.709> which<00:04:19.919> is

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
is a park or route you can take which is
