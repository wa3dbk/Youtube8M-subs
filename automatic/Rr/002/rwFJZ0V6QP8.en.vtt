00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.960
 to apply it and welcome one more day 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:11.090
 to my channel I'm a video somewhat 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.650
 different because it's a video of a 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.540
 collaboration to be concrete to me 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.099
 First collaboration first of all 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.750
 I want to say that to me the typical videos 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.720
 of collaborations where they talk about 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.699
 the product page that you have chosen or 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.289
 they have given and ready I am bored 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.090
 truth is that they do not entertain me and so 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.740
 that does not make me funny so what 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.439
 What I 'm going to do is give you a little 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.449
 of spark and with what I have chosen I will 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.370
 do three are different fitz so I 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:37.250
 It looks like it's going to be more entertaining more 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.750
 what to see and everything because as logically to 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.000
 I do not like that kind of videos that I've 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.390
 said I do not want to do them and here I leave you 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.390
 the outfits 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.770
 i 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.280
 Hello 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.200
 you have been able to see that what is in itself the 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.239
 product that I want to teach this the 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.930
 jersey this jersey from here the one that has 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.569
 come out in the outfits good I'm going to 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.890
 start talking a little about him 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.540
 logically that I have to do it well 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.910
 it's a jersey and I see it for 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.140
 halftime because it's pretty finite 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.519
 good has enough holes 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.500
 so therefore this in winter 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.480
 It's not going to warm you up but I see it 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.150
 ideal for halftime like autumn and 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.799
 spring colors and good is if by 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.569
 the shape it has is very bearable 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.519
 I love what you can put with 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.799
 many things you have already seen in the 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.330
 in the outfits a little variety 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.160
 when they said to see if he wanted to collaborate 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.440
 with them they told me they gave me a 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.170
 30 dollar coupon and I could tell what 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.569
 I wanted to choose this 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.940
 hershey that was worth the 30 dollars for 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.980
 that you have an idea 30 dollars are 22 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.520
 euros with something more or less that came in 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.220
 this package inside with plastic 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.190
 of bubbles very well wrapped moves 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.110
 very well and when I take it out suddenly 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.840
 Package came another tiny bag 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.090
 that is here and I realized that it is 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.100
 an eye necklace this had not 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.590
 I asked for more than anything because they had 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.590
 given a $ 30 coupon and the jersey 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.930
 I was worth 30 dollars but he sent me 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.580
 also this eye necklace now I'm going 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.800
 to zoom in and well then I 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.569
 enchanted of life in the beginning this 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.549
 they were not going to give me I had not asked for it 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.549
 nothing but fell by surprise 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.840
 ah 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.700
 end in the you can find a lot of type 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.140
 of clothes I think that for all 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.410
 likes and apart from the clothes also 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.940
 footwear accessories and other shipments 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.010
 they're free so it's one thing that 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.220
 it seems a plus point or super 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.450
 and nothing, I 'm very happy and I hope 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.590
 keep collaborating because he has 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.090
 delighted the jersey 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.550
 It is not the best quality in the world 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.580
 only for the price and for all I 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.200
 I think it's pretty good so very 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.540
 good note I give the box 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.880
