leave<00:04:03.030> some<00:04:03.329> gap<00:04:03.569> between<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.319> mutia<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:05.040> that

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:05.219 
leave some gap between the mutia so that

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:07.610 
leave some gap between the mutia so that
when<00:04:05.430> they<00:04:05.639> suffer<00:04:05.939> they<00:04:06.930> don't<00:04:07.170> stick<00:04:07.439> to

to 20 minutes

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.199 
to 20 minutes
I<00:04:13.439> think<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:13.950> mutia<00:04:14.280> will<00:04:14.579> now<00:04:14.760> be<00:04:15.000> ready

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
I think the mutia will now be ready

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.749 
I think the mutia will now be ready
let's<00:04:15.930> check<00:04:16.229> it<00:04:16.440> it's<00:04:16.680> been<00:04:16.889> 15<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.459> 20

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 
let's check it it's been 15 to 20

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
minutes and then take it out we can

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.620 
minutes and then take it out we can
slice<00:04:31.020> them<00:04:31.440> so<00:04:32.340> I<00:04:32.370> can<00:04:32.639> show<00:04:32.849> you<00:04:32.910> you<00:04:33.479> can
