00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
gonna do now obviously y'all think I

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.900 
gonna do now obviously y'all think I
would<00:02:09.720> be<00:02:09.840> stressed<00:02:10.229> as<00:02:10.550> someone<00:02:11.550> who<00:02:11.700> uses

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910

Lunia
right<00:02:12.810> yes<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.460> does<00:02:14.670> make<00:02:14.850> sense<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.180> I

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
right yes so it does make sense that I

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.690 
right yes so it does make sense that I
would<00:02:15.360> be<00:02:15.540> stressed<00:02:15.870> but<00:02:16.230> let's<00:02:16.800> say<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.460> we

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
would be stressed but let's say that we

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.970 
would be stressed but let's say that we
are<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.180> remove<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:18.660> let's<00:02:18.960> say<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.530> our

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
are to remove this let's say that our

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.730 
are to remove this let's say that our
air<00:02:20.190> sweeper<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.910> right<00:02:21.390> here<00:02:21.600> oh<00:02:21.720> nice<00:02:22.140> you

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
air sweeper is right here oh nice you

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.810 
air sweeper is right here oh nice you
can<00:02:22.860> actually<00:02:23.040> rotate<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.610> while<00:02:23.730> you're

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
can actually rotate it while you're

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.970 
can actually rotate it while you're
looking<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.690> air<00:02:24.870> sweeper<00:02:25.290> right<00:02:25.470> now<00:02:25.710> as

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
looking so the air sweeper right now as

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.860 
looking so the air sweeper right now as
y'all<00:02:26.160> can<00:02:26.190> see<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.730> little<00:02:26.880> red<00:02:27.060> Allen<00:02:27.420> would

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
y'all can see the little red Allen would

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.350 
y'all can see the little red Allen would
only<00:02:28.020> cover<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.710> portion<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.400> base<00:02:29.580> so

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
only cover that portion of the base so

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.960 
only cover that portion of the base so
it's<00:02:30.510> only<00:02:30.690> covering<00:02:31.410> like<00:02:31.650> what<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.400> 15

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
it's only covering like what is that 15

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.760 
it's only covering like what is that 15
percent<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.690> buildings<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.260> mean<00:02:34.410> if<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.560> see<00:02:34.680> if

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
percent of buildings I mean if I see if

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.200 
percent of buildings I mean if I see if
I<00:02:34.890> scooted<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.370> back<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.790> would<00:02:35.910> cover<00:02:36.090> a

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
I scooted it back it would cover a

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.120 
I scooted it back it would cover a
little<00:02:36.270> bit<00:02:36.480> more<00:02:36.690> but<00:02:37.350> it's<00:02:37.770> not<00:02:37.950> gonna<00:02:38.070> be

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
little bit more but it's not gonna be

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.310 
little bit more but it's not gonna be
the<00:02:38.340> death<00:02:38.490> of<00:02:38.610> air<00:02:38.850> attacks<00:02:39.660> what<00:02:40.110> it's<00:02:40.200> gonna

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
the death of air attacks what it's gonna

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.610 
the death of air attacks what it's gonna
do<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.710> make<00:02:40.890> people<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.750> just<00:02:42.750> get<00:02:43.050> lucky<00:02:43.500> at

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
do is make people that just get lucky at

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.720 
do is make people that just get lucky at
air<00:02:43.770> attacks<00:02:44.070> because<00:02:44.400> they're<00:02:44.550> so

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
air attacks because they're so

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.670 
air attacks because they're so
overpowered<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.930> gonna<00:02:46.110> make<00:02:46.320> them<00:02:46.470> have<00:02:46.650> to

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
overpowered it's gonna make them have to

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.470 
overpowered it's gonna make them have to
really<00:02:47.130> learn<00:02:47.370> what<00:02:47.880> they're<00:02:48.030> doing<00:02:48.360> it's

going to be stressful because as you all

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.840 
going to be stressful because as you all
saw<00:02:57.090> in<00:02:57.210> those<00:02:57.330> videos<00:02:58.100> it's<00:02:59.100> pretty<00:02:59.550> gnarly

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
saw in those videos it's pretty gnarly

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.750 
saw in those videos it's pretty gnarly
it<00:03:00.120> blows<00:03:00.420> balloons<00:03:00.900> back<00:03:01.200> like<00:03:01.590> crazy<00:03:02.280> it

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
it blows balloons back like crazy it

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.190 
it blows balloons back like crazy it
doesn't<00:03:03.000> really<00:03:03.090> affect<00:03:03.240> dragons<00:03:03.900> too<00:03:04.050> much

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
doesn't really affect dragons too much

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.960 
doesn't really affect dragons too much
it<00:03:04.560> doesn't<00:03:04.740> affect<00:03:05.070> minions<00:03:05.520> too<00:03:05.760> much

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
it doesn't affect minions too much

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.450 
it doesn't affect minions too much
either<00:03:06.240> if<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:06.780> watch<00:03:07.080> they<00:03:08.070> get<00:03:08.250> hit<00:03:08.430> a

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
either if you watch they get hit a

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.150 
either if you watch they get hit a
couple<00:03:08.820> times<00:03:09.180> before<00:03:09.590> they<00:03:10.590> can<00:03:10.800> get<00:03:11.010> in

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
couple times before they can get in

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.430 
couple times before they can get in
range<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:11.970> start<00:03:12.270> doing<00:03:12.450> work<00:03:12.630> on<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.990> but<00:03:13.260> it

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
range and start doing work on it but it

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.010 
range and start doing work on it but it
does<00:03:13.680> affect<00:03:13.860> balloons<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:15.030> most<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:15.780> what

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
does affect balloons the most so what

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.420

let's see how many people are building
their<00:04:55.710> erics<00:04:55.890> creepers<00:04:56.160> I<00:04:56.250> think<00:04:56.400> this<00:04:56.490> will

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
their erics creepers I think this will

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.160 
their erics creepers I think this will
be<00:04:56.670> interesting<00:04:56.910> as<00:04:57.600> long<00:04:57.750> as<00:04:57.840> we<00:04:57.930> have<00:04:58.080> to

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
be interesting as long as we have to

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.780 
be interesting as long as we have to
