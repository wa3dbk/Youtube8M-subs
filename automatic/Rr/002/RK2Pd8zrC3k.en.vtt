00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
hey guys what's up its jr. cuber in this

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:14.890 
hey guys what's up its jr. cuber in this
video<00:00:02.879> I'll<00:00:03.149> be<00:00:03.210> reviewing<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.959> YJ<00:00:04.319> sooo<00:00:04.529> long

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.590 

the<00:00:15.900> YJ<00:00:16.289> soo<00:00:16.529> long<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> new<00:00:17.190> cube<00:00:17.490> by<00:00:17.640> YJ<00:00:18.180> why

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
the YJ soo long is a new cube by YJ why

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.480 
the YJ soo long is a new cube by YJ why
he<00:00:18.750> has<00:00:18.869> been<00:00:19.020> silent<00:00:19.439> for<00:00:19.470> some<00:00:19.770> time<00:00:20.070> now<00:00:20.279> but

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
he has been silent for some time now but

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.429 
he has been silent for some time now but
it<00:00:20.670> seems<00:00:20.820> as<00:00:21.060> mo<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.330> who<00:00:21.689> uses<00:00:21.930> Y<00:00:22.199> J's

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
it seems as mo you who uses Y J's

I would like it to be it takes more
force<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.340> make<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> turn<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.180> people<00:01:36.540> who<00:01:36.630> turn

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
force to make a turn and people who turn

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.690 
force to make a turn and people who turn
lightly<00:01:37.290> such<00:01:37.500> as<00:01:37.650> myself<00:01:37.829> may<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.430> problems

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
lightly such as myself may have problems

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.910 
lightly such as myself may have problems
I<00:01:39.119> can't<00:01:39.600> use<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.869> cube<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.320> very<00:01:40.500> long<00:01:40.710> as

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
I can't use this cube for very long as

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.499 
I can't use this cube for very long as
it<00:01:41.040> makes<00:01:41.189> my<00:01:41.340> hands<00:01:41.549> tired<00:01:41.939> after<00:01:42.360> about

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
it makes my hands tired after about

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.420 
it makes my hands tired after about
twenty<00:01:42.869> Sol's<00:01:43.079> however<00:01:43.770> people<00:01:44.100> who<00:01:44.189> turn

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
twenty Sol's however people who turn

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.280 
twenty Sol's however people who turn
with<00:01:44.610> more<00:01:44.790> force<00:01:45.090> may<00:01:45.299> enjoy<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.840> cube<00:01:46.170> if

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
with more force may enjoy this cube if

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.410 
with more force may enjoy this cube if
you<00:01:46.500> turn<00:01:46.680> very<00:01:46.920> rough<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.430> increase<00:01:47.759> your<00:01:47.939> TPS

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
you turn very rough to increase your TPS

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.569 
you turn very rough to increase your TPS
this<00:01:48.960> cube<00:01:49.229> will<00:01:49.350> likely<00:01:49.590> not<00:01:49.920> overshoot<00:01:50.399> and

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
this cube will likely not overshoot and

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.639 
this cube will likely not overshoot and
lock<00:01:50.729> up<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.180> was<00:01:51.450> my<00:01:51.479> only<00:01:51.780> concern<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.500> it

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
lock up that was my only concern and it

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.080 
lock up that was my only concern and it
all<00:01:52.770> depends<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.250> your<00:01:53.399> turning<00:01:53.700> style

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
all depends on your turning style

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.389 
all depends on your turning style
so<00:01:54.420> overall<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:55.079> YJ<00:01:55.409> soo<00:01:55.619> long<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:56.070> quite<00:01:56.369> a

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
so overall the YJ soo long is quite a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.039 
so overall the YJ soo long is quite a
good<00:01:56.579> cube<00:01:56.850> for<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.060> price<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.689> feel<00:01:57.899> is

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
good cube for the price the feel is

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.289 
good cube for the price the feel is
amazing<00:01:58.290> corner<00:01:58.890> cutting<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.219> standard<00:01:59.700> major

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
amazing corner cutting is standard major

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.850 
amazing corner cutting is standard major
lock<00:02:00.570> ups<00:02:00.810> don't<00:02:00.990> happen<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.649> cube

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
lock ups don't happen and the cube

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.679 
lock ups don't happen and the cube
doesn't<00:02:02.159> pop<00:02:02.369> my<00:02:02.700> only<00:02:02.969> problem<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
doesn't pop my only problem is that the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.450 
doesn't pop my only problem is that the
cube<00:02:03.899> may<00:02:04.049> be<00:02:04.110> too<00:02:04.380> slow<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.860> sluggish<00:02:05.070> for

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
cube may be too slow and sluggish for

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.160 
cube may be too slow and sluggish for
light<00:02:05.610> Turner's<00:02:06.060> however<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.719> would<00:02:06.960> still

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
light Turner's however I would still

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.020 
light Turner's however I would still
recommend<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.680> YJ<00:02:07.979> soo<00:02:08.190> long<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.670> feeling

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
recommend the YJ soo long the feeling

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.729 
recommend the YJ soo long the feeling
performance<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.569> spectacular<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.530> cube

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
performance is spectacular and the cube

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.270 
performance is spectacular and the cube
would<00:02:10.860> be<00:02:10.979> my<00:02:11.099> main<00:02:11.310> if<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.580> wasn't<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:11.970> slow

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
would be my main if it wasn't so slow

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.220 
would be my main if it wasn't so slow
however<00:02:12.790> this<00:02:13.030> may<00:02:13.210> be<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.390> good<00:02:13.570> choice<00:02:13.810> if<00:02:14.170> you

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
however this may be a good choice if you

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.380 
however this may be a good choice if you
have<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.410> rep<00:02:14.680> returning<00:02:15.100> style<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:15.910> my<00:02:16.030> overall

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
have a rep returning style so my overall

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.450 
have a rep returning style so my overall
grade<00:02:16.600> on<00:02:16.720> this<00:02:16.840> cube<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.290> b-plus<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.070> love

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
grade on this cube is a b-plus I love

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.370 
grade on this cube is a b-plus I love
the<00:02:18.580> cube<00:02:18.820> but<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.210> is<00:02:19.300> just<00:02:19.600> too<00:02:19.840> slow<00:02:20.110> for<00:02:20.140> me

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
the cube but it is just too slow for me

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.110 
the cube but it is just too slow for me
if<00:02:20.800> you'd<00:02:20.950> like<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.190> purchase<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:21.610> cube<00:02:21.910> the
