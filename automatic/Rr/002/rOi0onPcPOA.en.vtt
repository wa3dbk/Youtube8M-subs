still rewarded with kind of a second
chance<00:02:43.519> or<00:02:43.849> a<00:02:44.560> consistent<00:02:45.560> reward<00:02:45.920> of<00:02:46.159> a<00:02:46.489> chest

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
chance or a consistent reward of a chest

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.059 
chance or a consistent reward of a chest
or<00:02:47.329> in<00:02:47.810> this<00:02:47.959> instance<00:02:48.019> we<00:02:48.560> found<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:48.889> sky

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
or in this instance we found the sky

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.220 
or in this instance we found the sky
shot<00:02:49.340> yeah<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:50.239> was<00:02:50.359> pretty<00:02:50.450> interesting<00:02:50.780> and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
shot yeah it was pretty interesting and

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.659 
shot yeah it was pretty interesting and
once<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:51.650> finish<00:02:51.919> it<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.099> think<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.489> boss<00:02:52.639> has

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:52.669 
once you finish it I think the boss has

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:54.940 
once you finish it I think the boss has
like<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.030> 10<00:02:53.480> minute<00:02:53.720> respawn<00:02:54.079> rate<00:02:54.319> I<00:02:54.530> looked

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
like a 10 minute respawn rate I looked

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.280 
like a 10 minute respawn rate I looked
it<00:02:55.040> up<00:02:55.099> on<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.849> looked<00:02:56.540> it<00:02:56.599> up<00:02:56.689> I<00:02:56.840> asked<00:02:57.079> people

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
it up on I looked it up I asked people

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.979 
it up on I looked it up I asked people
in<00:02:57.379> the<00:02:57.470> game<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.700> basically<00:02:59.419> the<00:02:59.569> mobs<00:02:59.780> in

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
in the game and basically the mobs in

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.089 
in the game and basically the mobs in
the<00:03:00.109> dungeon<00:03:00.409> actually<00:03:00.620> respond<00:03:00.889> pretty

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
the dungeon actually respond pretty

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.319 
the dungeon actually respond pretty
quickly<00:03:01.370> because<00:03:01.519> when<00:03:01.730> we<00:03:01.819> were<00:03:01.939> leaving<00:03:02.060> the

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
quickly because when we were leaving the

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:03.849 
quickly because when we were leaving the
dungeon<00:03:02.659> we<00:03:02.840> found<00:03:03.079> that<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:03.439> know<00:03:03.470> they

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
dungeon we found that you know they

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:05.860 
dungeon we found that you know they
respawn<00:03:04.129> straightaway<00:03:04.669> yeah<00:03:05.060> I<00:03:05.090> think<00:03:05.480> this

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
respawn straightaway yeah I think this

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.449 
respawn straightaway yeah I think this
might<00:03:05.930> be<00:03:06.169> to<00:03:06.470> do<00:03:06.590> with<00:03:06.889> the<00:03:06.980> fact<00:03:07.159> it's<00:03:07.370> a

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
might be to do with the fact it's a

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.550 
might be to do with the fact it's a
public<00:03:07.819> dungeon<00:03:08.239> so<00:03:08.510> if<00:03:08.810> one<00:03:09.049> group<00:03:09.200> runs

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
public dungeon so if one group runs

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.170 
public dungeon so if one group runs
through<00:03:09.889> it<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.129> another<00:03:10.370> follows<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.819> minute

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
through it and another follows a minute

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.839 
through it and another follows a minute
later<00:03:11.980> they're<00:03:12.980> not<00:03:13.129> just<00:03:13.280> gonna<00:03:13.430> get<00:03:13.730> off

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
later they're not just gonna get off

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.460 
later they're not just gonna get off
scot-free<00:03:14.180> they<00:03:14.599> still<00:03:14.840> have<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:15.079> clear<00:03:15.290> those
