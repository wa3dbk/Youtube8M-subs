that<00:01:33.299> which<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.750> nice<00:01:34.079> because<00:01:34.790> that<00:01:35.790> wasn't

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
that which is nice because that wasn't

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.890 
that which is nice because that wasn't
in<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.240> standard<00:01:37.610> version<00:01:38.750> when<00:01:39.750> they

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
in the standard version when they

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.600 
in the standard version when they
actually<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.320> there<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.189> place<00:01:41.369> where<00:01:41.579> I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
able to be displayed like on an HD

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.340 
able to be displayed like on an HD
screen<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.570> resolution<00:03:07.080> is<00:03:07.110> going<00:03:07.290> to

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
screen and the resolution is going to

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.620 
screen and the resolution is going to
obviously<00:03:07.530> be<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:07.950> lot<00:03:08.130> higher<00:03:08.310> too<00:03:08.610> so<00:03:09.330> and

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
obviously be a lot higher too so and

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.620 
obviously be a lot higher too so and
then<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.870> next<00:03:10.050> one<00:03:10.320> we<00:03:10.530> have<00:03:10.770> is<00:03:11.130> HD<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.330> it's

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
then the next one we have is HD and it's

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.620 
then the next one we have is HD and it's
1080p<00:03:13.410> so<00:03:14.370> that's<00:03:14.700> obviously<00:03:15.000> that's<00:03:15.420> higher

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
1080p so that's obviously that's higher

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.540 
1080p so that's obviously that's higher
so<00:03:16.140> that's<00:03:16.260> really<00:03:16.410> good<00:03:16.680> but<00:03:16.800> then<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.040> got

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
so that's really good but then I got

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.060 
so that's really good but then I got
blown<00:03:17.970> away<00:03:18.390> when<00:03:19.110> they<00:03:19.290> actually<00:03:19.739> have<00:03:19.890> the

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
blown away when they actually have the

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.810 
blown away when they actually have the
third<00:03:20.310> one<00:03:20.520> down<00:03:20.670> here<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:21.120> 2k<00:03:21.739> that<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:23.010> insane

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
and it's all right there but it's so

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.010 
and it's all right there but it's so
much<00:04:25.039> cleaner<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:25.789> way<00:04:25.910> they<00:04:26.090> put<00:04:26.900> this

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
much cleaner the way they put this

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.540 
much cleaner the way they put this
together<00:04:27.169> and<00:04:27.470> this<00:04:27.590> is<00:04:27.680> why<00:04:27.830> i<00:04:27.860> love<00:04:28.070> autodesk

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
together and this is why i love autodesk

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.430 
together and this is why i love autodesk
so<00:04:28.699> much<00:04:28.880> it<00:04:29.030> because<00:04:29.120> they<00:04:29.509> really<00:04:29.810> focus<00:04:30.080> on

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
so much it because they really focus on

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.939 
so much it because they really focus on
trying<00:04:30.740> to<00:04:31.009> make<00:04:31.250> their<00:04:32.500> their<00:04:33.500> software

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
trying to make their their software

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.830 
trying to make their their software
especially<00:04:34.250> this<00:04:34.729> one<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.210> sketchbook<00:04:35.660> pro

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
version for for android they really take

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.879 
version for for android they really take
their<00:04:39.229> time<00:04:39.410> to<00:04:39.710> make<00:04:39.889> it<00:04:40.039> look<00:04:40.220> you<00:04:41.060> know<00:04:41.180> like

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
their time to make it look you know like

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.379 
their time to make it look you know like
you<00:04:42.889> don't<00:04:43.039> like<00:04:43.190> to<00:04:43.280> like<00:04:43.610> a<00:04:43.639> really<00:04:43.970> nice

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
you don't like to like a really nice

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.360 
you don't like to like a really nice
good<00:04:45.080> like<00:04:45.470> this<00:04:45.620> looks<00:04:45.830> like<00:04:45.889> a<00:04:45.979> program<00:04:46.130> that

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
good like this looks like a program that

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.320 
good like this looks like a program that
you<00:04:46.460> would<00:04:46.580> actually<00:04:46.759> see<00:04:46.940> maybe<00:04:47.900> for<00:04:49.330> just

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
you would actually see maybe for just

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.240 
you would actually see maybe for just
regular<00:04:51.110> desktop<00:04:51.320> computer<00:04:52.009> or<00:04:52.039> something

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
regular desktop computer or something

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.159 
regular desktop computer or something
just<00:04:52.580> because<00:04:52.759> it's<00:04:53.090> just<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.599> way<00:04:53.750> it's<00:04:53.930> laid

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
just because it's just the way it's laid

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.779 
just because it's just the way it's laid
out<00:04:54.229> this<00:04:54.590> actually<00:04:55.250> feels<00:04:55.370> more<00:04:55.610> like<00:04:55.669> a

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
out this actually feels more like a

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.499 
out this actually feels more like a
setup<00:04:56.300> for<00:04:56.570> like<00:04:56.720> a<00:04:56.750> pc<00:04:57.440> or<00:04:57.470> something<00:04:58.509> so

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
setup for like a pc or something so

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.260 
setup for like a pc or something so

actually got rid of that so now what you
do<00:06:22.439> is<00:06:22.499> just<00:06:22.709> happen<00:06:23.099> and<00:06:23.219> you<00:06:23.610> have<00:06:23.759> a<00:06:23.789> full

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:25.099 
do is just happen and you have a full

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:27.230
