studio on a regular basis so if you
don't<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.160> them<00:00:56.460> um<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.030> could<00:00:57.480> use<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> drill

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
don't have them um you could use a drill

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.220 
don't have them um you could use a drill
instead<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.980> these<00:00:59.129> hole<00:00:59.969> punches<00:01:00.390> but

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
instead of one of these hole punches but

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.569 
instead of one of these hole punches but
I<00:01:01.260> recommend<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.859> coming<00:01:02.250> down<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.399> the

tires<00:01:36.000> I've<00:01:36.360> already<00:01:36.780> cut<00:01:37.049> down<00:01:37.079> they<00:01:37.979> used<00:01:38.159> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
tires I've already cut down they used to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.370 
tires I've already cut down they used to
be<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> continuous<00:01:39.090> tire<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.869> tiny<00:01:40.079> cone

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
be a continuous tire like the tiny cone

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.789 
be a continuous tire like the tiny cone
your<00:01:40.590> bicycle<00:01:41.100> um<00:01:41.939> but<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> volunteer<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.680> I

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
your bicycle um but a volunteer and I

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.399 
your bicycle um but a volunteer and I
had<00:01:44.009> actually<00:01:44.250> cut<00:01:44.610> them<00:01:44.790> down<00:01:45.079> the<00:01:46.079> hardest

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
had actually cut them down the hardest

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.530 
had actually cut them down the hardest
part<00:01:46.770> was<00:01:47.369> actually<00:01:47.430> cutting<00:01:48.060> around<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
part was actually cutting around the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.270 
part was actually cutting around the
inside<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.409> tire<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.890> these<00:01:50.009> actually

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
inside of the tire so these actually

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.510 
inside of the tire so these actually
went<00:01:50.670> together<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:53.070> inside

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
went together like this and the inside

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.780 
went together like this and the inside
actually<00:01:53.820> had<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.540> metal<00:01:55.140> piece<00:01:55.460> that<00:01:56.460> was

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
actually had this metal piece that was

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.510 
actually had this metal piece that was
on<00:01:57.060> either<00:01:57.270> side<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:58.009> what<00:01:59.009> we<00:01:59.130> had<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.369> do

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
on either side of this what we had to do

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.490 
on either side of this what we had to do
is<00:01:59.700> use<00:01:59.880> some<00:01:59.909> tin<00:02:00.270> snips<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.750> cut<00:02:00.869> into<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
is use some tin snips to cut into the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.910 
is use some tin snips to cut into the
tire<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.070> then<00:02:02.579> use<00:02:02.880> sharp<00:02:03.560> scissors<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.770> cut

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
tire and then use sharp scissors to cut

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.590 
tire and then use sharp scissors to cut
around<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.369> edge<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.880> we<00:02:05.939> cut<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.270> metal

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
around the edge and we cut that metal

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.960 
around the edge and we cut that metal
piece<00:02:06.780> off<00:02:08.030> we<00:02:09.030> also<00:02:09.179> have<00:02:09.450> tin

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
piece off we also have tin

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
piece off we also have tin
so<00:02:10.090> if<00:02:10.150> you<00:02:10.270> ever<00:02:10.420> need<00:02:10.630> them<00:02:10.810> at<00:02:11.110> DIY<00:02:11.590> studio

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.320 

so<00:02:16.990> after<00:02:17.410> you<00:02:17.530> cut<00:02:17.890> out<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.130> template<00:02:18.790> the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
so after you cut out the template the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.390 
so after you cut out the template the
next<00:02:19.630> thing<00:02:19.780> you're<00:02:19.870> going<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.110> do<00:02:20.320> is<00:02:20.590> get

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
next thing you're going to do is get

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.000 
next thing you're going to do is get
your<00:02:21.580> jump<00:02:21.790> ring<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.240> put<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.230> through<00:02:23.710> the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
your jump ring and put it through the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.550 
your jump ring and put it through the
top<00:02:24.040> tab<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:26.100> your<00:02:27.100> key<00:02:27.310> chain<00:02:28.080> then<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.110> fold

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
top tab of your key chain then you fold

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
it over the other side so this little

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.410 
it over the other side so this little
tongue<00:02:32.380> becomes<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.430> place<00:02:33.580> where<00:02:34.240> you're

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
tongue becomes the place where you're

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.530 
tongue becomes the place where you're
going<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.840> want<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.760> drill<00:02:36.760> your<00:02:37.000> holes<00:02:37.210> or

punch your holes here and then through
the<00:02:40.240> other<00:02:40.420> side<00:02:40.660> here<00:02:41.140> as<00:02:41.320> well<00:02:41.590> I'm<00:02:42.460> going<00:02:42.700> to

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
the other side here as well I'm going to

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.660 
the other side here as well I'm going to
take<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.660> camera<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.320> show<00:02:45.040> I'm<00:02:45.370> going<00:02:45.580> to

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
take the camera and show I'm going to

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.710 
take the camera and show I'm going to
punch<00:02:45.850> this<00:02:46.000> actually<00:02:46.390> on<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.600> ground

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
punch this actually on the ground

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.770 
punch this actually on the ground
because<00:02:47.680> it's<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:47.950> really<00:02:48.250> hard<00:02:48.490> surface<00:02:48.970> that

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
because it's a really hard surface that

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.140 
because it's a really hard surface that
way<00:02:49.990> it<00:02:50.290> doesn't<00:02:50.620> absorb<00:02:50.740> any<00:02:51.250> of<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.730> energy

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
way it doesn't absorb any of the energy

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.410 
way it doesn't absorb any of the energy
and<00:02:52.570> it<00:02:52.990> goes<00:02:53.170> all<00:02:53.410> into<00:02:54.120> punching<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.240> hole

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
and it goes all into punching the hole

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.810 
and it goes all into punching the hole
into<00:02:55.780> it<00:02:56.160> now<00:02:57.160> I<00:02:57.190> place<00:02:57.760> this<00:02:58.330> book<00:02:58.830> on<00:02:59.830> the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
into it now I place this book on the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.750 
into it now I place this book on the
floor<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.690> help<00:03:01.990> protect<00:03:02.950> our<00:03:03.400> surface<00:03:04.290> and

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
floor to help protect our surface and

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:15.510 
floor to help protect our surface and
then<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.790> take<00:03:07.330> a<00:03:10.110> large<00:03:12.720> hole<00:03:13.720> punch<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:14.520> I

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
then I take a large hole punch and I

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.940 
then I take a large hole punch and I
simply<00:03:17.100> twist<00:03:18.100> off<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.610> old<00:03:18.790> one<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.690> add<00:03:20.560> it

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.250 

now<00:03:33.040> simply<00:03:33.520> add<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.540> hole<00:03:34.720> punch<00:03:34.959> straight

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260
