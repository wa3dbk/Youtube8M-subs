00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
and then they'll be a little bit easier

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.560 
and then they'll be a little bit easier
to<00:00:31.650> remove

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
to remove

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.330 
to remove
remember<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> pan<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.110> really<00:00:34.500> hot<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.280> you

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
remember the pan is really hot so you

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.420 
remember the pan is really hot so you
don't<00:00:35.610> want<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.149> burn<00:00:36.480> your<00:00:36.719> hand<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:38.129> see

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
don't want to burn your hand and I see

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.220 
don't want to burn your hand and I see
over<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.329> two<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.540> them<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:39.989> gotten

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
over here that two of them have gotten

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.490 
over here that two of them have gotten
sort<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.770> run<00:00:41.129> into<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:41.760> another<00:00:42.260> so<00:00:43.260> while

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
sort of run into one another so while

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.369 
sort of run into one another so while
they're<00:00:43.739> still<00:00:44.149> very<00:00:45.149> warm<00:00:45.480> I'm<00:00:45.930> just<00:00:46.200> going

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
they're still very warm I'm just going

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.029 
they're still very warm I'm just going
to<00:00:46.440> take<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:46.980> spatula<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:48.890> stick<00:00:49.890> them

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
to take this spatula and stick them

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.010 
to take this spatula and stick them
between<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.610> two<00:00:50.850> they'll<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:51.329> easier<00:00:51.780> to

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
between the two they'll be easier to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.270 
between the two they'll be easier to
remove<00:00:52.559> if<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.690> think<00:00:55.280> that's

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
remove if you do that I think that's

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.299 
remove if you do that I think that's
looks<00:00:57.270> ok<00:00:57.719> now<00:00:58.760> I'm<00:00:59.760> going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.180> slide<00:01:01.309> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
looks ok now I'm going to slide the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.910 
looks ok now I'm going to slide the
spatula<00:01:02.550> underneath<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:06.110> it<00:01:07.110> comes<00:01:07.439> right

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
spatula underneath and it comes right

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.679 
spatula underneath and it comes right
off<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.340> pan<00:01:08.580> even<00:01:09.030> though<00:01:09.210> there<00:01:09.630> was<00:01:09.780> no

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
off the pan even though there was no

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.080 
off the pan even though there was no
grease<00:01:12.689> put<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> pan<00:01:13.920> or<00:01:14.220> butter<00:01:14.760> or

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
grease put on the pan or butter or

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.170 
grease put on the pan or butter or
anything<00:01:15.409> it<00:01:16.409> comes<00:01:16.799> off<00:01:17.130> because<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.909> course

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
anything it comes off because of course

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.350 
anything it comes off because of course
remember<00:01:18.540> we<00:01:19.229> put<00:01:19.500> two<00:01:20.130> whole<00:01:20.520> sticks<00:01:21.119> of

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
remember we put two whole sticks of

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.550 
remember we put two whole sticks of
butter<00:01:21.650> into<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.799> recipe<00:01:23.750> so<00:01:24.750> there's<00:01:25.259> just

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
butter into this recipe so there's just

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.370 
butter into this recipe so there's just
enough<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.100> there<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:27.270> prevent<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.869> pan<00:01:28.110> from

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
enough on there to prevent the pan from

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.890 
enough on there to prevent the pan from
sticking<00:01:28.909> if<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.299> cookies<00:01:30.930> from<00:01:31.049> sticking

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
sticking if the cookies from sticking

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.370 
sticking if the cookies from sticking
and<00:01:35.090> take<00:01:36.090> them<00:01:36.270> off<00:01:36.420> carefully<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.350> that

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
and take them off carefully so that

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.609 
and take them off carefully so that
they'll<00:01:39.439> lift<00:01:40.439> off<00:01:40.740> easily<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:42.439> find<00:01:43.439> a

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
they'll lift off easily and find a

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.499 
they'll lift off easily and find a
little<00:01:43.860> place<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.780> each<00:01:45.780> one<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.409> cool<00:01:47.509> don't

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
little place for each one to cool don't

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.060
