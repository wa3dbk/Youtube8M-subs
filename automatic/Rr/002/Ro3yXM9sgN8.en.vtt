00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.119
 new 7er bmw the flagship 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.220
 Munich 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.200

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.200
 motor version on the market come 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.690
 as a 730 d as this with a 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.110
 extremely cheap consumption of 7.2 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.330
 Liters 69 1500 euros will this on 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:38.280
 Cost and about this very in the offer 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:43.100
 two more engines of the 740 with 126 ps 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.100
 and the 750th war with 4 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.390
 the new 7er bmw is a proud five meters 7 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.160
 long and reminds you of a leaky thanks 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.140
 new camera system even to the 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.629
 speed limit on the roadside most important 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.980
 values â€‹â€‹for bmw boss norbert reithofer 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.140
 but are still the dynamics and 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.050
 driving pleasure for the bmw is this 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.540
 37 d vehicle to a highly efficient 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.240
 This engine, for example, only 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.790
 7.2 liters per 100 kilometers consumed 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.240
 has, for example, a head up display 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.320
 he has one for example 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.820
 lane departure warning means that if they are 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.039
 the track changes with this vehicle 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.710
 then they get a figuration 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:25.640
 the steering wheel , of course, he has night 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:29.300
 vision with people warning and 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.680
 Of course, then comes a signal and that 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.509
 is displayed in the middle of the display 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.420
 So modern what does the vehicle so 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.289
 We call this Integrally Active Steering 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.880
 bmw that means that the front wheels and 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.440
 the rear wheels are steered 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.300
 supported by a course 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.530
 active steering means what you have 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.180
 of course much smaller 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.700
 Turning circles conspicuous also the new one 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.290
 Design of the 7 the rear has been completed 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.670
 perhaps also because of that 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.170
 rear part of his predecessor not 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.270
 was really popular 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.770
 Of course I expected the question 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.650
 that had to come when the new 7 from 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.450
 bmw is presented but i want me 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.950
 again the sima we say 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.899
 now on the street have that 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.459
 were then most sold theme that 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.660
 bmw ever had 320,000 so far 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.730
 take into account no we start with 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.650
 This signal also a new one 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.060
 The design line marches forward and away 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.530
 If I look around so I can 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.510
 only say he succeeded us very well 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.280
 official start of sales is the 15th 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.380
 november and at the latest then will be 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.310
 Show if the customers are just as excited 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.310

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.000
