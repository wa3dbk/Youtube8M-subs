that's<00:00:22.380> fat<00:00:22.680> been<00:00:22.860> founded<00:00:23.160> game<00:00:23.460> today<00:00:23.820> i<00:00:24.470> had

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
that's fat been founded game today i had

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.200 
that's fat been founded game today i had
to<00:00:25.560> make<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:25.890> video<00:00:26.070> there<00:00:26.460> was<00:00:26.669> this<00:00:26.880> i

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
to make this video there was this i

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.550 
to make this video there was this i
guess<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.630> could<00:00:27.720> say<00:00:27.839> it's<00:00:27.990> sort<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.259> leaked

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
guess you could say it's sort of leaked

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.560 
guess you could say it's sort of leaked
theory<00:00:29.310> about<00:00:29.519> what<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> game<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.150> gonna<00:00:30.449> be

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
theory about what the game is gonna be

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.170 
theory about what the game is gonna be
um<00:00:30.960> i<00:00:31.890> guess<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.460> could<00:00:32.610> call<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.910> leaked

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
um i guess you could call it a leaked

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.630 
um i guess you could call it a leaked
theory<00:00:33.810> and<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.800> we're<00:00:34.920> gonna<00:00:35.040> talk<00:00:35.310> about<00:00:35.340> it

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
theory and so we're gonna talk about it

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.480 
theory and so we're gonna talk about it
as<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> theory<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:36.690> I'd<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.590> guys<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.770> see

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490 
as a theory but I'd like you guys to see

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.880 
as a theory but I'd like you guys to see
how<00:00:38.880> this<00:00:39.480> theory<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:39.930> being<00:00:40.230> approved<00:00:40.559> I've

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
how this theory is being approved I've

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.430 
how this theory is being approved I've
heard<00:00:41.070> about<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.460> um<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.420> actually<00:00:43.199> heard

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
heard about this um I actually heard

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.439 
heard about this um I actually heard
about<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.710> from<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.920> source<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.670> sort<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.300> them

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
about it from a source and sort of them

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:46.910 
about it from a source and sort of them
that<00:00:45.600> play<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.899> game<00:00:46.050> also<00:00:46.260> was<00:00:46.500> talking

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
that play the game also was talking

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.049 
that play the game also was talking
about<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.309> they've<00:00:47.640> been<00:00:47.789> known<00:00:48.000> to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
about this and they've been known to

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.060 
about this and they've been known to
sort<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.660> prove<00:00:48.870> things<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:49.920> want<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
sort of prove things so I just want to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.040 
sort of prove things so I just want to
let<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.309> guys<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:50.850> theory<00:00:51.690> idea

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
let you guys in on this theory idea

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.799 
let you guys in on this theory idea
thing<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:53.519> can<00:00:53.670> really<00:00:53.850> dive<00:00:54.149> into<00:00:54.180> sort

thing and we can really dive into sort

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.410 
thing and we can really dive into sort
of<00:00:54.870> what<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.379> premises<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.430> call<00:00:57.059> duty<00:00:57.329> black

what are we gonna be doing um I've been

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.030 
what are we gonna be doing um I've been
sort<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.239> hinting<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.809> out<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.199> Twitter<00:01:04.739> I've

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
sort of hinting this out on Twitter I've

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.690 
sort of hinting this out on Twitter I've
been<00:01:05.190> talking<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.760> lot<00:01:05.910> about<00:01:07.160> this<00:01:08.160> game<00:01:08.460> and

been talking a lot about this game and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.070 
been talking a lot about this game and
on<00:01:08.970> Twitter<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:11.340> Sun<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.270> Sun<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.870> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
on Twitter the Sun the Sun in the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.350 
on Twitter the Sun the Sun in the
snapchats<00:01:13.680> there<00:01:13.860> was<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> son<00:01:14.460> here<00:01:15.120> was<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
snapchats there was a son here was a

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.260 
snapchats there was a son here was a
sonic<00:01:15.840> straight<00:01:16.590> off<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:17.070> blue<00:01:17.430> kind<00:01:18.120> of

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
sonic straight off it was blue kind of

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.770 
sonic straight off it was blue kind of
crazy<00:01:18.570> um<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.890> what's<00:01:20.100> gonna<00:01:20.250> happen<00:01:20.670> if<00:01:20.910> I<00:01:21.570> had

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
crazy um so what's gonna happen if I had

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.540 
crazy um so what's gonna happen if I had
to<00:01:21.930> take<00:01:22.110> my<00:01:22.260> guess<00:01:22.440> I<00:01:22.650> would<00:01:22.830> Bank<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.310> this

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
to take my guess I would Bank on this

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.080 
to take my guess I would Bank on this
theory<00:01:24.050> there's<00:01:25.050> gonna<00:01:25.290> be<00:01:25.730> sort<00:01:26.730> of<00:01:26.820> maybe

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
theory there's gonna be sort of maybe

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.390 
theory there's gonna be sort of maybe
like<00:01:27.300> a<00:01:27.330> solar<00:01:27.720> flare<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.650> sort<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.160> thing

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
like a solar flare like sort of thing

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.220 
like a solar flare like sort of thing
the<00:01:29.640> sun's<00:01:29.940> gonna<00:01:30.120> release<00:01:30.570> something<00:01:30.930> I'm

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
the sun's gonna release something I'm

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.020 
the sun's gonna release something I'm
just<00:01:31.380> gonna<00:01:31.500> go<00:01:31.770> really<00:01:32.220> simple<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.850> make<00:01:33.000> a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
just gonna go really simple I can make a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.730 
just gonna go really simple I can make a
really<00:01:33.330> technical<00:01:33.480> video<00:01:34.050> based<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.470> all<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
really technical video based on all the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.320 
really technical video based on all the
information<00:01:35.190> I'm<00:01:35.310> ago<00:01:35.550> very<00:01:35.850> simple<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.270> very

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
information I'm ago very simple and very

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.440 
information I'm ago very simple and very
fast<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> Sun<00:01:38.190> let's<00:01:38.580> just<00:01:38.820> say<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.060> know

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
fast so the Sun let's just say you know

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.470 
fast so the Sun let's just say you know
it<00:01:39.750> has<00:01:40.230> this<00:01:40.410> effect<00:01:40.890> lets<00:01:41.610> off<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> flare<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
it has this effect lets off a flare the

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.920 
it has this effect lets off a flare the
flare<00:01:42.840> hits<00:01:43.560> earth<00:01:44.060> now<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.120> think<00:01:45.420> there's<00:01:45.810> two

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
flare hits earth now I think there's two

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.620 
flare hits earth now I think there's two
possibilities<00:01:46.410> either<00:01:47.090> or<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.300> can<00:01:48.480> get

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
possibilities either or it can get

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.990 
possibilities either or it can get
destroyed<00:01:49.080> civilization<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:50.310> be<00:01:50.460> gone<00:01:50.730> we

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
destroyed civilization to be gone we

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000 
destroyed civilization to be gone we
can't<00:01:51.330> rebuild<00:01:51.660> infant<00:01:52.140> infrastructure

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
can't rebuild infant infrastructure

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.370 
can't rebuild infant infrastructure
technology<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:53.910> totally<00:01:54.420> gone<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:55.170> an

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
technology is totally gone it's an

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.350 
technology is totally gone it's an
apocalyptic<00:01:56.010> world<00:01:56.400> that's<00:01:56.850> one<00:01:57.000> possibility

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
apocalyptic world that's one possibility

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.420 
apocalyptic world that's one possibility
its<00:01:57.570> second<00:01:57.870> possibility<00:01:58.230> is<00:01:58.410> that<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:59.250> just

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
its second possibility is that it just

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.160 
its second possibility is that it just
wipes<00:01:59.640> out<00:01:59.880> all<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.120> our<00:02:00.270> electronics<00:02:00.900> we<00:02:01.020> were

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
wipes out all of our electronics we were

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.830 
wipes out all of our electronics we were
reduced<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.800> back<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.670> back<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> eighteen

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
reduced to back to back in the eighteen

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.450 
reduced to back to back in the eighteen
hundreds<00:02:04.230> or<00:02:04.350> something<00:02:04.650> like<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.830> we're

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
hundreds or something like that we're

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.860 
hundreds or something like that we're
going<00:02:05.670> back<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.210> time

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
going back in time

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.390 
going back in time
actually<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:07.620> we're<00:02:07.740> still<00:02:07.980> in<00:02:08.040> the<00:02:08.130> future

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:08.400 
actually but we're still in the future

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.950 
actually but we're still in the future
we<00:02:08.490> just<00:02:08.670> lose<00:02:08.850> all<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.090> our<00:02:09.240> technology<00:02:09.660> and

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
we just lose all of our technology and

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.770 
we just lose all of our technology and
our<00:02:10.110> ability<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.740> sort<00:02:11.100> of<00:02:11.210> operate<00:02:12.210> as<00:02:12.390> human

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
our ability to sort of operate as human

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.250 
our ability to sort of operate as human
modern<00:02:13.200> human<00:02:13.230> beings<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.970> really<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:16.020> world

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
modern human beings so really the world

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.770 
modern human beings so really the world
has<00:02:16.440> changed<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:17.130> event<00:02:17.910> has<00:02:18.030> changed<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
has changed this event has changed the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.530 
has changed this event has changed the
world<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.490> that's<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.760> main<00:02:20.970> premise<00:02:21.390> for

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
world and that's the main premise for

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.050 
world and that's the main premise for
this<00:02:21.870> game<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.620> when<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.280> mean<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.640> future<00:02:23.940> is

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
this game so when I mean the future is

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.090 
this game so when I mean the future is
behind<00:02:24.360> we're<00:02:24.720> going<00:02:25.110> forward<00:02:25.470> in<00:02:25.560> time<00:02:25.770> but

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
behind we're going forward in time but

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.910 
behind we're going forward in time but
really<00:02:26.610> we're<00:02:26.850> not<00:02:27.090> we're<00:02:28.020> we're<00:02:28.590> regressing

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
really we're not we're we're regressing

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.870 
really we're not we're we're regressing
as<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> society<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.690> that's<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.260> main<00:02:31.710> thing<00:02:31.880> my

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
as a society so that's the main thing my

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.680 
as a society so that's the main thing my
theory<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.660> regarding<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.410> is<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:35.690> there's

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
theory of regarding this is that there's

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.300 
theory of regarding this is that there's
gonna<00:02:36.870> be<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.140> story<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.950> time<00:02:38.280> period

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
gonna be a story in this time period

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.760 
gonna be a story in this time period
there's<00:02:38.910> gonna<00:02:39.030> be<00:02:39.270> flashbacks<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.260> memories

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
there's gonna be flashbacks and memories

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.410 
there's gonna be flashbacks and memories
that<00:02:41.370> we're<00:02:41.520> gonna<00:02:41.610> get<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.940> play<00:02:42.180> through

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
that we're gonna get to play through

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.760 
that we're gonna get to play through
through<00:02:42.750> different<00:02:43.260> eras<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.500> sort

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
through different eras and that is sort

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.410 
through different eras and that is sort
of<00:02:46.830> gonna<00:02:47.040> encompass<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.760> lot<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.090> different

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
of gonna encompass a lot of different

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.120 
of gonna encompass a lot of different
time<00:02:48.570> for<00:02:48.780> your<00:02:48.900> periods<00:02:49.200> I'm<00:02:49.320> not<00:02:49.650> too<00:02:49.890> sure

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
time for your periods I'm not too sure

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.550 
time for your periods I'm not too sure
about<00:02:50.160> that<00:02:50.580> but<00:02:51.540> that's<00:02:51.690> just<00:02:51.810> that's<00:02:52.410> just

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
about that but that's just that's just

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.520 
about that but that's just that's just
what<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:52.920> think<00:02:53.340> would<00:02:53.460> be<00:02:53.610> pretty<00:02:53.790> awesome

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
what I think would be pretty awesome

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.810 
what I think would be pretty awesome
just<00:02:55.530> operate<00:02:56.010> through<00:02:56.280> these<00:02:56.490> flashbacks

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
just operate through these flashbacks

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.760 
just operate through these flashbacks
now<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.420> possibility<00:02:58.110> with<00:02:58.260> these<00:02:58.410> flashbacks

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
now a possibility with these flashbacks

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.210 
now a possibility with these flashbacks
also<00:02:59.550> is<00:02:59.730> this<00:02:59.910> guy<00:03:00.180> in<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:01.170> present<00:03:01.770> which<00:03:02.040> is

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
also is this guy in the present which is

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.390 
also is this guy in the present which is
this<00:03:02.430> crazy<00:03:02.970> crazy<00:03:03.660> messed-up<00:03:03.930> world<00:03:04.170> he<00:03:05.100> sees

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
this crazy crazy messed-up world he sees

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.430 
this crazy crazy messed-up world he sees
he's<00:03:05.790> flashed<00:03:06.120> his<00:03:06.390> flashbacks<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.050> someone

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
he's flashed his flashbacks to someone

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.440 
he's flashed his flashbacks to someone
else<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.890> know<00:03:07.920> years<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:08.760> years<00:03:08.820> five

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
else you know years and years five

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.260 
else you know years and years five
hundred<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.110> thousand<00:03:10.710> hundred<00:03:11.280> years<00:03:11.550> into

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
hundred and thousand hundred years into

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.660 
hundred and thousand hundred years into
the<00:03:12.390> past<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:12.959> we<00:03:13.560> might<00:03:13.770> be<00:03:13.950> playing<00:03:14.190> through

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
the past and we might be playing through

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.320 
the past and we might be playing through
those<00:03:14.880> people<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.739> sort<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.860> seeing<00:03:17.370> what<00:03:17.880> led

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
those people and sort of seeing what led

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.140 
those people and sort of seeing what led
to<00:03:18.360> maybe<00:03:18.840> this<00:03:19.110> event<00:03:19.440> maybe<00:03:19.739> maybe<00:03:20.520> they're

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
to maybe this event maybe maybe they're

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.090 
to maybe this event maybe maybe they're
even<00:03:21.450> if<00:03:21.660> he<00:03:21.810> isn't<00:03:22.200> gonna<00:03:22.410> be<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.620> son<00:03:22.860> maybe

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
even if he isn't gonna be a son maybe

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.310 
even if he isn't gonna be a son maybe
there's<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.489> nuke<00:03:23.760> maybe<00:03:24.090> just<00:03:24.390> some<00:03:24.720> total

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
there's a nuke maybe just some total

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.949 
there's a nuke maybe just some total
disaster<00:03:26.010> something<00:03:26.820> happened<00:03:27.270> and<00:03:27.390> we're

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
disaster something happened and we're

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.070 
disaster something happened and we're
seeing<00:03:28.350> into<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.010> past<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.760> what<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:30.690> think

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
seeing into the past and what I think

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.840 
seeing into the past and what I think
would<00:03:31.200> be<00:03:31.350> cool<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.709> if<00:03:31.739> we<00:03:31.980> have<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.340> sort<00:03:32.760> of

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
would be cool is if we have to sort of

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.810 
would be cool is if we have to sort of
think<00:03:33.510> about<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.140> maybe<00:03:34.650> there<00:03:35.280> is<00:03:35.520> some

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
think about that and maybe there is some

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.430 
think about that and maybe there is some
time-travel<00:03:36.060> almond<00:03:36.690> we<00:03:36.810> could<00:03:36.989> go<00:03:37.170> back<00:03:37.380> and

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
time-travel almond we could go back and

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.990 
time-travel almond we could go back and
save<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.100> world<00:03:38.220> although<00:03:38.640> I<00:03:38.670> don't<00:03:38.820> think

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
save the world although I don't think

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.640 
save the world although I don't think
that's<00:03:39.270> going<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.480> be<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.690> case<00:03:39.900> but<00:03:40.530> I'm

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
that's going to be the case but I'm

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.960 
that's going to be the case but I'm
trying<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.070> think<00:03:41.130> of<00:03:41.430> based<00:03:41.640> off<00:03:41.820> this

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
trying to think of based off this

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.590 
trying to think of based off this
information<00:03:42.630> of<00:03:42.840> this<00:03:43.020> crazy<00:03:43.830> event

society's messed up and this idea of

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.970 
society's messed up and this idea of
flashbacks<00:03:48.390> how<00:03:48.900> we<00:03:48.959> can<00:03:49.230> sort<00:03:49.440> of<00:03:49.530> sent<00:03:49.830> the

flashbacks how we can sort of sent the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.020 
flashbacks how we can sort of sent the
best<00:03:50.100> synthesized<00:03:50.790> those<00:03:51.150> into<00:03:52.019> one<00:03:53.030> coherent

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030

about the Sun sort of like going
thinking<00:04:47.380> back<00:04:47.650> in<00:04:47.890> time<00:04:48.160> and<00:04:48.340> this<00:04:48.580> guy's

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
thinking back in time and this guy's

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.460 
thinking back in time and this guy's
trying<00:04:49.030> to<00:04:49.150> get<00:04:49.270> into<00:04:49.510> his<00:04:49.600> mind<00:04:49.660> and<00:04:50.170> figure

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
trying to get into his mind and figure

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.310 
trying to get into his mind and figure
your<00:04:50.590> stuff<00:04:50.680> out<00:04:51.040> so<00:04:51.790> we<00:04:52.450> don't<00:04:52.600> know<00:04:52.720> too<00:04:52.780> much

your stuff out so we don't know too much
but<00:04:54.160> I<00:04:54.430> think<00:04:54.970> this<00:04:55.060> sounds<00:04:55.270> like<00:04:55.480> a<00:04:55.540> very

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
but I think this sounds like a very

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.600 
but I think this sounds like a very
plausible<00:04:56.230> idea<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:57.160> I<00:04:57.190> want<00:04:57.370> to<00:04:57.430> know<00:04:57.520> what

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
plausible idea and I want to know what

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.250 
plausible idea and I want to know what
you<00:04:57.700> guys<00:04:57.850> have<00:04:58.060> to<00:04:58.180> think<00:04:58.390> about<00:04:58.510> it<00:04:58.810> in<00:04:58.960> the

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
you guys have to think about it in the
