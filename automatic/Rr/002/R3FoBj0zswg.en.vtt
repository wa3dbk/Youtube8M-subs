brick but it's perfectly good for cats
as<00:00:11.429> well<00:00:11.780> it's<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.929> number<00:00:13.049> two<00:00:13.230> on<00:00:13.620> their<00:00:13.920> level

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
as well it's a number two on their level

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.279 
as well it's a number two on their level
of<00:00:14.519> difficulty<00:00:14.910> two<00:00:15.450> out<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.630> three

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
of difficulty two out of three

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.070 
of difficulty two out of three
but<00:00:17.100> still<00:00:17.699> should<00:00:18.210> be<00:00:18.240> perfectly<00:00:18.900> possible

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
but still should be perfectly possible

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.820 
but still should be perfectly possible
for<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.650> cat<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.310> figure<00:00:21.090> out<00:00:21.470> now<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.590> comes

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
for a cat to figure out now it comes

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.849 
for a cat to figure out now it comes
made<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.820> plastic<00:00:24.300> with<00:00:25.199> these<00:00:25.410> sliding

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
made of plastic with these sliding

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.839 
made of plastic with these sliding
covers<00:00:26.820> here<00:00:27.260> now<00:00:28.260> at<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.560> highest<00:00:29.490> level<00:00:29.760> of

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
covers here now at the highest level of

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.250 
covers here now at the highest level of
difficulty<00:00:30.740> we<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:31.949> these<00:00:32.149> there<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:34.140> of

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
difficulty we have these there so of

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.740 
difficulty we have these there so of
course<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.649> cat<00:00:34.829> can't<00:00:35.130> uncover<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.850> until

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
course the cat can't uncover this until

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.380 
course the cat can't uncover this until
he's<00:00:36.930> removed<00:00:37.290> those<00:00:37.969> but<00:00:38.969> we're<00:00:39.239> going<00:00:39.329> to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
he's removed those but we're going to

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.209 
he's removed those but we're going to
start<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.870> nice<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.170> easy<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> cap<00:00:41.040> to

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.940 
start it nice and easy for the cap to
begin<00:00:41.489> with<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:42.780> I'm<00:00:43.230> going<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.440> place<00:00:43.680> a

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
begin with and I'm going to place a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.549 
begin with and I'm going to place a
chicken<00:00:44.520> Treat<00:00:44.850> under<00:00:45.510> all<00:00:45.899> eight<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.260> these

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
chicken Treat under all eight of these

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.869 
chicken Treat under all eight of these
holes<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.870> leave<00:00:48.870> them<00:00:49.079> half<00:00:49.320> uncovered<00:00:50.280> so

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
holes and leave them half uncovered so

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.840 
holes and leave them half uncovered so
that<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.809> cat<00:00:52.050> will<00:00:53.030> figure<00:00:54.030> out<00:00:55.699> with<00:00:56.699> it

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
that the cat will figure out with it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.049 
that the cat will figure out with it
just<00:00:57.180> by<00:00:57.270> pushing<00:00:57.510> with<00:00:58.079> its<00:00:58.230> nose<00:00:58.730> how<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> get

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
just by pushing with its nose how to get

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.310 
just by pushing with its nose how to get
the<00:01:00.120> treat<00:01:00.329> out<00:01:02.420> I've<00:01:03.420> got<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.780> quick<00:01:03.930> here

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the treat out I've got to be quick here

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.920 
the treat out I've got to be quick here
before<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> cats<00:01:05.580> actually<00:01:05.970> notice<00:01:06.390> what<00:01:06.810> I'm

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
before the cats actually notice what I'm

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.039 
before the cats actually notice what I'm
doing<00:01:07.400> because<00:01:08.400> they're<00:01:08.640> big<00:01:08.909> fat<00:01:09.150> cheats<00:01:11.840> yep

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
doing because they're big fat cheats yep

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.410 
doing because they're big fat cheats yep
I've<00:01:13.500> been<00:01:13.770> busted<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.909> things<00:01:15.150> are<00:01:15.270> half

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
I've been busted so the things are half

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.539 
I've been busted so the things are half
covered<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:16.409> need<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.619> move<00:01:16.920> them<00:01:17.250> in

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
covered so they need to move them in

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.760 
covered so they need to move them in
order<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.970> actually<00:01:18.090> get<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.479> treat<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:21.770> it's

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
order to actually get the treat out it's

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.670 
order to actually get the treat out it's
not<00:01:22.920> ideal<00:01:23.159> working<00:01:23.759> with<00:01:23.880> two<00:01:24.090> cats<00:01:24.680> because

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
not ideal working with two cats because

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.780 
not ideal working with two cats because
they<00:01:25.890> work<00:01:26.360> against<00:01:27.360> each<00:01:27.509> other<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.790> it

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
they work against each other and it

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.850 
they work against each other and it
becomes<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.180> bit<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.450> rush<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:31.110> well<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.710> they

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
becomes a bit of a rush as well so they

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.370 
becomes a bit of a rush as well so they
can't<00:01:32.100> think<00:01:32.460> about<00:01:32.700> things<00:01:33.000> but<00:01:33.960> hopefully

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
can't think about things but hopefully

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.109 
can't think about things but hopefully
they'll<00:01:34.530> get<00:01:34.740> used<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> sliding<00:01:35.820> motion

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
they'll get used to the sliding motion

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.649 
they'll get used to the sliding motion
and<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:37.619> idea<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:37.979> these<00:01:38.280> things<00:01:38.759> slide<00:01:39.210> to

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
and the idea that these things slide to

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.690 
and the idea that these things slide to
uncover<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.439> reward

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.490 

and<00:01:44.700> there's<00:01:45.180> Tinker<00:01:45.720> actually<00:01:46.020> moving<00:01:46.320> one

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
and there's Tinker actually moving one

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.819 
and there's Tinker actually moving one
for<00:01:46.710> Chet<00:01:46.890> see<00:01:47.100> isn't<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.490> nice<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.820> him<00:01:48.829> so

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
in peace whereas I'm having to cover up

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:36.130 
in peace whereas I'm having to cover up
battling<00:02:29.660> your<00:02:29.780> cats<00:02:32.620> now<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:34.420> expect<00:02:35.420> as<00:02:35.780> usual

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
battling your cats now I expect as usual

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.720 
battling your cats now I expect as usual
chatzi<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.620> going<00:02:36.800> to<00:02:36.860> dominate<00:02:37.010> this<00:02:37.459> and

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
chatzi is going to dominate this and

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.920 
chatzi is going to dominate this and
Tigo<00:02:38.599> is<00:02:38.660> just<00:02:38.870> going<00:02:38.989> to<00:02:39.050> sit<00:02:39.230> back<00:02:39.380> and<00:02:39.440> watch

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
Tigo is just going to sit back and watch

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:54.670 
Tigo is just going to sit back and watch
Conti<00:02:41.930> go<00:02:43.750> under<00:02:44.750> here

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.069 

well<00:02:55.519> chatzi's<00:02:56.150> figured<00:02:56.510> out<00:02:56.629> that<00:02:56.900> there's

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
well chatzi's figured out that there's

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.030 
well chatzi's figured out that there's
something<00:02:57.409> under<00:02:57.650> there

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
something under there

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.460 
something under there
and<00:02:58.209> now<00:02:59.209> we're<00:02:59.360> going<00:02:59.510> through<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.900> random

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
and now we're going through the random

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.009 
and now we're going through the random
movement<00:03:00.650> phase<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:02.060> figure<00:03:02.329> out<00:03:02.450> how<00:03:02.659> there

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
movement phase to figure out how there

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:03.490 
movement phase to figure out how there
we<00:03:03.140> go

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
we go

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.119 
we go
so<00:03:04.430> he'll<00:03:04.610> have<00:03:04.730> learnt<00:03:05.000> now<00:03:05.650> or<00:03:06.650> had<00:03:06.920> one

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
so he'll have learnt now or had one

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.050 
so he'll have learnt now or had one
reinforcement<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:08.750> if<00:03:08.930> you<00:03:09.140> move<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.799> thing

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
reinforcement that if you move the thing

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.080 
reinforcement that if you move the thing
it<00:03:11.060> uncovers<00:03:11.540> a<00:03:11.569> treat<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.560> hopefully<00:03:13.090> he'll

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
it uncovers a treat so hopefully he'll

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.330 
it uncovers a treat so hopefully he'll
do<00:03:14.269> that<00:03:14.299> again<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.750> couple<00:03:15.109> of<00:03:15.170> times<00:03:15.470> by<00:03:16.040> luck

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
do that again a couple of times by luck

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:30.330 
do that again a couple of times by luck
and<00:03:16.640> then<00:03:17.480> figure<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.780> out<00:03:21.730> good<00:03:22.730> boy

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.559 

just<00:03:31.340> going<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.549> hold<00:03:31.700> it<00:03:31.819> down<00:03:32.000> so<00:03:32.269> he<00:03:32.329> doesn't

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
just going to hold it down so he doesn't

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.240 
just going to hold it down so he doesn't
look<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.900> knock<00:03:33.200> it<00:03:33.230> around<00:03:34.629> come<00:03:35.629> on<00:03:36.159> there<00:03:37.159> we

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
look it knock it around come on there we

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.929 
look it knock it around come on there we
go<00:03:37.599> and<00:03:38.599> again<00:03:39.260> that's<00:03:40.099> the<00:03:40.220> second<00:03:40.639> one<00:03:40.760> he's

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:40.939 
go and again that's the second one he's

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:45.780 
go and again that's the second one he's
done<00:03:41.150> so<00:03:41.389> that's<00:03:41.540> a<00:03:41.889> good<00:03:42.889> achievement

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.050 

meanwhile<00:03:46.790> Tigo<00:03:47.209> just<00:03:47.450> looks<00:03:47.629> on<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:49.700> can<00:03:49.849> see

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
meanwhile Tigo just looks on you can see

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.599 
meanwhile Tigo just looks on you can see
how<00:03:50.269> insensitive<00:03:51.230> his<00:03:51.590> nose<00:03:51.799> is<00:03:52.040> he<00:03:52.220> can<00:03:52.370> tell

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
how insensitive his nose is he can tell

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.599 
how insensitive his nose is he can tell
his<00:03:52.639> chicken<00:03:53.209> there<00:03:53.480> we<00:03:53.569> go<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:54.159> again<00:03:55.159> what<00:03:55.579> a

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
his chicken there we go and again what a

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.460 
his chicken there we go and again what a
clever<00:03:55.909> cat<00:03:56.090> this<00:03:56.420> is<00:03:56.569> the<00:03:56.599> second<00:03:57.079> time<00:03:57.260> he's

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
clever cat this is the second time he's

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:08.680 
clever cat this is the second time he's
used<00:03:57.739> this<00:04:06.160> he's<00:04:07.160> tried<00:04:07.849> dig<00:04:08.120> underneath<00:04:08.389> it

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
used this he's tried dig underneath it

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:16.270 
used this he's tried dig underneath it
now<00:04:10.540> it's<00:04:11.540> five<00:04:11.840> more<00:04:12.139> chatzi<00:04:13.989> go<00:04:14.989> on<00:04:15.199> you<00:04:16.099> can

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
now it's five more chatzi go on you can

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.909 
now it's five more chatzi go on you can
do<00:04:16.430> it<00:04:16.459> oh<00:04:16.729> he's<00:04:17.000> knocked<00:04:17.150> one<00:04:17.389> by<00:04:17.539> accident

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.390 

well<00:04:21.919> town

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
well town

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.149 
well town
I<00:04:22.900> think<00:04:23.900> he's<00:04:24.020> not<00:04:24.229> entirely<00:04:24.620> sure<00:04:24.949> which

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:25.159 
I think he's not entirely sure which

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.659 
I think he's not entirely sure which
ones<00:04:25.460> have<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.360> chicken<00:04:27.310> but<00:04:28.310> he's<00:04:28.430> got<00:04:28.639> a

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
ones have the chicken but he's got a

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:29.920 
ones have the chicken but he's got a
rough<00:04:28.909> idea<00:04:29.120> because<00:04:29.449> he<00:04:29.479> seems<00:04:29.750> to<00:04:29.840> be

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
rough idea because he seems to be

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.409 
rough idea because he seems to be
hovering<00:04:30.080> around<00:04:30.380> this<00:04:30.740> end<00:04:30.949> I'm<00:04:31.699> pretty<00:04:32.060> sure

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
hovering around this end I'm pretty sure

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.070 
hovering around this end I'm pretty sure
well<00:04:32.900> that<00:04:33.020> one's<00:04:33.199> that<00:04:33.349> Sam<00:04:34.449> so<00:04:35.449> these<00:04:35.630> three

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
well that one's that Sam so these three

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.580 
well that one's that Sam so these three
are<00:04:36.320> left<00:04:36.889> I<00:04:37.539> think<00:04:38.539> the<00:04:38.750> difficulty<00:04:39.229> now<00:04:39.380> is

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
are left I think the difficulty now is

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.659 
are left I think the difficulty now is
that<00:04:40.030> whereas<00:04:41.030> with<00:04:41.630> other<00:04:41.659> toys<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:43.280> lids

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
that whereas with other toys the lids

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.909 
that whereas with other toys the lids
come<00:04:43.970> off<00:04:44.090> and<00:04:44.300> you<00:04:44.360> can<00:04:44.510> move<00:04:44.630> them<00:04:44.780> away<00:04:44.919> with

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
come off and you can move them away with

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.439 
come off and you can move them away with
this<00:04:46.099> one<00:04:46.340> they<00:04:46.550> just<00:04:46.760> move<00:04:46.940> out<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.270> way

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
this one they just move out the way

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.120 
this one they just move out the way
and<00:04:47.690> so<00:04:48.050> he's<00:04:48.199> finding<00:04:48.530> a<00:04:48.560> bit<00:04:48.740> harder<00:04:49.099> to

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
and so he's finding a bit harder to

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.939 
and so he's finding a bit harder to
actually<00:04:49.520> figure<00:04:49.729> out<00:04:50.000> which<00:04:50.900> ones<00:04:51.169> have<00:04:51.770> the

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
actually figure out which ones have the

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:58.950 
actually figure out which ones have the
treats<00:04:52.190> under

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.190 

there<00:04:59.960> we<00:05:00.020> go<00:05:00.170> and<00:05:00.380> he<00:05:01.190> gets<00:05:01.430> one<00:05:01.640> another<00:05:01.850> one

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
there we go and he gets one another one

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.790 
there we go and he gets one another one
so<00:05:03.200> maybe<00:05:03.410> now<00:05:03.650> he's<00:05:03.920> in<00:05:04.070> the<00:05:04.160> right<00:05:04.340> side

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
so maybe now he's in the right side

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:13.030 
so maybe now he's in the right side
let's<00:05:06.800> see<00:05:06.950> one<00:05:07.160> more<00:05:11.560> so<00:05:12.560> the<00:05:12.680> great<00:05:12.830> thing

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
let's see one more so the great thing

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.950 
let's see one more so the great thing
about<00:05:13.070> these<00:05:13.400> puzzle<00:05:14.120> feeders<00:05:14.510> is<00:05:14.690> the

five stars out of five again it is

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.890 
five stars out of five again it is
harder<00:06:15.260> than<00:06:15.860> other<00:06:16.370> ones<00:06:16.669> there<00:06:17.210> are<00:06:17.240> simpler

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
harder than other ones there are simpler

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.140 
harder than other ones there are simpler
puzzle<00:06:18.650> feeders<00:06:19.040> but<00:06:19.550> if<00:06:19.700> you've<00:06:19.820> done<00:06:19.850> the

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
puzzle feeders but if you've done the

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.820 
puzzle feeders but if you've done the
simple<00:06:20.479> one<00:06:20.630> and<00:06:21.169> you<00:06:21.290> want<00:06:21.380> something<00:06:21.770> a

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
simple one and you want something a

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.190 
simple one and you want something a
little<00:06:21.860> more<00:06:22.160> challenging<00:06:22.820> then<00:06:23.630> try<00:06:23.960> this

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.200 
little more challenging then try this

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.860 
little more challenging then try this
you<00:06:24.800> can<00:06:25.370> let<00:06:25.580> vary<00:06:25.940> its<00:06:26.150> level<00:06:26.419> of<00:06:26.510> difficulty

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
you can let vary its level of difficulty

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.440 
you can let vary its level of difficulty
by<00:06:27.200> half<00:06:27.500> opening<00:06:28.010> the<00:06:28.490> holes<00:06:28.850> or<00:06:29.090> something

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
by half opening the holes or something

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.219 
by half opening the holes or something
like<00:06:29.600> that<00:06:29.660> and<00:06:30.640> so<00:06:31.640> the<00:06:32.090> more<00:06:32.330> confident<00:06:33.080> your

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
like that and so the more confident your

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:35.080 
like that and so the more confident your
cat<00:06:33.470> gets<00:06:33.740> with<00:06:33.950> it<00:06:34.070> the<00:06:34.310> harder<00:06:34.430> you<00:06:34.729> can<00:06:34.910> make

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
cat gets with it the harder you can make

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.480 
cat gets with it the harder you can make
it<00:06:35.650> so<00:06:36.650> I<00:06:37.010> think<00:06:37.700> it<00:06:38.000> grows<00:06:38.270> with<00:06:38.510> you<00:06:39.490> after

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
it so I think it grows with you after

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.670 
it so I think it grows with you after
five<00:06:40.669> or<00:06:40.880> six<00:06:41.150> goes<00:06:41.419> I<00:06:41.750> expect<00:06:42.260> the<00:06:42.350> cat<00:06:42.530> would

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 
five or six goes I expect the cat would

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.530 
five or six goes I expect the cat would
get<00:06:42.830> pretty<00:06:43.100> proficient<00:06:43.520> at<00:06:43.850> it<00:06:43.880> so<00:06:44.240> you<00:06:44.300> can

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
get pretty proficient at it so you can

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.600 
get pretty proficient at it so you can
spice<00:06:44.870> things<00:06:45.169> up<00:06:45.350> by<00:06:45.890> using<00:06:45.919> these<00:06:46.370> little

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610 
spice things up by using these little

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.380 
spice things up by using these little
Center<00:06:47.120> locks<00:06:47.360> to<00:06:48.290> make<00:06:48.440> it<00:06:48.590> even<00:06:48.710> harder<00:06:49.090> so<00:06:50.090> I

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.390 
Center locks to make it even harder so I

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.940 
Center locks to make it even harder so I
think<00:06:50.900> it's<00:06:51.020> really<00:06:51.260> good<00:06:51.500> value<00:06:51.740> for<00:06:51.770> money

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950 
think it's really good value for money

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.120 
think it's really good value for money
and<00:06:52.490> great<00:06:53.150> fun<00:06:53.419> you<00:06:54.140> can<00:06:54.229> see<00:06:54.380> how<00:06:54.500> stimulated

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
and great fun you can see how stimulated

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:02.040 
and great fun you can see how stimulated
these<00:06:55.310> two<00:06:55.520> are
