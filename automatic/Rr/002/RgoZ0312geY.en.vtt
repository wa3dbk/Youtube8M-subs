00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.290
 Volgograd region drought began 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.150
 residents of settlements in the middle 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.630
 Aktobe pony is not enough drinking 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.370
 the waters dry up the well and the ponds shallow 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.359
 Irina Ulyanova understood the reasons 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.670
 disasters futari ktestsky all dry 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.470
 wells to collect bucket farmers 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.570
 have to wait in the column no less 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.920
 half an hour there is no water 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.560
 wait at all this some water there he 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.750
 a little on the bottom which shines all 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.920
 her motor can not swing at all 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.899
 for survival who how to survive thanks here 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.180
 this motors well drilled so 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.079
 long and enough this well 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.110
 briefly 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.059
 yota level we all have no water because 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.219
 that this year's traditional spring 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.600
 water discharges to the Volga hydroelectric station began on 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.850
 a week later than usual 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.250
 and runs in record low volumes 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.629
 standard volumes reset sufficient 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.780
 so that the average Cuban floodplain 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.000
 filled with water 28 thousand cubic meters in 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.400
 second and the reset itself should last from 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.439
 ten to fifteen days but now 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.080
 the station discharges water in volumes almost 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.510
 half as much as 16 thousand cubic meters per 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.760
 second for the inhabitants of the hamlet cells such 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.310
 figures as a sentence the local lake is already 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.790
 the shallowers of the farmers are afraid that the end of summer 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.630
 it will dry out completely in the summer 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.970
 understand if there is no water 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.729
 the fire situation will increase again 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.890
 we're going to ask that for help 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.610
 so that we will be pumped over by steel 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.860
 transfer 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.369
 we will pump up the lake and koretskoy 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.689
 then other settlements 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.880
 experts say reasons for records 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.220
 small volumes of natural water discharge 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.740
 end of last year around the nap like 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.159
 Omsk basin was arid kremlin 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.130
 winter 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.159
 the vein was completely dry that is, the snow lay down 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.530
 on dry ground, he then began spring with that 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.719
 basically the bulk of the water went to 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.630
 the earth that is this and listening to the earth 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.729
 took almost all the water such 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.829
 The situation in the area was not the last three 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.170
 a dozen years while people are somehow 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:15.269
 copes water take straight and well 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:15.269
 they have little hope of hunting in Russian 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.200
 fish shortage will suffer now 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.879
 channels and lakes are not filled with water 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.450
 then from spawns can only 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.379
 quarter form fish 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.110
 production will be bad and 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:34.120
 accordingly this lost year 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.560
 he will have an effect later on 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.799
 fish stock status 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.260
 if summer is hot dry you can 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.849
 expect and dry the ponds completely 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.549
 that is, it will completely kill and 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.230
 fish feed base is projected 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.760
 meteorologists whether this Volgograd 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.950
 the area promises to be hot 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.569
 if the situation does not change residents 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.819
 average ahtuba worth preparing for 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.769
 severe water shortages and environmentalists 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.180
 warn that in this case the process 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:03.819
 dead spots of the floodplain may become irreversible 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.319
 here today by the way the day of the Volga orico by 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.900
 according to water management experts 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.970
 the deputy head is growing smaller for the second year 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.769
 lower abalone control departments 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.079
 urged to save water all 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.599
 users that is delaying reset 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.609
 water on all the dams if this is not 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.669
 do something in the period of the lowest level 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:24.810
 water in the Volga may be deficient in 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.810
 Astrakhan and and in the city
