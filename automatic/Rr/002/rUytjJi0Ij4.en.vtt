00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
security question from your console so

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.080 
security question from your console so
obviously<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:44.010> control<00:00:44.820> your<00:00:45.030> own

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
access to your ultimate team but the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.180 
access to your ultimate team but the
only<00:00:48.570> problem<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.230> when<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.739> can't<00:00:50.039> get

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
only problem is is when you can't get

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.520 
only problem is is when you can't get
into<00:00:50.520> your<00:00:50.640> own<00:00:50.910> your<00:00:51.629> security<00:00:52.170> question

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
into your own your security question

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.819 
into your own your security question
could<00:00:52.680> not<00:00:52.860> be<00:00:53.010> created<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.989> they<00:00:55.649> have

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
could not be created so they have

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.920 
could not be created so they have
improved<00:00:56.129> security<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.120> point<00:00:57.449> where<00:00:57.660> I

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
improved security to the point where I

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.139 
improved security to the point where I
can't<00:00:58.590> even<00:00:59.070> get<00:00:59.160> into<00:00:59.309> my<00:00:59.489> own<00:00:59.609> account<00:00:59.850> so

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
can't even get into my own account so

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.380 
can't even get into my own account so
that<00:01:00.359> means<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.379> nobody<00:01:01.800> can<00:01:02.039> hack<00:01:02.219> me

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
that means that nobody can hack me

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.240 
that means that nobody can hack me
