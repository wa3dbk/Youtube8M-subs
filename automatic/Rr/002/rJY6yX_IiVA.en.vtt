00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.259 
the fire is really low so you can PvP
really<00:02:36.170> good<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:36.920> can<00:02:37.010> still<00:02:37.280> see<00:02:37.310> who

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
really good and you can still see who

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.140 
really good and you can still see who
you<00:02:38.360> hitting<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.780> way<00:02:38.930> hitting<00:02:41.769> where<00:02:42.769> I

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
you hitting and way hitting where I

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:51.320 
you hitting and way hitting where I
customize<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.299> critic<00:02:44.600> cool

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:03:00.780 

and<00:02:52.330> then<00:02:52.480> when<00:02:52.600> you<00:02:52.690> jump<00:02:58.800> also<00:02:59.800> customize

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
and then when you jump also customize

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.150 
and then when you jump also customize
the<00:03:01.150> wave<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:01.960> chance<00:03:02.380> look<00:03:02.680> as<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:02.890> can<00:03:03.010> see

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
the wave and chance look as you can see

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.980 
the wave and chance look as you can see
on<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.280> sword<00:03:03.640> so<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.210> looks<00:03:04.420> like<00:03:04.480> lightning

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.500 

like<00:03:07.990> you<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.680> looks<00:03:08.830> like<00:03:08.950> you're<00:03:09.510> being

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
like you and it looks like you're being

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.150 
like you and it looks like you're being
electrocuted<00:03:11.020> or<00:03:11.290> something<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.770> really<00:03:11.980> like

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
electrocuted or something I really like

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.460 
electrocuted or something I really like
it<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.430> made<00:03:12.700> that<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:15.360> got<00:03:16.360> their<00:03:16.510> custom<00:03:16.990> Sun<00:03:17.290> up

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
it I made that I got their custom Sun up

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:28.910 
it I made that I got their custom Sun up
here

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.500 

and<00:03:29.920> now<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:30.460> should<00:03:30.940> be<00:03:31.060> able<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.240> see<00:03:31.390> the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
and now you should be able to see the

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.900 
and now you should be able to see the
moon<00:03:31.800> HD<00:03:32.800> may<00:03:33.010> not<00:03:33.190> work<00:03:33.400> I<00:03:35.460> think<00:03:36.460> that<00:03:36.670> is

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
moon HD may not work I think that is

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.520 
moon HD may not work I think that is
basically<00:03:37.690> it<00:03:40.200> there's<00:03:41.200> probably<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.500> few

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
basically it there's probably a few

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.200 
basically it there's probably a few
small<00:03:42.010> things<00:03:42.280> that<00:03:42.370> I've<00:03:42.520> forgotten<00:03:42.850> but
