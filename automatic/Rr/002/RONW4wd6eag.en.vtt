00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
little bit harder so I add a little more

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.890 
little bit harder so I add a little more
flour<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.670> that's<00:04:03.510> all

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
flour to it that's all

flour to it that's all
when<00:04:04.050> it<00:04:04.170> gets<00:04:04.440> too<00:04:04.739> soft<00:04:04.980> then<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.340> add<00:04:05.640> flour

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
when it gets too soft then you add flour

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.180 
when it gets too soft then you add flour
not<00:04:06.420> then<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:06.780> add<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:06.959> little<00:04:07.080> water<00:04:07.350> but<00:04:08.160> I

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
not then you add a little water but I

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:20.060 
not then you add a little water but I
don't<00:04:08.520> add<00:04:08.970> water<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:09.780> at<00:04:10.050> all<00:04:18.620> and<00:04:19.620> then<00:04:19.890> my

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
don't add water to it at all and then my

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.440 
don't add water to it at all and then my
soup<00:04:20.340> is<00:04:20.519> almost<00:04:20.970> done<00:04:21.299> then<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.780> good<00:04:22.650> enough

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450

sleep shop but not that soft a little
bit<00:04:29.610> hard<00:04:30.030> for<00:04:30.120> me<00:04:30.480> to<00:04:30.690> do

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
bit hard for me to do

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.909 
bit hard for me to do
make<00:04:31.530> sure<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:31.890> see<00:04:32.190> it<00:04:32.310> well<00:04:33.180> this<00:04:34.140> is<00:04:34.590> the

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
make sure you see it well this is the

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:40.159 
make sure you see it well this is the
though<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.870> just<00:04:36.870> dip<00:04:37.530> my<00:04:37.830> spoon<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.810> I<00:04:39.810> make

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
though I just dip my spoon and I make

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.270 
though I just dip my spoon and I make
better<00:04:40.729> times<00:04:41.840> and<00:04:42.840> this<00:04:43.050> is<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.320> easiest<00:04:43.919> way

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
better times and this is the easiest way

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.120 
better times and this is the easiest way
to<00:04:44.550> make<00:04:44.820> it<00:04:45.060> but<00:04:45.990> this<00:04:46.290> tastes<00:04:46.650> really<00:04:46.800> good

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
to make it but this tastes really good

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:54.040 
to make it but this tastes really good
baby<00:04:47.520> so<00:04:50.300> flatten<00:04:51.300> make<00:04:51.900> it<00:04:52.140> came<00:04:52.950> flap<00:04:53.640> and

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
baby so flatten make it came flap and

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.969 
baby so flatten make it came flap and
easier<00:04:55.050> to<00:04:55.140> just<00:04:55.830> go<00:04:56.070> in<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:56.550> your<00:04:57.180> spooning<00:04:57.810> I

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.040 

hope<00:05:01.979> you<00:05:02.160> can<00:05:02.400> see<00:05:02.700> because<00:05:02.880> my<00:05:03.479> angles

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
hope you can see because my angles

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.100 
hope you can see because my angles
really<00:05:04.440> hot<00:05:04.710> for<00:05:05.039> my<00:05:05.220> chance<00:05:06.030> to<00:05:06.240> do<00:05:06.390> but<00:05:07.080> I

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
really hot for my chance to do but I

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.440 
really hot for my chance to do but I
want<00:05:07.440> you<00:05:07.620> to<00:05:07.680> see<00:05:08.070> and<00:05:09.350> I<00:05:10.350> show<00:05:10.800> you<00:05:10.830> another

want you to see and I show you another

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.000 
want you to see and I show you another

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
trick because this way it gets a little

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.090 
trick because this way it gets a little
bit<00:05:14.250> bigger<00:05:14.660> but<00:05:15.660> I<00:05:15.720> got<00:05:16.080> this<00:05:16.289> good<00:05:16.740> stuff

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
bit bigger but I got this good stuff

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.570

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
I am this is just that another idea and

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.010 
I am this is just that another idea and
I<00:05:26.850> just<00:05:27.660> do<00:05:27.810> it<00:05:27.960> one<00:05:28.229> two<00:05:28.530> three<00:05:28.860> and<00:05:29.400> it's<00:05:29.729> done

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
I just do it one two three and it's done

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.070 
I just do it one two three and it's done
and<00:05:31.020> this<00:05:31.710> will<00:05:31.950> be<00:05:32.100> much<00:05:32.310> more<00:05:32.700> and<00:05:33.660> when<00:05:33.930> I

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
and this will be much more and when I

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.850 
and this will be much more and when I
find<00:05:34.500> out<00:05:34.800> how<00:05:35.760> we<00:05:35.820> can<00:05:36.240> get<00:05:36.419> it<00:05:36.539> here<00:05:36.810> I<00:05:37.140> will

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
find out how we can get it here I will

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.920 
find out how we can get it here I will
put<00:05:38.070> it<00:05:38.190> on<00:05:38.340> my<00:05:38.520> web

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
put it on my web

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.950 
put it on my web
on<00:05:39.259> my<00:05:39.500> facebook<00:05:40.130> under<00:05:40.699> going<00:05:41.389> on<00:05:41.539> the<00:05:41.660> Aryan

but<00:05:42.830> I<00:05:43.100> still<00:05:43.550> really<00:05:44.000> take<00:05:44.270> time<00:05:44.539> to<00:05:44.600> find<00:05:45.320> out

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
but I still really take time to find out

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.790 
but I still really take time to find out
all<00:05:45.860> we<00:05:45.889> can<00:05:46.270> get<00:05:47.270> it<00:05:47.419> from<00:05:47.660> me<00:05:47.930> because<00:05:48.470> it's

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
all we can get it from me because it's

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.350 
all we can get it from me because it's
easy<00:05:49.070> to<00:05:49.520> make

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
easy to make

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.830 
easy to make
