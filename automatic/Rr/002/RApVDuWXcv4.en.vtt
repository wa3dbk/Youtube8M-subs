due<00:00:00.240> to<00:00:00.439> disease<00:00:04.040> I<00:00:05.040> have<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.250> good<00:00:05.700> food

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
due to disease I have a good food

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.350 
due to disease I have a good food
step<00:00:07.950> 1<00:00:08.400> adjust<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.000> comfortable

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
step 1 adjust to a comfortable

step 1 adjust to a comfortable
sensitivity

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
sensitivity

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.870 
sensitivity
I<00:00:12.260> find<00:00:13.260> that<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.530> best<00:00:13.680> method<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.370> finding<00:00:14.760> a

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
I find that the best method to finding a

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.350 
I find that the best method to finding a
sensitivity<00:00:15.360> fit<00:00:15.780> for<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:17.180> starting<00:00:18.180> in

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
sensitivity fit for you is starting in

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.839 
sensitivity fit for you is starting in
the<00:00:18.480> middle<00:00:18.840> area<00:00:19.170> around<00:00:19.650> five<00:00:20.010> or<00:00:20.040> six<00:00:20.220> and

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:20.849 
the middle area around five or six and

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:22.999 
the middle area around five or six and
jumping<00:00:21.509> up<00:00:21.599> in<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.779> air<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.230> doing<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.529> 360

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
jumping up in the air and doing a 360

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.179 
jumping up in the air and doing a 360
and<00:00:23.490> if<00:00:23.610> you<00:00:23.730> can<00:00:23.880> consistently<00:00:24.570> end<00:00:24.990> up<00:00:25.860> where

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
and if you can consistently end up where

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.740 
and if you can consistently end up where
you<00:00:26.369> were<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.759> the<00:00:26.849> first<00:00:27.060> place

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
you were in the first place

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.019 
you were in the first place
so<00:00:27.989> as<00:00:28.290> I'm<00:00:28.590> aiming<00:00:28.860> at<00:00:28.950> these<00:00:29.130> guys<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.369> jump<00:00:29.880> up

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
so as I'm aiming at these guys I jump up

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.659 
so as I'm aiming at these guys I jump up
and<00:00:30.239> do<00:00:30.540> a<00:00:30.570> 360<00:00:30.899> and<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.739> try<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.009> aim<00:00:32.279> right<00:00:32.520> at

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
and do a 360 and I try to aim right at

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.720 
and do a 360 and I try to aim right at
him<00:00:32.790> again<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.270> play<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.110> nine<00:00:34.380> because<00:00:35.370> that's

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
him again I play on nine because that's

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.430 
him again I play on nine because that's
the<00:00:35.940> sensitivity<00:00:36.540> I'm<00:00:36.690> most<00:00:36.899> comfortable

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the sensitivity I'm most comfortable

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.430 
the sensitivity I'm most comfortable
with<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:38.010> for<00:00:38.250> beginners<00:00:39.020> it's<00:00:40.020> best<00:00:40.350> to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
with but for beginners it's best to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.500 
with but for beginners it's best to
start<00:00:40.739> off<00:00:40.920> low<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.489> slowly<00:00:41.820> build<00:00:42.180> your<00:00:42.390> way

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
start off low and slowly build your way

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.770 
start off low and slowly build your way
up<00:00:42.770> using<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:43.860> technique<00:00:44.450> until<00:00:45.450> you're<00:00:45.660> at

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
up using this technique until you're at

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.060 
up using this technique until you're at
a<00:00:45.810> point<00:00:46.050> where<00:00:46.230> you're<00:00:46.380> most<00:00:46.500> comfortable

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
a point where you're most comfortable

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.740 
a point where you're most comfortable
step<00:00:50.070> two<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.430> working<00:00:50.790> on<00:00:50.910> your<00:00:51.090> timing<00:00:51.540> when

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
step two is working on your timing when

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.100 
step two is working on your timing when
you<00:00:51.870> scope<00:00:52.170> in

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
you scope in

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.720 
you scope in
for<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.230> clip<00:00:55.470> I<00:00:55.590> slowed<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:55.920> down<00:00:56.040> because

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
for this clip I slowed it down because

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.090 
for this clip I slowed it down because
when<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.420> scope<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.440> perfect<00:00:58.890> time<00:00:59.070> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
when you scope in the perfect time to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.610 
when you scope in the perfect time to
fire<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.940> when<00:01:00.270> as<00:01:00.630> you'll<00:01:01.200> see<00:01:01.380> right<00:01:01.559> here

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
fire is when as you'll see right here

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.119 
fire is when as you'll see right here
when<00:01:02.580> the<00:01:03.180> outline<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.629> your<00:01:03.809> screen<00:01:04.320> turns

circle where you are scoping in at this

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.710 
circle where you are scoping in at this
is<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.130> show<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.760> are<00:01:11.910> fully<00:01:12.210> scoped

a person and then as you're scoping in

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.699 
a person and then as you're scoping in
you<00:02:09.099> drag<00:02:09.520> your<00:02:09.849> scope<00:02:10.780> over<00:02:10.989> to<00:02:11.380> their<00:02:11.500> body

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
you drag your scope over to their body

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.530 
you drag your scope over to their body
and<00:02:11.920> fire<00:02:12.280> as<00:02:12.580> soon<00:02:12.790> as<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.060> gets<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.330> their

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
and fire as soon as it gets to their

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.510 
and fire as soon as it gets to their
body<00:02:13.750> this<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.620> good<00:02:14.830> for<00:02:15.069> if<00:02:15.220> you're<00:02:15.370> not

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
body this is good for if you're not

body this is good for if you're not
already<00:02:15.730> aiming<00:02:16.090> at<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.480> person<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.020> can

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
already aiming at the person you can

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.479 
already aiming at the person you can
easily<00:02:17.800> kill<00:02:18.250> them<00:02:18.520> before<00:02:19.150> they<00:02:19.420> kill<00:02:19.780> you

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
easily kill them before they kill you

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
while of practicing you'll start to get

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.199 
while of practicing you'll start to get
a<00:02:29.200> feel<00:02:29.290> for<00:02:29.560> how<00:02:29.950> much<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.370> drag<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.790> either<00:02:30.940> to
