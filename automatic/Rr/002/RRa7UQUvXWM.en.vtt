00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.140
 pro-tibet today a new video 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.650
 still so sick on call of duty 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.689
 calls two extinctions the creation mode 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.509
 so new video as the title 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.189
 how many goals is unique and then I 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.429
 explains to you immediately was named in 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.490
 8 who is the sensibility that competition 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.360
 do not have is my people to see but if 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.670
 you know them where 8 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.800
 it's more or less what it is but 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.969
 professional and I do not do that just 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.449
 for that just me it suits me 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.520
 perfectly 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.309
 it's not too fast and it allows me to 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.280
 do it so by armand 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.510
 legally quite often and that allows 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.219
 to play well 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.160
 so all the brave who will say that 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.769
 are worth these minors I do not care we go there 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.300
 so go first very challenges very 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.620
 important between the first girls 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.539
 of arnaud miss none 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.540
 I say if you have hours before 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.340
 the big nor good to start our judge 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.490
 half a time it's dead he's us 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.750
 have to get peas at the beginning so if 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.010
 you attacked melee of 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.950
 melee attacks and no 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.510
 worries but if you do not have you 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.950
 to touch I was going to have to stay at 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.660
 bottom of the pond and a fake excuse to 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.150
 4 to go from left to right 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.010
 sadecky very visible but if each shot 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.790
 his side and do not spend enough pale 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.000
 like a barbarian 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.920
 it should go is not easy 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.510
 legs in girls is not easy 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.120
 the one where you do not have to be touched 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.070
 but good after how many udine games 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.350
 to the advice of our improve first 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.970
 your class still alive inspections 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.020
 places under the weight so hunted them 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.120
 small historical target of the popes 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.040
 fight the monsters in preview 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.610
 video games that's only for that 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.370
 we 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.600
 yes, we are still precarious after 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.770
 continues to do the gleek just as 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.940
 the jeans so enchanted edifice 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.790
 guns pass us what I want 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.160
 do and you continue you continue 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.590
 it's very difficult to do a little 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.380
 elite up to a little advanced 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.370
 but first I tell you that while 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.200
 next no heat are the hits 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.620
 quality marker will soon be closed 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.570
 tutorials tried although you're in 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.430
 function of the marketer sites and shoot 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.900
 always according to the marker sites 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.540
 because we bring even more 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.870
 weight and especially not to flatten all 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.340
 your balls on six and eighteen shots etc. 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.430
 do not slam your balls and that your 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.600
 sides to the end we and the 6 and 4 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.459
 you have managed in 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.760
 do not you do not need so 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.110
 you do not stay alone if there are any 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.390
 you separate from a couple goes there 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.010
 have more at home see you tend to 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.310
 you when you attack you and not the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.070
 other 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.320
 so I advise you to stay together 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.610
 and two that you're here to tell you 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.220
 yes but there's the shot but it's for the 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.459
 challenge I remind you the other the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.950
 challenges of course does it go there we go 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.500
 immediately some one is going to move forward 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.030
 found immediately after the ellipse 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.950
 so that's the nest is over so there 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.260
 I put myself on criteria that such as 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.260
 no worries and 7 that you are you want 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.209
 look down but we down 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.950
 you are a lead at the top you are 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.030
 raised compared to August so that 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.799
 such and aiming down you 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.239
 are going to have said that red marker and 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.590
 so you're going to have more points of 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.299
 employment in this case always 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.250
 increase your class first or your 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.080
 ammunition or your armor always a 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.360
 stuff like that was not going straight ur 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.820
 on the tower elf his advisers if you 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.739
 play with a relic if you have 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.290
 a relic so there go straight on 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.489
 the turret to be able to buckle for 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.810
 that she defend you because that their 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.049
 technique if you play with then ground 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.400
 only now otherwise ben no you 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.060
 will be able to watch the video 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.950

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.720
 we had next and in photo a 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.160
 next video so continue to that you 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.710
 are up to chronic as I have you 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.400
