label<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.479> was<00:01:45.899> testing<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.439> see<00:01:46.649> if<00:01:46.880> y'all

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
label I was testing to see if y'all

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.160 
label I was testing to see if y'all
would<00:01:48.030> look<00:01:48.210> better<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.899> probably

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
would look better but I probably

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.719 
would look better but I probably
shouldn't<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.649> done<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.280> these<00:01:50.430> -

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
shouldn't have done that for these -

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.560 
shouldn't have done that for these -
this<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.630> real<00:01:51.810> -<00:01:51.869> with<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.380> pads<00:01:52.619> inside

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
this is real - with the pads inside
