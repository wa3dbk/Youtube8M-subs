00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.099
 already in one of my videos I showed 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.079
 you 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.920

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:35.559

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:42.160
 what he is with us because I 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:44.920
 I showed how I did it all I just take 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:50.829
 I cut the refrigerator drive to 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:53.550
 improve his properties and then I him 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.199
 just took a piece of chewed 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.270
 swallowed just ate you can say and 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:02.190
 here he stayed 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.740
 but many people they do not want or can not 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.080
 because it is easy to eat because 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.289
 all the same he has such a bitter taste 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.360
 here it is this gel 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:19.450
 liquid yes indeed it is bitter 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:22.690
 that's why sometimes you just need it 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.110
 add a little bit to the deadlines that 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.590

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.080

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.750
 order to improve the properties of this 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.729
 the pot of this plant and he just 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.599
 cleanses the body tones it 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.390
 reduces even the weight of a person that is 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:49.539
 a kilogram a little bit I'm going to this 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.209
 I also want to add to the plant 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:56.649

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:13.690
 I cut this one here is the pulp 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.140
 gel is of course to be 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.300
 this plant must be at least 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.599
 four is better of course than the more 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.920

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:52.060
 it's like a storehouse of vitamins and minerals and 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:55.959
 Kiwi itself is also a little bit and 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:59.940

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:14.310
 Kiwi is already very good so soft

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:47.500
 Now we have just spring in Ukraine 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.329
 already dropped kidney berries which 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.269
 called cherry 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:54.790
 we froze it this year very 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:58.480
 many preserved water acquia 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.450
 ok here look this is thawed 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.269
 they needed to be used movie cakes 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:08.170

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:12.459

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.680
 you can watch on our channel 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.009

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:32.229
 the way these i 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:34.539
 they are pitted very much I advise much 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.750
 better than any jam and so on 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:41.349
 all the same berries 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.409

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:48.819

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:51.159

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.400

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:29.409
