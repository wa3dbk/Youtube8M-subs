you know a few weeks ago I did a review
of<00:00:13.430> the<00:00:13.550> nest<00:00:13.760> tip<00:00:14.030> trap<00:00:14.300> which<00:00:14.570> is<00:00:14.600> great<00:00:15.380> trap

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
of the nest tip trap which is great trap

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.920 
of the nest tip trap which is great trap
got<00:00:16.250> some<00:00:16.430> really<00:00:16.670> good<00:00:16.760> feedback<00:00:17.000> on<00:00:17.270> that<00:00:17.720> I

even saw some of you guys I bought those

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.130 
even saw some of you guys I bought those
and<00:00:20.150> we're<00:00:20.270> using<00:00:20.420> them<00:00:20.570> yourselves<00:00:20.960> which<00:00:21.110> is

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
and we're using them yourselves which is

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.470 
and we're using them yourselves which is
awesome<00:00:21.710> I'm<00:00:21.830> so<00:00:21.860> glad<00:00:22.160> so<00:00:22.970> glad<00:00:23.000> I'm

hopefully<00:00:23.840> convincing<00:00:24.500> some<00:00:24.650> other<00:00:24.770> people

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
hopefully convincing some other people

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.920 
hopefully convincing some other people
to<00:00:25.400> use<00:00:25.850> live<00:00:26.090> traps<00:00:26.420> and<00:00:26.600> trapped<00:00:26.780> mais

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
to use live traps and trapped mais

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.890 
to use live traps and trapped mais
humanely<00:00:27.289> I<00:00:27.590> have<00:00:28.250> however<00:00:28.490> since<00:00:28.940> then<00:00:29.210> found

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
humanely I have however since then found

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.779 
humanely I have however since then found
a<00:00:30.080> trap<00:00:30.320> that<00:00:30.560> I<00:00:30.619> think<00:00:31.100> we're<00:00:31.400> going<00:00:31.490> to<00:00:31.550> test

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
a trap that I think we're going to test

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.700 
a trap that I think we're going to test
this<00:00:31.970> now<00:00:32.119> but<00:00:32.270> I<00:00:32.329> think<00:00:32.450> it<00:00:33.140> may<00:00:33.350> be<00:00:33.410> even

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
this now but I think it may be even

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.040 
this now but I think it may be even
better<00:00:34.130> than<00:00:34.730> the<00:00:34.940> nest<00:00:35.180> tip<00:00:35.450> trap<00:00:35.720> and<00:00:35.960> that

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
better than the nest tip trap and that

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.770 
better than the nest tip trap and that
is<00:00:36.200> the<00:00:36.350> mice<00:00:36.560> cube<00:00:36.950> which<00:00:37.520> seems<00:00:37.910> like<00:00:38.120> really

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
is the mice cube which seems like really

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.750 
is the mice cube which seems like really
bad<00:00:39.079> English<00:00:39.530> actually<00:00:39.739> but<00:00:40.160> I<00:00:40.190> don't<00:00:40.610> name

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
bad English actually but I don't name

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.280 
bad English actually but I don't name
these<00:00:40.970> things<00:00:41.239> all<00:00:41.540> I<00:00:41.600> know<00:00:41.810> is<00:00:41.989> it<00:00:42.079> looks

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
these things all I know is it looks

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.630 
these things all I know is it looks
really<00:00:42.770> really<00:00:42.980> cool<00:00:43.130> okay

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
really really cool okay

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.240 
really really cool okay
it's<00:00:44.149> basically<00:00:44.770> simple<00:00:45.770> which<00:00:45.980> one<00:00:46.130> of<00:00:46.190> the

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
it's basically simple which one of the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.040 
it's basically simple which one of the
things<00:00:46.430> I<00:00:46.520> liked<00:00:46.760> so<00:00:46.880> much<00:00:46.940> about<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:47.329> nest<00:00:47.570> is

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
things I liked so much about the nest is

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.290 
things I liked so much about the nest is
that<00:00:48.320> is<00:00:48.500> simple<00:00:49.160> but<00:00:49.520> these<00:00:49.700> things<00:00:50.000> look

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
that is simple but these things look

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.720 
that is simple but these things look
like<00:00:50.329> there's<00:00:50.780> even<00:00:50.899> easier<00:00:51.559> to<00:00:52.040> use<00:00:52.250> which

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
like there's even easier to use which

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.940 
like there's even easier to use which
I'm<00:00:53.719> very<00:00:54.020> attractive<00:00:54.530> because<00:00:54.680> if<00:00:54.800> there's

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
I'm very attractive because if there's

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.350 
I'm very attractive because if there's
one<00:00:55.010> thing<00:00:55.130> that<00:00:55.460> tends<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:55.820> fail<00:00:56.059> its

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
one thing that tends to fail its

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.510 
one thing that tends to fail its
complexity<00:00:57.140> especially<00:00:57.559> with<00:00:57.680> mousetraps<00:00:58.100> so

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
complexity especially with mousetraps so

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.030 
complexity especially with mousetraps so
anyways<00:00:59.030> basically<00:00:59.780> just<00:01:00.350> kind<00:01:00.739> of<00:01:00.800> what<00:01:00.950> it

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
anyways basically just kind of what it

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.580 
anyways basically just kind of what it
says<00:01:01.250> it<00:01:01.370> is<00:01:01.520> it's<00:01:01.820> a<00:01:02.000> clear<00:01:02.660> box<00:01:03.020> which<00:01:03.320> I<00:01:03.410> like

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
says it is it's a clear box which I like

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.079 
says it is it's a clear box which I like
because<00:01:03.800> you<00:01:04.159> should<00:01:04.369> also<00:01:04.519> be<00:01:04.729> able<00:01:04.850> to<00:01:04.939> see

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
because you should also be able to see

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.819 
because you should also be able to see
the<00:01:05.239> mouse<00:01:05.420> so<00:01:05.630> you<00:01:05.689> don't<00:01:05.899> have<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.170> you<00:01:06.799> know

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
the mouse so you don't have to you know

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:08.949 
the mouse so you don't have to you know
try<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:07.189> pick<00:01:07.369> it<00:01:07.399> up<00:01:07.609> and<00:01:07.850> feel<00:01:07.999> oh<00:01:08.299> is<00:01:08.780> it<00:01:08.869> a

00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:08.959 
try and pick it up and feel oh is it a

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:10.569 
try and pick it up and feel oh is it a
light<00:01:09.139> mouse<00:01:09.380> do<00:01:09.770> I<00:01:09.799> feel<00:01:10.039> it<00:01:10.159> in<00:01:10.249> there<00:01:10.399> or<00:01:10.490> not

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579 
light mouse do I feel it in there or not

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:12.459 
light mouse do I feel it in there or not
you<00:01:10.639> can<00:01:10.850> just<00:01:11.030> see<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:12.139> way<00:01:12.229> it<00:01:12.319> works

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
you can just see and the way it works

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.109 
you can just see and the way it works
it's<00:01:12.679> just<00:01:12.799> got<00:01:13.039> this<00:01:13.159> really<00:01:13.549> simple<00:01:13.939> little

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:16.249 
baffle door right here the mouse can go

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:19.690 
baffle door right here the mouse can go
in<00:01:16.490> but<00:01:17.329> it<00:01:17.749> can't<00:01:18.079> get<00:01:18.259> back<00:01:18.439> out<00:01:18.709> so<00:01:19.279> the<00:01:19.579> way

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
in but it can't get back out so the way

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.190 
in but it can't get back out so the way
you<00:01:19.759> bait<00:01:20.060> it<00:01:20.090> is<00:01:20.359> you<00:01:20.569> just<00:01:20.719> take<00:01:20.899> a<00:01:20.959> little
