see<00:05:49.320> this<00:05:49.440> on<00:05:49.560> ebay<00:05:49.710> and<00:05:50.040> pick<00:05:50.490> it<00:05:50.610> up<00:05:50.670> for<00:05:50.850> $45

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
see this on ebay and pick it up for $45

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.810 
see this on ebay and pick it up for $45
and<00:05:51.870> think<00:05:52.080> that<00:05:52.230> was<00:05:52.350> a<00:05:52.380> good<00:05:52.470> deal<00:05:52.710> you<00:05:53.670> know

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
and think that was a good deal you know

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.080 
and think that was a good deal you know
so<00:05:54.090> $45<00:05:55.080> to<00:05:55.230> me<00:05:55.350> it's<00:05:55.470> pricey<00:05:55.740> but<00:05:55.970> seeing<00:05:56.970> as

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
so $45 to me it's pricey but seeing as

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.910 
so $45 to me it's pricey but seeing as
it's<00:05:57.330> very<00:05:57.510> hard<00:05:57.720> to<00:05:57.780> find<00:05:58.020> that<00:05:58.560> would<00:05:58.710> be<00:05:58.830> up

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:58.920 
it's very hard to find that would be up
