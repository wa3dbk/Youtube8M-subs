piano<00:00:03.540> styles<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:05.060> today's<00:00:06.060> lesson<00:00:06.359> is<00:00:06.839> about

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890 
piano styles and today's lesson is about

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.470 
piano styles and today's lesson is about
helping<00:00:07.890> you<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.910> build<00:00:09.389> your<00:00:09.540> sense<00:00:10.080> of

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
helping you to build your sense of

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.740 
helping you to build your sense of
awareness<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.960> where<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.889> notes<00:00:14.160> are<00:00:14.519> on<00:00:14.820> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
awareness of where the notes are on the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.410 
awareness of where the notes are on the
piano<00:00:16.109> learning<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.890> geography<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.820> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
piano learning the geography of the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.660 
piano learning the geography of the
keyboard<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.949> think<00:00:20.160> one<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.460> best

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
keyboard and I think one of the best

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.359 
keyboard and I think one of the best
ways<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.910> do<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:22.070> to<00:00:24.650> not<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.890> looking<00:00:26.250> at

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
ways to do that is to not be looking at

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.330 
ways to do that is to not be looking at
your<00:00:26.490> fingers<00:00:27.080> okay<00:00:28.080> not<00:00:28.349> be<00:00:28.560> looking<00:00:28.920> at<00:00:29.160> your

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
your fingers okay not be looking at your

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.800 
your fingers okay not be looking at your
fingers<00:00:29.609> when<00:00:29.789> you're<00:00:29.939> playing<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.539> just

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
fingers when you're playing this is just

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.160 
fingers when you're playing this is just
you<00:00:30.990> can<00:00:31.019> do<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.500> but<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:32.250> build<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:33.329> awareness

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
you can do it but to build the awareness

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.080 
you can do it but to build the awareness
the<00:00:34.770> spatial<00:00:35.250> awareness<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the spatial awareness of the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.209 
the spatial awareness of the
relationship<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> keys<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.469> each<00:00:37.950> other

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
relationship of the keys to each other

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.720 
relationship of the keys to each other
and<00:00:38.870> you're<00:00:39.870> where<00:00:40.710> you're<00:00:40.890> sitting<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.700> the

actual<00:00:42.210> note<00:00:42.559> I<00:00:43.559> think<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.190> good<00:00:44.370> idea<00:00:44.550> not

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
actual note I think it's a good idea not

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.590 
actual note I think it's a good idea not
to<00:00:45.210> look<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.129> either<00:00:47.129> look<00:00:47.309> away<00:00:47.640> or<00:00:48.030> look<00:00:48.300> up

feel for Black Keys if you need to okay
that<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:07.020> how<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.260> know<00:01:07.320> where<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.770> are<00:01:07.799> so

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
that is how you know where you are so

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.830 
that is how you know where you are so
not<00:01:08.760> only<00:01:08.909> do<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.150> want<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> get<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.570> know<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
not only do you want to get to know the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.109 
not only do you want to get to know the
distance<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.470> intervallic<00:01:10.890> distance<00:01:11.430> but

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
distance the intervallic distance but

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.330 
distance the intervallic distance but
you<00:01:12.150> can<00:01:12.450> also<00:01:12.659> use<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.260> black<00:01:13.380> keys<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.070> help

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
you can also use the black keys to help

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.060 
you can also use the black keys to help
you<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:15.390> learn<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.320> know<00:01:16.439> where<00:01:16.680> you're<00:01:16.830> going

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
you to learn you know where you're going

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.210 
you to learn you know where you're going
okay<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.060> you'd<00:01:18.360> start<00:01:18.720> with<00:01:18.930> C<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.920> D<00:01:20.159> that's

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
okay so you'd start with C to D that's

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.160 
okay so you'd start with C to D that's
the<00:01:20.490> second<00:01:21.000> right<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.360> then<00:01:21.509> we<00:01:21.600> go<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.140> E

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the second right and then we go up to E

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.899 
the second right and then we go up to E
and<00:01:23.159> then<00:01:24.000> we<00:01:24.090> go<00:01:24.270> see<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> ABS<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:25.350> fourth

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
and then we go see the ABS just fourth

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:33.469 
and then we go see the ABS just fourth
then<00:01:26.909> C<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.750> G<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.490> C<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:31.460> C<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:33.210> B

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
then C to G and then C to a and C to B

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.770 
then C to G and then C to a and C to B
and<00:01:34.470> then<00:01:34.890> we're<00:01:34.979> gonna<00:01:35.070> do<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> whole<00:01:35.340> octave

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
and then we're gonna do a whole octave

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.210 
and then we're gonna do a whole octave
now<00:01:36.780> I'm<00:01:36.930> not<00:01:37.079> looking<00:01:37.229> while<00:01:37.560> I'm<00:01:37.740> doing<00:01:38.070> this

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
now I'm not looking while I'm doing this

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.240 
now I'm not looking while I'm doing this
and<00:01:38.700> then<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.240> go<00:01:39.390> backwards<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:40.020> go<00:01:40.140> see<00:01:40.470> see

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and then we go backwards we go see see

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:57.649 
and then we go backwards we go see see
see<00:01:42.110> back<00:01:43.110> down<00:01:44.360> see<00:01:49.399> see<00:01:50.399> see<00:01:53.119> see

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.410 

and<00:01:58.350> back<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.890> sea<00:01:59.130> all<00:02:00.030> right<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.329> then

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
and back to the sea all right and then

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.490 
and back to the sea all right and then
you<00:02:00.509> do<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> same<00:02:00.960> thing<00:02:01.200> with<00:02:01.350> your<00:02:01.439> left

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
you do the same thing with your left

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:17.180 
you do the same thing with your left
hand<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.460> start<00:02:02.789> with<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.030> sea<00:02:15.290> say<00:02:16.290> okay

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
hand so you start with the sea say okay

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.430 
hand so you start with the sea say okay
so<00:02:17.819> you're<00:02:17.970> learning<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.900> distance

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
so you're learning that that distance

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.009 
so you're learning that that distance
but<00:02:19.709> you're<00:02:19.860> also<00:02:20.069> learning<00:02:20.810> where<00:02:21.810> that

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
but you're also learning where that

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.600 
but you're also learning where that
individual<00:02:22.560> note<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:22.980> in<00:02:23.190> relation<00:02:23.519> to<00:02:23.550> the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
individual note is in relation to the

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.920 
individual note is in relation to the
black<00:02:23.849> then<00:02:24.300> you<00:02:24.330> go<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.840> verse<00:02:25.110> see<00:02:26.690> see<00:02:27.950> see

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
black then you go to verse see see see

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:39.220 
black then you go to verse see see see
see<00:02:31.880> see<00:02:34.069> see<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:37.190> see

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
see see see and see

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.619 
see see see and see
okay<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.129> then<00:02:40.400> what<00:02:40.520> you<00:02:40.670> do<00:02:40.879> is<00:02:41.060> go<00:02:41.270> through

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
okay and then what you do is go through

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.470 
okay and then what you do is go through
all<00:02:41.989> of<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.890> scales<00:02:43.250> so<00:02:43.610> you<00:02:43.760> go<00:02:44.090> around<00:02:44.209> you

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
all of the scales so you go around you

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.990 
all of the scales so you go around you
can<00:02:44.629> then<00:02:45.050> start<00:02:45.440> on<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.739> D<00:02:45.980> flat<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.580> do<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.730> D

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
can then start on the D flat and do a D

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.690 
can then start on the D flat and do a D
flat<00:02:47.300> scale<00:02:47.800> so<00:02:48.800> this<00:02:49.160> also<00:02:49.670> builds<00:02:50.090> your<00:02:51.700> you

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
flat scale so this also builds your you

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.119 
flat scale so this also builds your you
know<00:02:52.819> drill<00:02:53.120> see<00:02:53.300> you<00:02:53.390> on<00:02:53.540> your<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.170> then<00:02:54.920> it's

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
know drill see you on your and then it's

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.690 
know drill see you on your and then it's
in<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.340> scale<00:02:56.140> okay<00:02:57.140> so<00:02:57.680> whatever<00:02:58.370> you're

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
in the scale okay so whatever you're

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.729 
in the scale okay so whatever you're
doing<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.269> fourth<00:02:59.599> or<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.900> fifth<00:02:59.989> you're<00:03:00.410> doing

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
doing a fourth or a fifth you're doing

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.280 
doing a fourth or a fifth you're doing
the<00:03:00.860> fourth<00:03:01.130> fifth<00:03:01.550> in<00:03:01.730> relation<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.959> you

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
the fourth fifth in relation to and you

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.800 
the fourth fifth in relation to and you
know<00:03:03.470> so<00:03:04.250> you're<00:03:04.430> constantly<00:03:04.730> building<00:03:05.540> on

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
know so you're constantly building on

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.229 
know so you're constantly building on
your<00:03:06.319> awareness<00:03:06.769> of<00:03:07.130> where<00:03:07.459> of<00:03:07.700> these

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
your awareness of where of these

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.030 
your awareness of where of these
intervals<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:09.200> different<00:03:09.530> intervals<00:03:09.830> as

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
intervals and the different intervals as

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.449 
intervals and the different intervals as
you<00:03:10.190> go<00:03:10.340> up<00:03:10.519> okay<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.330> think<00:03:11.480> this<00:03:11.720> is<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:11.930> great

you go up okay I think this is a great
great<00:03:13.459> way<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.760> build<00:03:14.360> your<00:03:14.630> official<00:03:15.349> to

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
develop the spatial awareness at the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.500 
develop the spatial awareness at the
piano<00:03:17.360> so<00:03:18.200> that<00:03:18.440> you<00:03:18.560> can<00:03:18.709> play<00:03:19.269> clearly<00:03:20.269> and
