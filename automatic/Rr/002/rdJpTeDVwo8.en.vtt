quick unboxing and first look at the
nikon<00:00:04.740> d610<00:00:18.109> so<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.230> d610<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.189> newest

full-frame SLR from Nikon it's the
upgrade<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.789> 600<00:00:24.570> which<00:00:25.109> only<00:00:25.410> came<00:00:25.590> out

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
upgrade to the 600 which only came out

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.670 
upgrade to the 600 which only came out
in<00:00:25.769> September<00:00:26.430> last<00:00:26.640> year<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.720> d600<00:00:28.230> had

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
in September last year the d600 had

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.939 
in September last year the d600 had
loads<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.550> problems<00:00:30.019> widely<00:00:31.019> reported<00:00:31.320> with

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
loads of problems widely reported with

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.280 
loads of problems widely reported with
oil<00:00:32.279> spots<00:00:32.700> on<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> sensor<00:00:33.510> supposedly

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
oil spots on the sensor supposedly

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.920 
oil spots on the sensor supposedly
coming<00:00:34.590> from<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> shower<00:00:35.040> mechanism<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.930> so

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
coming from the shower mechanism and so

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.930 
coming from the shower mechanism and so
instead<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.350> recalling<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.370> units<00:00:38.760> and

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
instead of recalling the units and

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.760 
instead of recalling the units and
nichkhun<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.300> decided<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.840> do<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.170> little<00:00:40.530> bit

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
nichkhun have decided to do a little bit

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.250 
nichkhun have decided to do a little bit
of<00:00:40.829> an<00:00:40.920> upgrade<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:42.510> were<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.780> few<00:00:43.140> new

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
of an upgrade and if were a few new

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.400 
of an upgrade and if were a few new
features<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.950> camera<00:00:45.140> under<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> hood

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
features in the camera under the hood

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.240 
features in the camera under the hood
it's<00:00:46.649> still<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.430> same<00:00:47.870> 24<00:00:48.870> megapixel<00:00:49.680> sensor

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
it's still the same 24 megapixel sensor

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.459 
it's still the same 24 megapixel sensor
still<00:00:50.850> uses<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> same<00:00:51.300> focusing<00:00:52.230> system

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
still uses the same focusing system

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.340 
still uses the same focusing system
still<00:00:53.219> be<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.370> same<00:00:53.579> twin<00:00:53.940> card<00:00:54.300> slot<00:00:54.660> they've

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
still be the same twin card slot they've

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.200 
still be the same twin card slot they've
upgraded<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.980> metering<00:00:56.460> system<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.940> little

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
upgraded the metering system a little

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.700 
upgraded the metering system a little
bit<00:00:57.360> which<00:00:57.539> should<00:00:57.840> give<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.170> better<00:00:58.410> white

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
bit which should give you better white

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.400 
bit which should give you better white
balance<00:00:59.219> performance<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.000> bit<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.140> honest

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
balance performance and bit to be honest

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.810 
balance performance and bit to be honest
if<00:01:01.500> you're<00:01:01.649> shooting<00:01:01.829> raw<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.460> isn't<00:01:02.730> going

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
if you're shooting raw this isn't going

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.539 
if you're shooting raw this isn't going
to<00:01:02.879> make<00:01:02.940> an<00:01:03.239> awful<00:01:03.660> lot<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.870> difference<00:01:04.549> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
to make an awful lot of difference the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.530 
to make an awful lot of difference the
big<00:01:06.470> sort<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.560> upgrade<00:01:07.979> comes<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.090> shutter

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
big sort of upgrade comes in the shutter

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.440 
big sort of upgrade comes in the shutter
itself<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.860> now<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.250> will<00:01:11.310> do<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> 6<00:01:12.000> frames<00:01:12.299> a

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
itself so now it will do a 6 frames a

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.539 
itself so now it will do a 6 frames a
second<00:01:12.810> continuous<00:01:13.439> instead<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.010> five<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.520> a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
second continuous instead of five and a

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.440 
second continuous instead of five and a
half<00:01:14.610> from<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.390> v600

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
half from the v600

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.539 
half from the v600
it<00:01:18.450> also<00:01:18.720> features<00:01:19.560> probably<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> most

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
it also features probably the most

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.640 
it also features probably the most
exciting<00:01:21.210> new<00:01:21.390> feature<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.049> which<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
exciting new feature in it which is the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.969 
exciting new feature in it which is the
quiet<00:01:23.009> continuous<00:01:23.729> mode<00:01:23.939> now<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.650> a

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
quiet continuous mode now this is a

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.789 
quiet continuous mode now this is a
continuous<00:01:26.549> mode<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.299> slows<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.500> shutter

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
continuous mode the slows the shutter

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.190 
continuous mode the slows the shutter
speed<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.759> therefore<00:01:30.570> makes<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.990> lot<00:01:31.170> less

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
speed and therefore makes a lot less

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.490 
speed and therefore makes a lot less
noise<00:01:31.590> VAR<00:01:31.920> turning<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.900> this<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.110> really

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
noise VAR turning and this is really

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.590 
noise VAR turning and this is really
handy<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.890> you're<00:01:35.100> shooting<00:01:35.250> wildlife<00:01:35.850> if

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
handy if you're shooting wildlife if

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.910 
handy if you're shooting wildlife if
you're<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.840> wedding<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.470> you're<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.710> quiet

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
you're a wedding in you're in a quiet

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.260 
you're a wedding in you're in a quiet
church<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.610> don't<00:01:38.790> want<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.000> make<00:01:39.090> an

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
church and you don't want to make an

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.270 
church and you don't want to make an
awful<00:01:39.540> lot<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.689> noise<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.380> does<00:01:40.650> drop<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.130> down

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
awful lot of noise it does drop it down

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.520 
awful lot of noise it does drop it down
to<00:01:41.430> three<00:01:41.610> frames<00:01:41.909> second<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.170> really

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
to three frames second but it's a really

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.410 
to three frames second but it's a really
really<00:01:43.829> nice<00:01:43.950> little<00:01:44.280> option<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.000> they<00:01:45.180> give

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
really nice little option that they give

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:58.590 
really nice little option that they give
you

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.330 

I<00:01:59.070> think<00:02:00.070> if<00:02:00.369> you've<00:02:00.850> already<00:02:01.780> got<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.170> d600<00:02:03.159> and

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
I think if you've already got a d600 and

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.640 
I think if you've already got a d600 and
you're<00:02:03.490> not<00:02:03.759> experiencing<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.600> oil-less<00:02:05.259> boy

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
you're not experiencing the oil-less boy

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.800 
you're not experiencing the oil-less boy
issue<00:02:05.860> then<00:02:06.189> there's<00:02:06.369> genuinely<00:02:07.180> no<00:02:07.450> reason

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
issue then there's genuinely no reason

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.109 
issue then there's genuinely no reason
to<00:02:07.960> upgrade<00:02:08.380> if<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.429> are<00:02:09.640> having<00:02:09.910> the

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
to upgrade if you are having the

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.390 
to upgrade if you are having the
problems<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:10.959> you<00:02:11.410> don't<00:02:11.590> feel<00:02:11.860> like<00:02:11.890> Nick<00:02:12.220> on

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
problems and you don't feel like Nick on

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.130 
problems and you don't feel like Nick on
a<00:02:12.430> really<00:02:12.760> supporting<00:02:13.209> you<00:02:13.360> then<00:02:13.569> you<00:02:13.989> know

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
a really supporting you then you know

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.590 
a really supporting you then you know
it's<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.560> good<00:02:14.800> camera<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.520> if<00:02:16.209> this<00:02:16.390> one

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
it's a good camera and if this one

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.090 
it's a good camera and if this one
doesn't<00:02:16.780> have<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.170> oil<00:02:17.260> spots<00:02:17.709> there's<00:02:17.920> no

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
doesn't have the oil spots there's no
