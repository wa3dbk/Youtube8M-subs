we got the USB port at the AV the line

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.350 
we got the USB port at the AV the line

as<00:02:13.719> you<00:02:13.840> guys<00:02:13.959> can<00:02:14.109> see<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.439> is<00:02:14.560> actually

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
as you guys can see it is actually

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.890 
as you guys can see it is actually
pretty<00:02:15.069> shiny<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.790> pretty<00:02:15.969> nice-looking<00:02:16.299> and

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
pretty shiny and pretty nice-looking and

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.500 
pretty shiny and pretty nice-looking and
it<00:02:17.799> does<00:02:18.010> have<00:02:18.219> a<00:02:18.250> really<00:02:18.519> good<00:02:18.790> design<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.390> it

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
it does have a really good design to it

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.170 
it does have a really good design to it
as<00:02:19.659> well<00:02:19.870> as<00:02:20.049> small<00:02:20.829> compact<00:02:21.519> and<00:02:21.790> it's<00:02:21.909> a<00:02:21.969> much

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
as well as small compact and it's a much

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.690 
as well as small compact and it's a much
upgraded<00:02:22.840> version<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.379> the<00:02:23.439> previous<00:02:24.189> so

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
upgraded version of the previous so

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.209 
upgraded version of the previous so
let's<00:02:24.879> just<00:02:25.060> compare<00:02:25.420> both<00:02:25.659> of<00:02:25.870> them<00:02:26.019> so<00:02:26.950> this

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
let's just compare both of them so this

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.130 
let's just compare both of them so this
is<00:02:27.280> what<00:02:27.549> the<00:02:27.730> actual<00:02:27.909> older<00:02:28.659> version

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
is what the actual older version

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.750 
is what the actual older version
actually<00:02:29.319> looks<00:02:29.799> like<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.250> as<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:30.459> guys<00:02:30.609> can

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
actually looks like and as you guys can

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.569 
actually looks like and as you guys can
see<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:31.150> box<00:02:31.420> is<00:02:31.629> actually<00:02:31.750> massive<00:02:32.680> compared

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
see the box is actually massive compared

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.500 
see the box is actually massive compared
to<00:02:33.639> the<00:02:33.819> new<00:02:34.060> one<00:02:34.469> it's<00:02:35.469> really<00:02:35.799> small<00:02:36.389> so<00:02:37.389> the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
to the new one it's really small so the

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.470 
to the new one it's really small so the
older<00:02:37.870> version<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.319> this<00:02:38.590> had<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:38.950> 1gb<00:02:39.849> of<00:02:39.879> RAM

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
older version of this had a 1gb of RAM

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.009 
older version of this had a 1gb of RAM
this<00:02:41.200> one<00:02:41.439> actually<00:02:41.920> has<00:02:42.129> a<00:02:42.159> 1<00:02:42.549> GB<00:02:43.049> ddr3<00:02:44.049> RAM

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
this one actually has a 1 GB ddr3 RAM

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.740 
this one actually has a 1 GB ddr3 RAM
the<00:02:47.019> older<00:02:47.470> version<00:02:47.889> was<00:02:48.159> a<00:02:48.459> 1.5<00:02:49.299> gigahertz

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
the older version was a 1.5 gigahertz

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.849 
the older version was a 1.5 gigahertz
dual<00:02:50.349> GPU<00:02:51.329> but<00:02:52.329> this<00:02:52.569> one<00:02:52.840> right<00:02:52.989> here<00:02:53.260> is<00:02:53.439> a<00:02:53.470> am

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859

one<00:02:59.040> the<00:03:00.040> older<00:03:00.340> version<00:03:00.790> was<00:03:01.030> capable<00:03:01.269> of

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
one the older version was capable of

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.080 
one the older version was capable of
taking<00:03:02.079> 1080p<00:03:02.919> as<00:03:03.159> well<00:03:03.400> but<00:03:03.700> this<00:03:03.879> is

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
taking 1080p as well but this is

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.610 
taking 1080p as well but this is
actually<00:03:04.659> it<00:03:05.079> takes<00:03:05.560> 1080p<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.849> 720p<00:03:07.620> with

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
actually it takes 1080p and 720p with

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.490 
actually it takes 1080p and 720p with

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
the help of the HDMI 1.4 it provides up

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.759 
the help of the HDMI 1.4 it provides up

was the remote the remote was actually
pretty<00:05:08.170> slow<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:08.950> they<00:05:09.220> don't<00:05:09.430> really<00:05:09.550> work

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
pretty slow and they don't really work

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.750 
pretty slow and they don't really work
as<00:05:10.060> well<00:05:10.300> you<00:05:10.840> have<00:05:10.990> to<00:05:11.170> go<00:05:11.740> really<00:05:12.070> close<00:05:12.490> to

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
as well you have to go really close to

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.660 
as well you have to go really close to
the<00:05:12.880> cyclone<00:05:13.390> android<00:05:13.990> x4<00:05:14.470> to<00:05:14.710> make<00:05:15.280> it<00:05:15.490> work

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
the cyclone android x4 to make it work

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.990 
the cyclone android x4 to make it work
so<00:05:15.910> I<00:05:15.940> do<00:05:16.120> recommend<00:05:16.600> having<00:05:16.840> aids<00:05:17.500> a<00:05:18.070> wireless

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
so I do recommend having aids a wireless

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.110 
so I do recommend having aids a wireless
mouse<00:05:19.330> or<00:05:19.660> a<00:05:20.290> wireless<00:05:20.590> keyboard<00:05:21.250> with<00:05:21.670> you<00:05:21.850> or

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
mouse or a wireless keyboard with you or

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.570 
mouse or a wireless keyboard with you or
even<00:05:22.840> if<00:05:22.900> you<00:05:23.020> have<00:05:23.200> wired<00:05:23.470> one<00:05:23.830> what<00:05:24.430> are

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
even if you have wired one what are

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.420 
even if you have wired one what are
these<00:05:24.700> four<00:05:25.030> right<00:05:25.240> here<00:05:25.740> where<00:05:26.740> do<00:05:26.860> they<00:05:26.950> go

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
these four right here where do they go

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.130 
these four right here where do they go
