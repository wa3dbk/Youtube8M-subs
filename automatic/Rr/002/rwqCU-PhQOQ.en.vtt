is<00:02:16.530> debatable<00:02:17.530> i'm<00:02:17.680> not<00:02:17.830> sure<00:02:18.040> if<00:02:18.160> we'll

of windows 8 ish looking icons that i
guess<00:02:36.100> is<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.280> little<00:02:36.549> unfair<00:02:36.820> because<00:02:36.970> they're

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
guess is a little unfair because they're

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.910 
guess is a little unfair because they're
just<00:02:37.420> brightly<00:02:37.840> colored<00:02:38.140> round<00:02:38.290> icons<00:02:38.650> which

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
just brightly colored round icons which

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.229 
just brightly colored round icons which
it<00:02:39.220> seems<00:02:39.459> like<00:02:39.640> they<00:02:39.760> would<00:02:39.880> always<00:02:40.030> be

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
it seems like they would always be

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.900 
it seems like they would always be

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
compared to windows 8 it's kind of a

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.610 
compared to windows 8 it's kind of a
lengthy<00:02:43.570> list<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.140> doesn't<00:02:44.470> feel

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
lengthy list and doesn't feel

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.610 
lengthy list and doesn't feel
particularly<00:02:45.299> intuitive<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:46.450> me<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:46.870> find

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
particularly intuitive to me to find

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.140 
particularly intuitive to me to find
what<00:02:47.799> you're<00:02:47.920> looking<00:02:48.190> for<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.700> can't<00:02:48.970> quite

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
what you're looking for I can't quite

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.610 
what you're looking for I can't quite
figure<00:02:49.420> out<00:02:49.570> what<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.870> color<00:02:50.049> coding<00:02:50.470> is

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
figure out what the color coding is

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.259 
figure out what the color coding is
going<00:02:51.489> on<00:02:51.610> but<00:02:51.820> at<00:02:51.910> least<00:02:52.000> you've<00:02:52.239> got

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
going on but at least you've got

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.340 
going on but at least you've got
different<00:02:53.250> subcategories<00:02:54.480> fortunately<00:02:55.480> you

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
different subcategories fortunately you

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.120 
different subcategories fortunately you
can<00:02:56.380> change<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:57.130> which<00:02:57.880> I<00:02:58.060> like<00:02:58.299> to<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:59.709> simple

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
can change that which I like to a simple

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.050 
can change that which I like to a simple
list<00:03:00.310> which<00:03:01.120> is<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.330> lot<00:03:01.510> easier<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.989> navigate

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
list which is a lot easier to navigate

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.970 
list which is a lot easier to navigate
although<00:03:04.060> it's<00:03:04.209> still<00:03:04.239> quite<00:03:04.600> long<00:03:04.810> or<00:03:05.500> you

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
although it's still quite long or you

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.880 
although it's still quite long or you
can<00:03:06.160> go<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.880> traditional<00:03:07.390> tab<00:03:07.660> view<00:03:07.890> which

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
can go to the traditional tab view which

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.060 
can go to the traditional tab view which
i<00:03:09.070> think<00:03:09.130> is<00:03:09.430> much<00:03:10.330> nicer<00:03:10.570> and<00:03:11.080> probably<00:03:11.890> more

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
i think is much nicer and probably more

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.220 
i think is much nicer and probably more
familiar<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.670> Samsung<00:03:13.060> owners

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
familiar to Samsung owners

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.770 
familiar to Samsung owners
so<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.099> camera<00:03:15.370> on<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.550> s5<00:03:15.879> is<00:03:16.120> pretty

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
so the camera on the s5 is pretty

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.289 
so the camera on the s5 is pretty
fantastic<00:03:17.170> from<00:03:17.680> what<00:03:17.800> I<00:03:17.830> can<00:03:17.920> see<00:03:18.040> so<00:03:18.370> far<00:03:18.580> I

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
fantastic from what I can see so far I

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.149 
fantastic from what I can see so far I
haven't<00:03:19.900> had<00:03:20.019> too<00:03:20.230> much<00:03:20.349> of<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.530> chance<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:20.950> play

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
haven't had too much of a chance to play

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.089 
haven't had too much of a chance to play
around<00:03:21.340> with<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.700> but<00:03:22.180> obviously<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:23.290> options

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
around with it but obviously the options

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.250 
around with it but obviously the options
for<00:03:24.400> different<00:03:24.670> modes<00:03:25.150> are<00:03:25.450> much<00:03:25.959> slimmer

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
for different modes are much slimmer

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.890 
for different modes are much slimmer
than<00:03:26.530> with<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:26.890> s4<00:03:27.250> but<00:03:28.030> it's<00:03:28.150> basically<00:03:28.599> just

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
than with the s4 but it's basically just

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.809 
than with the s4 but it's basically just
the<00:03:29.170> ones<00:03:29.319> that<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:29.560> really<00:03:29.890> are<00:03:30.129> going<00:03:30.640> to

ultra power saving mode which will
apparently<00:05:09.019> get<00:05:09.199> you<00:05:09.319> 24<00:05:09.829> hours<00:05:10.309> on<00:05:10.549> a<00:05:10.609> ten

basically<00:05:18.619> it<00:05:18.949> will<00:05:19.039> just<00:05:19.189> limit<00:05:19.489> the<00:05:19.519> apps

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
basically it will just limit the apps

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.789 
basically it will just limit the apps
that<00:05:19.969> you<00:05:20.119> have<00:05:20.239> available<00:05:20.389> and<00:05:20.989> also<00:05:21.319> switch

that you have available and also switch
to<00:05:22.009> grayscale<00:05:22.429> so<00:05:23.439> let's<00:05:24.439> take<00:05:24.589> a<00:05:24.649> look<00:05:24.799> at

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:24.859 
to grayscale so let's take a look at

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:39.390 
to grayscale so let's take a look at
that<00:05:25.069> can<00:05:25.759> have<00:05:25.849> a<00:05:25.939> quick<00:05:26.119> read<00:05:26.269> of<00:05:26.299> that

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:51.800

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.340 

the<00:05:52.350> Samsung<00:05:52.980> Galaxy<00:05:53.010> s5<00:05:53.850> also<00:05:54.330> has<00:05:54.660> a<00:05:54.930> new

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
the Samsung Galaxy s5 also has a new

the Samsung Galaxy s5 also has a new
download<00:05:55.740> Booster<00:05:56.130> which<00:05:56.520> will<00:05:56.669> apparently

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
download Booster which will apparently

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.020 
download Booster which will apparently
get<00:05:57.330> you<00:05:57.600> what<00:05:58.200> is<00:05:58.320> it<00:05:58.440> 1<00:05:58.620> gigabytes<00:05:59.250> of<00:05:59.520> data

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
get you what is it 1 gigabytes of data

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.900 
get you what is it 1 gigabytes of data
in<00:06:00.389> 30<00:06:00.870> seconds<00:06:01.350> I<00:06:01.650> have<00:06:02.040> tested<00:06:02.550> it<00:06:02.610> of<00:06:02.730> course

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
in 30 seconds I have tested it of course

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.340 
in 30 seconds I have tested it of course
but<00:06:03.030> that<00:06:03.450> sounds<00:06:04.020> pretty<00:06:04.260> fantastic<00:06:04.590> to<00:06:05.100> me

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
but that sounds pretty fantastic to me

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.150 
but that sounds pretty fantastic to me
so<00:06:07.350> let's<00:06:07.560> check<00:06:08.040> out<00:06:08.220> the<00:06:09.080> fingerprint

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
so let's check out the fingerprint

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.950 
so let's check out the fingerprint
scanner<00:06:11.750> just<00:06:12.750> here

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
scanner just here

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.540 
scanner just here
and<00:06:15.560> we<00:06:15.919> need<00:06:16.100> to<00:06:16.340> register<00:06:17.240> another
