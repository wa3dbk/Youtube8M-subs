on<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.950> side<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.760> I'm<00:00:42.180> trying<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.899> point<00:00:43.200> to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
on this side and I'm trying to point to

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.560 
on this side and I'm trying to point to
you<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:44.070> can't<00:00:44.309> see<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.850> then

you but you can't see it and then
actually<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.410> one<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.800> really<00:00:47.070> awkward<00:00:47.370> to

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
actually this one is really awkward to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.420 
actually this one is really awkward to
access<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.989> hard<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.530> get<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> ratchet<00:00:50.309> in

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
access it's hard to get a ratchet in

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.069 
access it's hard to get a ratchet in
here<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.210> we're<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.390> going<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.629> take<00:00:51.899> the

remove this tensioner assembly we

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.470 
remove this tensioner assembly we
actually<00:03:06.519> pull<00:03:06.760> it<00:03:06.849> off<00:03:06.939> you<00:03:07.180> got<00:03:07.329> to<00:03:07.419> be

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
back where the the pulley bolts to and

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.189 
back where the the pulley bolts to and
it'll<00:03:12.430> just<00:03:12.639> fall<00:03:12.879> right<00:03:13.209> out<00:03:13.449> and<00:03:13.719> that

it'll just fall right out and that
actually<00:03:14.530> happened<00:03:14.919> when<00:03:15.010> we<00:03:15.159> took<00:03:15.340> this

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
actually happened when we took this

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.939 
actually happened when we took this
assembly<00:03:16.000> off<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.419> tilt<00:03:16.659> it<00:03:16.840> see<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.680> bolt

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:17.949 
assembly off and tilt it see the bolt

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.520 
assembly off and tilt it see the bolt
fill<00:03:18.250> right<00:03:18.519> now<00:03:18.639> or<00:03:18.879> the<00:03:19.000> nut<00:03:19.180> actually<00:03:19.689> felt

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
fill right now or the nut actually felt

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.490 
fill right now or the nut actually felt
right<00:03:20.799> out<00:03:21.419> so<00:03:22.419> just<00:03:22.599> be<00:03:22.689> careful<00:03:22.840> not<00:03:23.109> to<00:03:23.290> lose

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
right out so just be careful not to lose

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.039 
right out so just be careful not to lose
that<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:24.389> reinstall<00:03:25.389> it<00:03:25.540> when<00:03:25.689> you<00:03:25.780> put<00:03:25.959> the

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
that and reinstall it when you put the

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.039 
that and reinstall it when you put the
tensioner<00:03:26.409> back<00:03:26.560> in<00:03:27.569> okay<00:03:28.569> so<00:03:28.629> I'm<00:03:28.780> going<00:03:28.900> to

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
tensioner back in okay so I'm going to

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.020 
tensioner back in okay so I'm going to
reinstall<00:03:29.829> I'm<00:03:30.219> going<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.579> sell<00:03:30.760> a<00:03:30.790> new

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
reinstall I'm going to sell a new

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.289 
reinstall I'm going to sell a new
tensioner<00:03:31.480> here<00:03:31.689> and<00:03:31.900> I<00:03:32.859> have<00:03:33.219> the<00:03:33.639> nut<00:03:33.909> for

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
tensioner here and I have the nut for

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.379 
tensioner here and I have the nut for
the<00:03:34.479> pulley<00:03:34.750> placed<00:03:35.590> in<00:03:35.949> its<00:03:36.340> space<00:03:36.819> here<00:03:37.209> I

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
the pulley placed in its space here I

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.800 
the pulley placed in its space here I
just<00:03:38.079> I'm<00:03:38.739> going<00:03:38.919> to<00:03:38.979> be<00:03:39.099> careful<00:03:39.489> to<00:03:39.790> not<00:03:39.819> tilt

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
just I'm going to be careful to not tilt

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.210 
just I'm going to be careful to not tilt
the<00:03:40.959> tensioner<00:03:41.470> because<00:03:41.769> then<00:03:41.889> that<00:03:42.009> nut

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
the tensioner because then that nut

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.249 
the tensioner because then that nut
could<00:03:42.400> fall<00:03:42.609> out<00:03:42.639> get<00:03:43.030> lost<00:03:43.269> definitely<00:03:44.109> don't

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:44.259 
could fall out get lost definitely don't

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:46.619 
could fall out get lost definitely don't
want<00:03:44.409> that<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.620> happen<00:03:44.799> and<00:03:45.280> then<00:03:46.090> we<00:03:46.120> got<00:03:46.509> to

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
want that to happen and then we got to

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.640 
want that to happen and then we got to
line<00:03:46.840> up<00:03:46.870> our<00:03:47.229> three<00:03:47.650> mounting<00:03:48.159> bolts<00:03:49.319> on<00:03:50.319> this

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
line up our three mounting bolts on this

00:03:50.650 --> 00:04:11.380 
line up our three mounting bolts on this
tension

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.360 

be<00:04:12.390> sure<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:12.750> longest<00:04:13.140> boat<00:04:13.319> is<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.799> one<00:04:14.190> in

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
be sure the longest boat is the one in

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.869 
be sure the longest boat is the one in
the<00:04:14.459> middle

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
the middle

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.280 
the middle
yeah<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.480> center<00:04:15.810> bolt<00:04:15.989> is<00:04:16.340> longer<00:04:17.340> so<00:04:18.290> give

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
yeah the center bolt is longer so give

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.480 
yeah the center bolt is longer so give
that<00:04:19.320> one<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.739> right<00:04:19.889> place<00:04:21.740> and<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:23.340> other

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
that one the right place and the other

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.280 
that one the right place and the other
two<00:04:23.820> bolts<00:04:24.180> on<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.419> ends<00:04:24.750> are<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:24.990> same

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
two bolts on the ends are the same

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:41.600 
two bolts on the ends are the same
length<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:40.560> don't<00:04:40.949> tighten<00:04:41.160> any<00:04:41.430> of<00:04:41.550> the

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
length and don't tighten any of the

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.260 
length and don't tighten any of the
bolts<00:04:41.940> before<00:04:42.120> you<00:04:42.389> have<00:04:42.539> all<00:04:42.840> them<00:04:43.199> lined<00:04:43.440> up

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
bolts before you have all them lined up

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:56.330 
bolts before you have all them lined up
that<00:04:45.270> last<00:04:45.510> time<00:04:45.690> didn't<00:04:45.930> want<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.169> go<00:04:46.289> in

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.339 

now<00:04:57.340> we're<00:04:57.460> going<00:04:57.580> to<00:04:57.639> tighten<00:04:58.000> these<00:04:58.090> to<00:04:58.389> 16

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
now we're going to tighten these to 16

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.399 
now we're going to tighten these to 16
foot-pounds<00:04:59.740> of<00:05:00.219> torque<00:05:00.539> so<00:05:01.539> a<00:05:01.569> final<00:05:01.960> step<00:05:02.169> of

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.409 
foot-pounds of torque so a final step of

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:05.189 
foot-pounds of torque so a final step of
course<00:05:02.740> will<00:05:02.919> be<00:05:03.009> to<00:05:03.219> tighten<00:05:04.210> these<00:05:04.360> bolts<00:05:04.659> to

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
course will be to tighten these bolts to

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.429 
course will be to tighten these bolts to
16<00:05:06.069> foot-pounds<00:05:06.400> of<00:05:06.819> torque<00:05:07.020> it's<00:05:08.020> just<00:05:08.319> a

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:08.439 
16 foot-pounds of torque it's just a

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:34.540 
16 foot-pounds of torque it's just a
speck<00:05:09.210> amount<00:05:10.210> of<00:05:10.300> heroin

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.820 

here<00:05:35.550> we<00:05:35.670> go<00:05:35.960> now<00:05:36.960> the<00:05:37.020> trick<00:05:37.410> when<00:05:37.680> we're

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
here we go now the trick when we're

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.520 
here we go now the trick when we're
putting<00:05:38.070> the<00:05:38.370> pulley<00:05:38.820> back<00:05:39.120> to<00:05:39.990> not<00:05:40.200> knock<00:05:40.500> the

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
putting the pulley back to not knock the

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.600 
putting the pulley back to not knock the
nut<00:05:41.100> out<00:05:41.130> comes<00:05:41.670> behind<00:05:43.010> now<00:05:44.010> hold<00:05:44.340> it<00:05:44.520> in

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
nut out comes behind now hold it in

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.920 
nut out comes behind now hold it in
place<00:05:44.850> and<00:05:45.270> get<00:05:45.450> the<00:05:45.660> bolts<00:05:46.110> written<00:05:46.440> into<00:05:46.800> it

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
place and get the bolts written into it

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.090 
place and get the bolts written into it
otherwise<00:05:48.930> you<00:05:49.290> don't<00:05:49.440> hold<00:05:49.620> it<00:05:49.800> from<00:05:49.980> the

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
otherwise you don't hold it from the

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.030 
otherwise you don't hold it from the
backs<00:05:50.310> and<00:05:50.520> fall<00:05:50.850> out

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
backs and fall out

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.500 
backs and fall out
okay<00:05:53.040> now<00:05:53.190> we're<00:05:53.370> torquing<00:05:53.850> this<00:05:54.030> 14

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
okay now we're torquing this 14

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:03.080 
okay now we're torquing this 14
millimeter<00:05:54.960> head<00:05:55.230> to<00:05:55.940> 41<00:05:56.940> foot-pounds<00:06:01.790> so<00:06:02.790> let

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
millimeter head to 41 foot-pounds so let

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:10.610 
millimeter head to 41 foot-pounds so let
us<00:06:03.890> go<00:06:07.490> okay<00:06:08.490> so<00:06:08.850> the<00:06:09.540> next<00:06:09.720> step<00:06:09.870> is<00:06:10.260> going<00:06:10.500> to

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
us go okay so the next step is going to

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.920 
us go okay so the next step is going to
be<00:06:10.770> to<00:06:11.070> mount<00:06:11.280> your<00:06:11.490> power<00:06:11.880> steering<00:06:12.390> pump

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
be to mount your power steering pump

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.170 
be to mount your power steering pump
hook<00:06:13.800> up<00:06:14.010> the<00:06:14.220> high<00:06:14.370> pressure<00:06:14.700> and<00:06:14.850> low

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
hook up the high pressure and low

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
hook up the high pressure and low
pressure<00:06:15.930> lines<00:06:17.570> you<00:06:18.570> want<00:06:18.750> to<00:06:18.810> get<00:06:18.930> that<00:06:19.080> down

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
pressure lines you want to get that down

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.080 
pressure lines you want to get that down
first<00:06:19.530> and<00:06:19.740> get<00:06:19.830> that<00:06:19.860> out<00:06:20.100> of<00:06:20.130> the<00:06:20.220> way<00:06:20.370> before

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
first and get that out of the way before

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.060 
first and get that out of the way before
you<00:06:21.450> put<00:06:21.630> the<00:06:21.750> belt<00:06:21.930> on<00:06:22.140> last<00:06:22.500> because<00:06:22.830> you

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
you put the belt on last because you

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.740 
you put the belt on last because you
don't<00:06:23.190> want<00:06:23.340> to<00:06:23.430> spill<00:06:23.760> fluid<00:06:24.210> onto<00:06:24.330> your<00:06:24.510> belt

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
don't want to spill fluid onto your belt

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.950 
don't want to spill fluid onto your belt
that's<00:06:25.140> not<00:06:25.260> going<00:06:25.380> to<00:06:25.470> be<00:06:25.560> good<00:06:26.090> and<00:06:27.090> then<00:06:27.330> if

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
that's not going to be good and then if

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.680 
that's not going to be good and then if
necessary<00:06:28.700> you're<00:06:29.700> probably<00:06:30.330> going<00:06:30.510> to<00:06:30.570> have

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
necessary you're probably going to have

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.540 
necessary you're probably going to have
to<00:06:30.720> bleed<00:06:31.350> the<00:06:31.470> air<00:06:31.500> out<00:06:31.650> of<00:06:31.920> the<00:06:32.160> power

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
to bleed the air out of the power

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.220 
to bleed the air out of the power
steering<00:06:32.790> pump<00:06:32.940> as<00:06:33.240> well<00:06:33.860> at<00:06:34.860> the<00:06:35.100> end
