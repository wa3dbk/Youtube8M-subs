00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.070
 yes, today it's all about carburetor 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.049
 to adjust 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.119
 more precisely, look at mainz.de bvfk 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.670
 gaza series 1 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.480
 and what is it all that gives it 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.940
 you see in this video 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.130
 the bvfk gaza of the 1er series should 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.019
 They all look a bit like a screw 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.210
 straight down and one at an angle 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.839
 upwards we start with the lower one 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.029
 screw on 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.250
 this is the so-called idling air 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.230
 Regulate screw like the name 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.040
 already implies for the air government 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.320
 responsible is 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.390
 It decides how the gasoline 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.800
 air mixture is composed turns 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.990
 her the screw rhine will be later 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.180
 she turned out magath the mix 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.370
 The top screw is the gas slide 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.440
 Bolt will screw this screw 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.660
 and the hosts will reingedreht a 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.060
 small piece raised resulting in 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.590
 has that the gas becomes stronger as 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.300
 so often it is said here before the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.400
 Set the drive motor works council 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.410
 and I mean I do not drive this time 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.049
 only one block should arrive 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.430
 quietly drive for 20 to 30 minutes and 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.790
 brings the engine locally 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.790
 full speed 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.450
 ohso 1 before he should leave 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.280
 you have the right screwdriver 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.660
 have already arranged and you 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.640
 You should be clear as it is then 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.200
 go on when you are back because he is 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.150
 has about a maximum of two minutes left 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.740
 to stop the carburetor 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.740
 then over fat the engine 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.600
 when we are back since october 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.460
 but on the main stand and read 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.049
 she should keep running in the gas 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.210
 the stand was not yet straight off 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.130
 old device first time provisionally allowed 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.530
 slide bolt be so far that that 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.549
 starter field so now but to the air 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.590
 Regulating screw 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.159
 This is first turned on stop 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.229
 So often maximum fed now she turns 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.719
 Carefully get out of there for so long 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.670
 engine reaches its highest point 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.799
 slow down and listen carefully to the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.220
 motor so you have the optimum 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.200
 reached 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.530
 Now the host turned back 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.030
 until the engine runs quietly in the state yes 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.890
 In my opinion, the carburetor 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.440
 Setting things that you learn 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.000
 Should you call them otherwise, for example 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.739
 if you are traveling or being mixed 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.849
 would like to ask or just 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.980
 because in general something again 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.780
 so it just tried 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.819
 times itself rather than broken 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.269
 Finally , you can not make it up 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.269
 next time
