all<00:00:00.810> right<00:00:00.960> guys<00:00:01.140> we<00:00:01.319> gotta<00:00:01.469> come<00:00:01.829> up<00:00:01.860> to<00:00:02.129> PC

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:02.689 
all right guys we gotta come up to PC

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.470 
all right guys we gotta come up to PC
308<00:00:03.740> right<00:00:04.740> here<00:00:05.040> it's<00:00:05.400> in<00:00:05.580> perfect<00:00:05.819> condition

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
308 right here it's in perfect condition

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.259 
308 right here it's in perfect condition
to<00:00:06.799> show<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:08.189> zero-tails<00:00:08.639> swinging<00:00:08.970> effect

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
to show the zero-tails swinging effect

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.990 
to show the zero-tails swinging effect
on<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.510> machine<00:00:09.750> so<00:00:10.679> I'll<00:00:10.980> do<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.160> right<00:00:11.429> now

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
on a machine so I'll do that right now

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.330 
on a machine so I'll do that right now
reason<00:00:12.660> why<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:12.809> body<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.469> so<00:00:13.710> short<00:00:14.130> it's

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
reason why this body is so short it's

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.240 
reason why this body is so short it's
because<00:00:14.639> it's<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.880> zero<00:00:15.059> tail<00:00:15.299> swing<00:00:15.540> machine

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
because it's a zero tail swing machine

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.680 
because it's a zero tail swing machine
meaning<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.550> can<00:00:17.699> go<00:00:17.789> in<00:00:17.940> tight<00:00:18.119> spots<00:00:18.480> you

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
meaning it can go in tight spots you

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.929 
meaning it can go in tight spots you
don't<00:00:18.869> have<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> radius<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> back<00:00:20.189> there's

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
don't have a radius on the back there's

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.840 
don't have a radius on the back there's
no<00:00:21.029> overhang<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:21.840> back<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.260> machine<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.850> this

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
no overhang on back of machine and this

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.830 
no overhang on back of machine and this
position<00:00:24.150> right<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.750> shows<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.920> perfectly

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
position right here shows it perfectly

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.050 
position right here shows it perfectly
what<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.869> mean<00:00:28.230> by<00:00:28.380> zero<00:00:28.650> tail<00:00:28.920> swing<00:00:29.220> for<00:00:29.939> those

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
what I mean by zero tail swing for those

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.339 
what I mean by zero tail swing for those
of<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.330> don't<00:00:30.510> know<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.929> I've<00:00:31.019> done<00:00:31.320> a

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
of you that don't know and I've done a

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.080 
of you that don't know and I've done a
lot<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.949> other<00:00:32.070> swing<00:00:32.460> machines

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
lot of the other swing machines

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.030 
lot of the other swing machines
none<00:00:33.540> have<00:00:33.690> been<00:00:33.809> parked<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.710> this

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
none have been parked like this so this

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.770 
none have been parked like this so this
is<00:00:35.190> absolutely<00:00:35.550> perfect<00:00:38.000> body<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.180> very<00:00:39.420> small

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
is absolutely perfect body is very small

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.979 
is absolutely perfect body is very small
it's<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.800> compact<00:00:41.190> machine<00:00:41.660> that's<00:00:42.660> what<00:00:42.870> it's

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
it's a compact machine that's what it's

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.869 
it's a compact machine that's what it's
really<00:00:43.170> meant<00:00:43.290> for<00:00:43.530> its<00:00:43.829> tight<00:00:44.190> environments

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
really meant for its tight environments

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.040 
really meant for its tight environments
kind<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:46.050> over<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:47.629> it's<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.719> it's

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
kind of like over here it's just it's

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.310 
kind of like over here it's just it's
perfect<00:00:49.559> for<00:00:49.590> small<00:00:50.100> environments<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:51.360> start

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
perfect for small environments but start

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.750 
perfect for small environments but start
off<00:00:52.940> track<00:00:53.940> frame<00:00:54.710> pads<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.070> they<00:00:56.370> actually<00:00:56.520> I

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
off track frame pads and they actually I

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.400 
off track frame pads and they actually I
was<00:00:56.910> watching<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.329> webcam<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.960> job<00:00:58.199> and

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
was watching the webcam of this job and

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.520 
was watching the webcam of this job and
they<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:58.949> cleaned<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.280> machine<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.530> just

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
they just cleaned this machine so just

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.770 
they just cleaned this machine so just
got<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:01.829> dirt<00:01:02.070> off<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.250> that's<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.239> step<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.629> go

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
got all dirt off it that's a step to go

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.509 
got all dirt off it that's a step to go
on<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.140> then<00:01:04.409> some<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.040> steps<00:01:05.280> are

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
on it and then some of the steps are

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.170 
on it and then some of the steps are
really<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.869> know<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:08.250> they're<00:01:08.490> foreign<00:01:09.030> so

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
really you know that they're foreign so

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.230 
really you know that they're foreign so
when<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.390> go<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> step<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.049> gotta<00:01:10.640> watch<00:01:11.640> your

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
when you go to step you gotta watch your

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.620 
when you go to step you gotta watch your
step<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:13.530> that's<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:14.010> step<00:01:14.430> you're<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
step but that's a step you're on the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.770 
step but that's a step you're on the
carriage<00:01:15.960> frame<00:01:16.310> Komatsu's<00:01:17.310> have

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
carriage frame Komatsu's have

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.380 
carriage frame Komatsu's have
always<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.890> lot<00:01:20.190> of<00:01:20.340> them<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.909> don't<00:01:21.299> I

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
always a lot of them have that I don't I

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330 
always a lot of them have that I don't I
think<00:01:21.600> case<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> machine<00:01:22.770> gets<00:01:22.920> stuck<00:01:23.190> you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
think case the machine gets stuck you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.180 
think case the machine gets stuck you
could<00:01:23.490> pull<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.670> cuz<00:01:23.940> it's<00:01:24.240> thicker<00:01:24.540> then<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
could pull it cuz it's thicker then the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.560 
could pull it cuz it's thicker then the
bottom<00:01:26.820> plate<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:28.280> no<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.940> hold<00:01:30.090> up<00:01:30.330> more

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
bottom plate so no it can hold up more

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.609 
bottom plate so no it can hold up more
and<00:01:31.310> your<00:01:32.310> tracks<00:01:32.670> these<00:01:33.299> nuts<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.259> to

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
and your tracks these nuts on here is to

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.710 
and your tracks these nuts on here is to
actually<00:01:34.920> track<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.759> attach<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.300> track

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
actually track the attach of the track

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.539 
actually track the attach of the track
is<00:01:36.960> because<00:01:39.409> these<00:01:40.409> are<00:01:40.590> called<00:01:40.800> pads<00:01:41.130> right

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
is because these are called pads right

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.469 
is because these are called pads right
here

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.350 

and<00:01:45.460> now<00:01:47.049> that<00:01:48.049> is<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.409> service<00:01:48.979> door<00:01:49.820> for<00:01:50.299> the

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
and now that is a service door for the

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.420 
and now that is a service door for the
machine<00:01:50.719> a<00:01:50.930> mirror<00:01:51.590> would<00:01:51.860> originally<00:01:52.219> be

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
machine a mirror would originally be

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.300 
machine a mirror would originally be
there<00:01:52.610> but<00:01:52.820> I<00:01:52.850> guess<00:01:53.060> it<00:01:53.240> got<00:01:53.329> knocked<00:01:53.630> off<00:01:54.310> but

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
there but I guess it got knocked off but

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.760 
there but I guess it got knocked off but
here's<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.420> bucket<00:01:56.810> it's<00:01:57.049> very<00:01:57.350> it's<00:01:57.560> pretty

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
here's the bucket it's very it's pretty

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.440 
here's the bucket it's very it's pretty
large<00:01:57.920> bucket<00:01:58.399> it's<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.789> nice<00:01:58.969> sized<00:01:59.179> bucket

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
large bucket it's a nice sized bucket

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.350 
large bucket it's a nice sized bucket
maybe<00:02:00.220> three<00:02:01.220> and<00:02:01.369> a<00:02:01.429> half<00:02:01.579> yards<00:02:02.060> I<00:02:02.149> don't

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
maybe three and a half yards I don't

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.080 
maybe three and a half yards I don't
know<00:02:02.530> it's<00:02:03.530> just<00:02:03.679> grease<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.490> check<00:02:04.819> out<00:02:04.970> all

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
know it's just grease to check out all

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.380 
know it's just grease to check out all
the<00:02:05.179> grease<00:02:05.740> sets<00:02:06.740> when<00:02:07.520> there<00:02:07.670> is<00:02:07.729> two<00:02:08.090> pins

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
the grease sets when there is two pins

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.110 
the grease sets when there is two pins
out<00:02:08.599> to<00:02:08.810> quick<00:02:09.019> coupler<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:10.640> along<00:02:10.880> with<00:02:10.910> the

bucket and linkage those cool dog bones

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.210 
bucket and linkage those cool dog bones
get<00:02:14.660> shaped<00:02:14.900> like<00:02:15.049> a<00:02:15.080> dog<00:02:15.319> bone<00:02:15.530> this<00:02:15.950> has<00:02:16.190> a

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
get shaped like a dog bone this has a

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.180 
get shaped like a dog bone this has a
lot<00:02:16.489> of<00:02:16.519> auxiliary<00:02:17.150> lines<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:18.040> more<00:02:19.040> than

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
lot of auxiliary lines on it more than

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.460 
lot of auxiliary lines on it more than
I've<00:02:19.370> seen<00:02:19.400> on<00:02:19.760> normal<00:02:20.120> machine<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.690> then

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
I've seen on normal machine and then

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.620 
I've seen on normal machine and then
that's<00:02:21.680> cylinder<00:02:22.099> right<00:02:22.310> there<00:02:22.549> is<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:23.120> curl

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
that's cylinder right there is to curl

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.039 
that's cylinder right there is to curl
your<00:02:23.870> bucket<00:02:24.049> in<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.620> out<00:02:25.630> then<00:02:26.630> as<00:02:26.840> always

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
your bucket in and out then as always

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.830 
your bucket in and out then as always
there's<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.470> boom<00:02:27.680> now<00:02:28.640> here's<00:02:29.269> good<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.630> show

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
there's a boom now here's good to show

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.350 
there's a boom now here's good to show
where<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.650> lines<00:02:30.860> going<00:02:31.280> to

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
where the lines going to

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.090 
where the lines going to
they<00:02:32.930> come<00:02:33.110> off<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.290> boom<00:02:33.530> right<00:02:33.710> there<00:02:33.980> and

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
they come off the boom right there and

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.230 
they come off the boom right there and
then<00:02:34.220> they<00:02:34.310> go<00:02:34.430> into<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.730> body<00:02:34.940> right<00:02:35.180> there

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
then they go into the body right there

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.540 
then they go into the body right there
on<00:02:35.660> like<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.870> normal<00:02:36.290> machine<00:02:36.560> where<00:02:37.220> they<00:02:37.340> just

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
on like a normal machine where they just

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.790 
on like a normal machine where they just
stay<00:02:37.940> on<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.480> back<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:38.930> then<00:02:39.020> attach<00:02:39.380> into

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
stay on the back and then attach into

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.980 
stay on the back and then attach into
the<00:02:39.890> back<00:02:40.130> these<00:02:41.060> go<00:02:41.330> off<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.750> side<00:02:41.960> like

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
the back these go off to the side like

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:49.059 
the back these go off to the side like
that<00:02:45.490> now<00:02:46.490> here's<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.880> back<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.330> machine

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
that now here's the back in the machine

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.160 
that now here's the back in the machine
and<00:02:49.430> then<00:02:49.700> there's<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.209> vent<00:02:50.480> right<00:02:50.629> here

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.670 

and<00:02:55.380> like<00:02:56.600> all-zero<00:02:57.600> counseling<00:02:58.350> machines

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
and like all-zero counseling machines

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.700 
and like all-zero counseling machines
cabs<00:02:59.370> tilted<00:02:59.880> I<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.120> don't<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.780> never<00:03:01.200> understand

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
cabs tilted I I don't I never understand

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.710 
cabs tilted I I don't I never understand
why<00:03:01.860> they<00:03:02.010> go<00:03:02.190> in<00:03:02.340> here<00:03:02.370> they<00:03:03.030> don't<00:03:03.210> have<00:03:03.450> to

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
why they go in here they don't have to

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.780 
why they go in here they don't have to
since<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.740> know<00:03:04.860> most<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.340> machine<00:03:05.670> is

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
since you know most of the machine is

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.560 
since you know most of the machine is
out<00:03:06.770> but<00:03:07.770> I<00:03:08.040> guess<00:03:08.670> that's<00:03:08.910> that's<00:03:09.240> just

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
out but I guess that's that's just

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.800 
out but I guess that's that's just
design<00:03:10.140> they<00:03:10.530> do<00:03:10.710> it<00:03:10.860> way<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.600> then<00:03:12.600> those

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
design they do it way and then those

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.380 
design they do it way and then those
events<00:03:13.050> are<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.380> let<00:03:13.530> all<00:03:13.650> your<00:03:13.770> heat<00:03:13.980> out

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
events are to let all your heat out

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:22.040 
events are to let all your heat out
right<00:03:15.390> there<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:17.340> your<00:03:17.730> tracks<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:21.050> inside

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
right there and your tracks and inside

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.850 
right there and your tracks and inside
it<00:03:22.230> your<00:03:22.560> cab<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.490> then<00:03:24.209> those<00:03:24.810> are<00:03:24.860> right

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
it your cab and then those are right

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.380 
it your cab and then those are right
there<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.160> your<00:03:26.280> horns<00:03:26.580> your<00:03:26.670> swing<00:03:26.970> gears<00:03:27.180> in

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
there and your horns your swing gears in

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.560 
there and your horns your swing gears in
there<00:03:27.570> it's<00:03:27.840> all<00:03:27.930> compact<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:29.610> then<00:03:30.390> if

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
there it's all compact and then if

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.600 
there it's all compact and then if
anyone<00:03:30.810> wonders<00:03:31.350> what<00:03:31.740> those<00:03:32.130> things<00:03:32.370> are

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
anyone wonders what those things are

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.990 
anyone wonders what those things are
those<00:03:32.820> are<00:03:32.970> I<00:03:33.270> call<00:03:33.900> them<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.410> cutting<00:03:34.709> edge

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
those are I call them the cutting edge

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.850 
those are I call them the cutting edge
they<00:03:36.000> just<00:03:36.690> they<00:03:36.870> caught<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.170> dirt<00:03:37.350> really<00:03:38.090> I

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
they just they caught the dirt really I

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.580 
they just they caught the dirt really I
mean<00:03:40.860> that<00:03:41.070> they<00:03:42.110> you<00:03:43.110> really<00:03:43.350> think<00:03:43.530> about

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
mean that they you really think about

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.680 
mean that they you really think about
what<00:03:43.860> they<00:03:43.980> did<00:03:44.160> when<00:03:44.340> they<00:03:44.370> dig<00:03:44.670> they<00:03:45.000> do<00:03:45.330> cut

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
what they did when they dig they do cut

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.470 
what they did when they dig they do cut
the<00:03:45.840> dirt<00:03:47.600> but<00:03:48.600> that's<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.880> guess<00:03:50.880> it's<00:03:51.120> it's<00:03:51.330> an

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
the dirt but that's I guess it's it's an

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.760 
the dirt but that's I guess it's it's an
all<00:03:51.570> right<00:03:51.840> walk<00:03:52.080> around<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.650> PC<00:03:53.430> thrill
