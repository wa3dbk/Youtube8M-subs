and troubles but said Gallifrey during
the<00:01:20.280> six<00:01:20.520> doctors<00:01:20.939> timeline<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.600> makes<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the six doctors timeline and makes the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.570 
the six doctors timeline and makes the
deal<00:01:22.110> with<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> master<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> end<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
deal with the master but in the end the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.480 
deal with the master but in the end the
doctor<00:01:23.790> defeats<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.650> this<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.799> just<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.159> theory

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
doctor defeats in this is just a theory

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.210 
doctor defeats in this is just a theory
so<00:01:26.670> they<00:01:26.820> probably<00:01:27.060> won't<00:01:27.409> be<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.680> how<00:01:29.070> it

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
so they probably won't be like how it

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.270 
so they probably won't be like how it
happens<00:01:29.640> but<00:01:30.229> i<00:01:31.229> think<00:01:31.560> my<00:01:31.680> theory<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.070> pretty

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
happens but i think my theory is pretty

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:54.460 
happens but i think my theory is pretty
good

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470
