00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.600
 review cannot be done to a great one 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.640
 shot 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.070
 we had what would have been good in 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.519
 two people are one and three as James 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.369
 bonds 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.689
 then many energies available god and jesus 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.340
 and spot genres 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.050
 so we decided to fill the hole 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.090
 of the title and this week is left 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.960
 from the absence of video review doing 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.149
 a top seven of the ten beautiful things 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.660
 that happened in the story of two 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.760
 fires 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.710
 which then are really kept is not 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.020
 been informed what research we have 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.780
 tried to do a sorting either 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.820
 too much could be region then 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.699
 good vision and dirty number 10 second 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.559
 world statistics 48 percent 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.769
 of gamers are of sex 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.299
 female there remains news leaves us a 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.210
 little perplexed seen and considered that 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.159
 in the statistics of our channel the 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.400
 90 percent of viewers are 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.180
 males 9.7 per cent are females and 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.020
 0.3 percent are not known 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.970
 It must be the first nine when 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.610
 in the seventies the video game was released 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.799
 space invaders in japan the game of 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.750
 it shook so much success that 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.549
 100 yen coins failed 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.079
 They were not more and they were 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:40.409
 necessary to play the cabin cruiser 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:42.689
 number 8 has football in 1973 came 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.960
 developed precisely from to bari the 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.909
 problem 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.760
 from Mr. football the problem is that 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.860
 it was released only in 1978 therefore 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.840
 five years later because why 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.940
 they developed the game but failed 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.650
 to develop screen scrolling 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.909
 then in a nutshell you checked in 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.259
 a player who came out of the 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.540
 screen was followed by cameras on 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.399
 dog because if he thinks that when then 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.780
 managed to develop and the purpose of 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.580
 screen what was at the base of 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.400
 all the games that there were then with it 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:17.430
 stop promised 500 members two years for 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.430
 understand how to do what we can do 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.709
 you know what the world record is 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.540
 appreciation of keys on the joypad 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.130
 neither is we next to the other one there 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.019
 japanese boy called something 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.600
 takahashi who managed to press the 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.519
 key 16 min faces second do not enter 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.320
 to hand submachine guns 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.450
 useless every he is champion is not among 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.950
 which affects not even the champion of 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.680
 world is congratulated his girlfriend 6 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.810
 the largest game map is contained 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.510
 inside a video game is that 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.880
 of the elder scrolls video game two from 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.610
 ko and is large and 62 thousand square miles 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.970
 or 160 thousand square kilometers 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.329
 or almost three quarters of the great 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.100
 britain or ambush thousand times the 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.190
 map contained in skyrim 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.170
 but let's say that as soon as it is generated 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.390
 an elegant song was not that there was a 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.180
 little man that both the modeled 160,000 and 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:23.010
 he did n't make it very repetitive 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:24.390
 big a lot of minustah I was saying for 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.370
 save the immense just for the 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:32.850
 programmer back in that house 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:34.860
 they went down to Christmas drags in the first 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.080
 mid- 90s means story 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.300
 they made a pact to create one 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.820
 console together with the name of nintendo ma 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.190
 with components built by themselves but 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.020
 nintendo retired from the project and sony 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.910
 however he decided to carry it out 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.340
 today with the console known as 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.250
 playstation I know they did well 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.200
 however release it also to the nose but if 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.120
 it seems that maybe it was a race if not 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.160
 I'm an expert in numbers and economics 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.390
 we are often of nothing I am not a 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:07.310
 expert number 4 and the same four 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.990
 sad number there are two porn movies 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.030
 passages on the super mario saga e 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.060
 these are called suvero ovens o 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.870
 they beat the super fornio brothers hard 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.299
 the first was enough for the 91 too 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.060
 nintendo has acquired the rights to 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.100
 both films to be sure that 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:30.770
 I never put these non -coaches 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:33.169
 marketed convictions and I want to 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.620
 I saw in two an advertisement that 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.509
 should tell them 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.490
 you remember the silent hill 1 that game 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.409
 he is afraid of fear 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.860
 the entrance to the silent hill school 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:48.020
 one is based on school entrance 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.240
 of a film with arnold schwarzenegger that 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.919
 in Italian it is called the policeman at 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.500
 elementary English is called kinder 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.509
 coma card for kindergarten means 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.400
 She suffered a lot and have grown the 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.960
 transposition Italian silvia you seem to 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.819
 compare the intended image are 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.949
 precisely the same thing even 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.720
 having said that they are two posters from Salento 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.430
 are your written no to copy 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:13.280
 exact of those even the number two 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.139
 during the sixteenth and last level of the 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.169
 Diablo game how nice it is away 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.270
 stuck beautiful thing is possible 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.370
 listen to an audio message that 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.479
 apparently meaningless that it is not 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.340
 meaningless because the episode but must 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:32.150
 listen to the message in reverse for 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.840
 hear the hidden message that ethio 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.550
 jazz blues and glass arthur avenue 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.190
 or I eat vegetables and the wing of 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.229
 giving you a meal every meal is so on 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.259
 success on the contrary if the 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:46.789
 it felt good that it is scary is a bit of a tone 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:49.430
 of my mother this real face 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:51.830
 diablo therefore looks a little like my mother 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.440
 official perfumed huge horns scent 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.710
 when so corrugated musky that wants 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.710
 to say 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.220
 the last thing is perhaps the cutest 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.530
 I don't know I'm not a thorn it's a 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:11.020
 stunt enters most romantic one of the 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:13.030
 last romantic in 1987 the software 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.950
 house square enix was big 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:19.510
 economic difficulties almost loses 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:21.280
 bancari alternates the famous video that 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.050
 in design and does not accuse that the came out 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.260
 famous of its thick the famous ones 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.390

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:32.470
 written on the michelin guide the father a 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:34.960
 tones do not lose they gave him two 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.880
 pancake indeed decided to launch into 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.340
 one last great challenge of his trade 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.290
 he said this does not suit me a little 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.180
 everything and therefore that they made decided of 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.550
 be inspired by 3 famous video days 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.520
 of the very successful era that 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.690
 zelda dragon quests were reached 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.130
 last you know how it ended 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.390
 starts developing this video game 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:56.270
 weapons came out in the corner 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.820
 987 and to date have been developed years 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.550
 about 17 sequences of this video a 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.280
 followed more followed less than what game 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.710
 we are talking and it is final 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.480
 fantasy and so we want to close 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.640
 this small but close with this 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.260
 pearl and want to know it by closing 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.940
 so too a vowel too 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.600
 nothing was anap and goodbye 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:20.630

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.680
 to look for around the floor of 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.320
 rubrichette nice things exist a 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.380
 lots of interesting mega background 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.450
 Video games are sausages on fiesole 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.740
 only a mysterious object ate not 

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.340
 you know the instrument picture by going to 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:39.290
 looking for new gates two more seas 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.730
 left of the interior of the is perhaps so 

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.800
 also of the last unitary days a 

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.510
 inside of something rather we leave 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.910
 lose only for short to the next 

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.680
 heading if it will be successful then to facts 

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.750
 that is successful and I do another 

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:56.470
 so what to say thanks for your attention 

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:56.470
 and the track of juan maria cv
