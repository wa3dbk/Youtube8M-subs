all<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.060> need<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.270> do<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.510> pick<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.690> champion

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
all you need to do is pick a champion

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.740 
all you need to do is pick a champion
with<00:00:19.740> some<00:00:20.010> range<00:00:20.279> like<00:00:20.760> Annie<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.359> then

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
with some range like Annie and then

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.340 
with some range like Annie and then
really<00:00:22.410> really<00:00:22.619> high<00:00:22.769> burst<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.310> nice<00:00:23.490> indra

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
really really high burst a nice indra

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.570 
really really high burst a nice indra
orianna's<00:00:25.350> okay<00:00:25.769> she<00:00:26.130> doesn't<00:00:26.369> really<00:00:26.460> have

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
orianna's okay she doesn't really have

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.970 
orianna's okay she doesn't really have
the<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.300> necessary<00:00:27.480> burst<00:00:28.230> fizz<00:00:28.680> would<00:00:28.890> be

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the the necessary burst fizz would be

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.880 
the the necessary burst fizz would be
good<00:00:29.330> except<00:00:30.330> for<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.510> range<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
good except for the range so the the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.590 
good except for the range so the the
laning<00:00:32.520> face<00:00:32.669> might<00:00:32.880> be<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> little<00:00:33.210> bit<00:00:33.300> harder

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
laning face might be a little bit harder

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.910 
laning face might be a little bit harder
but<00:00:33.719> as<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.899> can<00:00:33.989> see<00:00:34.050> every<00:00:34.410> time<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.620> get<00:00:34.739> in

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
but as you can see every time I get in

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.110 
but as you can see every time I get in
range<00:00:35.070> was<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.399> throw<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.730> like

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
range was going to throw with like

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.970 
range was going to throw with like
throwing<00:00:36.360> Auto<00:00:36.600> at<00:00:36.809> her<00:00:36.899> Annie<00:00:37.380> has<00:00:37.649> one<00:00:37.860> of

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
throwing Auto at her Annie has one of

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.010 
throwing Auto at her Annie has one of
the<00:00:38.100> longest<00:00:38.340> Auto<00:00:38.940> Attack<00:00:39.239> ranges<00:00:39.600> from<00:00:39.780> mid

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
the longest Auto Attack ranges from mid

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.340 
the longest Auto Attack ranges from mid
champions<00:00:40.910> so<00:00:41.910> that's<00:00:42.480> why<00:00:42.660> Orianna<00:00:43.050> would<00:00:43.230> be

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
champions so that's why Orianna would be

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.510 
champions so that's why Orianna would be
good<00:00:43.530> because<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.860> could<00:00:44.010> literally<00:00:44.219> push

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
good because you could literally push

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.520 
good because you could literally push
her<00:00:44.610> out<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.820> lane<00:00:44.940> because<00:00:45.289> orianna's<00:00:46.289> auto

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
her out of lane because orianna's auto

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.260 
her out of lane because orianna's auto
attacks<00:00:46.829> do<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.100> much<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.399> right<00:00:47.579> here<00:00:47.610> just

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
attacks do so much but right here just

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.959 
attacks do so much but right here just
gonna<00:00:48.420> use<00:00:48.600> my<00:00:49.020> stun<00:00:49.350> my<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.280> spell<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.730> igniter

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
gonna use my stun my to spell is igniter

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.939 
gonna use my stun my to spell is igniter
and<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.300> push<00:00:51.420> her<00:00:51.539> out<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.750> lane<00:00:51.930> I'm<00:00:52.530> fairly

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
and just push her out of lane I'm fairly

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.010 
and just push her out of lane I'm fairly
simple<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:54.000> if<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.660> range<00:00:54.899> you

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
simple to do if you have that range you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.090 
simple to do if you have that range you
just<00:00:55.170> need<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.350> make<00:00:55.500> sure<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.860> keep

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
just need to make sure that you keep

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.650 
just need to make sure that you keep
that<00:00:56.160> auto<00:00:56.610> go<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.270> want<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> make<00:00:57.629> sure

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
that auto go and you want to make sure

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.080 
that auto go and you want to make sure
that<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.960> avoid<00:00:58.430> minion<00:00:59.430> damage<00:00:59.550> as<00:00:59.789> much<00:00:59.940> as

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
that you avoid minion damage as much as

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.459 
that you avoid minion damage as much as
you<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.600> then<00:01:00.719> when<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:01.020> your<00:01:01.079> stun

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
you can but then when you have your stun

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.929 
you can but then when you have your stun
up<00:01:01.940> with<00:01:02.940> either<00:01:03.239> syndra<00:01:03.870> or<00:01:04.489> Annie<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.790> just

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
up with either syndra or Annie you just

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.100 
up with either syndra or Annie you just
want<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.119> go<00:01:06.240> right<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.600> use<00:01:06.840> it

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
want to go right and use it

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.380 
want to go right and use it
luckily<00:01:07.830> knew<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> jungler<00:01:08.939> was<00:01:09.090> coming

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
luckily knew that the jungler was coming

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.609 
luckily knew that the jungler was coming
so<00:01:09.510> he's<00:01:09.630> gonna<00:01:09.750> flash<00:01:10.020> news<00:01:10.229> result<00:01:10.530> thing

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
so he's gonna flash news result thing

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.750 
so he's gonna flash news result thing
we're<00:01:10.710> gonna<00:01:10.799> pick<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> kill<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.580> one

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
we're gonna pick up the kill on that one

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.710 
we're gonna pick up the kill on that one
so<00:01:12.240> there's<00:01:12.600> another<00:01:12.990> way<00:01:14.390> this<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.509> kind<00:01:15.689> of

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
so there's another way this is kind of

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.999 
so there's another way this is kind of
just<00:01:15.840> showing<00:01:16.080> laying<00:01:16.470> mechanics<00:01:16.890> again

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
just showing laying mechanics again

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.020 
just showing laying mechanics again
there's<00:01:17.189> nothing<00:01:17.430> really<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.850> can

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
there's nothing really that you can

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.120 
there's nothing really that you can
build<00:01:18.299> against<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.960> collie<00:01:19.200> that's<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.920> to

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
build against a collie that's going to

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.280 
build against a collie that's going to
like<00:01:20.460> tilt<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.119> favor

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
like tilt the favor

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.749 
like tilt the favor
like<00:01:22.470> tilt<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.040> your<00:01:23.159> favor<00:01:23.340> if<00:01:23.460> she<00:01:23.580> gets
