00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.180 
conveniently I have a longer cable here
that<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:33.420> just<00:02:33.690> happen<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:33.989> have<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.500> if<00:02:35.040> you

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
that I just happen to have and if you

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.890 
that I just happen to have and if you
own<00:02:35.489> a<00:02:35.519> smartphone<00:02:35.970> or<00:02:36.150> any<00:02:36.420> other<00:02:36.599> device

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
that takes micro USB then you probably

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.780 
that takes micro USB then you probably
the<00:02:39.989> cord<00:02:40.230> like<00:02:40.410> this<00:02:40.470> this<00:02:41.250> one<00:02:41.430> happens<00:02:41.730> to

faster than the actual wall outlet which
is<00:03:44.600> kind<00:03:45.600> of<00:03:45.690> strange<00:03:46.019> because<00:03:46.290> other<00:03:46.739> power

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
is kind of strange because other power

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.099 
is kind of strange because other power
banks<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.489> have<00:03:47.730> charged<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.569> lot<00:03:48.840> slower

so<00:04:23.320> another<00:04:24.280> awesome<00:04:24.820> thing<00:04:25.000> about<00:04:25.030> this

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
so another awesome thing about this

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.510 
so another awesome thing about this
device<00:04:25.630> of<00:04:25.960> course<00:04:26.020> is<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.740> capacity<00:04:27.220> itself

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
device of course is the capacity itself

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.600 
device of course is the capacity itself
so<00:04:28.330> twenty<00:04:28.840> thousand<00:04:29.470> million<00:04:29.919> hours<00:04:30.220> that<00:04:30.490> is

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
so twenty thousand million hours that is

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.030 
so twenty thousand million hours that is
huge<00:04:31.090> if<00:04:31.720> you<00:04:31.840> go<00:04:31.930> on<00:04:32.080> another<00:04:32.350> website<00:04:32.590> like

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040

with<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:44.950> capacity<00:04:45.550> I<00:04:45.580> have<00:04:45.970> a<00:04:46.000> similar

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
with the capacity I have a similar

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.180 
with the capacity I have a similar
product<00:04:46.810> that<00:04:47.169> I've<00:04:47.260> been<00:04:47.290> using<00:04:47.440> for<00:04:47.830> quite

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
product that I've been using for quite

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.340 
product that I've been using for quite
some<00:04:48.460> time<00:04:48.669> and<00:04:48.940> I<00:04:49.540> like<00:04:49.870> I<00:04:49.990> mentioned<00:04:50.320> before

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
some time and I like I mentioned before

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.490 
some time and I like I mentioned before
charge<00:04:51.040> is<00:04:51.190> slower<00:04:51.400> than<00:04:51.550> this<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.320> it<00:04:53.320> is

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
charge is slower than this and it is

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.670 
charge is slower than this and it is
lower<00:04:53.680> capacity<00:04:53.919> it<00:04:54.550> is<00:04:55.210> only<00:04:55.540> I<00:04:56.080> believe<00:04:56.350> four

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
lower capacity it is only I believe four

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.500 
lower capacity it is only I believe four
thousand<00:04:57.250> milliamp<00:04:57.520> hours<00:04:57.850> so<00:04:58.030> this<00:04:58.120> is<00:04:58.270> five

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
thousand milliamp hours so this is five

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.930 
thousand milliamp hours so this is five
times<00:04:58.810> larger<00:04:58.930> and<00:04:59.440> I<00:05:00.100> believe<00:05:00.430> for<00:05:00.910> that

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
times larger and I believe for that

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.900 
times larger and I believe for that
other<00:05:01.180> product<00:05:01.630> I<00:05:01.750> paid<00:05:01.960> towards<00:05:02.790> $30.00<00:05:03.790> I

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
other product I paid towards $30.00 I

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.670 
other product I paid towards $30.00 I
think<00:05:04.060> roughly<00:05:04.240> thirty<00:05:04.570> dollars<00:05:04.930> so<00:05:05.200> this<00:05:05.530> is

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
think roughly thirty dollars so this is

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.920 
think roughly thirty dollars so this is
like<00:05:05.800> half<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.190> price<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:06.729> then<00:05:07.270> five<00:05:07.570> times

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
like half the price and then five times

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.159 
like half the price and then five times
the<00:05:08.110> capacity<00:05:08.740> so<00:05:09.460> great<00:05:10.419> deal<00:05:10.720> here<00:05:11.050> if

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
the capacity so great deal here if

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.570 
the capacity so great deal here if
you're<00:05:11.290> really<00:05:11.470> looking<00:05:11.620> for<00:05:11.800> a<00:05:12.010> nice<00:05:12.280> power

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
you're really looking for a nice power

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.750 
you're really looking for a nice power
bank<00:05:12.940> and<00:05:13.770> I<00:05:14.770> have<00:05:14.860> other<00:05:15.040> phones<00:05:15.280> too<00:05:15.580> like

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
bank and I have other phones too like

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.360 
bank and I have other phones too like
the<00:05:16.479> Galaxy<00:05:16.900> Nexus<00:05:17.020> has<00:05:17.919> a<00:05:17.950> little<00:05:18.100> bit<00:05:18.190> of<00:05:18.280> a

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
the Galaxy Nexus has a little bit of a

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.490 
the Galaxy Nexus has a little bit of a
larger<00:05:18.700> battery<00:05:18.910> I<00:05:19.150> think<00:05:19.450> it<00:05:19.660> actually<00:05:20.110> no<00:05:20.350> it

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
larger battery I think it actually no it

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.320 
larger battery I think it actually no it
does<00:05:20.830> it<00:05:21.010> has<00:05:21.100> a<00:05:21.130> two<00:05:21.370> thousand<00:05:21.910> milliamp<00:05:22.180> hour

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
does it has a two thousand milliamp hour

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.469 
does it has a two thousand milliamp hour
battery<00:05:22.419> so<00:05:22.960> so<00:05:23.740> technically<00:05:24.310> I<00:05:24.490> can<00:05:25.180> use<00:05:25.330> this

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
battery so so technically I can use this

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.790 
battery so so technically I can use this
product<00:05:25.930> to<00:05:26.169> charge<00:05:26.410> my<00:05:26.620> phone<00:05:26.650> 10<00:05:27.250> times<00:05:27.700> and

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
product to charge my phone 10 times and

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.340 
product to charge my phone 10 times and
my<00:05:29.800> Galaxy<00:05:30.190> Nexus<00:05:30.450> it<00:05:31.450> lasts<00:05:31.870> for<00:05:32.020> roughly<00:05:32.229> a

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
my Galaxy Nexus it lasts for roughly a

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.750 
my Galaxy Nexus it lasts for roughly a
day<00:05:32.590> so<00:05:33.520> you<00:05:33.640> get<00:05:33.820> 10<00:05:34.120> days<00:05:34.720> of<00:05:35.080> charge<00:05:35.440> out<00:05:36.039> of

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
day so you get 10 days of charge out of

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.820 
day so you get 10 days of charge out of
this<00:05:37.030> so<00:05:37.240> if<00:05:37.330> I<00:05:37.390> go<00:05:37.570> on<00:05:37.780> a<00:05:37.840> camping<00:05:38.260> trip<00:05:38.289> for<00:05:38.650> 10

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
this so if I go on a camping trip for 10

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.880 
this so if I go on a camping trip for 10
days<00:05:39.130> which<00:05:39.729> is<00:05:39.940> a<00:05:39.970> big<00:05:40.300> camping<00:05:40.750> trip<00:05:40.990> I<00:05:41.229> would

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
the entire time so just that in itself

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.690 
the entire time so just that in itself
the<00:05:46.870> capacity<00:05:47.530> really<00:05:47.800> is<00:05:48.039> what<00:05:48.310> wins<00:05:48.520> the

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
the capacity really is what wins the
