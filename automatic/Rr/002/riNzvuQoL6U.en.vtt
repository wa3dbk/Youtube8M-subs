might seem quite simple just go as hard

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.010 
might seem quite simple just go as hard
as<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.290> can<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:14.070> start<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.670> finish<00:00:14.880> but<00:00:15.330> the

as you can and start to finish but the

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.330 
as you can and start to finish but the
phrase<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.440> little<00:00:16.680> bit<00:00:16.800> more<00:00:16.980> complicated

phrase is a little bit more complicated

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.170 
phrase is a little bit more complicated
than<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.789> because<00:00:18.890> pasting<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.279> absolutely

here are tips the good pacing and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:46.750 
here are tips the good pacing and
getting<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> most<00:00:32.700> out<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.540> your<00:00:33.719> time

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.910 

there's<00:00:47.690> no<00:00:47.809> doubt<00:00:48.110> there's<00:00:48.470> one<00:00:48.620> piece<00:00:48.860> of

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
there's no doubt there's one piece of

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.799 
there's no doubt there's one piece of
hardware<00:00:49.340> which<00:00:49.790> Trump's<00:00:50.180> all<00:00:50.239> others<00:00:50.360> when

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
hardware which Trump's all others when

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.569 
hardware which Trump's all others when
it<00:00:50.930> comes<00:00:51.170> to<00:00:51.350> pasting<00:00:51.800> a<00:00:51.860> time<00:00:52.100> shell<00:00:52.370> and

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
it comes to pasting a time shell and

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.850 
it comes to pasting a time shell and
that<00:00:52.610> is<00:00:53.090> a<00:00:53.329> power<00:00:53.660> meter<00:00:53.930> so<00:00:54.379> as<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:54.590> can<00:00:54.710> see

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
that is a power meter so as you can see

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.950 
that is a power meter so as you can see

them in training regularly over the last
year<00:01:00.920> that<00:01:01.070> has<00:01:01.670> allowed<00:01:01.940> me<00:01:02.090> to<00:01:02.120> build<00:01:02.329> up<00:01:02.480> a

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
year that has allowed me to build up a

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.660 
year that has allowed me to build up a
clear<00:01:02.870> picture<00:01:03.080> of<00:01:03.350> my<00:01:03.470> personal<00:01:03.920> best<00:01:04.190> over

is<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:07.340> very<00:01:07.729> valuable<00:01:08.060> piece<00:01:08.479> of<00:01:08.540> information

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
is a very valuable piece of information

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.380 
is a very valuable piece of information
here's<00:01:09.860> why<00:01:10.100> let's<00:01:10.759> say<00:01:11.030> that<00:01:11.240> your<00:01:11.330> target

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
here's why let's say that your target

event is a 10 kilometer time trial or
6.2<00:01:14.630> miles<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.229> based<00:01:15.590> on<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.830> course<00:01:16.100> you

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
6.2 miles and based on the course you

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.950 
6.2 miles and based on the course you
estimate<00:01:17.030> it's<00:01:17.210> going<00:01:17.390> to<00:01:17.479> take<00:01:17.659> you<00:01:17.840> around

for<00:01:52.490> goodness<00:01:52.819> knows<00:01:53.000> how<00:01:53.149> many<00:01:53.330> years<00:01:53.420> now

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
for goodness knows how many years now

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.830 
for goodness knows how many years now
310<00:01:54.860> watts<00:01:55.160> on<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.490> day<00:01:55.670> would<00:01:56.060> be<00:01:56.090> absolutely

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
310 watts on the day would be absolutely

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.870 
310 watts on the day would be absolutely
incredible<00:01:57.349> so<00:01:57.560> how<00:01:58.280> do<00:01:58.340> we<00:01:58.429> use<00:01:58.700> this

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
incredible so how do we use this

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.240 
incredible so how do we use this
information<00:01:58.940> on<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.720> day<00:01:59.929> of<00:02:00.140> our<00:02:00.289> events<00:02:00.770> or

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
information on the day of our events or

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.979 
information on the day of our events or
firstly<00:02:01.729> it's<00:02:01.940> important<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.539> note<00:02:02.780> the

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989 
firstly it's important to note the

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:04.749 
firstly it's important to note the
initial<00:02:03.380> 10-second<00:02:04.009> sprint<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.429> get<00:02:04.520> us<00:02:04.640> up<00:02:04.729> to

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
initial 10-second sprint to get us up to

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.760 
initial 10-second sprint to get us up to
speed<00:02:05.179> uses<00:02:05.690> a<00:02:05.750> different<00:02:06.110> physiological

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
speed uses a different physiological

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.800 
speed uses a different physiological
system<00:02:07.160> so<00:02:07.489> it's<00:02:07.610> okay<00:02:07.970> for<00:02:08.000> us<00:02:08.239> to<00:02:08.330> sprint<00:02:08.660> off

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
system so it's okay for us to sprint off

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.260 
system so it's okay for us to sprint off
the<00:02:08.929> start<00:02:09.200> line<00:02:09.410> over<00:02:10.399> once<00:02:10.610> you've<00:02:10.759> sat<00:02:11.030> in<00:02:11.180> a

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
the start line over once you've sat in a

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.660 
the start line over once you've sat in a
saddle<00:02:11.770> nestled<00:02:12.770> into<00:02:12.920> your<00:02:13.130> time<00:02:13.370> trial

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
saddle nestled into your time trial

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.240 
saddle nestled into your time trial
position<00:02:14.239> it's<00:02:14.720> really<00:02:15.080> important<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:15.860> you

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
position it's really important that you

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.460 
position it's really important that you
stick<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.849> power<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.720> know<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:17.989> can<00:02:18.260> do

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
stick to the power you know you can do

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.620 
stick to the power you know you can do
for<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.800> duration<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:20.060> actually<00:02:20.420> this<00:02:20.569> is

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
for the duration and actually this is

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.080 
for the duration and actually this is
much<00:02:20.870> easier<00:02:21.380> said<00:02:21.620> than<00:02:21.800> done<00:02:21.860> because<00:02:22.790> with

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
much easier said than done because with

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.220 
much easier said than done because with
the<00:02:23.180> adrenaline<00:02:23.480> running<00:02:23.810> through<00:02:24.050> your<00:02:24.170> body

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
the adrenaline running through your body

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.339 
the adrenaline running through your body
on<00:02:25.099> a<00:02:25.190> day<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.670> event<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:26.690> is<00:02:26.720> going<00:02:27.200> to

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
on a day of the event this is going to

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.890 
on a day of the event this is going to
feel<00:02:27.560> incredibly<00:02:28.340> easy<00:02:28.550> but<00:02:29.540> it's<00:02:29.720> really

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
feel incredibly easy but it's really

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.660 
feel incredibly easy but it's really
important<00:02:30.349> that<00:02:30.410> we<00:02:30.500> stick<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.920> our<00:02:30.950> target

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
important that we stick to our target

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.910 
important that we stick to our target
and<00:02:32.090> don't<00:02:32.510> go<00:02:32.720> over<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:33.080> heavy<00:02:33.349> Garmin

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
through that's the point where we can

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.940 
through that's the point where we can

our power numbers it's still feeling
very<00:02:54.230> good<00:02:54.500> we<00:02:55.189> can<00:02:55.400> raise<00:02:55.609> our<00:02:55.879> game<00:02:56.090> ever<00:02:56.420> so

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:56.719 
very good we can raise our game ever so
