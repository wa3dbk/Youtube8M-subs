00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
hello guys and welcome to the review of

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.600 
hello guys and welcome to the review of
lg<00:00:09.059> optimus<00:00:09.240> l5<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.380> in<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.070> video<00:00:11.280> we<00:00:11.550> will

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
lg optimus l5 and in this video we will

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.470 
lg optimus l5 and in this video we will
talk<00:00:11.790> about<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.300> display<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.440> l5<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.480> you

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
talk about the display of the l5 and you

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.630 
talk about the display of the l5 and you
know<00:00:15.599> we<00:00:15.719> were<00:00:15.780> just<00:00:15.839> try<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.740> few<00:00:17.070> games<00:00:17.310> on

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
know we were just try a few games on

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.269 
know we were just try a few games on
this<00:00:17.970> device<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.230> see<00:00:19.350> what<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> gaming<00:00:20.130> is

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
this device and see what the gaming is

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.560 
this device and see what the gaming is
like<00:00:20.670> on<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.090> device<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:22.369> the<00:00:23.369> device<00:00:24.029> has<00:00:24.330> a

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
like on this device so the device has a

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.109 
like on this device so the device has a
4-inch<00:00:25.070> diagonally<00:00:26.070> display<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:27.090> a

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
4-inch diagonally display with a

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.769 
4-inch diagonally display with a
resolution<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.779> 320<00:00:28.349> by<00:00:29.039> 480<00:00:29.310> pixels<00:00:29.849> so

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
resolution of 320 by 480 pixels so

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.430 
resolution of 320 by 480 pixels so
that's<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.650> mid-range<00:00:32.610> resolution<00:00:33.270> because

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
that's a mid-range resolution because

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.049 
that's a mid-range resolution because
something<00:00:34.440> lower<00:00:34.680> than<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:35.130> would<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.460> 240

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
something lower than this would be 240

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.510 
something lower than this would be 240
by<00:00:36.180> 320<00:00:36.390> pixels<00:00:37.079> or<00:00:37.530> something<00:00:37.950> higher<00:00:38.219> would

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
by 320 pixels or something higher would

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
by 320 pixels or something higher would
be<00:00:38.640> 480<00:00:39.120> by<00:00:39.270> 800<00:00:39.510> as<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.379> l7<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:42.090> optimus

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
be 480 by 800 as in the l7 the optimus

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.610 
be 480 by 800 as in the l7 the optimus
l7<00:00:42.719> would<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.260> 320<00:00:46.260> by<00:00:46.379> 480

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
l7 would have so this is 320 by 480

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.270 
l7 would have so this is 320 by 480
pixels<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.539> about<00:00:48.750> okay<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:50.160> know

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
pixels and it just about okay you know

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.549 
pixels and it just about okay you know
there<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.520> no<00:00:50.640> pixelation<00:00:51.329> as<00:00:51.539> such<00:00:51.780> any

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
there is no pixelation as such any

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.939 
there is no pixelation as such any
noticeable<00:00:52.980> pixelation<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:54.770> it's<00:00:55.770> not

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
noticeable pixelation but it's not

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.270 
noticeable pixelation but it's not
exactly<00:00:56.100> high<00:00:56.489> definition<00:00:57.500> so<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.949> know<00:00:59.039> that

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
exactly high definition so you know that

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.790 
exactly high definition so you know that
the<00:00:59.399> text<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.629> quite<00:01:00.750> clear<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.350> icons

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
the text is it's quite clear the icons

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.770 
the text is it's quite clear the icons
look<00:01:02.120> average<00:01:03.799> nothing<00:01:04.799> extraordinary<00:01:05.189> but

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
look average nothing extraordinary but

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.510 
look average nothing extraordinary but
you<00:01:06.780> know<00:01:06.869> nothing<00:01:07.170> too<00:01:07.290> bad<00:01:07.439> either<00:01:08.960> so

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
you know nothing too bad either so

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.140 
you know nothing too bad either so
that's<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.909> display<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:13.850> let's<00:01:14.850> talk<00:01:15.000> about

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
that's the display and let's talk about

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.950 
that's the display and let's talk about
the<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:16.619> viewing<00:01:17.070> angles<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.390> know<00:01:18.630> if<00:01:18.840> I

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
the the viewing angles so you know if I

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.929 
the the viewing angles so you know if I
tilt<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.320> phone<00:01:20.210> this<00:01:21.210> way<00:01:21.860> it<00:01:22.860> kind<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.340> you

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
tilt the phone this way it kind of you

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.060 
tilt the phone this way it kind of you
know<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.119> would<00:01:24.360> lose<00:01:24.570> colors<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.799> mean<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
know you would lose colors I mean the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.240 
know you would lose colors I mean the
colors<00:01:26.369> wash<00:01:26.580> out<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.829> if<00:01:28.829> you're<00:01:29.040> viewing

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
colors wash out and if you're viewing

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.789 
colors wash out and if you're viewing
some<00:01:29.610> some<00:01:29.939> video<00:01:30.270> or<00:01:30.600> some<00:01:30.960> TV<00:01:31.259> show<00:01:31.500> or<00:01:31.770> a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
youtube video and if you if you tilt it

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.399 
youtube video and if you if you tilt it
your<00:01:34.290> device<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:36.090> know<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.900> colors<00:01:37.170> will

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
your device you know the colors will

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.210 
your device you know the colors will
wash<00:01:37.590> out<00:01:37.909> so<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.299> even<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.320> tilt<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> this

wash out so and even if you tilt it this

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.450 
wash out so and even if you tilt it this
way<00:01:41.810> this<00:01:42.810> paint<00:01:43.079> kind<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.409> becomes<00:01:43.680> fight<00:01:44.009> so

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
way this paint kind of becomes fight so

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.050 
way this paint kind of becomes fight so
you<00:01:44.729> know<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.090> becomes<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.670> it<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:48.030> not

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
you know it becomes it's just it is not

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.450 
you know it becomes it's just it is not
adjust<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:50.210> brightness<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.840> kind<00:01:52.049> of

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
adjust for the brightness and it kind of

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.870 
adjust for the brightness and it kind of
loses<00:01:53.460> readability<00:01:54.950> but<00:01:55.950> as<00:01:56.189> long<00:01:56.549> as<00:01:56.610> you're

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
loses readability but as long as you're

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.300 
loses readability but as long as you're
looking<00:01:57.570> at<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.869> directly<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:59.159> quite<00:01:59.430> nice

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
looking at it directly it's quite nice

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.130 
looking at it directly it's quite nice
there<00:02:01.909> you<00:02:02.000> go<00:02:05.049> so<00:02:06.250> you<00:02:07.250> know<00:02:07.660> so<00:02:08.660> as<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:09.050> can

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
there you go so you know so as you can

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.620 
there you go so you know so as you can
see<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.410> colors<00:02:09.679> look<00:02:09.860> good<00:02:10.209> it's<00:02:11.209> more<00:02:11.450> like

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
see the colors look good it's more like

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.460 
see the colors look good it's more like
the<00:02:12.130> very<00:02:13.130> similar<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.640> IBS<00:02:14.120> display<00:02:14.900> well

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
the very similar to the IBS display well

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.740 
the very similar to the IBS display well
the<00:02:15.590> IBS<00:02:15.950> is<00:02:16.130> obviously<00:02:16.550> a<00:02:16.940> lot<00:02:17.420> better<00:02:17.690> than

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
the IBS is obviously a lot better than

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.170 
the IBS is obviously a lot better than
the<00:02:18.140> display<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.560> is<00:02:18.650> used<00:02:18.830> here<00:02:19.069> but<00:02:19.640> you

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
the display that is used here but you

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.470 
the display that is used here but you
know<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.420> colors<00:02:20.690> are<00:02:20.840> very<00:02:20.930> natural<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:23.300> look

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
know the colors are very natural to look

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.630 
know the colors are very natural to look
very<00:02:23.840> good<00:02:24.470> it's<00:02:24.739> it's<00:02:24.980> not<00:02:25.160> something<00:02:25.610> like

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
very good it's it's not something like

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.030 
very good it's it's not something like
super<00:02:26.030> amoled<00:02:26.480> which<00:02:26.720> has<00:02:26.900> very<00:02:27.530> vivid<00:02:27.950> and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
super amoled which has very vivid and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.820 
super amoled which has very vivid and
very<00:02:28.580> saturated<00:02:28.790> colors<00:02:29.420> this<00:02:30.410> is<00:02:30.530> more<00:02:30.739> of

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
very saturated colors this is more of

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.770 
very saturated colors this is more of
the<00:02:30.920> natural<00:02:31.069> side<00:02:31.520> so<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.390> looks<00:02:32.600> nice<00:02:32.780> now

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
the natural side so it looks nice now

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.910 
the natural side so it looks nice now
let's<00:02:35.780> talk<00:02:36.140> about<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.910> gaming<00:02:37.910> on<00:02:38.769> you<00:02:39.769> know

let's talk about the gaming on you know

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.940 
let's talk about the gaming on you know
the<00:02:40.730> LG<00:02:41.000> elf<00:02:41.180> eyes<00:02:41.390> I<00:02:41.720> have<00:02:42.290> two<00:02:42.500> games<00:02:42.709> here

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
the LG elf eyes I have two games here

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.670 
the LG elf eyes I have two games here
Temple<00:02:43.310> Run<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:43.730> Angry<00:02:44.180> Birds<00:02:44.440> so<00:02:45.440> let's

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
Temple Run and Angry Birds so let's

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.630 
Temple Run and Angry Birds so let's
let's<00:02:46.160> try<00:02:46.310> Angry<00:02:46.670> Birds<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.060> see<00:02:47.209> what<00:02:47.390> that

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
let's try Angry Birds and see what that

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.479 
let's try Angry Birds and see what that
looks<00:02:49.640> like

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
looks like

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.860 
looks like
so<00:02:52.489> colors<00:02:52.760> are<00:02:52.880> looking<00:02:53.120> pretty<00:02:53.269> good<00:02:53.390> here<00:02:53.690> I

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
so colors are looking pretty good here I

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.660 
so colors are looking pretty good here I
mean<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.590> know<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.950> camera<00:02:55.220> might<00:02:55.370> not<00:02:55.550> be

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
mean I know the camera might not be

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.210 
mean I know the camera might not be
doing<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.030> best<00:02:56.150> job<00:02:56.330> here<00:02:56.720> but<00:02:57.319> I'm<00:02:57.920> looking

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
doing the best job here but I'm looking

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:14.350 
doing the best job here but I'm looking
at<00:02:58.340> indirectly<00:02:58.730> and<00:03:12.070> so<00:03:13.070> pinch<00:03:13.850> and<00:03:14.000> zoom<00:03:14.060> is

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
at indirectly and so pinch and zoom is

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.330 
at indirectly and so pinch and zoom is
working<00:03:14.660> quite<00:03:15.019> well<00:03:15.140> while<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.040> game<00:03:16.190> is

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
working quite well while the game is

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:24.479 
working quite well while the game is
being<00:03:16.489> played<00:03:17.500> so<00:03:18.500> no<00:03:18.890> delay<00:03:19.220> or<00:03:19.250> starters<00:03:19.640> -

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:33.130 

that's<00:03:25.489> pretty<00:03:25.730> well

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.670 

quite<00:03:34.140> nice

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
quite nice

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.400 
quite nice
no<00:03:35.220> it's<00:03:35.370> not<00:03:37.700> it's<00:03:38.700> not<00:03:38.790> really<00:03:39.030> lagging

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
no it's not it's not really lagging

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:53.710 
no it's not it's not really lagging
anywhere<00:03:47.330> quite<00:03:48.330> nice<00:03:48.540> now<00:03:50.990> let's<00:03:51.990> play

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
anywhere quite nice now let's play

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.090 
anywhere quite nice now let's play
temple<00:03:54.720> run<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.200> see<00:03:55.380> what<00:03:55.530> temple<00:03:55.860> run<00:03:55.950> is

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
temple run and see what temple run is

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.250 
temple run and see what temple run is
like<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:58.760> we<00:03:59.760> all<00:03:59.880> know<00:04:00.060> temple<00:04:00.390> run<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:01.020> takes

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
like and we all know temple run it takes

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.370 
like and we all know temple run it takes
a<00:04:01.440> little<00:04:01.650> while<00:04:01.890> to<00:04:01.950> open<00:04:02.489> up<00:04:03.200> you<00:04:04.200> know<00:04:04.320> to

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
a little while to open up you know to

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.910 
a little while to open up you know to
lower<00:04:04.650> Temple<00:04:05.040> Run<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.900> this<00:04:06.900> is<00:04:07.050> just<00:04:07.260> 800

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
lower Temple Run and this is just 800

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.160 
lower Temple Run and this is just 800
megahertz<00:04:08.430> processor<00:04:08.730> so<00:04:09.390> it's<00:04:09.690> not<00:04:09.840> going<00:04:10.110> to

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
megahertz processor so it's not going to

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.250 
megahertz processor so it's not going to
be<00:04:10.260> very<00:04:10.500> fast<00:04:10.890> and<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.550> can<00:04:11.880> expect<00:04:12.269> a<00:04:12.840> little

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
be very fast and you can expect a little

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.729 
be very fast and you can expect a little
glitch<00:04:13.709> or<00:04:14.180> you<00:04:15.180> know<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:16.079> game<00:04:16.260> might<00:04:16.410> not<00:04:16.590> be

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
glitch or you know the game might not be

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.210 
glitch or you know the game might not be
as<00:04:16.890> responsive<00:04:17.579> as<00:04:17.660> you<00:04:18.660> would<00:04:18.989> see<00:04:19.680> in<00:04:19.799> more

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
as responsive as you would see in more

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:29.650 
as responsive as you would see in more
high<00:04:20.600> high-end<00:04:21.600> devices

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.990 

so<00:04:30.660> I<00:04:31.080> don't<00:04:31.949> know<00:04:32.009> if<00:04:32.099> you<00:04:32.190> can<00:04:32.310> see<00:04:32.520> this<00:04:32.699> but

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
so I don't know if you can see this but

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.839 
so I don't know if you can see this but
there<00:04:33.780> is<00:04:33.810> a<00:04:34.349> slight<00:04:34.919> lag<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.520> slight<00:04:36.240> delay<00:04:37.849> you

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
there is a slight lag a slight delay you

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.059 
there is a slight lag a slight delay you
know<00:04:39.000> in<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.389> frames<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:40.620> frames<00:04:40.860> are<00:04:41.039> not

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
know in the frames the frames are not

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:44.990 
know in the frames the frames are not
exactly<00:04:41.520> very<00:04:41.729> smooth<00:04:42.090> and<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:44.520> know<00:04:44.610> if<00:04:44.789> you

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
exactly very smooth and you know if you

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.670 
exactly very smooth and you know if you
are<00:04:45.360> one<00:04:45.569> of<00:04:45.599> those<00:04:45.870> who<00:04:46.110> wants<00:04:46.380> to<00:04:46.470> score

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
are one of those who wants to score

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.550 
are one of those who wants to score
surely<00:04:47.069> high<00:04:47.250> on<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.550> gains<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:49.110> want<00:04:49.470> to

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
surely high on the gains you want to

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.010 
surely high on the gains you want to
have<00:04:50.009> high<00:04:50.190> scores<00:04:50.580> and<00:04:50.789> keep<00:04:51.509> beating<00:04:51.900> their

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
have high scores and keep beating their

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.589 
have high scores and keep beating their
own<00:04:52.139> scores<00:04:52.669> I'm<00:04:53.669> not<00:04:53.880> sure<00:04:54.090> if<00:04:54.240> you<00:04:54.330> would<00:04:54.449> be

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
own scores I'm not sure if you would be

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.990 
own scores I'm not sure if you would be
very<00:04:54.810> happy<00:04:54.960> with<00:04:55.470> this<00:04:55.590> because<00:04:55.830> you<00:04:56.819> would

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
very happy with this because you would

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.790 
very happy with this because you would
die<00:04:57.180> quite<00:04:57.449> often<00:04:57.690> on<00:04:58.080> this<00:05:00.080> there<00:05:01.080> you<00:05:01.110> go

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
die quite often on this there you go

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.600 
die quite often on this there you go
I<00:05:01.830> mean<00:05:02.490> I'm<00:05:02.610> not<00:05:02.729> that<00:05:02.789> bad<00:05:03.090> Yuri<00:05:03.389> but<00:05:04.610> you

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
I mean I'm not that bad Yuri but you

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.730 
I mean I'm not that bad Yuri but you
know<00:05:05.729> it's<00:05:06.240> just<00:05:06.479> that<00:05:06.630> it's<00:05:07.080> not<00:05:07.229> exactly

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
know it's just that it's not exactly

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.350 
know it's just that it's not exactly
very<00:05:07.830> smooth<00:05:08.280> so<00:05:10.039> yeah<00:05:11.039> Angry<00:05:11.970> Birds<00:05:12.210> was

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
very smooth so yeah Angry Birds was

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.290 
very smooth so yeah Angry Birds was
playing<00:05:12.630> quite<00:05:12.900> well<00:05:12.930> and<00:05:13.729> you<00:05:14.729> know<00:05:14.819> if<00:05:15.000> if

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
playing quite well and you know if if

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.180 
playing quite well and you know if if
you<00:05:15.449> played<00:05:15.780> games<00:05:15.960> like<00:05:16.139> dragonfly<00:05:16.830> or

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
you played games like dragonfly or

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.100 
you played games like dragonfly or
something<00:05:17.580> I<00:05:17.759> think<00:05:18.330> it<00:05:18.419> will<00:05:18.479> be<00:05:18.599> fine<00:05:18.840> but

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
something I think it will be fine but

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.740 
something I think it will be fine but
for<00:05:19.530> this<00:05:19.710> particular<00:05:20.400> game<00:05:20.580> Temple<00:05:21.000> Run<00:05:21.120> the

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
for this particular game Temple Run the

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.830 
for this particular game Temple Run the
frame<00:05:22.229> rate<00:05:22.470> was<00:05:23.220> not<00:05:23.400> very<00:05:23.639> high<00:05:23.849> and<00:05:24.120> there

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
frame rate was not very high and there

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.360 
frame rate was not very high and there
would<00:05:25.050> be<00:05:25.080> some<00:05:25.380> skipping<00:05:25.770> of<00:05:25.889> frames<00:05:26.130> and

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
would be some skipping of frames and

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.300 
would be some skipping of frames and
that<00:05:26.490> would<00:05:26.669> not<00:05:27.330> really<00:05:27.630> be<00:05:28.229> good<00:05:28.620> in<00:05:29.220> the

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
that would not really be good in the

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.730 
that would not really be good in the
sense<00:05:29.520> you<00:05:29.610> would<00:05:30.080> you<00:05:31.080> know<00:05:31.199> not<00:05:31.229> be<00:05:31.500> able<00:05:31.650> to

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
sense you would you know not be able to

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.170 
sense you would you know not be able to
play<00:05:31.860> the<00:05:31.979> game<00:05:32.130> quite<00:05:32.430> well<00:05:32.750> so<00:05:34.759> again<00:05:35.759> it<00:05:36.000> is

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
play the game quite well so again it is

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.129 
play the game quite well so again it is
a<00:05:36.360> mid-range<00:05:36.659> device<00:05:37.199> you<00:05:37.500> know<00:05:37.590> and<00:05:38.870> it's<00:05:39.870> not

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
a mid-range device you know and it's not

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.870 
a mid-range device you know and it's not
exactly<00:05:40.409> a<00:05:40.800> very<00:05:40.979> high-performing<00:05:41.639> device

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
exactly a very high-performing device

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.520 
exactly a very high-performing device
it's<00:05:42.060> just<00:05:42.300> a<00:05:42.389> 2<00:05:42.449> in<00:05:42.599> megahertz<00:05:42.870> of<00:05:43.139> processor

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
it's just a 2 in megahertz of processor

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.230 
it's just a 2 in megahertz of processor
and<00:05:43.789> 512mb<00:05:44.789> of<00:05:44.969> RAM<00:05:45.360> so<00:05:46.169> and<00:05:46.680> it's<00:05:47.490> quite<00:05:47.729> it's

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
and 512mb of RAM so and it's quite it's

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.659 
and 512mb of RAM so and it's quite it's
it's<00:05:48.659> its<00:05:49.229> price<00:05:49.500> according<00:05:50.009> to<00:05:50.130> that<00:05:50.280> I<00:05:50.520> mean

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
it's its price according to that I mean

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.370 
it's its price according to that I mean
it's<00:05:50.820> totally<00:05:51.000> avoids<00:05:51.479> the<00:05:51.630> price<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:52.080> device

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
it's totally avoids the price the device

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.700 
it's totally avoids the price the device
but<00:05:53.099> it's<00:05:53.280> just<00:05:53.430> that<00:05:53.669> you<00:05:54.300> know<00:05:55.289> add<00:05:55.469> these

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
but it's just that you know add these

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.890 
but it's just that you know add these
that<00:05:56.430> these<00:05:56.639> heart<00:05:56.880> broken<00:05:57.150> at<00:05:57.419> this<00:05:57.599> hardware

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
that these heart broken at this hardware

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.870 
that these heart broken at this hardware
configuration<00:05:58.440> it's<00:05:59.099> going<00:05:59.430> to<00:05:59.550> be<00:05:59.639> a<00:05:59.669> little

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
configuration it's going to be a little

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.700 
configuration it's going to be a little
it's<00:06:00.599> going<00:06:00.750> to<00:06:00.810> be<00:06:00.870> a<00:06:00.900> fight<00:06:01.169> if<00:06:01.349> you<00:06:01.380> want<00:06:01.650> to

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
it's going to be a fight if you want to

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.770 
it's going to be a fight if you want to
play<00:06:01.860> high<00:06:02.039> def<00:06:02.219> games<00:06:02.490> or<00:06:02.759> games<00:06:03.690> that

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
play high def games or games that

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.249 
play high def games or games that
require<00:06:04.139> more<00:06:04.380> power<00:06:04.580> so<00:06:05.750> yeah<00:06:06.750> I<00:06:06.780> mean<00:06:07.080> you

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
require more power so yeah I mean you

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:08.480 
require more power so yeah I mean you
can<00:06:07.409> play<00:06:07.560> Angry<00:06:07.650> Birds<00:06:07.830> you<00:06:08.130> can<00:06:08.310> play

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
can play Angry Birds you can play

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.719 
can play Angry Birds you can play
something<00:06:08.729> like<00:06:08.930> dragonfly<00:06:09.930> or<00:06:10.610> you<00:06:11.610> know

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
something like dragonfly or you know

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.480 
something like dragonfly or you know
there's<00:06:12.509> a<00:06:12.630> game<00:06:12.949> sprinkler<00:06:13.949> or<00:06:14.009> something

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
there's a game sprinkler or something

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.790 
there's a game sprinkler or something
else<00:06:14.669> sprinkled<00:06:15.449> so<00:06:15.900> I<00:06:15.930> think<00:06:16.229> those<00:06:16.469> games

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
else sprinkled so I think those games

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.200 
else sprinkled so I think those games
would<00:06:16.860> be<00:06:16.919> fine<00:06:17.219> but<00:06:17.430> something<00:06:17.789> more<00:06:18.030> dynamic

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
would be fine but something more dynamic

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.050 
would be fine but something more dynamic
like<00:06:18.719> Temple<00:06:19.050> Run<00:06:19.400> does<00:06:20.400> require<00:06:20.639> heavy

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
like Temple Run does require heavy

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.050 
like Temple Run does require heavy
processing<00:06:21.630> and<00:06:21.840> hence<00:06:22.219> you<00:06:23.219> know<00:06:23.340> maybe<00:06:23.550> not

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
processing and hence you know maybe not

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.730 
processing and hence you know maybe not
perfect<00:06:24.479> on<00:06:24.599> this<00:06:24.690> device

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
perfect on this device

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.530 
perfect on this device
so<00:06:26.280> that's<00:06:26.460> it<00:06:26.610> about<00:06:26.670> the<00:06:26.970> display<00:06:27.330> and<00:06:27.450> the

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
so that's it about the display and the

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.230 
so that's it about the display and the
gaming<00:06:27.900> on<00:06:28.110> the<00:06:28.380> lg<00:06:28.680> optimus<00:06:28.710> l5<00:06:29.280> there<00:06:30.120> are

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
gaming on the lg optimus l5 there are

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.700 
gaming on the lg optimus l5 there are
other<00:06:30.390> videos<00:06:30.810> on<00:06:30.990> the<00:06:31.110> hardware<00:06:31.410> body

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
other videos on the hardware body

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.160 
other videos on the hardware body
designed<00:06:32.160> the<00:06:32.400> camera<00:06:32.790> the<00:06:32.940> interface<00:06:33.360> and<00:06:33.660> so

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170 
designed the camera the interface and so

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.780 
designed the camera the interface and so
on<00:06:34.350> so<00:06:34.590> state<00:06:34.800> you<00:06:34.980> will<00:06:35.130> then<00:06:35.280> look<00:06:35.460> at<00:06:35.610> more

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
on so state you will then look at more

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.300 
on so state you will then look at more
videos<00:06:36.540> due<00:06:37.260> with<00:06:37.440> the<00:06:37.470> review<00:06:37.860> at<00:06:38.010> movies

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
videos due with the review at movies
