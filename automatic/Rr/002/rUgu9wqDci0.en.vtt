00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:07.290
 good afternoon my loved ones are glad here 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.730
 I greet you on my channel and 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.009
 Today I have this 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.590
 Such a topic was a lot of cove request and I 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.500
 I want to tell you how to distinguish 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.960
 natural essential oils and 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:26.820
 synthetic i went for a few 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.250
 lectures on this and can with you this 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.189
 share so here i have here 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.489
 natural essential oil i practically 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.540
 probably 99 percent sure it's a hundred 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.489
 percent natural essential oil 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.090
 Of course there is no guarantee but 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.390
 at least everything we were told here 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.140
 in this oil let's 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.610
 let's start with the packaging the packaging should be 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.920
 it's dark to him 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.969
 essential oil and at least 50 percent 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.330
 it should be exactly the second 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:09.060
 real butter is like this 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.280
 how to say this pipka something not pipka but 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.630
 at least she is there 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.270
 It's such a long somewhere takes 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.869
 there is such a space and like this 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.930
 looks like 2 how you can determine it 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.650
 you should put on paper on any 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.600
 paper and if you have it naturally 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.210
 grease stains do not stay just be 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.540
 such a stain then it dries and no 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:41.729
 grease stains nothing like this 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.619
 should be 3 probably this is the price when you 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.479
 buy a big bubble and here 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.170
 written entirely natural oil 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.899
 and it costs there for example 100 rubles 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.600
 also have a 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:02:00.450
 think about it also if you 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:03.030
 have a very nose like that 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.830
 reacts to all smells too 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.100
 understand that is 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:12.090
 if you put a drop of oil on 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.940
 for example, it will be one at the beginning 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.690
 smell then second then 3 that is there 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.740
 a lot of components and it is at different times 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.010
 plays differently and plus for example here 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.950
 I use this oil as a refresher 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:34.140
 on often put a bit 2 on 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:37.200
 some sachet layer and this smell 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:41.070
 he keeps well for three or four days that is 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.790
 such a light good smelling odor 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.580
 as a rule, the packaging is worth the time 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.560
 storage and recommendations that is necessary 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.110
 store if you opened it you need 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.600
 store or refrigerate or term 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.230
 storage there is quite small because 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.380
 well it spoils quickly also if you see 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.090
 title and written for example 100 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.030
 percent natural essential oil 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.880
 peach strawberries or some kind there 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.280
 fruit then this does not happen this is all 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.340
 synthetics 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.760
 fruit is no essential oil 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.690
 there can also be so 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.690
 guess forgot add that 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.209
 citrus is essential oil and there is 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.920
 still such that if you see it is written 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.280
 100% natural essential oil 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.430
 from lotus it too 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.770
 fake because all the same lotus we have 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.990
 listed in the red book and its not 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.540
 grows industrial scale to 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.400
 make oil of it in order to 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.210
 make a mass need actually 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.370
 large plantations and this should not be 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.370
 that is, it is synthetic 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.190
 also need to think about here for example 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:02.230
 worth selling essential oils and about them there 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:04.770
 the difference is not so small 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.520
 maybe because some 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.110
 essential oils are made from plants that 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.300
 specially grow some plants 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.420
 there is mined somewhere high up there in the mountains 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:20.640
 some there are some hard to reach 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:26.050
 places and therefore the price still has to 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:28.120
 be different on different essential oils 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.250
 And finally, I want to say that if 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.070
 the manufacturer on the package writes for 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:37.150
 external use or one hundred percent 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.660
 there is some cosmetic essential oil 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.540
 and and there is such a name 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:47.230
 passed a hybrid on which she which 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:50.620
 written in small letters it too 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.750
 Synthetics I hope these small 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.760
 Komi council helped you to get out 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.860
 real 100% essential oil 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:01.720
 which will serve you on the right with which 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.670
 you will benefit from the love which 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.980
 you will like it by the way 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:11.170
 Egyptian geranium and written one hundred 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.020
 percent essential oil small volume 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:17.290
 chick here is 10 milliliters but since she 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:20.890
 very concentrated I already use 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.630
 and instantly more than six months and met 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.150
 You see half because you need 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.870
 just one two droplets and no longer 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.780
 need so hope you helped everyone 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.200
 Thank you all for your attention. 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.660
 to and by the way please write me what 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.450
 Essential oils you like where you buy 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.240
 what are you using the last for 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:45.870
 time this topic is very interesting to me and I 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.080
 very fond of essential oils all so far 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.080
