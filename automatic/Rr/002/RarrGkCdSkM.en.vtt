appear one is for simple prefix we've
got<00:00:44.129> our<00:00:44.250> config<00:00:44.670> yml<00:00:45.450> file<00:00:45.750> here<00:00:46.020> which<00:00:46.680> is

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
got our config yml file here which is

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.959 
got our config yml file here which is
where<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.129> our<00:00:47.789> add<00:00:48.719> our<00:00:48.930> prefixes<00:00:49.440> basically

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
where we our add our prefixes basically

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.299 
where we our add our prefixes basically
so<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.390> want<00:00:51.570> if<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.920> open<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.219> with

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
so you want if if you open it with

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.130 
so you want if if you open it with
notepad<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:54.030> generally<00:00:54.719> end<00:00:54.870> up<00:00:54.989> with

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
notepad you generally end up with

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.350 
notepad you generally end up with
something<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.920> which<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.670> not<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.210> good

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
something like this which is not a good

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.599 
something like this which is not a good
idea<00:00:57.510> I'd<00:00:57.960> recommend<00:00:58.440> notepad<00:00:58.829> plus<00:00:59.070> plus<00:00:59.100> on

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
idea I'd recommend notepad plus plus on

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.670 
idea I'd recommend notepad plus plus on
windows<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.840> don't<00:01:01.289> know<00:01:01.379> about<00:01:01.469> other

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
windows that is I don't know about other

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.349 
windows that is I don't know about other
offering<00:01:02.039> systems<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.520> anyways<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:03.210> is

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
offering systems that anyways this is

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.230 
offering systems that anyways this is
what<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.600> should<00:01:03.840> look<00:01:03.899> like<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.820> if<00:01:05.820> you

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
what it should look like and if you

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.000 
what it should look like and if you
don't<00:01:06.390> know<00:01:06.450> what<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.630> yml<00:01:07.049> file<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.500> basically

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
don't know what a yml file is basically

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.450 
don't know what a yml file is basically
it's<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:09.060> certain<00:01:09.930> way<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.470> arranging<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:11.100> text

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
it's a certain way of arranging a text

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.710 
it's a certain way of arranging a text
document<00:01:12.229> so<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.650> kind<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.600> guess<00:01:15.600> you

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
document so you have kind of I guess you

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.780 
document so you have kind of I guess you
could<00:01:15.840> call<00:01:15.960> them<00:01:16.080> headings<00:01:16.500> like<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.430> group

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
could call them headings like this group

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.249 
could call them headings like this group
here<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.180> then<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> colon<00:01:18.570> after<00:01:18.810> Widgery<00:01:19.170> is

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
here and then a colon after Widgery is

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.450 
here and then a colon after Widgery is
an<00:01:19.380> important<00:01:19.710> then<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.830> start<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.130> new<00:01:20.159> line

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
an important then you start a new line

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.670 
an important then you start a new line
and<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.180> four<00:01:21.509> spaces<00:01:22.080> for<00:01:22.350> an<00:01:22.409> indent

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
and you have four spaces for an indent

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.080 
and you have four spaces for an indent
you<00:01:22.770> don't<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> tab<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.549> four<00:01:23.759> spaces

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
you don't have a tab it's four spaces

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.539 
you don't have a tab it's four spaces
that's<00:01:24.390> important<00:01:24.840> by<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:24.990> way<00:01:25.490> anyway<00:01:26.490> so

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
that's important by the way anyway so

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.609 
that's important by the way anyway so
I'll<00:01:26.790> move<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.330> from<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.780> got<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.290> this

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
I'll move on from that so we got in this

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.140 
I'll move on from that so we got in this
default<00:01:29.040> configuration<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.820> three

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
default configuration we have three

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.149 
default configuration we have three

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
group files we have added an open member

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.289 
group files we have added an open member
now<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.400> don't<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.880> use<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.150> can

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
now you don't have to use this you can

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.990 
now you don't have to use this you can
get<00:01:33.479> rid<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.659> them<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.320> can<00:01:34.470> rename<00:01:34.770> them<00:01:35.009> I'm

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
back this four times and then we call it

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.910 
back this four times and then we call it
cool<00:01:44.490> cats<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.630> then<00:01:45.899> we<00:01:45.990> remember<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.710> put<00:01:46.829> in

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
cool cats and then we remember to put in

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.880 
cool cats and then we remember to put in
the<00:01:47.009> colon<00:01:47.340> newline<00:01:48.149> one<00:01:48.780> two<00:01:48.990> three<00:01:49.320> four<00:01:49.649> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the colon newline one two three four and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.630 
the colon newline one two three four and
type<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.549> prefix<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.270> we<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:53.549> a

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
type in prefix and we have to have a

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.850 
type in prefix and we have to have a
single<00:01:54.030> inverted<00:01:54.540> comma<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.560> we

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
single inverted comma like that and we

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.380 
single inverted comma like that and we
can<00:01:55.979> write<00:01:56.130> our<00:01:56.250> prefix<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.820> use<00:01:56.939> colors

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
can write our prefix you can use colors

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.080 
can write our prefix you can use colors
the<00:01:57.990> colors<00:01:58.290> range<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.369> way<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.549> do<00:01:59.759> colors

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
the colors range the way you do colors

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.929 
the colors range the way you do colors
in<00:02:00.240> Minecraft<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:01.770> with<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> ampersand<00:02:02.670> sign

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
in Minecraft is with the ampersand sign

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.889 
in Minecraft is with the ampersand sign
like<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.659> then<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.320> can<00:02:04.409> use<00:02:04.649> A<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.729> F<00:02:05.969> so

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
like this and then you can use A to F so

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.279 
like this and then you can use A to F so
basically<00:02:07.200> ABCDE<00:02:07.950> F<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.759> then<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.780> numeric

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
basically ABCDE F and then the numeric

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.660 
basically ABCDE F and then the numeric
values<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:11.009> one

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
values of one

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.270 
values of one
and<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.970> nine<00:02:12.349> basically<00:02:13.349> so<00:02:13.890> one<00:02:14.130> two<00:02:14.250> three

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
and to nine basically so one two three

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.130 
and to nine basically so one two three
four<00:02:14.520> five<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.120> basically<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.780> can<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:15.930> look

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
four five so basically you can just look

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.780 
four five so basically you can just look
them<00:02:16.200> up<00:02:16.380> if<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.560> go<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.950> thread<00:02:17.280> there<00:02:17.550> we

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
them up if you go to the thread there we

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.309 
them up if you go to the thread there we
have<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> table<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.750> concludes<00:02:19.110> all<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
have a table that concludes all the

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.260 
have a table that concludes all the
colors<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.739> what<00:02:19.830> they<00:02:19.950> are<00:02:19.980> for<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:21.150> I'll

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
colors and what they are for this I'll

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.300 
colors and what they are for this I'll
use<00:02:21.300> six<00:02:21.750> which<00:02:21.959> is<00:02:22.080> kind<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.410> Goldy<00:02:22.950> yellow

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
use six which is kind of a Goldy yellow

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.140 
use six which is kind of a Goldy yellow
color<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.849> go<00:02:24.420> cat<00:02:25.290> with<00:02:26.099> a<00:02:26.130> K<00:02:26.370> because<00:02:26.819> it's

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
color I go cat with a K because it's

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.780 
color I go cat with a K because it's
cool<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.470> my<00:02:28.470> suffix<00:02:28.920> on<00:02:29.160> this<00:02:29.400> group<00:02:29.610> is

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
cool and my suffix on this group is

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.520 
cool and my suffix on this group is
going<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.000> be<00:02:30.090> like<00:02:30.900> if<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.200> don't<00:02:31.380> want<00:02:31.500> a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
going to be like if you don't want a

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.809 
going to be like if you don't want a
suffix<00:02:31.860> or<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.010> don't<00:02:32.069> want<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.280> prefix<00:02:32.580> maybe

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
suffix or you don't want to prefix maybe

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.220 
suffix or you don't want to prefix maybe
you<00:02:32.910> only<00:02:33.060> want<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.330> suffix<00:02:33.660> then<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.080> just

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
you only want a suffix then you just

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.350 
you only want a suffix then you just
leave<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.380> blank<00:02:34.620> like<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.010> pretty<00:02:35.250> much<00:02:35.430> my

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
leave a blank like that pretty much my

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.890 
leave a blank like that pretty much my
suffix<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:37.020> going<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.230> be<00:02:37.580> go<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.900> or

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
suffix and this is going to be go and or

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.809 
suffix and this is going to be go and or
let's<00:02:40.530> go<00:02:40.620> with<00:02:40.739> e<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.190> don't<00:02:41.430> even<00:02:41.519> know<00:02:41.670> what<00:02:41.790> a

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
let's go with e I don't even know what a

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.850 
let's go with e I don't even know what a
is<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.510> then<00:02:42.870> we<00:02:42.930> go<00:02:43.019> star<00:02:43.349> start<00:02:43.650> just

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
is and then we go star start just

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.400 
is and then we go star start just
because<00:02:43.920> we<00:02:44.130> can<00:02:44.370> anyway<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:46.080> can<00:02:46.230> figure

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
because we can anyway so you can figure

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.199 
because we can anyway so you can figure
that<00:02:46.650> file<00:02:47.040> however<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.610> want<00:02:47.819> whatever<00:02:48.090> you

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
want to do with it and then the way we

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.180 
want to do with it and then the way we
apply<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.150> prefix<00:02:51.660> our<00:02:51.810> users<00:02:52.380> is<00:02:52.500> very<00:02:52.739> into

apply the prefix our users is very into

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.160 
apply the prefix our users is very into
our<00:02:53.310> plug-in<00:02:53.670> manager<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.239> you'll<00:02:54.450> see<00:02:54.569> yml

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
our plug-in manager and you'll see yml

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.600 
our plug-in manager and you'll see yml
file<00:02:55.350> as<00:02:55.500> well<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:57.060> then<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:58.049> this<00:02:58.890> this

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
file as well and then in this this

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.340 
file as well and then in this this
permissions<00:03:00.030> one<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.390> see<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.810> nodes<00:03:01.049> are

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
permissions one you see the nodes are

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.080 
permissions one you see the nodes are
underneath<00:03:01.860> permissions<00:03:02.549> we<00:03:02.940> have<00:03:03.030> a

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
underneath permissions we have a

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.059 
underneath permissions we have a
permissions<00:03:03.510> area<00:03:03.780> then<00:03:04.500> all<00:03:04.739> we<00:03:04.830> have<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:04.950> do

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
permissions area then all we have to do

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.470 
permissions area then all we have to do
is<00:03:05.160> add<00:03:05.280> in<00:03:05.400> our<00:03:05.489> permissions<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:06.090> for<00:03:06.299> group

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
you name it is the permission so in this

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.770 
you name it is the permission so in this
case<00:03:18.209> for<00:03:18.390> admin<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.840> would<00:03:18.930> be<00:03:19.049> simple<00:03:19.709> prefix

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
case for admin it would be simple prefix

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.190 
case for admin it would be simple prefix
admin<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:21.959> let<00:03:22.380> me<00:03:22.440> go<00:03:22.560> true<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:25.019> will

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
group here I'll be fine

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.930 
group here I'll be fine
oh<00:03:30.350> that's<00:03:31.350> bad<00:03:31.620> that's<00:03:31.859> wrong<00:03:32.489> formatting

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
oh that's bad that's wrong formatting

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.910

whole<00:03:36.299> heap<00:03:36.480> of<00:03:36.600> trouble<00:03:36.859> so<00:03:37.859> I'm<00:03:37.920> going<00:03:38.070> to

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
whole heap of trouble so I'm going to

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.750 
whole heap of trouble so I'm going to
call<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.660> cool<00:03:39.660> cats<00:03:40.019> and<00:03:40.579> then<00:03:41.579> the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
call this cool cats and then the

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.910 
call this cool cats and then the
permission<00:03:42.120> mode<00:03:42.269> for<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:42.570> one<00:03:42.810> if<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.769> will

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
permission mode for this one if you will

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.580 
permission mode for this one if you will
notice<00:03:44.130> is<00:03:44.459> actually<00:03:45.209> over<00:03:45.329> over<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:46.140> capital

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
notice is actually over over to capital

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.400 
notice is actually over over to capital
C's<00:03:46.769> and<00:03:46.950> capitals<00:03:47.430> are<00:03:48.079> important<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.140> note

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
C's and capitals are important to note

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.910 
C's and capitals are important to note
by<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.769> way<00:03:49.859> so<00:03:50.700> in<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.540> one<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:51.810> was<00:03:51.959> simple

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
by the way so in this one it was simple

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.370 
by the way so in this one it was simple
prefix<00:03:53.850> dot<00:03:54.720> cool<00:03:55.500> cat<00:03:57.079> true

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
prefix dot cool cat true

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.400 
prefix dot cool cat true
I<00:03:58.410> think<00:03:58.620> it's<00:03:58.739> cool<00:03:58.859> cat<00:03:59.040> all<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.250> cool<00:03:59.430> cats

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
I think it's cool cat all the cool cats

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.319 
I think it's cool cat all the cool cats
cool<00:04:01.410> cats<00:04:01.709> sorry<00:04:02.250> I<00:04:02.280> forgot<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.640> ass<00:04:02.760> but

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
cool cats sorry I forgot the ass but

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.699 
cool cats sorry I forgot the ass but
anyway<00:04:03.510> that's<00:04:03.810> basically<00:04:04.230> how<00:04:04.440> it's<00:04:04.590> going

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
anyway that's basically how it's going

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.559 
anyway that's basically how it's going
to<00:04:04.769> work<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.640> just<00:04:05.670> give<00:04:06.060> them<00:04:06.239> the

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
to work and you just give them the

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.199 
to work and you just give them the
prefix<00:04:07.290> like<00:04:08.069> simple<00:04:08.400> free<00:04:08.519> fix<00:04:08.790> dot<00:04:09.030> the

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
prefix like simple free fix dot the

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.330 
prefix like simple free fix dot the
group<00:04:09.389> name<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.630> then<00:04:09.959> true<00:04:10.260> essentially<00:04:11.250> it

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
group name and then true essentially it

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.190 
group name and then true essentially it
is<00:04:11.459> how<00:04:11.579> it<00:04:11.670> works<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:12.090> you<00:04:12.600> just<00:04:12.750> save<00:04:12.959> both

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
is how it works and you just save both

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.159 
is how it works and you just save both
files<00:04:13.579> reload<00:04:14.579> the<00:04:14.700> server<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.269> then

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
files reload the server and then

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.469 
files reload the server and then
whenever<00:04:16.470> user<00:04:16.919> logs<00:04:17.250> into<00:04:17.549> your<00:04:17.910> server<00:04:18.359> I

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
whenever user logs into your server I

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.020 
whenever user logs into your server I
had<00:04:18.870> minecraft<00:04:19.350> on<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.590> desktop<00:04:20.159> there<00:04:20.640> it<00:04:20.729> is

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
had minecraft on the desktop there it is

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.089 
had minecraft on the desktop there it is
when<00:04:21.720> a<00:04:21.750> user<00:04:21.870> logs<00:04:22.049> into<00:04:22.349> your<00:04:22.500> server<00:04:22.710> the

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
when a user logs into your server the

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.190 
when a user logs into your server the
disk<00:04:23.580> their<00:04:23.760> display<00:04:24.060> name<00:04:24.090> will<00:04:24.360> be<00:04:24.450> changed

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
disk their display name will be changed

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.990 
disk their display name will be changed
and<00:04:25.290> I<00:04:25.650> will<00:04:25.740> only<00:04:25.890> change<00:04:26.250> on<00:04:26.580> login<00:04:27.830> so<00:04:29.000> yeah

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
and I will only change on login so yeah

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.640 
and I will only change on login so yeah
so<00:04:30.330> basically<00:04:30.630> if<00:04:30.930> you<00:04:30.990> change<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:31.290> prefix

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
so basically if you change the prefix

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.010 
so basically if you change the prefix
while<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:31.920> server<00:04:32.130> is<00:04:32.280> running<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:33.780> user

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
while the server is running the user

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.000 
while the server is running the user
will<00:04:34.170> have<00:04:34.260> to<00:04:34.350> do<00:04:34.470> is<00:04:34.530> connect<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:34.920> reconnect

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
will have to do is connect and reconnect

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.490 
will have to do is connect and reconnect

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.760 
the group yes it is I should have named
these<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.090> same<00:05:12.330> so<00:05:13.020> it's<00:05:13.050> not<00:05:13.200> I<00:05:13.260> do<00:05:13.410> a<00:05:13.440> reload

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
these the same so it's not I do a reload

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.410 
these the same so it's not I do a reload
again<00:05:13.910> obviously<00:05:14.910> you<00:05:15.000> want<00:05:15.120> to<00:05:15.150> set<00:05:15.330> these

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
again obviously you want to set these

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.330 
again obviously you want to set these
all<00:05:15.630> up<00:05:15.780> before<00:05:16.200> you<00:05:16.380> so<00:05:16.920> you<00:05:17.010> don't<00:05:17.160> have<00:05:17.220> to

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
all up before you so you don't have to

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.920 
all up before you so you don't have to
keep<00:05:17.490> reloading<00:05:17.760> the<00:05:18.150> server<00:05:18.390> every<00:05:18.720> five

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
keep reloading the server every five

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.200 
keep reloading the server every five
seconds<00:05:19.380> but<00:05:19.590> I<00:05:19.620> mean<00:05:19.830> it's<00:05:20.460> really<00:05:20.730> easy<00:05:21.000> to

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
seconds but I mean it's really easy to

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.620 
seconds but I mean it's really easy to
do<00:05:21.420> and<00:05:21.690> it's<00:05:22.380> quite<00:05:22.710> flexible<00:05:22.980> they<00:05:23.940> are<00:05:23.970> cat

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
do and it's quite flexible they are cat

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.830 
do and it's quite flexible they are cat
flabbily<00:05:25.260> key<00:05:25.440> star<00:05:26.010> star<00:05:26.310> oh<00:05:27.300> yeah<00:05:27.660> that's

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
flabbily key star star oh yeah that's

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.910 
flabbily key star star oh yeah that's
another<00:05:27.990> thing<00:05:28.080> I<00:05:28.170> meant<00:05:28.320> to<00:05:28.380> a<00:05:28.410> mental<00:05:28.890> note

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
another thing I meant to a mental note

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.890 
another thing I meant to a mental note
if<00:05:29.190> we<00:05:29.370> go<00:05:29.550> like<00:05:29.730> this<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:30.330> go<00:05:30.390> back<00:05:30.450> into<00:05:30.720> our

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
if we go like this and go back into our

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.380 
if we go like this and go back into our
simple<00:05:31.260> prefix<00:05:31.620> configuration<00:05:32.390> you'll

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
simple prefix configuration you'll

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.330 
simple prefix configuration you'll
notice<00:05:33.630> this<00:05:33.750> one<00:05:33.930> has<00:05:33.960> and<00:05:34.320> F<00:05:34.560> after<00:05:35.010> it<00:05:35.130> that

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
notice this one has and F after it that

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.460 
notice this one has and F after it that
means<00:05:36.000> because<00:05:36.510> if<00:05:36.720> you<00:05:36.810> don't<00:05:36.930> put<00:05:37.200> a<00:05:37.230> color

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
means because if you don't put a color

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.380 
means because if you don't put a color
code<00:05:37.710> after<00:05:38.040> it<00:05:38.130> will<00:05:38.370> make<00:05:38.550> the<00:05:39.030> user's<00:05:39.360> name

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
code after it will make the user's name

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.870 
code after it will make the user's name
the<00:05:40.230> same<00:05:40.440> color<00:05:40.710> that<00:05:40.950> you've<00:05:41.070> set<00:05:41.310> it<00:05:41.340> pretty

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
the same color that you've set it pretty

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.090 
the same color that you've set it pretty
much<00:05:41.970> so<00:05:42.690> that<00:05:42.960> meant<00:05:43.140> that<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:43.770> way<00:05:43.890> the

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
much so that meant that the way the

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.980 
much so that meant that the way the
reason<00:05:44.310> I<00:05:44.370> do<00:05:44.430> that<00:05:44.490> is<00:05:44.640> because<00:05:44.910> if<00:05:45.240> you<00:05:45.420> if

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
reason I do that is because if you if

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.120 
reason I do that is because if you if
you<00:05:46.110> don't<00:05:46.170> want<00:05:46.350> to<00:05:46.410> prefix<00:05:46.680> at<00:05:46.800> all<00:05:46.890> maybe

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
you don't want to prefix at all maybe

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.650 
you don't want to prefix at all maybe
you<00:05:47.190> just<00:05:47.280> want<00:05:47.460> to<00:05:47.520> color<00:05:47.700> so<00:05:48.300> maybe<00:05:48.450> I<00:05:48.540> just

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
you just want to color so maybe I just

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.080 
you just want to color so maybe I just
want<00:05:48.840> six<00:05:49.230> sir

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
want six sir

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.990 
want six sir
that<00:05:51.090> means<00:05:51.300> I<00:05:51.540> will<00:05:51.780> be<00:05:52.020> a<00:05:52.580> color<00:05:53.580> I<00:05:53.670> forgot

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
that means I will be a color I forgot

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.490 
that means I will be a color I forgot
what<00:05:54.120> color<00:05:54.300> it<00:05:54.420> was<00:05:54.450> now<00:05:54.720> but<00:05:55.170> if<00:05:55.230> we<00:05:55.290> go<00:05:55.350> back

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
what color it was now but if we go back

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.620 
what color it was now but if we go back
here<00:05:56.120> we'll<00:05:57.120> see<00:05:58.430> that<00:05:59.430> now<00:05:59.670> my<00:05:59.700> name<00:06:00.060> is<00:06:00.330> a

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
here we'll see that now my name is a

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.800 
here we'll see that now my name is a
Goldy<00:06:01.320> yellow<00:06:01.860> color<00:06:02.220> and<00:06:02.490> I<00:06:03.480> don't<00:06:03.540> have<00:06:03.780> a

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
Goldy yellow color and I don't have a

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.330 
Goldy yellow color and I don't have a
prefix<00:06:04.170> but<00:06:04.260> my<00:06:04.380> name<00:06:04.530> color<00:06:04.740> has<00:06:04.920> changed<00:06:05.100> so

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
prefix but my name color has changed so

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.330 
prefix but my name color has changed so
I<00:06:05.370> mean<00:06:05.550> it's<00:06:05.730> useful<00:06:06.000> for<00:06:06.030> that<00:06:06.240> anyways<00:06:07.340> so

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
I mean it's useful for that anyways so

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.280 
I mean it's useful for that anyways so
that<00:06:08.370> that's<00:06:08.790> good<00:06:08.940> for<00:06:08.970> that<00:06:09.150> for<00:06:10.020> just<00:06:10.140> just

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
that that's good for that for just just

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.590 
that that's good for that for just just
connect<00:06:10.650> now<00:06:10.830> so<00:06:11.160> basically<00:06:11.550> this<00:06:12.270> is<00:06:12.330> your

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
connect now so basically this is your

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.330 
connect now so basically this is your
simple<00:06:12.900> prefix<00:06:13.290> configuration<00:06:13.950> file<00:06:14.130> where

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
simple prefix configuration file where

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.340 
simple prefix configuration file where
you<00:06:14.430> set<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:14.640> groups<00:06:15.030> and<00:06:15.240> the<00:06:15.810> prefix<00:06:16.140> or

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.650 
you set the groups and the prefix or
suffix<00:06:16.380> and<00:06:17.070> then<00:06:17.910> in<00:06:18.150> the<00:06:18.240> configuration

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
suffix and then in the configuration

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.330 
suffix and then in the configuration
file<00:06:18.990> of<00:06:19.170> your<00:06:19.440> permissions<00:06:19.860> manager<00:06:20.190> you

file of your permissions manager you

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.550 
file of your permissions manager you
just<00:06:20.490> add<00:06:20.580> the<00:06:20.880> node<00:06:21.120> simple<00:06:21.870> free<00:06:22.080> fix<00:06:22.350> and

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
just add the node simple free fix and

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.340 
just add the node simple free fix and
dot<00:06:22.980> group<00:06:23.400> name<00:06:23.610> true<00:06:24.120> that's<00:06:24.690> it<00:06:24.990> I<00:06:25.140> hope

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
dot group name true that's it I hope

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.520 
dot group name true that's it I hope
this<00:06:25.500> helped<00:06:25.770> you<00:06:25.830> guys<00:06:25.920> Thanks
