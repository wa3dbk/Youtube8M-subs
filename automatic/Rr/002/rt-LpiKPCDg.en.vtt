so<00:00:01.979> in<00:00:02.070> this<00:00:02.159> video<00:00:02.310> we're<00:00:02.700> going<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.909> show<00:00:03.149> you

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
so in this video we're going to show you

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.480 
so in this video we're going to show you
the<00:00:03.360> setup<00:00:03.659> for<00:00:03.929> our<00:00:03.990> new<00:00:04.410> talus<00:00:04.920> system<00:00:05.310> which

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
the setup for our new talus system which

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.120 
the setup for our new talus system which
stands<00:00:05.879> for<00:00:05.940> tally<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.480> iris<00:00:06.870> this<00:00:07.770> has<00:00:07.950> been

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
stands for tally and iris this has been

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.360 
stands for tally and iris this has been
designed<00:00:08.540> to<00:00:09.540> offer<00:00:09.780> up<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.440> ability<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.860> have

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
designed to offer up the ability to have

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.270 
designed to offer up the ability to have
a<00:00:11.670> wireless<00:00:12.030> tally<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.719> also<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.559> be<00:00:13.980> able<00:00:14.160> to

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
a wireless tally and also to be able to

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.599 
a wireless tally and also to be able to
control<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.120> lens<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.529> broadcast<00:00:16.830> camera

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
control the lens of a broadcast camera

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.400 
control the lens of a broadcast camera
now<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.270> system<00:00:18.570> works<00:00:18.779> with<00:00:18.900> any<00:00:19.080> camera

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
now this system works with any camera

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.960 
now this system works with any camera
because<00:00:19.830> what<00:00:19.980> we<00:00:20.070> do<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.250> we<00:00:20.430> actually<00:00:20.550> tap

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
because what we do is we actually tap

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.870 
because what we do is we actually tap
into<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.420> lens<00:00:21.660> not<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.199> camera<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.640> gives

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
into the lens not the camera so it gives

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.080 
into the lens not the camera so it gives
the<00:00:24.029> ability<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.539> adjust<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.560> iris<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:26.250> any

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
the ability to adjust the iris of any

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.040 
the ability to adjust the iris of any
broadcast<00:00:27.390> lens<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.349> any<00:00:29.010> make<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> camera<00:00:30.050> so

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
broadcast lens on any make a camera so

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.920 
broadcast lens on any make a camera so
we'll<00:00:31.170> first<00:00:31.520> show<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.700> tally<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.690> tally

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
we'll first show you the tally the tally

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.049 
we'll first show you the tally the tally
system<00:00:34.170> works<00:00:34.710> with<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.219> receiver<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.850> top

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059

in most countries runs on 12 volts which
we<00:01:06.600> pacTel<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.260> camera<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.270> then<00:01:09.270> this

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
we pacTel have the camera and then this

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.000 
we pacTel have the camera and then this
this<00:01:09.630> cable<00:01:09.960> here<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.200> what's<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.650> down<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
this cable here is what's going down to

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.710 
this cable here is what's going down to
the<00:01:11.159> down<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> lens<00:01:11.939> which<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.240> tapping

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the down to the lens which is tapping

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.660 
the down to the lens which is tapping
into<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> iris<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> lens<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.070> allows

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
into the iris of the lens that allows

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.020 
into the iris of the lens that allows
you<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> control<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.920> this<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.340> main

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
you to control that this is the main

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.960 
you to control that this is the main
transmitter<00:01:18.600> here<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.700> would<00:01:20.700> you'll

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
transmitter here so this would you'll

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.480 
transmitter here so this would you'll
miss<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.420> studio<00:01:21.869> runs<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.830> 12<00:01:23.100> volts

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
miss it in the studio runs on 12 volts

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.340 
miss it in the studio runs on 12 volts
and<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:23.970> see<00:01:24.180> here's<00:01:24.509> where<00:01:24.810> we<00:01:24.930> tap<00:01:25.170> into

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
and you can see here's where we tap into

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.330 
and you can see here's where we tap into
the<00:01:25.590> tally<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.159> tele<00:01:26.580> channel<00:01:26.909> one<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:28.340> tele

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the tally so tele channel one and tele

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.880 
the tally so tele channel one and tele
channel<00:01:29.670> two<00:01:30.200> it's<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> kind<00:01:31.770> of

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
channel two it's just the kind of

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.249 
channel two it's just the kind of
industry<00:01:32.369> standard<00:01:32.820> pins<00:01:33.119> two<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.049> three

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
industry standard pins two and three

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.700 
industry standard pins two and three
close<00:01:34.470> contact<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.250> make<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.520> work<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.710> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
close contact to make that work and the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.670 
close contact to make that work and the
iris<00:01:38.070> control<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:39.259> literally<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> pot<00:01:40.530> inner

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
iris control is literally a pot inner

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.080 
iris control is literally a pot inner
box<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.460> actually<00:01:41.790> make<00:01:41.909> them<00:01:42.030> up

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
box so you can actually make them up

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.609 
box so you can actually make them up
yourself<00:01:42.150> if<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.600> needed<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.960> but<00:01:43.200> we've<00:01:43.350> made

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
yourself if you needed to but we've made

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.530 
yourself if you needed to but we've made
these<00:01:43.710> little<00:01:43.829> boxes<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.329> see

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
these little boxes here and you can see

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.889 
these little boxes here and you can see
here<00:01:45.810> if<00:01:45.899> we<00:01:46.079> adjust<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:48.119> iris<00:01:48.509> you'll

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
here if we adjust the the iris you'll

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.889 
here if we adjust the the iris you'll
see<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.850> also<00:01:50.850> will<00:01:50.939> see<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.180> iris<00:01:51.390> go<00:01:51.509> up<00:01:51.659> and

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
see the also will see the iris go up and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.929 
see the also will see the iris go up and
so<00:01:52.860> that's<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.189> way<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:53.399> can<00:01:53.520> control<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
so that's the way we can control the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.330 
so that's the way we can control the
lens<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.110> two<00:01:55.290> channels<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.130> have

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
lens so it's two channels so you have

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.399 
lens so it's two channels so you have
camera<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.759> camera<00:01:56.969> B<00:01:57.119> with<00:01:57.600> an<00:01:57.750> iris<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.350> you

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
camera a camera B with an iris and you

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.999 
camera a camera B with an iris and you
have<00:01:59.040> tele<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.329> tele<00:02:00.509> B<00:02:00.689> there's<00:02:01.350> also<00:02:01.560> ten

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
have tele a and tele B there's also ten

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.679 
have tele a and tele B there's also ten
frequencies<00:02:02.759> as<00:02:02.909> well<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.740> 868

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
frequencies as well so in the 868

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.999 
frequencies as well so in the 868
spectrum<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:06.960> see<00:02:07.200> here<00:02:07.469> that's<00:02:07.680> all<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
spectrum you can see here that's all the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.400 
spectrum you can see here that's all the
frequencies<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.520> we<00:02:08.819> can<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.509> use<00:02:09.780> so

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
frequencies that we can we can use so

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.990 
frequencies that we can we can use so
you<00:02:10.470> could<00:02:10.770> actually<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.700> theory<00:02:12.060> use

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
you could actually in theory use

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.340 
you could actually in theory use
these<00:02:13.270> which<00:02:13.600> would<00:02:13.780> actually<00:02:14.050> allow<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.230> to

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
these which would actually allow you to

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.680 
these which would actually allow you to
control<00:02:14.590> 20<00:02:14.830> cameras<00:02:15.400> not<00:02:16.360> that<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:16.540> probably

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
control 20 cameras not that you probably

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.540 
control 20 cameras not that you probably
ever<00:02:16.900> need<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.230> many<00:02:17.380> but<00:02:17.620> that's<00:02:17.860> that's

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
ever need that many but that's that's

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.240 
ever need that many but that's that's
that's<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.180> possibility<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:20.620> can<00:02:20.740> also<00:02:20.860> see

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
that's a possibility you can also see

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.190 
that's a possibility you can also see
when<00:02:21.460> you<00:02:21.640> actually<00:02:22.000> turn<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.510> turn<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.960> dial

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
when you actually turn the turn the dial

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.630 
when you actually turn the turn the dial
the<00:02:23.680> lights<00:02:24.010> flash<00:02:24.910> here<00:02:25.150> as<00:02:25.240> well<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:25.930> as<00:02:26.170> we

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
the lights flash here as well so as we

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.940 
the lights flash here as well so as we
turn<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.970> lights<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.990> can<00:02:29.110> see<00:02:29.320> one<00:02:29.530> going<00:02:29.830> up

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
turn the lights you can see one going up

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.860 
turn the lights you can see one going up
and<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.370> green<00:02:30.610> means<00:02:31.090> going<00:02:31.360> down<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:31.720> that

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
and the green means going down so that

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.740 
and the green means going down so that
also<00:02:32.020> lets<00:02:32.320> you<00:02:32.410> know<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.740> knobs<00:02:32.920> moving

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
also lets you know that the knobs moving

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.720 
also lets you know that the knobs moving
and<00:02:34.750> then<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.620> tally<00:02:35.860> light<00:02:36.040> coming<00:02:36.430> off<00:02:36.550> and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
and then the tally light coming off and

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.310 
and then the tally light coming off and
on<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:39.370> reaction<00:02:39.760> time<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.480> around<00:02:40.780> about<00:02:41.050> 30

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
on the reaction time is around about 30

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.260 
on the reaction time is around about 30
milliseconds<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:42.100> it's<00:02:42.220> it's<00:02:42.430> it's<00:02:42.790> very<00:02:43.030> fast

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
milliseconds so it's it's it's very fast

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.560 
milliseconds so it's it's it's very fast
as<00:02:43.420> well<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:45.250> that's<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.700> talus<00:02:46.120> it's

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
as well so that's the talus it's

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.710 
as well so that's the talus it's
shipping<00:02:46.989> now<00:02:48.000> give<00:02:49.000> us<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.209> call<00:02:49.390> if<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:49.600> need
