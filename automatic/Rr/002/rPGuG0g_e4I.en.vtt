00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.100
 hello everyone I'm dani and here I am in a 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.990
 minecraft island again to bring you news 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.710
 all the news of the next 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.610
 version 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.500
 so let's start nathan adam has 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.270
 given on your twitter more information about 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.520
 the new map options 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.320
 extraplanos the photo that you are seeing 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.060
 shows what the interface looks like 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.430
 of the personalization of the 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.930
 maps as we see to the left of the 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.790
 column are the materials that 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.070
 will make up the layers and on the right the 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.710
 number of layers in this case the world 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.150
 what would be generated would be the following 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.090
 starting at the bottom we would have a layer 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:48.080
 of bedrock two of ground one of grass 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.000
 one green wool and two pink wool 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.280
 below we see some buttons that indicate us 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.470
 that we can add edit and delete 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.120
 layers that we want plus we see another 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.600
 button down in the center that is pretty 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.550
 interesting called presets when you hit 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.159
 this button will take us to another interface 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.140
 this you are seeing here we can 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.420
 select predefined maps as per 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.070
 example the classic super flat map or 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.950
 these two new models that we are 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.480
 watching the tan the stream is a map that 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.700
 It is composed as follows 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.300
 starting at the top we would have a layer 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.170
 grass four layers of earth 232 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.299
 layers of stone and a layer of oil 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.640
 the water world would be the next 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.790
 way starting at the bottom we would have a 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.509
 layer of rock met 5 layers of stone 5 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.729
 layers of earth 5 layers of sand and 90 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.380
 layers of water this is all that is 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.710
 knows for the moment of this new 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.710
 characteristic 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.180
 let's move on to one last thing a user of 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.070
 redit has proposed that just like it's going to 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.750
 happen with the super-flat maps are 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.909
 can personalize the worlds by 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.860
 defect in particular has proposed that 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.900
 we can exclude certain biomes that do not 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.700
 we like them and increase the probability of 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.070
 that others appear that we like more 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.350
 nathan adam has already commented that 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.060
 they had planned is to say that they have 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.890
 thought of doing it but have not yet 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.570
 put to it therefore will have to see 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.610
 if they finally implement it in the new 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.830
 version 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.420
 well nothing else that has been all for the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.970
 At the moment I hope you liked it and 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.440
 I will be attentive to new developments a 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.440
 greeting and until the next video
