00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
I make my shooting videos at home and

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.599

wanted to show you a recent upgrade that
was<00:00:05.730> really<00:00:06.060> long<00:00:06.299> overdue

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
was really long overdue

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.129 
was really long overdue
this<00:00:08.069> was<00:00:08.400> my<00:00:08.639> backyard<00:00:08.910> shooting<00:00:09.570> range<00:00:09.840> it

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
this was my backyard shooting range it

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.440 
this was my backyard shooting range it
was<00:00:10.620> down<00:00:10.889> in<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.160> gully<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.759> really<00:00:12.090> left<00:00:12.269> a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
was down in a gully and I really left a

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.749 
was down in a gully and I really left a
lot<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.660> be<00:00:12.840> desired<00:00:13.139> actually<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.190> was<00:00:14.309> so<00:00:14.519> low

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
lot to be desired actually it was so low

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.340 
lot to be desired actually it was so low
that<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.000> couldn't<00:00:15.360> really<00:00:15.509> get<00:00:15.809> more<00:00:15.990> than<00:00:16.170> ten

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
that I couldn't really get more than ten

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.960 
that I couldn't really get more than ten
yards<00:00:16.680> away<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.250> had<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.550> do<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> lot<00:00:17.940> of

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
yards away so I had to do a lot of

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.679 
yards away so I had to do a lot of
improvising<00:00:19.910> the<00:00:20.910> first<00:00:21.150> thing<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.570> did

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
improvising the first thing that I did

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.599 
improvising the first thing that I did
was<00:00:21.990> cut<00:00:22.199> some<00:00:22.380> trees<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.650> extend<00:00:23.220> things<00:00:23.460> a

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
was cut some trees to extend things a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.939 
was cut some trees to extend things a
little<00:00:23.730> further<00:00:24.000> back<00:00:24.300> into<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.689> woods<00:00:25.019> then

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
little further back into the woods then

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.009 
little further back into the woods then
the<00:00:26.160> area<00:00:26.519> was<00:00:26.789> filled<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.449> built<00:00:27.660> up<00:00:27.840> to

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
the area was filled in and built up to

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.160 
the area was filled in and built up to
the<00:00:28.140> same<00:00:28.349> level<00:00:28.380> as<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.010> rest<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> yard

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
the same level as the rest of the yard

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.740 
the same level as the rest of the yard
it<00:00:31.170> took<00:00:31.439> 33<00:00:31.949> dump<00:00:32.460> trucks<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.000> level<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.510> which

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
it took 33 dump trucks to level it which

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.840 
it took 33 dump trucks to level it which
brought<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.200> ground<00:00:34.469> level<00:00:34.680> up<00:00:34.980> dramatically

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
brought the ground level up dramatically

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.840 
brought the ground level up dramatically
around<00:00:36.270> 6<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.840> 8<00:00:36.960> feet

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.939 

here<00:00:44.300> you<00:00:44.449> can<00:00:44.600> see<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:44.930> big<00:00:45.109> loader<00:00:45.379> comes<00:00:45.739> in

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
here you can see the big loader comes in

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.150 
here you can see the big loader comes in
and<00:00:46.129> makes<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.430> berm<00:00:47.530> this<00:00:48.530> has<00:00:48.710> really<00:00:48.920> been

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
and makes the berm this has really been

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.189 
and makes the berm this has really been
a<00:00:49.219> fantastic<00:00:49.730> improvement<00:00:50.359> allowing<00:00:51.050> me<00:00:51.170> to

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
a fantastic improvement allowing me to

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.709 
a fantastic improvement allowing me to
shoot<00:00:51.500> from<00:00:51.680> as<00:00:51.829> far<00:00:52.010> as<00:00:52.129> 50<00:00:52.550> yards<00:00:52.940> at<00:00:53.120> home
