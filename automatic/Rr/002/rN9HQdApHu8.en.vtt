00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.580

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.590
 Cedar trees that give natural shade

 for horses I also like to do 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.160
 the large stable stables 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.550
 so the horse can run and 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.610
 walk so they never seem to me in 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.590
