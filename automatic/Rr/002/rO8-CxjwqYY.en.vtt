00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
Hello. Today we will be folding "Can Love Be Squashed" by Sy Chen.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.280
This is a very entertaining action model,
and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.780
Also please be sure to check out Sy Chen's book, "Folding Hearts".

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.550
This model requires a square sheet of

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.990
paper with color on one side and white
on the other. Start with the color side

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.259
down and then fold in half vertically. So
take the left edge and fold it over to

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:47.879
the right edge. Once it is aligned, just
make a crease, and unfold. And now take

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.370
the top edge and make a horizontal
crease by folding it down to the bottom

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.289
edge. And then unfold.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.609
Now we're going to create two diagonal
creases.

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:17.539
So start by taking the top left corner
and pulling it down to the bottom right

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:32.600
corner. Make a crease and unfold. And then take the top right corner and fold it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:43.670
down to the bottom left corner. Make a
crease and unfold

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.930
Now we're going to fold two edges

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.080
to the center crease. So start by taking
this left edge and aligning it with that

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.890
crease that we created in the middle.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:12.480
Try to line it up perfectly. And then make a crease. And then do the same thing on the right side.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.320
Line it up with the other
one that we just folded over, make a

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.700
crease, just like that.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.860
Now turn the model over and we're going
to be creating two creases along

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.630
existing creases that we made before. And the reason we're doing this is to make

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.690
creases on the front side so that they
go through those layers. So let's start

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.570
by creasing along this crease here.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.390
So what we do is we are going to fold
the whole model over, so all of the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.880
layers. And you can align this
crease with the center. And just try to

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.790
line it up as best you can. And it should
sort of just fall into place because we

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.030
have another crease on the back side.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.220
Okay, so once you did that , just unfold and now we're going to fold along this

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.970
crease.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:27.450
So just fold the model over. Line up these
two creases here, and just make a crease.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.890
And then fold this back up. And then you
can turn the model back over.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.310
Now we're just going to fold the whole
model in half. So start by taking this

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.540
bottom edge and folding it up to the
top edge along this crease here. It should

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.540
simply fall into place, and then you'll
have something like this.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.610
Now we're going to fold this top edge
down about a third of the length of the

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:13.000
side here. So it doesn't have to be exact,
but just try to make it as perfect as

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.130
possible. Anything around here

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.540
will be okay.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.240
And when you're making this crease, just
make sure that the center lines up with

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.550
these two flaps. And then make sure that
the edges line up over here.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.550
So once you've folded one down about a
third of the way, then just flip the

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.669
model over and do the same thing.

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:48.010
It helps to just basically fold it so
that it aligns with it on the other side

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.770
as well. So you can see the flap here. So
if you just make a crease using that as

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.770
your reference point, it makes it a lot easier.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.150
So just make the crease and you should
have something like this.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.009
Now what we're going to do is create two squash

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.009
folds. So, to start one

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:22.399
let's take this left flap here. And we're
just going to open it up so that you can

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:27.169
see the white inside. And you'll notice
that there's a crease running up the top

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:27.800
here.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:35.119
So you're just going to align that with
this crease here, and when it lines up

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:39.830
and it looks something like this then it
should be perfect.

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.409
So then you do the same thing on the
right side.

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:50.779
Just open the flap up a bit, and align this
crease with the edge of this crease here.

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:59.659
And make a crease on both sides, and
that's called a squash fold. And then you

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.659
do the same thing on the back. So just
flip it over,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:12.740
open up each pocket a bit, and just
squash it down. And then make creases so

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.789
that it lies flat. And do this one more
time,

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.750
and it should look like this.

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:33.150
Now we're going to create four more creases.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.860
So let's start with this top left flap
up here, and what you're going to do is

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.170
align this raw edge here (that should be
white) and you're going to align that

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:52.380
with this edge down here. So it should
just make a crease like this. And as soon

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.520
as it lines up there, 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.650
just make a crease and then unfold. And you do the same thing on this side. So just make

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.800
sure that that flat edge lines up with
the edge here. Make a crease, and then

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.040
unfold. And then you have to do the same
thing on the back. So flip it over and

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.770
align this edge with this

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:22.650
crease's edge down here. Make a
crease, and then do the same on this side.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.030
Make a crease and unfold.
