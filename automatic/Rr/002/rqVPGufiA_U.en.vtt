00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
gonna want to space these one block away

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.090 
gonna want to space these one block away
from<00:01:15.420> each<00:01:15.689> other<00:01:15.900> there<00:01:16.439> are<00:01:16.590> other<00:01:16.799> ways<00:01:17.040> to

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
from each other there are other ways to

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.640 
from each other there are other ways to
do<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.659> make<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.170> they<00:01:19.259> could<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.470> all

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
do this to make it so they could be all

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.679 
do this to make it so they could be all
next<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.009> each<00:01:20.130> other<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.299> doesn't<00:01:21.600> always

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
next to each other but it doesn't always

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.420 
next to each other but it doesn't always
work<00:01:21.810> very<00:01:22.229> well<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.710> mean<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.950> could<00:01:23.100> stack

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
work very well I mean you could stack

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.830 
work very well I mean you could stack
them<00:01:23.640> when<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.909> find<00:01:24.210> out<00:01:24.360> how<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.570> put<00:01:24.750> them

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
them when I find out how to put them

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.570 
them when I find out how to put them
next<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.110> each<00:01:25.229> other<00:01:25.350> I'll<00:01:25.560> make<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> video<00:01:25.979> and

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
next to each other I'll make a video and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.030
