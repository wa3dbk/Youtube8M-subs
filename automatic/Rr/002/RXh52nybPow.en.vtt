so<00:00:08.220> this<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.490> our<00:00:08.610> descent<00:00:09.000> into<00:00:09.120> glutton

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
so this is our descent into glutton

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.789 
so this is our descent into glutton
greed<00:00:10.380> excuse<00:00:10.920> me<00:00:12.349> we're<00:00:13.349> approaching<00:00:13.530> our

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
greed excuse me we're approaching our

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.499 
greed excuse me we're approaching our
halfway<00:00:14.190> mark<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.670> think<00:00:14.790> we've<00:00:15.030> already<00:00:15.210> met

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
halfway mark I think we've already met

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.930 
halfway mark I think we've already met
our<00:00:15.540> halfway<00:00:15.990> mark<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.250> believe<00:00:17.760> the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
our halfway mark this is I believe the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.400 
our halfway mark this is I believe the
fifth<00:00:18.510> level<00:00:19.220> out<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.460> 10<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.480> yeah<00:00:22.260> we're

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
fifth level out of 10 so yeah we're

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:38.310 
fifth level out of 10 so yeah we're
about<00:00:22.529> halfway

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.020 

so<00:00:38.920> it's<00:00:39.040> pretty<00:00:39.130> much<00:00:39.310> it's<00:00:39.490> the<00:00:39.520> same<00:00:39.790> thing

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
so it's pretty much it's the same thing

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.750 
so it's pretty much it's the same thing
as<00:00:40.150> every<00:00:40.480> descent<00:00:40.900> into<00:00:41.080> another<00:00:41.410> level<00:00:41.760> just

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
as every descent into another level just

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.390 
as every descent into another level just
avoiding<00:00:43.480> puzzles<00:00:43.960> and<00:00:44.440> stuff<00:00:44.800> like<00:00:44.950> that

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
avoiding puzzles and stuff like that

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:58.270 
avoiding puzzles and stuff like that
trying<00:00:45.640> to<00:00:45.730> get<00:00:45.880> down

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.920 

this<00:00:59.280> part<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.550> pretty<00:00:59.579> easy<00:00:59.790> I<00:01:00.600> actually

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
this part is pretty easy I actually

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.340 
this part is pretty easy I actually
didn't<00:01:01.650> do<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.890> right<00:01:02.040> for<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.489> minute<00:01:02.730> here

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
didn't do it right for a minute here

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.750 
didn't do it right for a minute here
what<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.440> gotta<00:01:04.589> do<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.010> gotta<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.430> kick

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
what you gotta do is you gotta just kick

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.950 
what you gotta do is you gotta just kick
it<00:01:05.910> across<00:01:06.180> by<00:01:06.450> holding<00:01:06.780> B<00:01:08.330> but<00:01:09.330> what<00:01:09.720> screwed

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
it across by holding B but what screwed

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.140 
it across by holding B but what screwed
me<00:01:10.050> up<00:01:10.080> was<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:10.500> behind<00:01:10.680> me<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:11.940> you<00:01:12.000> can

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
me up was the one behind me as you can

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.940 
me up was the one behind me as you can
see<00:01:12.360> flared<00:01:12.810> up<00:01:12.930> again<00:01:13.050> I<00:01:13.440> thought<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.770> could

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
see flared up again I thought I could

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.900 
see flared up again I thought I could
avoid<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.430> really<00:01:14.760> quick<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:16.400> it<00:01:17.400> got<00:01:17.610> too

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
avoid it really quick but it got too

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.800 
avoid it really quick but it got too
much<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.880> had<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.060> run<00:01:21.210> back<00:01:21.360> over<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:21.660> and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
much so I had to run back over here and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.440 
much so I had to run back over here and
grab<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.200> one

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.300 

they're<00:01:26.960> pretty<00:01:27.170> hard<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.500> grab<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:27.980> because

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
they're pretty hard to grab to because

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.110 
they're pretty hard to grab to because
of<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.520> camera<00:01:28.910> angle<00:01:28.940> and<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:31.820> fact<00:01:32.030> that

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
of the camera angle and the fact that

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:39.789 
of the camera angle and the fact that
nothing's<00:01:32.660> hitting<00:01:32.960> me<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.440> can't<00:01:33.680> grab<00:01:33.890> it

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.639

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
give it the boot over of course the

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:56.390

camera<00:01:46.490> angle<00:01:46.700> is<00:01:46.729> not<00:01:46.880> helping

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.160
