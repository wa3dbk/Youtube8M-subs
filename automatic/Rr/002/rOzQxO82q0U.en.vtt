00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.240
 It's not for you, you can only take photos. 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.270
 blurred with the frame 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.180

 For those who do not know I'm a photographer. 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.989
 more than a decade in the last five 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.210
 I specialize in some techniques 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.960
 well advanced photography as 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.210
 360 ° spherical photography and 3d photography 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.710
 for example among other techniques see 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.629
 now some companies that have used 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.640

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.240
 I've spent more than a year of my life. 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.820
 to prepare this course for you I 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.409
 I made all the examples all the videos 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.290
 all views of the videos 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.939
 the issue of making the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.240
 The way that I think it will be better. 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.610
 to teach you the best of everything is 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.540
 that you can take lessons from any 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.159
 place 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.320
 If you are online, you take the photo. 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.960
 of any tablet computer or 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.490
 What is different about this smartphone? 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.229
 with the first it is a video that 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.759
 there are courses that you buy and you 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.040
 watch video just as there are 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.710
 video lessons you buy a dvd 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.140
 the course goes beyond you to watch the video and 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.189
 yes yes almost three hours of video yes 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.710
 you also have a pdf booklet that 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.659
 you see online also that it is not 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.500
 just a reference booklet with some 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.740
 topics 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.600
 It is a book that teaches photography. 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.220
 and sometimes you have content in the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.539
 that you are not in the video and 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.400
 Sometimes you have content in the video that 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.319
 not in the old village bridge only pays 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.569
 attention to all content 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.659
 it is very important to be seen not 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.760
 just write it already be super cool 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.400
 super visual full of cool graphics 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.030
 several examples of photo comments and 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.359
 etc 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.340
 some classes also have content 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:31.379
 and interactive content 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.290
 shows for example some simulators 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.629
 for example a system simulator 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.030
 focus of your camera is you click on the 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.730
 points of focus and you see and real time 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.099
 there what happens a photo focus changes from 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.810
 one side of the other or else you see 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.299
 influence of the opening at night from the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.639
 image is a requirement of openness in 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.870
 Shallow depth of field All this you see 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:54.000
 interactively 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.280
 you do not need to pick up your camera and to 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.349
 street opening big opening boot opening 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.449
 Why was it a test to stop me? 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.459
 I did it for you and you just have to 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:04.379
 push the button another power 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.000
 show result 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.730
 Look how nice, later you're going to the street. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.139
 and makes your test is a multimedia course 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.750
 and more interactive is a basic course is 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:17.609
 It is also the course for beginners and he 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.290
 was made for those who know nothing of 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:23.280
 photography 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.409
 but wait then it is so it goes from 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.229
 who knows nothing who wants to know 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.879
 pretty thing pretty thing 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.859
 you are very professional and you are 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.659
 earning money from photography that 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.519
 do not know what's inside the 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.370
 course 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.430
 Another cool differential of the course I go 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:46.489

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:49.290
