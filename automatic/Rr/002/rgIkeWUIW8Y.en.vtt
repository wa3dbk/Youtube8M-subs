00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 
chapters but the key question of course

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.720 
chapters but the key question of course
is<00:07:53.700> what<00:07:53.820> we<00:07:54.600> still<00:07:54.870> don't<00:07:55.110> know<00:07:55.200> and<00:07:55.680> that<00:07:56.520> is

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:56.730 
is what we still don't know and that is

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.440 
is what we still don't know and that is
