the completed weapons but now it's time

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.269 
the completed weapons but now it's time
to<00:00:18.660> take<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> look<00:00:19.230> at<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.500> parts<00:00:19.890> once<00:00:20.130> they're

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
to take a look at the parts once they're

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.340 
to take a look at the parts once they're
all<00:00:20.400> together<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.970> there<00:00:21.689> are<00:00:21.869> some<00:00:22.109> pretty

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
all together and there are some pretty

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.250 
all together and there are some pretty
impressive<00:00:22.800> mechanisms<00:00:23.699> inside<00:00:24.390> each<00:00:25.050> of

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
impressive mechanisms inside each of

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.900 
impressive mechanisms inside each of
these<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.830> let's<00:00:25.859> get<00:00:26.250> started

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
these so let's get started

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.519 
these so let's get started
starting<00:00:27.420> at<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.599> bottom<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.990> feet<00:00:28.289> were

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
starting at the bottom of the feet were

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.779 
starting at the bottom of the feet were
one<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> first<00:00:29.160> things<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.460> put<00:00:29.670> together

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
one of the first things I put together

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.060 
one of the first things I put together
and<00:00:30.240> they<00:00:30.510> are<00:00:30.779> impressive<00:00:31.470> for<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.859> pretty

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
and they are impressive for a pretty

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.160 
and they are impressive for a pretty
simple<00:00:32.430> reason<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.880> amount<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.899> mobility

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
simple reason the amount of mobility

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.049 
simple reason the amount of mobility
you've<00:00:34.530> got<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.010> first<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.399> all<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.640> can<00:00:35.850> bend

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
you've got so first of all you can bend

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.959 
you've got so first of all you can bend
them<00:00:36.210> at<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.600> back<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.680> then<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.579> can

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
them at the back here and then you can

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.450 
them at the back here and then you can
bend<00:00:39.300> them<00:00:39.480> also<00:00:39.750> up<00:00:40.290> here<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.100> what<00:00:41.280> you're

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
bend them also up here so what you're

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.360 
bend them also up here so what you're
able<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:42.059> quite<00:00:42.719> easily<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.440> get<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:44.040> kind

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
able to do quite easily is get this kind

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.639 
able to do quite easily is get this kind
of<00:00:44.550> near<00:00:44.969> 90<00:00:45.300> degrees<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.200> looked<00:00:46.410> at<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
of near 90 degrees if you looked at the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.650 
of near 90 degrees if you looked at the
soles<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.160> feet<00:00:47.190> there<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:48.360> because

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
soles of the feet there and it's because

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.330 
soles of the feet there and it's because
you've<00:00:48.780> got<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> slide<00:00:49.260> mechanism<00:00:49.410> up<00:00:49.890> here<00:00:50.160> and

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
you've got a slide mechanism up here and

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.729 
you've got a slide mechanism up here and
built<00:00:51.090> into<00:00:51.300> all<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.570> these<00:00:51.870> parts<00:00:52.230> down<00:00:52.410> below

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
built into all of these parts down below

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.830 
built into all of these parts down below
so<00:00:53.309> very<00:00:53.550> cool<00:00:53.789> there<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.510> other<00:00:54.600> thing<00:00:54.809> that

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
so very cool there the other thing that

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.540 
so very cool there the other thing that
I<00:00:54.960> was<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.140> big<00:00:55.320> fan<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.219> you're<00:00:56.399> able

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
I was a big fan of is that you're able

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.670 
I was a big fan of is that you're able
to<00:00:56.699> take<00:00:56.940> these<00:00:57.149> parts<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.960> these<00:00:58.530> are

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
to take these parts and these are

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.959 
to take these parts and these are
designed<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.219> when<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.550> put<00:00:59.730> them<00:00:59.879> on

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
designed so that when you put them on

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.959 
designed so that when you put them on
the<00:01:00.090> table<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:01.109> foot<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.680> not<00:01:02.039> going<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.760> move

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
the table this foot is not going to move

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.490 
the table this foot is not going to move
so<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.329> basically<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:04.019> cut<00:01:04.170> these<00:01:04.320> out

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
so you basically just cut these out

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.859 
so you basically just cut these out
using<00:01:04.769> your<00:01:04.970> modelers<00:01:05.970> knife<00:01:06.180> no<00:01:06.450> problem<00:01:06.780> at

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
using your modelers knife no problem at

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:07.100 
using your modelers knife no problem at
all

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
all

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.929 
all
slap<00:01:07.619> those<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.280> these<00:01:08.400> are<00:01:08.580> already<00:01:08.760> on

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
slap those in and these are already on

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.179 
slap those in and these are already on
indents<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:09.720> they<00:01:09.840> don't<00:01:10.140> protrude<00:01:10.740> too<00:01:10.979> much

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
indents so they don't protrude too much

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.190 
indents so they don't protrude too much
but<00:01:11.939> they<00:01:12.090> should<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:12.540> provide<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> little

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
but they should just provide a little

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.440 
but they should just provide a little
bit<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.470> extra<00:01:13.860> support<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.090> when<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.299> do

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
bit of extra support so that when you do

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.380 
bit of extra support so that when you do
to<00:01:15.600> slap<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.229> huge<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.950> riser<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.820> this

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
to slap on the huge a riser that this

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.060 
to slap on the huge a riser that this
double-o<00:01:18.840> riser<00:01:19.049> will<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.439> able<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.680> keep<00:01:19.890> its

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
double-o riser will be able to keep its

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.370 
double-o riser will be able to keep its
feet<00:01:20.280> hopefully<00:01:20.540> next<00:01:21.540> with<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> ankles<00:01:22.140> this

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
feet hopefully next with the ankles this

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.320 
feet hopefully next with the ankles this
is<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> theme<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.189> really<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.670> recurring<00:01:24.210> with

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
is a theme that really is recurring with

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.749 
is a theme that really is recurring with
a<00:01:24.360> double<00:01:24.810> O<00:01:24.900> Gundam<00:01:25.259> basically<00:01:26.250> all<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.640> these

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
a double O Gundam basically all of these

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.130 
a double O Gundam basically all of these
parts<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.150> got<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> lot<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.540> moving<00:01:27.780> parts<00:01:27.990> but

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
parts it's got a lot of moving parts but

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.899 
parts it's got a lot of moving parts but
they're<00:01:28.380> very<00:01:28.560> very<00:01:28.710> stiff<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.700> is

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
they're very very stiff and that is

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.270 
they're very very stiff and that is
going<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.329> very<00:01:30.630> important<00:01:31.170> when<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.070> add

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
going to be very important when we add

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.010 
going to be very important when we add
in<00:01:32.520> all<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.700> extra<00:01:33.180> weight<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:33.720> anyway<00:01:33.960> you

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
in all the extra weight but anyway you

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.480 
in all the extra weight but anyway you
were<00:01:34.170> able<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.409> move<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.740> here<00:01:34.770> it'll<00:01:35.280> move

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
were able to move it here it'll move

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.789 
were able to move it here it'll move
around<00:01:35.790> here<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.900> able<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.229> attach<00:01:37.500> here

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
around here and it's able to attach here

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.859 
around here and it's able to attach here
so<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.100> should<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.790> same<00:01:39.240> kind<00:01:39.750> of

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
so we should have the same kind of

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.630 
so we should have the same kind of
mobility<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.409> we<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.770> with<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.159> awesome

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
mobility that we have with the awesome

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.090 
mobility that we have with the awesome
hg<00:01:42.240> kits<00:01:42.540> already<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.740> once<00:01:43.950> you're

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
hg kits already but it's once you're

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.469 
hg kits already but it's once you're
building<00:01:44.369> something<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> legs<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
building something like the legs and the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.539 
building something like the legs and the
arms<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:45.990> really<00:01:46.320> get<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> see<00:01:46.740> wow<00:01:47.040> how

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
arms that you really get to see wow how

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.160 
arms that you really get to see wow how
much<00:01:47.729> effort<00:01:48.180> they<00:01:48.360> put<00:01:48.390> into<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.930> inner

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
much effort they put into the inner

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.109 
much effort they put into the inner
frame<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:50.070> though<00:01:50.220> while<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.579> outside<00:01:50.729> may

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
frame so though while the outside may

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.030 
frame so though while the outside may
look<00:01:51.299> simple<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.869> parts<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.439> inside<00:01:52.680> that

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
look simple the parts on the inside that

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.039 
look simple the parts on the inside that
allow<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.610> kind<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.090> movement<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.899> this

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
allow this kind of movement with this

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.380 
allow this kind of movement with this
kind<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.380> stability<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.880> well<00:01:57.119> worth

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
kind of stability is really well worth

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.870 
kind of stability is really well worth
the<00:01:57.570> build<00:01:57.780> just<00:01:58.079> by<00:01:58.259> itself<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:59.610> anyway<00:01:59.820> to

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
the build just by itself so anyway to

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.459 
the build just by itself so anyway to
getting<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.719> take<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.899> look<00:02:01.079> here<00:02:01.320> at

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
getting to it if you take a look here at

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.350 
getting to it if you take a look here at
the<00:02:01.500> bottom<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.310> part<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.670> able<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.969> move<00:02:03.149> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the bottom this part is able to move a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.149 
the bottom this part is able to move a
little<00:02:03.719> bit<00:02:03.869> which<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.200> good<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.740> back<00:02:04.890> part

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
little bit which is good the back part

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.330 
little bit which is good the back part
does<00:02:05.340> not<00:02:05.479> these<00:02:06.479> parts<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.380> are<00:02:07.590> able<00:02:08.310> to

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
does not these parts here are able to

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.880 
does not these parts here are able to
lock<00:02:08.910> into<00:02:09.179> place<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.869> they<00:02:09.989> slide<00:02:10.289> out<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.770> in

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
lock into place so they slide out and in

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.050 
lock into place so they slide out and in
and<00:02:11.160> that's<00:02:11.310> because<00:02:11.640> we're<00:02:11.760> going<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.910> put

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
and that's because we're going to put

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.760 
and that's because we're going to put
the<00:02:12.209> GN<00:02:12.510> condenser<00:02:13.050> in<00:02:13.110> there

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
the GN condenser in there

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.260 
the GN condenser in there
which<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.040> going<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.310> serve<00:02:14.520> as<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.880> lock

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
which is going to serve as a lock

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.810 
which is going to serve as a lock
mechanism<00:02:15.740> but<00:02:16.740> because<00:02:17.100> it's<00:02:17.280> not<00:02:17.550> locked

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
mechanism but because it's not locked

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.050 
mechanism but because it's not locked
right<00:02:18.120> now<00:02:18.330> we<00:02:18.810> have<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.290> smooth<00:02:19.940> Mehcad<00:02:20.940> a

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
right now we have a smooth Mehcad a

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.910 
right now we have a smooth Mehcad a
slide<00:02:21.450> here<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:21.990> you'll<00:02:22.470> notice<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.800> we

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
slide here and you'll notice that we

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.890 
slide here and you'll notice that we
have<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.130> two-part<00:02:23.670> slide<00:02:23.970> there<00:02:24.240> on<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.630> front

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
have a two-part slide there on the front

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.020 
have a two-part slide there on the front
which<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.110> great<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:26.310> rest<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.850> Bend

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
which is great and the rest of the Bend

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.210 
which is great and the rest of the Bend
is<00:02:27.210> going<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.510> come<00:02:27.690> from<00:02:27.840> up<00:02:28.020> here<00:02:28.260> but<00:02:28.950> just

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
is going to come from up here but just

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.210 
is going to come from up here but just
to<00:02:29.310> give<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.460> an<00:02:29.580> idea<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.900> very<00:02:31.830> very

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
to give you an idea this is very very

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.150 
to give you an idea this is very very
tight<00:02:32.490> when<00:02:32.700> you're<00:02:32.790> moving<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:34.160> with

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
tight when you're moving it and with

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.040 
tight when you're moving it and with
that<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.730> course<00:02:36.030> we're<00:02:36.450> going<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.750> be<00:02:36.840> able<00:02:36.930> to

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
that of course we're going to be able to

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.950 
that of course we're going to be able to
get<00:02:37.260> almost<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.890> 180<00:02:38.580> but<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.690> really

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
get almost the 180 but this is really

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.630 
get almost the 180 but this is really
clicking<00:02:40.410> into<00:02:40.830> place<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.280> actually

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
clicking into place and you actually

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.280 
clicking into place and you actually
build<00:02:41.940> in<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.360> clicking<00:02:42.690> mechanism<00:02:43.170> when

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
build in the clicking mechanism when

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.900 
build in the clicking mechanism when
you're<00:02:43.380> putting<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.740> together<00:02:43.860> which<00:02:44.730> is

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
you're putting it together which is

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.910 
you're putting it together which is
pretty<00:02:45.150> cool<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:46.380> slide<00:02:46.680> mechanism

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
pretty cool and this slide mechanism

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.970 
pretty cool and this slide mechanism
which<00:02:47.490> doesn't<00:02:47.910> feature<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.560> which<00:02:49.560> features

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
which doesn't feature so which features

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.590 
which doesn't feature so which features
prominently<00:02:50.400> on<00:02:50.460> the<00:02:50.550> high-grade<00:02:51.030> figure<00:02:51.390> but

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
prominently on the high-grade figure but

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.140 
prominently on the high-grade figure but
this<00:02:51.750> gray<00:02:52.080> part<00:02:52.350> does<00:02:52.560> not<00:02:52.670> over<00:02:53.670> all<00:02:53.790> even

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
this gray part does not over all even

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.640 
this gray part does not over all even
when<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.330> open<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.600> up<00:02:54.720> I'm<00:02:55.050> impressed<00:02:55.560> with

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
when you open it up I'm impressed with

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.250 
when you open it up I'm impressed with
the<00:02:55.860> way<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.130> looks<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.690> Jian<00:02:57.690> condensers

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
the way it looks the Jian condensers

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.620 
the way it looks the Jian condensers
that<00:02:58.470> go<00:02:58.620> in<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.890> shoulder<00:02:59.400> elbow<00:02:59.940> wrist<00:02:59.970> and

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
that go in the shoulder elbow wrist and

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.420 
that go in the shoulder elbow wrist and
these<00:03:01.020> I<00:03:01.440> thought<00:03:01.830> were<00:03:01.950> going<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.130> be<00:03:02.250> pretty

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
these I thought were going to be pretty

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.830 
these I thought were going to be pretty
complicated<00:03:02.790> putting<00:03:03.180> them<00:03:03.300> together<00:03:03.450> but<00:03:03.750> if

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
complicated putting them together but if

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.090 
complicated putting them together but if
you<00:03:03.930> follow<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.260> directions<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.740> don't<00:03:04.890> think

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
you follow the directions I don't think

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.710 
you follow the directions I don't think
you'll<00:03:05.190> have<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.370> big<00:03:05.550> problem<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.420> these<00:03:06.570> are

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
you'll have a big problem so these are

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.390 
you'll have a big problem so these are
just<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.960> few<00:03:07.140> big<00:03:07.290> pieces<00:03:07.680> with<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:08.100> large

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
just a few big pieces with a large

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.010 
just a few big pieces with a large
spring<00:03:08.820> in<00:03:09.000> sight<00:03:09.240> and<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.480> can't<00:03:09.660> really<00:03:09.900> do

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
spring in sight and you can't really do

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.900 
spring in sight and you can't really do
anything<00:03:10.260> with<00:03:10.560> them<00:03:10.800> but<00:03:11.490> when<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:11.730> open

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
anything with them but when you open

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.270 
anything with them but when you open
this<00:03:12.180> up<00:03:12.240> and<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.690> slide<00:03:13.500> this<00:03:13.740> part<00:03:13.980> open

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
this up and you slide this part open

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.220 
this up and you slide this part open
you're<00:03:14.730> able<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.000> attach<00:03:15.330> this<00:03:15.540> into<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.080> knee

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
you're able to attach this into the knee

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.570 
you're able to attach this into the knee
which<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:16.680> going<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.070> give<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.340> lot<00:03:17.520> more

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
which is going to give it a lot more

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.970 
which is going to give it a lot more
stability<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.570> saw<00:03:19.080> with<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.350> other<00:03:19.380> leg<00:03:19.740> the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
stability you saw with the other leg the

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.000 
stability you saw with the other leg the
free<00:03:20.370> movement<00:03:20.640> here<00:03:21.180> but<00:03:21.360> now<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:22.380> shouldn't

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
free movement here but now it shouldn't

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.580 
free movement here but now it shouldn't
be<00:03:23.250> moving<00:03:23.520> well<00:03:24.090> at<00:03:24.420> all<00:03:24.690> but<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.230> does<00:03:25.350> move<00:03:25.530> a

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
be moving well at all but it does move a

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.440 
be moving well at all but it does move a
little<00:03:25.709> bit<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.010> you're<00:03:26.700> able<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:27.000> push<00:03:27.270> this

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
little bit and you're able to push this

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.600 
little bit and you're able to push this
in<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.690> when<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.050> do<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:29.010> get<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.340> free

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
in and when you do that you get the free

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.760 
in and when you do that you get the free
movement<00:03:29.850> back<00:03:30.209> but<00:03:30.810> when<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:30.990> let<00:03:31.230> go<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.470> it

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
movement back but when you let go of it

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.980 
movement back but when you let go of it
it<00:03:32.250> locks<00:03:32.640> into<00:03:32.910> place<00:03:33.209> with<00:03:33.510> just<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.840> little

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
it locks into place with just a little

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.810 
it locks into place with just a little
bit<00:03:34.230> of<00:03:34.350> mobility<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:35.010> you're<00:03:35.459> able<00:03:35.580> to

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
bit of mobility and you're able to

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.850 
bit of mobility and you're able to
actually<00:03:35.910> bend<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.450> knees<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.440> number<00:03:37.830> of

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
actually bend the knees to a number of

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.290 
actually bend the knees to a number of
positions<00:03:38.430> here<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.760> lock<00:03:38.910> them<00:03:39.090> into<00:03:39.209> place

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
positions here and lock them into place

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.480 
positions here and lock them into place
so<00:03:39.930> again<00:03:40.200> hopefully<00:03:40.410> this<00:03:40.800> is<00:03:40.950> going<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.280> help

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
so again hopefully this is going to help

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.210 
so again hopefully this is going to help
with<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.300> weight<00:03:42.480> issues<00:03:42.930> later<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.980> waist

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
with the weight issues later the waist

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.949 
with the weight issues later the waist
section<00:03:44.700> looks<00:03:44.940> deceptively<00:03:45.300> simple<00:03:45.930> but

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
section looks deceptively simple but

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.300 
section looks deceptively simple but
still<00:03:46.290> has<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.470> fair<00:03:46.740> number<00:03:46.950> of<00:03:47.070> mechanisms

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
still has a fair number of mechanisms

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.520 
still has a fair number of mechanisms
built<00:03:47.910> into<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.510> starting<00:03:48.959> with<00:03:48.990> just<00:03:49.350> how

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
built into it starting with just how

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.699 
built into it starting with just how
much<00:03:49.830> inner<00:03:50.250> frame<00:03:50.670> there<00:03:50.910> is<00:03:51.350> so<00:03:52.350> first<00:03:52.590> of

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
much inner frame there is so first of

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.320 
much inner frame there is so first of
all<00:03:52.770> looking<00:03:53.070> at<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.250> from<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.520> front<00:03:53.550> you're

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
all looking at it from the front you're

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.150 
all looking at it from the front you're
able<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:54.660> bring<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.260> side<00:03:55.560> skirt<00:03:55.980> or<00:03:56.130> the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
able to bring the side skirt or the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.980 
able to bring the side skirt or the
front<00:03:56.520> skirt<00:03:56.790> out<00:03:57.030> because<00:03:57.660> it's<00:03:57.870> on<00:03:57.959> a

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
front skirt out because it's on a

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.780 
front skirt out because it's on a
mechanism<00:03:58.380> there<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.860> when<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.459> do<00:03:59.610> that

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
mechanism there and when you do that

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.400 
mechanism there and when you do that
you're<00:03:59.970> able<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.240> move<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.630> out<00:04:00.750> of<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.930> way<00:04:01.140> of

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
you're able to move it out of the way of

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.350 
you're able to move it out of the way of
the<00:04:01.560> leg<00:04:01.770> but<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.430> do<00:04:02.550> like<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.970> fact<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.209> you

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
the leg but I do like the fact that you

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.730 
the leg but I do like the fact that you
can<00:04:03.510> lock<00:04:03.690> it<00:04:03.840> into<00:04:03.959> place<00:04:04.170> if<00:04:04.470> you're<00:04:04.709> not

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
can lock it into place if you're not

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.310 
can lock it into place if you're not
choosing<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.370> use<00:04:05.520> that<00:04:05.760> feature<00:04:06.060> on<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:07.170> side

choosing to use that feature on the side

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.140 
choosing to use that feature on the side
skirts<00:04:07.650> you're<00:04:07.770> able<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.040> move<00:04:08.280> them<00:04:08.490> up<00:04:08.610> here

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
skirts you're able to move them up here

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.940 
skirts you're able to move them up here
you<00:04:09.300> can<00:04:09.480> see<00:04:09.660> there<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:09.989> they're<00:04:10.590> also<00:04:10.709> on<00:04:10.920> a

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
you can see there and they're also on a

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.160 
you can see there and they're also on a
ball<00:04:11.160> joints<00:04:11.520> there<00:04:11.610> so<00:04:11.970> a<00:04:12.000> lot<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.390> mechanism

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
ball joints there so a lot of mechanism

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.680 
ball joints there so a lot of mechanism
moving<00:04:13.500> these<00:04:13.620> forward<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.310> back<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:15.000> if<00:04:15.600> you

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
moving these forward and back and if you

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.090 
moving these forward and back and if you
saw<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.900> previous<00:04:16.080> part<00:04:16.530> you<00:04:16.680> can<00:04:16.830> see<00:04:16.859> that

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
saw the previous part you can see that

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.920 
saw the previous part you can see that
you<00:04:17.190> can<00:04:17.310> attach<00:04:17.580> the<00:04:17.820> weapons<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.480> GN<00:04:18.750> sword

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
you can attach the weapons the GN sword

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.229 
you can attach the weapons the GN sword
twos<00:04:19.260> onto<00:04:20.190> there<00:04:20.340> by<00:04:20.520> opening<00:04:20.970> up<00:04:21.060> that

hinting compartment as well with the
beam<00:04:23.400> sabers<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:23.880> can<00:04:24.030> put<00:04:24.180> them<00:04:24.300> on<00:04:24.390> either

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
beam sabers you can put them on either

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.440 
beam sabers you can put them on either
side<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.169> you<00:04:25.979> can<00:04:26.340> bring<00:04:26.550> them<00:04:26.700> up

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
side and you can bring them up

side and you can bring them up
pop<00:04:27.600> this<00:04:27.870> out<00:04:28.140> and<00:04:28.350> then<00:04:28.740> you<00:04:28.890> can<00:04:29.010> pivot<00:04:29.250> them

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
pop this out and then you can pivot them

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.090 
pop this out and then you can pivot them
up<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:30.030> get<00:04:30.180> them<00:04:30.330> into<00:04:30.570> place<00:04:30.780> at<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.830> bottom

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
up to get them into place at the bottom

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.950 
up to get them into place at the bottom
we<00:04:32.190> also<00:04:32.220> have<00:04:32.640> a<00:04:32.670> slide<00:04:33.150> mechanism<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:33.870> I'm

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
we also have a slide mechanism and I'm

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.690 
we also have a slide mechanism and I'm
assuming<00:04:34.230> that's<00:04:34.530> going<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:34.830> attach<00:04:35.100> on<00:04:35.340> to

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
assuming that's going to attach on to

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.910 
assuming that's going to attach on to
the<00:04:35.970> action<00:04:36.510> base<00:04:36.780> that<00:04:37.080> this<00:04:37.230> comes<00:04:37.500> with<00:04:37.680> and

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
the action base that this comes with and

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.680 
the action base that this comes with and
the<00:04:38.460> final<00:04:38.790> cool<00:04:38.940> thing<00:04:39.180> that<00:04:39.210> they<00:04:39.420> give<00:04:39.570> you

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
the final cool thing that they give you

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.810 
the final cool thing that they give you
here<00:04:40.050> is<00:04:40.140> that<00:04:40.800> you're<00:04:41.010> able<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.430> move<00:04:41.670> the

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
here is that you're able to move the

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.270 
here is that you're able to move the
legs<00:04:42.000> if<00:04:42.240> you<00:04:42.270> get<00:04:42.450> these<00:04:42.630> out<00:04:42.960> if<00:04:43.200> you<00:04:43.830> slide

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
legs if you get these out if you slide

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.820 
legs if you get these out if you slide
this<00:04:44.490> black<00:04:44.850> part<00:04:45.180> up<00:04:45.360> and<00:04:45.870> out<00:04:46.170> of<00:04:46.290> the<00:04:46.350> way<00:04:46.500> as

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
this black part up and out of the way as

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.190 
this black part up and out of the way as
it<00:04:47.040> is<00:04:47.160> right<00:04:47.370> now<00:04:47.550> you<00:04:48.150> can<00:04:48.330> move<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:48.750> legs<00:04:48.960> up

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
it is right now you can move the legs up

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.890 
it is right now you can move the legs up
and<00:04:49.530> then<00:04:49.590> slide<00:04:50.400> these<00:04:50.670> down<00:04:51.030> and<00:04:51.390> then<00:04:51.450> these

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
and then slide these down and then these

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.630 
and then slide these down and then these
lock<00:04:52.260> into<00:04:52.590> place<00:04:52.770> if<00:04:52.980> you<00:04:53.100> heard<00:04:53.250> that<00:04:53.370> little

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
lock into place if you heard that little

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.550 
lock into place if you heard that little
click<00:04:53.850> there<00:04:54.060> so<00:04:54.570> you're<00:04:54.690> able<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:55.080> change<00:04:55.350> the

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
click there so you're able to change the

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.770 
click there so you're able to change the
position<00:04:55.950> of<00:04:55.980> the<00:04:56.340> hips<00:04:56.610> quite<00:04:57.120> solidly<00:04:57.630> and

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
position of the hips quite solidly and

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.690 
position of the hips quite solidly and
really<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.710> only<00:04:58.740> thing<00:04:59.130> that<00:04:59.160> I<00:04:59.280> did<00:04:59.490> have<00:04:59.640> a

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
really the only thing that I did have a

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.130 
really the only thing that I did have a
problem<00:04:59.910> with<00:05:00.180> sometimes<00:05:00.510> is<00:05:00.660> that<00:05:00.690> this<00:05:00.960> will

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
problem with sometimes is that this will

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.110 
problem with sometimes is that this will
crack<00:05:01.380> itself<00:05:01.650> open<00:05:02.040> but<00:05:02.520> again<00:05:02.760> that's<00:05:02.880> going

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
crack itself open but again that's going

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.030 
crack itself open but again that's going
to<00:05:03.270> allow<00:05:03.450> you<00:05:03.510> to<00:05:03.660> get<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.140> legs<00:05:04.380> more

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
to allow you to get the legs more

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.920 
to allow you to get the legs more
forward<00:05:05.550> mobility<00:05:06.060> so<00:05:06.330> for<00:05:06.540> something<00:05:06.810> that

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
forward mobility so for something that

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.900 
forward mobility so for something that
seems<00:05:07.230> simple<00:05:07.500> there's<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.340> lot<00:05:08.610> of<00:05:08.730> moving

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
seems simple there's a lot of moving

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.690 
seems simple there's a lot of moving
parts<00:05:09.180> in<00:05:09.420> this<00:05:09.620> next<00:05:10.620> up<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:10.980> chest<00:05:11.310> has<00:05:11.550> an

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
parts in this next up the chest has an

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.090 
parts in this next up the chest has an
incredible<00:05:12.360> system<00:05:12.660> for<00:05:13.320> inner<00:05:13.530> movement

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
incredible system for inner movement

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.280 
incredible system for inner movement
here<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:14.370> basically<00:05:15.120> it's<00:05:15.540> hollow<00:05:15.900> with<00:05:16.260> a

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
here and basically it's hollow with a

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.380 
here and basically it's hollow with a
big<00:05:16.560> ring<00:05:16.800> in<00:05:16.950> there<00:05:17.100> because<00:05:17.430> of<00:05:17.550> course<00:05:17.760> this

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
big ring in there because of course this

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.600 
big ring in there because of course this
is<00:05:18.600> going<00:05:18.810> to<00:05:18.990> support<00:05:19.380> a<00:05:19.470> GN<00:05:19.830> Drive<00:05:20.130> perhaps

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
is going to support a GN Drive perhaps

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.210 
is going to support a GN Drive perhaps
for<00:05:20.790> Exia<00:05:21.120> or<00:05:21.360> quanta<00:05:21.900> of<00:05:21.960> course<00:05:22.200> which<00:05:22.980> could

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
for Exia or quanta of course which could

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.620 
for Exia or quanta of course which could
get<00:05:23.340> a<00:05:23.370> perfect<00:05:23.790> grade<00:05:23.940> but<00:05:24.240> that's<00:05:24.390> just

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
get a perfect grade but that's just

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.280 
get a perfect grade but that's just
speculation

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
speculation

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.020 
speculation
anyway<00:05:26.160> what<00:05:26.370> you're<00:05:26.520> going<00:05:26.640> to<00:05:26.730> get<00:05:26.850> with

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
anyway what you're going to get with

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.730 
anyway what you're going to get with
this<00:05:27.210> because<00:05:27.630> it<00:05:27.750> has<00:05:27.870> such<00:05:28.080> a<00:05:28.140> complex<00:05:28.530> inner

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
this because it has such a complex inner

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.350 
this because it has such a complex inner
frame<00:05:28.980> is<00:05:29.130> an<00:05:29.520> incredible<00:05:30.030> amount<00:05:30.210> of

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
frame is an incredible amount of

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.030 
frame is an incredible amount of
mobility<00:05:30.630> but<00:05:30.930> again<00:05:31.200> everything<00:05:31.710> is<00:05:31.800> very

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
mobility but again everything is very

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.970 
mobility but again everything is very
very<00:05:32.400> stiff<00:05:32.760> so<00:05:33.360> at<00:05:33.630> the<00:05:33.780> bottom<00:05:33.900> you're<00:05:34.560> able

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
very stiff so at the bottom you're able

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.760 
very stiff so at the bottom you're able
to<00:05:35.100> move<00:05:35.250> these<00:05:35.430> red<00:05:35.760> parts<00:05:36.120> forward<00:05:36.870> as<00:05:37.050> well

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
to move these red parts forward as well

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.090 
to move these red parts forward as well
as<00:05:38.010> off<00:05:38.400> to<00:05:38.820> the<00:05:38.940> side<00:05:39.240> but<00:05:40.050> again<00:05:40.200> you<00:05:40.920> can

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
as off to the side but again you can

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.770 
as off to the side but again you can
hear<00:05:41.280> the<00:05:41.400> clicking<00:05:41.820> as<00:05:42.060> they<00:05:42.330> do<00:05:42.390> that

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
hear the clicking as they do that

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.210 
hear the clicking as they do that
because<00:05:42.960> it<00:05:43.200> doesn't<00:05:43.470> really<00:05:43.680> want<00:05:43.980> to<00:05:44.040> move

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
because it doesn't really want to move

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.680 
because it doesn't really want to move
but<00:05:44.460> that's<00:05:44.640> going<00:05:44.850> to<00:05:44.910> be<00:05:45.000> a<00:05:45.030> good<00:05:45.270> thing<00:05:45.480> in

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
but that's going to be a good thing in

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.290 
but that's going to be a good thing in
the<00:05:46.200> long<00:05:46.230> run<00:05:46.710> as<00:05:46.950> far<00:05:47.670> as<00:05:47.790> the<00:05:47.940> shoulders

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
the long run as far as the shoulders

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.060 
the long run as far as the shoulders
itself<00:05:48.630> this<00:05:48.780> blue<00:05:49.020> part<00:05:49.200> also<00:05:49.620> has<00:05:49.800> some

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
itself this blue part also has some

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.550 
itself this blue part also has some
range<00:05:50.460> of<00:05:50.640> movement<00:05:51.060> here<00:05:51.210> but<00:05:51.360> not<00:05:51.570> a<00:05:51.600> lot<00:05:51.900> the

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
range of movement here but not a lot the

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.380 
range of movement here but not a lot the
blue<00:05:52.770> parts<00:05:53.040> on<00:05:53.160> the<00:05:53.280> chest<00:05:53.520> the<00:05:53.700> yellow<00:05:54.060> parts

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
blue parts on the chest the yellow parts

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.810 
blue parts on the chest the yellow parts
here<00:05:54.780> can<00:05:55.380> bend<00:05:55.650> up<00:05:55.860> and<00:05:56.100> down<00:05:56.280> and<00:05:56.580> you<00:05:56.670> can

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
here can bend up and down and you can

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.400 
here can bend up and down and you can
position<00:05:57.000> them<00:05:57.330> accordingly<00:05:57.720> but<00:05:58.260> you're

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
position them accordingly but you're

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.740 
position them accordingly but you're
also<00:05:58.530> able<00:05:58.740> to<00:05:58.920> slide<00:05:59.280> these<00:05:59.490> in<00:05:59.550> and<00:05:59.910> out<00:06:00.030> the

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
also able to slide these in and out the

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.300 
also able to slide these in and out the
shoulders<00:06:01.170> were<00:06:01.290> quite<00:06:01.500> impressive<00:06:01.830> because

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
shoulders were quite impressive because

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.150 
shoulders were quite impressive because
they<00:06:02.490> are<00:06:02.640> able<00:06:02.910> to<00:06:03.090> pop<00:06:03.450> all<00:06:03.930> the<00:06:03.990> way<00:06:04.710> up<00:06:04.920> as

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
they are able to pop all the way up as

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160 
they are able to pop all the way up as
you<00:06:05.280> can<00:06:05.460> see<00:06:05.670> there<00:06:05.910> and<00:06:06.120> they<00:06:06.660> can<00:06:06.810> come<00:06:06.990> back

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
you can see there and they can come back

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.020 
you can see there and they can come back
down<00:06:07.440> and<00:06:07.470> these<00:06:07.710> blue<00:06:08.070> plates<00:06:08.430> because<00:06:08.880> they

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
down and these blue plates because they

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.850 
down and these blue plates because they
added<00:06:09.270> those<00:06:09.390> on<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.690> top<00:06:09.870> they<00:06:10.470> don't<00:06:10.710> look

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
added those on the top they don't look

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.050 
added those on the top they don't look
out<00:06:11.010> of<00:06:11.100> place<00:06:11.130> when<00:06:11.490> you<00:06:11.580> put<00:06:11.730> them<00:06:11.850> out<00:06:11.940> of

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
out of place when you put them out of

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.030 
out of place when you put them out of
position<00:06:12.420> like<00:06:12.600> that<00:06:12.630> when<00:06:13.500> you<00:06:13.590> slide<00:06:13.860> that

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
position like that when you slide that

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.470 
position like that when you slide that
forward<00:06:14.400> you<00:06:14.490> can<00:06:14.610> have<00:06:14.760> a<00:06:14.790> good<00:06:15.060> range<00:06:15.360> of

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
forward you can have a good range of

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.570 
forward you can have a good range of
mobility<00:06:15.930> with<00:06:15.960> the<00:06:16.200> arm<00:06:16.350> and<00:06:16.620> on<00:06:17.310> the<00:06:17.430> back

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
mobility with the arm and on the back

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.580 
mobility with the arm and on the back
nothing<00:06:18.120> too<00:06:18.300> fancy<00:06:18.510> of<00:06:18.840> course<00:06:19.050> a<00:06:19.140> GN<00:06:19.380> Drive

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
nothing too fancy of course a GN Drive

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.660 
nothing too fancy of course a GN Drive
could<00:06:19.830> go<00:06:19.980> in<00:06:20.100> there<00:06:20.190> if<00:06:20.340> this<00:06:20.430> was<00:06:20.640> a

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
could go in there if this was a

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.400 
could go in there if this was a
different<00:06:20.910> Gundam<00:06:21.300> but<00:06:21.720> we<00:06:21.840> have<00:06:21.990> the<00:06:22.140> three

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
different Gundam but we have the three

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.620 
different Gundam but we have the three
parts<00:06:22.710> here<00:06:23.100> that's<00:06:23.580> going<00:06:23.880> to<00:06:24.000> attach<00:06:24.300> the

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
parts here that's going to attach the

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.890 
parts here that's going to attach the
harness<00:06:25.110> for<00:06:25.740> the<00:06:25.800> GN<00:06:26.250> drives<00:06:26.640> and<00:06:27.030> the<00:06:27.570> final

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
harness for the GN drives and the final

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.450 
harness for the GN drives and the final
thing<00:06:27.990> that<00:06:28.050> they<00:06:28.290> have<00:06:28.530> a<00:06:28.830> they've<00:06:29.280> got<00:06:29.430> a

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
thing that they have a they've got a

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.490 
thing that they have a they've got a
good<00:06:29.940> neck<00:06:30.300> mechanism<00:06:30.900> up<00:06:31.020> here<00:06:31.290> which<00:06:31.470> is

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
good neck mechanism up here which is

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.620 
good neck mechanism up here which is
going<00:06:31.800> to<00:06:31.890> bend<00:06:32.130> forward<00:06:32.400> and<00:06:32.640> back<00:06:32.820> combined

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
going to bend forward and back combined

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.690 
going to bend forward and back combined
with<00:06:33.690> the<00:06:33.900> ball<00:06:34.080> joint<00:06:34.380> on<00:06:34.590> the<00:06:34.620> head<00:06:35.010> that's

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 
with the ball joint on the head that's

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.650 
with the ball joint on the head that's
going<00:06:35.880> to<00:06:35.940> give<00:06:36.060> it<00:06:36.090> a<00:06:36.210> good<00:06:36.330> range<00:06:36.540> of

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
going to give it a good range of

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.630 
going to give it a good range of
mobility<00:06:36.900> but<00:06:37.590> if<00:06:37.710> you<00:06:37.800> slide<00:06:38.130> this<00:06:38.400> white

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
mobility but if you slide this white

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.180 
mobility but if you slide this white
part<00:06:38.880> forward<00:06:39.540> inside<00:06:40.380> there's<00:06:40.620> a<00:06:40.680> tiny

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
part forward inside there's a tiny

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.300 
part forward inside there's a tiny
cockpit<00:06:41.400> and<00:06:41.910> if<00:06:42.390> you<00:06:42.540> crack<00:06:43.380> that<00:06:43.410> open<00:06:43.590> you

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
cockpit and if you crack that open you

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.870 
cockpit and if you crack that open you
have<00:06:44.520> a<00:06:44.550> very<00:06:44.880> well<00:06:45.660> small<00:06:46.500> sets<00:06:47.100> in<00:06:47.220> af<00:06:47.370> se<00:06:47.580> but

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
have a very well small sets in af se but

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.460 
have a very well small sets in af se but
because<00:06:48.150> he's<00:06:48.300> in<00:06:48.450> one<00:06:48.570> sixtieth<00:06:48.990> actually

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
because he's in one sixtieth actually

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.320 
because he's in one sixtieth actually
he's<00:06:49.920> a<00:06:49.950> fairly<00:06:50.250> large<00:06:50.490> figure<00:06:50.880> almost<00:06:51.060> an

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
he's a fairly large figure almost an

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.690 
he's a fairly large figure almost an
inch<00:06:51.480> tall<00:06:51.750> now<00:06:52.710> when<00:06:52.860> I<00:06:52.890> first<00:06:53.190> saw<00:06:53.340> this<00:06:53.490> kit

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:53.700 
inch tall now when I first saw this kit

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.670 
inch tall now when I first saw this kit
constructed<00:06:54.300> I<00:06:54.360> wasn't<00:06:54.750> too<00:06:54.840> crazy<00:06:54.990> about<00:06:55.290> the

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
constructed I wasn't too crazy about the

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.200 
constructed I wasn't too crazy about the
way<00:06:55.830> the<00:06:55.980> chest<00:06:56.250> looked<00:06:56.520> mostly<00:06:56.880> because<00:06:57.000> it

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210 
way the chest looked mostly because it

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.060 
way the chest looked mostly because it
was<00:06:57.240> exposing<00:06:57.810> a<00:06:57.900> lot<00:06:58.140> of<00:06:58.320> inner<00:06:58.500> frame<00:06:58.830> etc

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070 
was exposing a lot of inner frame etc

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.490 
was exposing a lot of inner frame etc
and<00:06:59.580> I<00:07:00.000> sort<00:07:00.270> of<00:07:00.360> preferred<00:07:00.660> the<00:07:00.810> clean<00:07:01.140> look

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
and I sort of preferred the clean look

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.110 
and I sort of preferred the clean look
of<00:07:01.740> the<00:07:01.920> high-grade<00:07:02.370> here<00:07:02.640> you<00:07:02.760> can<00:07:02.880> really

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
of the high-grade here you can really

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.730 
of the high-grade here you can really
see<00:07:03.270> how<00:07:03.420> simple<00:07:03.810> this<00:07:03.900> is<00:07:04.080> with<00:07:04.230> the<00:07:04.320> red<00:07:04.500> part

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
see how simple this is with the red part

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.170 
see how simple this is with the red part
blue<00:07:04.980> parts<00:07:05.280> and<00:07:05.430> just<00:07:05.460> put<00:07:05.730> a<00:07:05.760> little<00:07:05.820> bit<00:07:06.060> of

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
blue parts and just put a little bit of

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.930 
blue parts and just put a little bit of
grey<00:07:06.330> in<00:07:06.510> between<00:07:06.840> but<00:07:07.770> once<00:07:08.520> you<00:07:08.640> actually

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 
grey in between but once you actually

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.490 
grey in between but once you actually
put<00:07:09.090> this<00:07:09.210> together<00:07:09.390> the<00:07:09.870> detail<00:07:10.290> that<00:07:10.320> goes

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 
put this together the detail that goes

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.740 
put this together the detail that goes
into<00:07:10.830> the<00:07:10.980> inner<00:07:11.160> frame<00:07:11.460> is<00:07:11.820> going<00:07:12.480> to<00:07:12.600> make

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
into the inner frame is going to make

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.050 
into the inner frame is going to make
you<00:07:12.930> appreciate<00:07:13.380> this<00:07:13.830> a<00:07:13.980> lot<00:07:14.370> more<00:07:14.700> than<00:07:14.940> if

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 
you appreciate this a lot more than if

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.400 
you appreciate this a lot more than if
you're<00:07:15.180> just<00:07:15.330> looking<00:07:15.540> at<00:07:15.810> it<00:07:15.960> aesthetically

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.410 
you're just looking at it aesthetically

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.920 
you're just looking at it aesthetically
so<00:07:17.130> I<00:07:17.160> am<00:07:17.550> now<00:07:17.760> a<00:07:17.790> big<00:07:18.090> fan<00:07:18.300> of<00:07:18.330> this<00:07:18.600> despite

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:18.930 
so I am now a big fan of this despite

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.480 
so I am now a big fan of this despite
the<00:07:18.990> fact<00:07:19.140> that<00:07:19.890> I<00:07:19.920> would<00:07:20.130> have<00:07:20.220> preferred

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490 
the fact that I would have preferred

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.640 
the fact that I would have preferred
something<00:07:20.700> clean<00:07:21.060> and<00:07:21.270> simple<00:07:21.420> before<00:07:21.750> now

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:22.650 
something clean and simple before now

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.280 
something clean and simple before now
I've<00:07:23.190> been<00:07:23.460> one<00:07:23.670> over<00:07:23.970> the<00:07:24.750> shoulders<00:07:25.110> come

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:25.290 
I've been one over the shoulders come

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.140 
I've been one over the shoulders come
with<00:07:25.440> a<00:07:25.470> complete<00:07:25.920> inner<00:07:26.220> frame<00:07:26.610> so<00:07:26.940> if<00:07:27.060> you

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150 
with a complete inner frame so if you

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.790 
with a complete inner frame so if you
did<00:07:27.300> not<00:07:27.570> want<00:07:27.780> to<00:07:27.870> put<00:07:27.990> on<00:07:28.020> any<00:07:28.230> of<00:07:28.410> this<00:07:28.530> outer

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 
did not want to put on any of this outer

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.410 
did not want to put on any of this outer
armor<00:07:29.190> you<00:07:29.310> could<00:07:29.520> just<00:07:29.700> have<00:07:29.850> an<00:07:29.970> all-black

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:30.420 
armor you could just have an all-black

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.000 
armor you could just have an all-black
double-o<00:07:31.080> Gundam<00:07:31.350> which<00:07:31.470> would<00:07:31.680> look<00:07:31.800> pretty

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.010 
double-o Gundam which would look pretty

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.710 
double-o Gundam which would look pretty
cool<00:07:32.220> but<00:07:32.850> the<00:07:32.940> first<00:07:33.120> thing<00:07:33.270> that<00:07:33.390> I<00:07:33.450> saw<00:07:33.600> when

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 
cool but the first thing that I saw when

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.960 
cool but the first thing that I saw when
I<00:07:33.750> saw<00:07:33.960> these<00:07:34.170> was<00:07:34.410> while<00:07:35.220> they<00:07:35.610> sort<00:07:35.820> of

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:35.970 
I saw these was while they sort of

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.730 
I saw these was while they sort of
scream<00:07:36.390> double<00:07:36.840> o<00:07:36.930> quanta<00:07:37.380> with<00:07:37.530> their

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 
scream double o quanta with their

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.520 
scream double o quanta with their
assembly<00:07:38.400> here<00:07:39.110> here's<00:07:40.110> a<00:07:40.200> look<00:07:40.350> at<00:07:40.470> the

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.530 
assembly here here's a look at the

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:41.990 
assembly here here's a look at the
high-grade<00:07:40.890> shoulders<00:07:41.460> and<00:07:41.640> you<00:07:41.700> really<00:07:41.910> get

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 
high-grade shoulders and you really get

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.790 
high-grade shoulders and you really get
an<00:07:42.120> idea<00:07:42.420> of<00:07:42.540> just<00:07:42.600> how<00:07:42.810> simple<00:07:43.170> these<00:07:43.380> are<00:07:43.440> and

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 
an idea of just how simple these are and

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.170 
an idea of just how simple these are and
of<00:07:44.280> course<00:07:44.520> because<00:07:44.850> we're<00:07:44.970> going<00:07:45.060> to<00:07:45.120> have

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.180 
of course because we're going to have

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.630 
of course because we're going to have
the<00:07:45.330> GN<00:07:45.630> drives<00:07:45.930> of<00:07:46.530> hanging<00:07:47.250> over<00:07:47.520> these

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:47.640 
the GN drives of hanging over these

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.610 
the GN drives of hanging over these
these<00:07:48.210> really<00:07:48.270> do<00:07:48.750> have<00:07:48.960> to<00:07:49.080> be<00:07:49.200> sort<00:07:49.440> of<00:07:49.500> out

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:49.620 
these really do have to be sort of out

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.840 
these really do have to be sort of out
of<00:07:49.650> the<00:07:49.740> way<00:07:49.890> but<00:07:50.100> I<00:07:50.130> appreciate<00:07:50.640> the<00:07:50.730> fact

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:50.850 
of the way but I appreciate the fact

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.950 
of the way but I appreciate the fact
that<00:07:51.060> they<00:07:51.150> put<00:07:51.270> in<00:07:51.390> that<00:07:51.450> little<00:07:51.660> bit<00:07:51.870> of

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 
that they put in that little bit of

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.320 
that they put in that little bit of
inner<00:07:52.080> frame<00:07:52.380> exposed<00:07:52.860> just<00:07:53.669> to<00:07:53.790> sort<00:07:54.000> of<00:07:54.090> up

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:54.330 
inner frame exposed just to sort of up

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.260 
inner frame exposed just to sort of up
the<00:07:54.960> aesthetic<00:07:55.440> value<00:07:55.470> of<00:07:55.950> this<00:07:56.160> this<00:07:57.000> looks

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:57.270 
the aesthetic value of this this looks

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.400 
the aesthetic value of this this looks
like<00:07:57.419> it's<00:07:57.600> running<00:07:57.840> a<00:07:57.900> little<00:07:57.930> bit<00:07:58.169> long<00:07:58.350> so

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:58.410 
like it's running a little bit long so

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.020 
like it's running a little bit long so
stay<00:07:58.890> tuned<00:07:59.100> for<00:07:59.310> the<00:07:59.370> next<00:07:59.460> part<00:07:59.610> where<00:07:59.940> I'll

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.030 
stay tuned for the next part where I'll

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.940 
stay tuned for the next part where I'll
finish<00:08:00.390> up<00:08:00.690> a<00:08:00.810> look<00:08:00.990> at<00:08:01.169> all<00:08:01.320> these<00:08:01.500> parts

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:01.950 
finish up a look at all these parts

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.280 
finish up a look at all these parts
before<00:08:02.370> we<00:08:02.490> finally<00:08:02.940> put<00:08:03.090> it<00:08:03.180> together<00:08:03.330> thanks

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:04.290
