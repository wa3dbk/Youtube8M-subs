00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
hair like how it looks like after you

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.640 
hair like how it looks like after you
get<00:04:49.400> out<00:04:49.490> of<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.729> ocean<00:04:50.210> so<00:04:51.139> just<00:04:51.380> add<00:04:51.620> a

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
get out of the ocean so just add a

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.350 
get out of the ocean so just add a
little<00:04:52.070> bit<00:04:52.280> of<00:04:52.340> salt<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:54.400> this<00:04:55.400> is<00:04:55.610> just<00:04:55.910> sea

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
little bit of salt and this is just sea

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.040 
little bit of salt and this is just sea
salt<00:04:56.630> so<00:04:57.340> yeah<00:04:58.340> I<00:04:58.669> mean<00:04:59.090> you<00:04:59.240> can<00:04:59.389> use<00:04:59.540> iodized

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
salt so yeah I mean you can use iodized

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.350 
salt so yeah I mean you can use iodized
salt<00:05:00.350> too<00:05:00.889> like<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.340> kind<00:05:01.639> you<00:05:02.000> use<00:05:02.030> in<00:05:02.330> your

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
salt too like the kind you use in your

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.990 
salt too like the kind you use in your
food<00:05:02.660> I've<00:05:03.590> used<00:05:03.919> all<00:05:04.070> kinds<00:05:04.550> and<00:05:04.700> it<00:05:04.790> still

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
food I've used all kinds and it still

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.940 
food I've used all kinds and it still
works<00:05:05.180> but<00:05:05.810> sea<00:05:06.020> salt<00:05:06.260> sounds<00:05:06.590> like<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.830> best

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
works but sea salt sounds like the best

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.219 
works but sea salt sounds like the best
result<00:05:07.510> and<00:05:08.510> then<00:05:08.630> they<00:05:08.720> actually<00:05:08.900> come

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
result and then they actually come

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.180 
result and then they actually come
together<00:05:09.410> and<00:05:09.820> then<00:05:10.820> this<00:05:10.970> looks<00:05:11.180> like<00:05:12.080> a<00:05:12.410> long

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
together and then this looks like a long

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.940 
together and then this looks like a long
time<00:05:13.490> so<00:05:14.060> really<00:05:14.900> when<00:05:15.080> you<00:05:15.200> spray<00:05:15.530> it<00:05:15.740> you

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
time so really when you spray it you

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.090 
time so really when you spray it you
don't<00:05:16.130> need<00:05:16.550> to<00:05:16.610> put<00:05:17.000> that<00:05:17.240> much<00:05:17.539> on<00:05:18.100> like

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
don't need to put that much on like

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.550 
don't need to put that much on like
right<00:05:19.310> now<00:05:19.460> I<00:05:19.490> would<00:05:20.060> say<00:05:20.300> that<00:05:20.570> my<00:05:20.750> hair<00:05:21.050> does

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
right now I would say that my hair does

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.590 
right now I would say that my hair does
not<00:05:21.590> need<00:05:22.220> it<00:05:22.430> because<00:05:22.640> I'm<00:05:23.030> kind<00:05:23.330> of<00:05:23.390> happy

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
not need it because I'm kind of happy

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.630 
not need it because I'm kind of happy
with<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:24.320> way<00:05:24.500> it<00:05:24.770> looks<00:05:24.979> because<00:05:25.250> it's<00:05:25.490> not

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
with the way it looks because it's not

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.940 
with the way it looks because it's not
like<00:05:25.820> super<00:05:26.120> frizzy<00:05:26.419> right<00:05:26.750> now<00:05:26.900> because<00:05:27.830> I

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.960 
just washed it which makes it like very
soft<00:05:30.639> but<00:05:31.639> if<00:05:32.000> my<00:05:32.270> hair<00:05:32.570> were<00:05:32.960> to<00:05:33.260> be<00:05:33.760> not<00:05:34.760> the

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
soft but if my hair were to be not the

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.270
