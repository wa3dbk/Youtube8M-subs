first<00:00:24.060> question<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.720> how<00:00:24.930> fast<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.800> faster

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.190 
first question is how fast is faster

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.609 
first question is how fast is faster
it's<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.390> fast<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.900> wouldn't<00:00:28.170> even<00:00:28.230> see<00:00:28.500> it

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
it's so fast you wouldn't even see it

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.170 
it's so fast you wouldn't even see it
it's<00:00:28.800> just<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.160> fad<00:00:29.340> boom<00:00:29.520> it's<00:00:29.699> gone<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:30.000> see

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
it's just a fad boom it's gone you see

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.509 
it's just a fad boom it's gone you see
it<00:00:30.270> what<00:00:31.230> does<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:33.710> give<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.800> more<00:00:34.830> give<00:00:35.370> me

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
it what does it give you more give me

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:38.810 
it what does it give you more give me

movie that is kick-ass well I think well

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.040 
movie that is kick-ass well I think well
there's<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.910> lot<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.180> ass-kicking<00:02:03.720> in<00:02:03.960> the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.880 
movie I think just in turn because he
has<00:02:05.940> a<00:02:05.970> gun<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.540> these<00:02:06.690> individuals<00:02:07.290> pay<00:02:07.500> and

has a gun and these individuals pay and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.570 
has a gun and these individuals pay and
he<00:02:08.070> takes<00:02:08.340> their<00:02:08.550> life<00:02:09.740> but<00:02:10.740> I<00:02:10.800> think<00:02:10.950> what

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
he takes their life but I think what

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.400 
he takes their life but I think what
makes<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.090> movie<00:02:12.390> for<00:02:12.810> me<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.080> think<00:02:13.140> what

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
makes the movie for me and I think what

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.870 
makes the movie for me and I think what
makes<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.709> movie<00:02:13.860> for<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.190> audience<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.730> when

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
makes the movie for the audience is when

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.240 
makes the movie for the audience is when
they<00:02:14.970> go<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.840> action<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.500> driven<00:02:17.130> by

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
they go is that the action is driven by

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.850 
they go is that the action is driven by
emotion<00:02:17.760> if<00:02:17.910> it's<00:02:18.090> emotional<00:02:19.080> action<00:02:19.500> it's

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
emotion if it's emotional action it's

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.350 
emotion if it's emotional action it's
not<00:02:19.920> big<00:02:20.190> explosions<00:02:20.820> for<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.150> sake<00:02:21.330> of

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
not big explosions for the sake of

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.449 
not big explosions for the sake of
explosions<00:02:22.050> there's<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.830> time<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.250> place<00:02:23.340> for

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
explosions there's a time and place for

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.160 
explosions there's a time and place for
that<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.910> movies<00:02:24.180> but<00:02:24.600> it's<00:02:24.780> not<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.080> this

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
that in the movies but it's not in this

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
it's justified and it's driven by

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.880 
it's justified and it's driven by
emotion<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.700> these<00:02:35.910> scenes<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:37.260> it's<00:02:37.800> a

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
emotion and in these scenes and it's a

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.890 
emotion and in these scenes and it's a

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
Steve McQueen movies Charles Bronson

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.670 
Steve McQueen movies Charles Bronson
movies<00:02:44.070> were<00:02:44.250> every<00:02:45.030> action<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.870> driven<00:02:46.080> by<00:02:46.350> a

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
movies were every action is driven by a

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.880 
movies were every action is driven by a
solid<00:02:47.280> emotion<00:02:48.200> expecting<00:02:51.410> how<00:02:52.410> do<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.650> feel

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
solid emotion expecting how do you feel

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.340 
solid emotion expecting how do you feel
this<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.640> people<00:02:53.970> would<00:02:54.090> react<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.570> this<00:02:54.900> it's

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
this the people would react to this it's

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.949 
this the people would react to this it's
like<00:02:55.590> finally<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.310> bad<00:02:57.269> guys<00:02:57.540> are<00:02:57.750> paying

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
like finally the bad guys are paying

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.000 
like finally the bad guys are paying
well<00:02:58.950> there's<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.459> lot<00:02:59.670> of<00:03:00.170> justice<00:03:01.170> being

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
well there's a lot of justice being

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.670 
well there's a lot of justice being
served<00:03:02.600> but<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.660> think<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:03.989> audiences<00:03:04.620> are

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
served but I think the audiences are

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.860 
served but I think the audiences are
gonna<00:03:04.799> respond<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.220> this<00:03:05.370> but<00:03:05.760> aside<00:03:06.540> from<00:03:06.600> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
gonna respond to this but aside from the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.180 
gonna respond to this but aside from the
fact<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:07.170> think<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.380> action<00:03:07.799> and<00:03:07.980> always

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
fact I think the action and always

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.039 
fact I think the action and always
kicking<00:03:08.549> ass<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.000> he's<00:03:09.090> finding<00:03:09.510> bad<00:03:09.780> guys

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
kicking ass and he's finding bad guys

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.310 
kicking ass and he's finding bad guys
and<00:03:10.350> he's<00:03:11.120> putting<00:03:12.120> bullets<00:03:12.540> between<00:03:13.140> their

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
and he's putting bullets between their

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.000 
and he's putting bullets between their
eyes<00:03:13.530> one<00:03:14.400> guy<00:03:14.580> for<00:03:14.640> example<00:03:14.850> is<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.239> pedophile

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
eyes one guy for example is a pedophile

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.229 
eyes one guy for example is a pedophile
bullet<00:03:17.010> right<00:03:17.160> between<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.580> eyes<00:03:17.610> much

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
bullet right between the eyes much

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.050 
bullet right between the eyes much
deserving<00:03:19.280> but<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.340> think<00:03:20.610> what<00:03:20.760> they're<00:03:20.910> also

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
deserving but I think what they're also

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.539 
deserving but I think what they're also
