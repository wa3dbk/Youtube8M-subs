00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
think the key is in the food you feed

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.940 
think the key is in the food you feed
them<00:02:01.090> you<00:02:01.300> have<00:02:01.720> to<00:02:01.899> feed<00:02:02.170> them<00:02:02.289> like<00:02:02.440> I<00:02:02.679> feed

them you have to feed them like I feed
them<00:02:03.099> and<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.369> think<00:02:03.640> you'll<00:02:03.789> have<00:02:03.970> success
