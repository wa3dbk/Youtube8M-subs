00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.220 
yeah I think this plate is a little bit
too<00:02:44.140> small<00:02:44.970> well<00:02:45.970> here<00:02:46.510> we<00:02:46.660> are<00:02:46.690> on<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:46.959> bigger

too small well here we are on a bigger

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.559 
too small well here we are on a bigger
plate<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:48.120> naturally<00:02:49.120> we're<00:02:49.270> going<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.450> have

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
plate and naturally we're going to have

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.420
