leaving the site sections up because I'm

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.340 
leaving the site sections up because I'm
going<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.260> do<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.500> sides<00:02:35.800> last<00:02:37.050> what<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.200> see

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
going to do the sides last what you see

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.800 
going to do the sides last what you see
me<00:02:38.470> doing<00:02:38.500> often<00:02:39.310> as<00:02:39.489> folding<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.150> twisting

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
me doing often as folding is twisting

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.630 
me doing often as folding is twisting
the<00:02:40.930> twist<00:02:41.260> on<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.709> each<00:02:41.830> other<00:02:42.040> then<00:02:42.370> pinning

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
the twist on to each other then pinning

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.400 
the twist on to each other then pinning
them<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:42.940> do<00:02:43.239> this<00:02:43.540> because<00:02:43.600> when<00:02:44.020> it<00:02:44.170> helps<00:02:44.380> to

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
them I do this because when it helps to

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.900 
them I do this because when it helps to
sell<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.860> moisture<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.430> even<00:02:45.640> further

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
sell the moisture and even further

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.790 
sell the moisture and even further
because<00:02:46.360> when<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.750> hair<00:02:46.989> is<00:02:47.020> on<00:02:47.260> top<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.680> each

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
because when the hair is on top of each

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.920 
because when the hair is on top of each
other<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.280> seems<00:02:48.820> as<00:02:49.060> if<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.360> water<00:02:49.630> can't

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
other it seems as if the water can't

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.199 
other it seems as if the water can't
escape<00:02:50.320> it<00:02:50.980> can't<00:02:51.250> evaporate<00:02:51.489> into<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.000> air

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
escape it can't evaporate into the air

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.030 
escape it can't evaporate into the air
as<00:02:52.450> fast<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.140> one<00:02:53.320> of<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.440> biggest<00:02:53.590> issues<00:02:53.920> of
