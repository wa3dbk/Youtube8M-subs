00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 what's up I'm javier prior of 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.210
 apnea dotcom training and in this 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.280
 video I want to explain to you I want to talk 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.639
 on the tube it seems very simple and 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.740
 it is but I want to give you two 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.900
 recommendations for with the tube when 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.289
 go to do apnea the first of them 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.199
 is that you take it off that you take off when 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.810
 go to dive to the bottom of the sea 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.769
 you're going to avoid several various things the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.679
 first of all you're going to win an extra 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.530
 of oxygen because because when we 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.079
 we exhale air we are throwing co2 out 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.050
 agree and when we inhale we put 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.149
 air with oxygen with which if I have 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.129
 this is an extension of apra 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.530
 that this is an extension of the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.640
 trachea with which if I'm exhaling 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.850
 this is going to fill up with co2 in the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.420
 exhalation 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.489
 however, if I am on the surface 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.100
 I can go diving where I'm going to 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.729
 do the immersion with the tube can 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.680
 to swim or breathe with the 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.290
 tube but when I'm going to do in the 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.310
 immersion after the relaxation I 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.310
 I can remove the tube 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.550
 and take a tube and I'm going to save everything 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:22.040
 this of oxygen - depleted air 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.890
 agreement because if I exhaled 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.010
 this is going to be left with pigs 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.200
 and when I get fresh air I'm going to put this 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.560
 I was with him 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.479
 well that on the one hand 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.880
 another one of the other reasons why 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.890
 that the very important reasons for the 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.950
 that I think you should take off the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.439
 tube is because if we go down to the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.860
 background and we go up and I know you're 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:53.210
 doing your apneas very well and it's not going 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.640
 to give nor a syncope of agreement but in 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:01.210
 the hypothetical case that I gave you a 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:04.840
 syncope of agreement if you take the tube 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.790
 and if you had your knees towards 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.069
 up with the chest pulls up 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.750
 towards the surface 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.280
 and leave with the mouth with the tracks 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.770
 Respiratory out of water 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.600
 and you recover is unconsciously with 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:24.770
 the tube you can not revive according to 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.830
 that's another important thing and in third 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.830
 place 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.260
 the tube without the tube will stop 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.480
 feel 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.049
 those uncomfortable vibrations that there 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.099
 when we go down to the bottom that is doing 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.659
 so the book in the tube when we go up 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.599
 you will stop feeling those vibrations 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:49.579
 It's not much but it's good 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.530
 less distraction for the mind with what 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.690
 which you can really concentrate on 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.379
 keep all your muscles well you 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.209
 I want to explain how you can do 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.640
 to remove the tube 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.470
 but one more thing what what yes that 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.250
 I recommend you that the tube go for a 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.620
 side and the mask go by another is to say 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.180
 those masks and tubes that are glued 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.299
 of each other so you do not miss out on 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.030
 what good when we do apnea 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:20.349
 or spearfishing we are doing something 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.349
 very specific we are 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.349
 athletes and professionals of this with 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.800
 which we know what we are doing 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.280
 is 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.560
 good is a recommendation because 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.240
 We will make the task easier for our 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.730
 partner 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.820
 in case there was a syncope if 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.950
 we go down without the tube when we go down to the 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.370
 surface but we have hooked up 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.880
 is going to be bothering us according 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.460
 then I will explain how 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.140
 I take like like to see how 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:59.380
 could you take the tube off 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.380
 when you go down to the bottom of the sea 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.240
 you wear the mask 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.670
 and the tube goes here in agreement that it's 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.620
 easy access 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.000
 and when you're going to take it off when you 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.000
 you're going to submerge is like that 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.019
 and you can give it to your partner with a 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.449
 pull 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.990
 You can take it away from me like this 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:29.560
 how good this is the recommendation of 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.509
 is this video if you liked it 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.759
 some comment write comments me 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:37.240
 I love reading comments and tried to 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:39.340
 answer all the questions that I 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.030
 do people so do not cut or 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.580
 a hair 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.500
 write your comment what do you think about 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.000
 the video if you liked it if it has not 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.330
 liked if the week different from what 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.169
 risks question question everything and try 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.460
 to answer you 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.770
 to all these videos if you liked 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.319

 Share it with your friends and if you see this 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:00.979
 video on some other web page that 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.379
 know that apnea training 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.969
 puntocom you have more videos like this and 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.550
 you have a high video area 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:09.969
 definition with master classes that you have 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.969
 a good day
