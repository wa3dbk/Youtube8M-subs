00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
six so next thing that I mentioned in

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.109 
six so next thing that I mentioned in
the<00:02:07.409> trailer<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.979> additional<00:02:08.610> missions<00:02:08.970> for

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the trailer is additional missions for

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.999 
the trailer is additional missions for
Aiden<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:10.080> didn't<00:02:10.379> really<00:02:10.560> go<00:02:10.769> into<00:02:10.830> detail

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
Aiden that didn't really go into detail

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.089 
Aiden that didn't really go into detail
with<00:02:11.370> what<00:02:11.730> missions<00:02:12.150> they<00:02:12.330> sort<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.599> just

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
with what missions they sort of just

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.710 
with what missions they sort of just
showed<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.129> snippet<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:14.640> sort<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.180> cutscene<00:02:15.569> I

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
showed a snippet of sort of a cutscene I

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.770 
showed a snippet of sort of a cutscene I
guess<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.260> yeah<00:02:17.010> it's<00:02:17.519> just<00:02:17.790> additional<00:02:18.150> sort

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
guess so yeah it's just additional sort

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.600 
guess so yeah it's just additional sort
of<00:02:18.840> missions<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.290> guess<00:02:19.500> now<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.950> next<00:02:20.040> one<00:02:20.280> is

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
of missions I guess now the next one is

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.650 
of missions I guess now the next one is
a<00:02:20.640> bit<00:02:20.849> um<00:02:21.500> touchy<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.709> guess<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:24.239> trailer

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
a bit um touchy I guess so the trailer

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.690 
a bit um touchy I guess so the trailer
that<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.840> originally<00:02:25.080> saw<00:02:25.500> was<00:02:25.890> an<00:02:26.069> American

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
that I originally saw was an American

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.309 
that I originally saw was an American
trailer<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.060> guess<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.660> then<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:27.989> saw<00:02:28.260> the

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
trailer I guess and then I saw the

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.350 
trailer I guess and then I saw the
Australian<00:02:28.799> trailer<00:02:29.040> after<00:02:29.250> i<00:02:29.459> had<00:02:29.640> read<00:02:29.910> some
