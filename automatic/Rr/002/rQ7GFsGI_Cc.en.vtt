00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.049
 Hi there, this is a review of the game which 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.680
 enters 

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:10.050
 top 5 paid games google play grow 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.670
 Survival let's see what it is 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.820
 the game is so wonderful 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.699
 so reworked over 50 percent of the game 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.039
 new map and weapon graphics multiplayer 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.580
 so far removed multiplayer and zombies wait 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.410
 new update 35 rubles for what I 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.590
 paid 35 rubles to wait though 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.840
 no one forced me I decided 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.070
 look at all actually grow 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.630
 Survival it 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.899
 sort of yes and z on android let's 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.980
 let's see what it is and yes z anyway 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:46.800
 so does the elite go crazy how fast 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.829
 loaded on and we are already in the game 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.360
 here at once the tree is, in principle, not bad 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.850
 pretty christmas tree high good 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.770
 leaves of normal color so let's go 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:07.799
 further we will go on the fire now we 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:10.380
 take what fire quick grabbed everything 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:16.049
 bonfire i think this is the goal of the game and i 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:21.560
 conquered i conquered ran away ran away the fire 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:26.540
 on you not bad wholesale something else 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:30.299
 ax ax i have a weapon now 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.700
 the graphics are wonderful i can't say 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.920
 that she's so bad or good 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.430
 normal graphics so fast now 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.180
 I will come here on business here nowhere to go 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.460
 things go so well let's go 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.229
 look around look around there is a button 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.920
 run there is a jump button already 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.509
 wonderful 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.040
 everything is good, but burdocks are growing 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.060
 such burdock grow big 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.850
 good burdock further in principle 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.759
 terrain pretty 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.939
 rocky clouds clouds beautiful 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.390
 such a nice picture 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:11.770
 clouds everywhere trees but true no neither 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.380
 mobs are not people 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.010
 that is, you walk here alone 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.050
 studying the map well here I come some 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.240
 bastion will now grab it with 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.730
 there is no one with an ax but no here 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.720
 tired or homeless and so here will be 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:36.640
 look like zombies stand to stand, in principle, 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:39.040
 nice look of the zombies just odd 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.330
 somehow moves right now okay 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:47.650
 about the box I will go with the box wanted to become about 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:52.210
 you can pick up the box fell out you can 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.420
 Halsa life break look like in 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.750
 bunk third so what else is there 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:04.020
 do what else to rise now 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:08.260
 let's go up let's see what's about 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.750
 got up look around nothing 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.700
 there is no interesting 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.450
 im jaguar already switch interesting i can 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:20.550
 now disarmed with weapons now 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:28.260
 no weapon green button 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:28.260
 now we will press so in 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.070
 here I was already greeted slandered mobs 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.640
 no thousands 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.260
 I lie down until the rest of the testimony in 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.750
 principle how do you see the idea pretty 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.810
 still a good game promises to be 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.420
 interesting kinda like nutuz only 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.000
 burdock as if not yet be interesting 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.590
 Only now it is not clear Chon and not completed a 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.870
 Already sold not to the same 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.640
 fifth place 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.220
 is it really so easy to take the fifth place 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.660
 among paid games 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:09.370
 Well, I think there is no close 10 card limit 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.820
 nakarka nakarkal limit map there is 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:17.799
 and it is exciting to capture and 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.850
 all the hell know how to get out of here 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.830
 it was a review
