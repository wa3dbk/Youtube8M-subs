00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.300
 stuck 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.249
 after the new working there is not 

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:09.849
 this is a new bike an institution 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.059
 and we leave him the defender is a possibility for Heerenveen 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:17.189
 the past 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.320
 those who are being prosecuted in the committee are popular 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.729
 this means that using a small boat on the bike is just for you 

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:29.810
 elderly no it has been easy to use and for those who are interesting 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.500
 what must they be a fine when their forces have had to pay he 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.629
 added hence it is partly about time so it was about these two dealers 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.350
 what better to view 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.990
 the experience experts from the local bicycle specialist shop in Arnhem 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.000
 explain the status of superstar who have this choice in time with the bike there 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.480
 is a 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.860
 the normal price 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.320
 provided that 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.400
 but the power goes on the trappers 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.350
 damn the bike will help you 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.170
 that is especially if you want or cycle 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.050
 if you are a bike it is very nice so i think most are from ajax 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.700
 always the minus in the air 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.460
 It is important to take this into account with an electric bicycle 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.910
 petacchi I have different types 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.450
 first a bike with a new challenge especially suitable for people 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.980
 which a little more 9 so that means that only the Veenendaal is 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.970
 powered yourself but by the center of gravity it is also completely 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.370
 below the middle 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.530
 and as the pain and the most in dialogue situation 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.480
 what is also a very nice bike is so that is a somewhat lighter bike this game 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.670
 is the eighteenth sitting in the back 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.180
 with rear - wheel drive, which means that the center of gravity of the bicycle is on 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.750
 backside 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.700
 well that is all the city better said but if that you have a center of gravity 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.790
 on the front side 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.790
 with driven wheels that's a bit less 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.860
 but there is it with the battery life and the cheaper bikes there is also one 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.200
 we sell good ones at the back 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.290
 of a question for your kind, which increases the capacity of the battery 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.530
 is less so that the service life is less 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.299
 aegon is going to investigate year 50 meters free give five years to the cars 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.700
 Recalls buffer building a great chance of anouk dying 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.879
 for that a weapon always becomes the forces that the episode itself receives 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.879
 only how long the power can deliver and that difference can add up 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:21.329
 so if at rest in the cyclist city traffic used pass as an app 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.299
 that can last much longer 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.749
 like someone going that long way to go on vacations with an 80 nine 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:27.849
 kilometers per day 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.159
 because it will fall short at some point 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:34.959
 shares say the length of the ret and then you can consider getting one 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.689
 to buy a new battery 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:42.899
 Danny Boyle's reading may vary but assume a minimum of 15 100 3000 euros 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.729
 the difference lies mainly in the quality of the batteries 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:50.359
 The most important advantage is the fact that you continue to fall for that 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.969
 yes then you will not get a worse condition you will be poorly distributed 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:55.489
 in short 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.489
 a good mode of transportation 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:04.979
 from
