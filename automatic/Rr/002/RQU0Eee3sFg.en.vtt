time so you can create infinite mana

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.100 
time so you can create infinite mana
well<00:01:02.370> there's<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.610> tough<00:01:02.970> to<00:01:03.570> set<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.930> because

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
well there's a tough to set up because

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.040 
well there's a tough to set up because
it<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.290> semi<00:01:04.680> slow<00:01:04.970> but<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.120> basis<00:01:06.480> is<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
it is semi slow but the basis is just a

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.530 
it is semi slow but the basis is just a
blue<00:01:07.470> red<00:01:07.710> control<00:01:08.100> deck<00:01:08.310> built<00:01:08.880> around<00:01:09.210> that

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
blue red control deck built around that

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.630 
blue red control deck built around that
so<00:01:09.750> we're<00:01:09.840> just<00:01:09.870> trying<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.200> survive<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.860> the
