00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.180
 Welcome to my third departure 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.020
 and tutorials we may already 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.850
 I realized I was alone without 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.189
 sebastian work will be next 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.960
 tutorial promise to be there tutorial 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.129
 I only stop now because of special 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.960
 do not start because I'll show you today 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.370
 a fourth technique for picking up with the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.580
 wrist as in intro perhaps already 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.110
 have analyzed and I almost again 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.089
 the role generally together and 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.670
 Of course, something about the individual 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.670
 Techniques at the end of video 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.080
 So let's start first step 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.270
 unwind foot 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.350
 Of course this is with our technology 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.230
 normal land 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:19.100
 you know just before going down more 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:23.420
 or less the 90 degrees but not 90 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.180
 do not forget grad so thank you and 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.020
 if you are then and you are then 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.290
 the hand position 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.610
 if you have your wrist or her 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.500
 back of your hand when you touch down you have to 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.490
 watch what you weigh 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.009
 if you shift your weight 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.720
 here on the back of the hand then relocated 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.970
 it may be that something crack here 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.400
 characterized by something and dusty 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.490
 or overstretched that means we 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.090
 do not lose our weight on this 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.220
 but here on hinged where that of these 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.659
 Hard bone is that is very sturdy 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:07.520
 nothing happens yes you are sitting your hand 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:10.970
 on or you end up coming 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.820
 down let your arm here as a 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.130
 rotate 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.680
 as long or about as fast as that 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.390
 Put your finger on the wrist 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.250
 Or you can do that first with the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.230
 Back on cities and then on 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.070
 wrist main thing he comes up 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.709
 Wrist after putting up I show 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.180
 you are still allowed to roll yourselves 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.000
 For example, you are not allowed to 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.570
 then go down and down 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.470
 well, no 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.580
 but you can not do it 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.590
 bring much except that you the 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:50.209
 shoulder to skin so you come down 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.280
 the arm still outstretched and then 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.560
 you look forward to the whole arm 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.420
 for her shoulder then comes over the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.209
 move 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.209
 that is landing and one 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.670
 the advent of the legs all the rest 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.860
 everything stays the same 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.070
 Just put it on and how you are 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.780
 is rolled over a bit changed 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.310
 We may ask in slow motion 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.170
 I've already seen one enter 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.570
 a little bit did not eat so much 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.170
 shoulder just touched the ground 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.740
 lift your shoulder or you may 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.350
 buckle a bit 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.710
 but not so much workshop said 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.610
 Roll over the short arms again 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.640
 the role in the fast run 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.030
 summarized when patrick storm 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.750
 So do not turn to truth 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.280
 Shortly then land stretched 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:52.070
 that does not mean somehow landed like that 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:56.540
 Lena not like that and then you go then us 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:58.520
 you go down to less than 90 degrees animal 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.630
 or more like 90 degrees in the angle 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.220
 both have then comes just the technology 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.830
 positions her life and finally all 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.330
 two three or four 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.230
 you want to get over your shoulders 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.630
 right or left 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.380
 As we wanted to see I wanted that 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:17.180
 left-handed of the miracle to public 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.470
 or right thigh left or 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.690
 right-handed lands or we comes up 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.030
 as I have shown in unrolling couple 2 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.460
 then you can still left or the 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.350
 right hand as a push for on spa for 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.390
 It is important to get up when 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.570
 you think you are not 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.590
 somehow shoulder to skin for me 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.590
 just the stretch jump is 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.710
 Now we'll get to the next 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.870
 point which technique such operations 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.660
 or should I ever only one 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.430
 I personally do the technique 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.800
 my technicals vary when i am 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.500
 knitting a further jump of a 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.530
 makes large up I have an enormous amount of 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.100
 swing enormous speed at the same time 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.860
 the height 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:17.300
 that's where I go especially deep into the 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.580
 knee and technology three apply technology 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.449
 four 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:25.520
 then I'm already doing something 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.600
 Wrist only when I go 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.039
 no gloves on 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.870
 then I prefer to take mine 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.270
 methods has occupied hands and you 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.810
 Just technology and just year 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.930
 Technique three is doing a lot of work 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.220
 absorb 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.780
 Of course, it's up to you whether you 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:46.639
 technology uses a for everything 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:49.270
 ball technique 42 whatsoever 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.949
 I'm not used anymore 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.130
 Technology 1 It 's simply because of it 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.840
 I learned the others first though 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:01.700
 Now I wanted something more to technique 1 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:05.919
 If your hands on the 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.960
 have ground you have such a triangular shape 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.940
 and then pick you up 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.650
 the same thing with technic3d 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.720
 year between jump I still wanted 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.070
 complete 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.410
 then I realized you can 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.030
 Roll off a lot better and easier now 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.680
 maybe you have noticed 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.780
 a tutorial not much video 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.880
 technical I just wanted yours 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.360
 know how it finds it is 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.160
 better with divisions or so how 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.449
 For example, I always had one now 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.760
 black screen comes and then 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:37.490
 Firstly, secondly, it bounces off 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.199
 overcome and so I find that 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.560
 members and better or do you find him 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:44.000
 have done this now you can find it 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.870
 honors me better on that 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.430
 can optimize the future 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.220
 I think that's something with mine 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.700
 clear away tutorial and I promise 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.590
 start soon 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.000
 more videos reinstellen for example the 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.230
 with the wall body daddy that 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.870
 main problem is that we just no 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:03.860
 find location 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:06.300
 but as I said the next video will be 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.750
 I promise to be a little off that 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.370
 means women surmountable and high 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.350
 koppold something like that it was then 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.120
 already a tutorial and we see 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:18.650
 next time with sebastian and one 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.650
 small credits
