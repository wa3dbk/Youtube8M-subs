00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello every holder I have a pretty 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.069
 cool video for you that i totally 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.480
 definitely brings in the spring mood 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.370
 me that in any case 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.559
 I am on amazon hair 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.630
 chalk order this package here the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.830
 burning in 24 colors that was really cheap 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.839
 and I want you left in the course 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.220
 Infobox is absolutely me in any case 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.810
 or shopping tip and I know now 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.520
 together with you, I've try 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.650
 with three variants how to think the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.939
 Haag can use suffering and how will 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.740
 I just do it now and look like 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.300
 It looks like I 'm looking forward to it and me 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.680
 think this is really cool in summer so one 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.240
 few highlights and a few burned 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.230
 hire in the hair and then I think 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.120
 just to the next hair wash 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.010
 be sure to write in the comments 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.079
 Which three variants are best for you? 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.730
 liked and what i like best 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.379
 is or what your first try 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.760
 I would be interested in that 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.309
 In any case, so very much writes mini 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.110
 my first variant has been since then 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.360
 where the hair ends almost in color 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.250
 So the hair was bathed 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.750
 I am afraid the parties are liable 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.289
 should be later with a point 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.219
 I swam in the vip 3 variant 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.890
 me for those pretty songs 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.420
 decided strand for strand goal the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.739
 chalk over my hair now 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.370
 I do that with my whole 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.370
 sharpen 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.560
 and that's how the result looks like on me 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.560
 really cool now 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.990
 my next variant are colorful 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.640
 highlight because I need the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.750
 individual strands and then it works too 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.330
 already to the color selection 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.890
 i take blue pink and orange a lot 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.990
 Nice combination as I think 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.910
 Here you can completely vary 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.070
 either you just make a strand 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.750
 gone far to the top and you dyed 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.130
 the tip of a strand or man 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.490
 even makes single hair strands 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.490
 multicolored 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.810
 looking forward 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.730
 even this gap is not beautiful 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.600
 Just tell incredible fresh and 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.600
 moves to spring 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.810
 my number three are karabulut the one 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.420
 new trend in the approach point 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.370
 dyed the first step is that again 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.050
 moisten and after that I want to first 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.850
 dark blue with me on the crest 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.990
 along ca 1 and are the meta of mine 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.990
 approach lawyer 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.460
 At the end of the transition seemed to create 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.530
 namely a light blue color and 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.090
 combined with it the dark blue and draw 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.090
 the color a little further out 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.580
 the variant becomes call of duty 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.050
 probably not against you 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.820
 I like it too and I have to start 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.410
 not sure to find videos though 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.800
 By now I 'm really pretty 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.380
 cool 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.690
 I want the ihk really great and will be 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.040
 Certainly use some times tell me 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.360
 necessarily same variant you on 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.110
 liked best and leave one 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.820
 Thumbs up 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.870

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.870
