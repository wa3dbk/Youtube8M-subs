00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
slower at close range you can spray as

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.190 
area the radical bloom will actually
bloom<00:02:00.859> into<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.159> headshot<00:02:01.600> you<00:02:02.600> can<00:02:02.780> zoom<00:02:02.960> in

bloom into the headshot you can zoom in
for<00:02:03.409> long-range<00:02:03.740> assistance<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.549> you<00:02:05.090> can

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
for long-range assistance and you can

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.029 
for long-range assistance and you can
also<00:02:05.359> Crouch<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:06.200> crashing<00:02:06.560> will<00:02:06.649> actually

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
also Crouch the crashing will actually

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.430 
also Crouch the crashing will actually
make<00:02:07.189> your<00:02:07.369> reticle<00:02:07.729> bloom<00:02:07.969> a<00:02:08.630> little<00:02:09.350> bit

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
make your reticle bloom a little bit

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.620 
make your reticle bloom a little bit
less<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:10.039> you<00:02:10.700> have<00:02:10.850> a<00:02:10.880> micro<00:02:11.240> shop<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.569> can

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
less and you have a micro shop you can

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.330 
less and you have a micro shop you can
no<00:02:11.840> longer<00:02:12.020> scrape<00:02:12.350> so<00:02:12.530> be<00:02:12.650> judicial<00:02:13.130> about

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
no longer scrape so be judicial about

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.220 
no longer scrape so be judicial about
its<00:02:13.490> use<00:02:13.670> with<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.660> pistol<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:14.960> want<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.140> be

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
its use with the pistol you want to be

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.360 
its use with the pistol you want to be
slow<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.530> steady<00:02:15.770> because<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.130> is<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.220> large

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
slow and steady because it is a large

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.040 
slow and steady because it is a large
reticle<00:02:16.730> bloom<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.090> it's<00:02:17.330> clip<00:02:17.630> is<00:02:17.810> pretty

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
reticle bloom and it's clip is pretty

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.840 
reticle bloom and it's clip is pretty
small<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:18.290> make<00:02:18.590> every<00:02:18.710> shot<00:02:18.890> count<00:02:18.950> at<00:02:19.340> close

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
small so make every shot count at close

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.130 
small so make every shot count at close
range<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.300> can<00:02:20.330> spray<00:02:20.720> with<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.990> pistol

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
range you can spray with the pistol

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.050 
range you can spray with the pistol
because<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.590> bloom<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:21.920> easier<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.310> handle

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
because the bloom is easier to handle

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.690 
because the bloom is easier to handle
the<00:02:25.050> pistol<00:02:25.440> also<00:02:25.680> has<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.830> zoom<00:02:26.069> function<00:02:26.489> but

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
the pistol also has a zoom function but

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.190 
the pistol also has a zoom function but
once<00:02:26.880> again<00:02:26.970> same<00:02:27.360> principle<00:02:27.810> slow<00:02:28.050> and

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
once again same principle slow and

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.760 
once again same principle slow and
steady<00:02:28.380> shots<00:02:30.200> now<00:02:31.200> let's<00:02:31.380> go<00:02:31.530> over<00:02:31.650> how<00:02:31.739> to

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
steady shots now let's go over how to

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.750 
steady shots now let's go over how to
properly<00:02:32.160> strafe<00:02:33.800> alright<00:02:34.800> guys<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.459> this<00:02:35.580> is

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
properly strafe alright guys so this is

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.720 
properly strafe alright guys so this is
an<00:02:35.940> example<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.540> bad<00:02:36.780> strafe<00:02:37.370> just<00:02:38.370> moving

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
an example of a bad strafe just moving

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.870 
an example of a bad strafe just moving
left<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.420> right<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.530> same<00:02:40.830> fashion<00:02:41.190> that

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.880 

right<00:02:44.880> there<00:02:45.120> that's<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.510> bad<00:02:45.690> strafe<00:02:46.019> a<00:02:46.260> good

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
right there that's a bad strafe a good

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.089 
right there that's a bad strafe a good
strafe<00:02:47.130> mixes<00:02:47.550> up<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.590> directionality<00:02:49.590> and

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
strafe mixes up the directionality and

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.479 
strafe mixes up the directionality and
the<00:02:50.340> distance<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:51.209> instead<00:02:51.540> of<00:02:51.599> doing<00:02:51.780> this

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
the distance so instead of doing this

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.240 
the distance so instead of doing this
you<00:02:53.489> do<00:02:53.730> something<00:02:53.940> like<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:55.040> where<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.130> go

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
you do something like this where you go

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.870 
you do something like this where you go

strength<00:03:07.799> like<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.209> you<00:03:09.209> can<00:03:09.330> also<00:03:09.450> mix<00:03:09.690> up

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
strength like this you can also mix up

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.479 
strength like this you can also mix up
