00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.480

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.520
 You can compare with the ones that come 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:15.090
 soon they are from the laser and the 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.090
 classics 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:22.150
 they are going to have this line that are based 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.810
 in the cartoons and they will have the 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.189
 others that are based on 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.189
 in cartoons of the 80s 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.120
 as I said let's see first this 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.120
 figure is amazing 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.080
 I do not know why I do not like it but before 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.080
 that we see 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.230
 best 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.480
 in more detail this figure let me almost 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.320
 what I never teach them 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.320
 box 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.090
 I do not know if he can see but how he looks 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.560
 the box 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:10.640
 different colors are 2 and Friday in the 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:16.580
 face you see the structure of the new show 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:19.940
 and back comes a biography of rafael 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.490
 and the next figures or figures 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.160
 that are in this series by 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.670
 course I do not hold Rafael anymore and 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.670
 it sounds 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.810
 I saw the other turtles and rafael a 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.470
 April but do not catch them of course 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.510
 I'm going to grab them next but 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.519
 be and is this is rafael and twitter 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.830
 they're the only ones that I got and we're going to see 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.260
 what comes in this figure 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.450
 It also comes with a small 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.209
 like a bad day 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.970
 of the things that come of course the 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.970
 figures talking figures 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.720
 the play set to this the play is going to be 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.510
 great because it 's about 4 feet 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.360
 I do not know how much he will tell me 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.330
 in centimeters but 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.930
 it's great as you can see the child is 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.950
 on his knees and this 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.700
 we could say that the child is a little 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.660
 taller than him 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:34.830
 the base that the play set 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.990
 some other things the vehicles and 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.540
 also this vehicle and these others from 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.090
 I've seen them here but they do not catch us 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.170
 still soon I will do what 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.600
 I'm going to grab the vehicle especially 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.390
 and after they saw all that 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.200
 we'll see 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.290
 a rafael 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.790
 rafael is once like I said a new 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.940
 structure and since they have come out 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.940
 right now 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:10.210
 and we are going to see that articulation rafael 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.150
 one can move 360 ​​degrees 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.710
 in his head 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.950
 up and down the diet 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.700
 Of course 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:25.350
 you can move like this up down here in 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:28.080
 the shoulders 360 degrees 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.610
 does not have any articulation here in the 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.070
 biceps but here on the elbow 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.280
 you can move 360 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:41.750
 dead go down here where is 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:45.090
 this bandana 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.790
 after 360 degrees 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.080
 this plastic here from your comparison 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:56.430
 this in front is very flexible only 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.080
 you can do well and it makes the kicks 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.289
 remain 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.330
 we do not know 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:07.349
 are not restricted by the shell 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.960
 but as you can see moves to the top and of 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:12.750
 above 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.360
 and so on down further back 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.980
 it moves sideways of course 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.510
 you have to move the whole leg to 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.900
 can that 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.680
 moves the knee 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.449
 the 360 degrees in the knee and that's 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.870
 the entire joint of course is not 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:32.270
 a lot but it 's enough for us 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.630
 especially if you're a fan of the 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.630
 turtles 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.340
 the ninja turtles 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:45.180
 they come with 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:48.880
 with new and accessories 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.390
 of course they see that he has his 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:55.370
 the ratchets 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.370
 how come here classics 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:04.889
 it also comes with two more 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:07.830
 other weapons unfortunately I do not know the 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:11.330
 name of all the weapons I'm not going 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:15.120
 to teach come with these 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:19.569
 trinchet dude I hope you are missing 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:23.999
 one of the sides are deeper 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:23.999
 it can be like a fork 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:32.690
 also with two stars 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.690
 of course children have 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:42.150
 and with this type of hooks 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.150
 I do not know very well the name of them 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.870
 and that's pretty much all the weapons that 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.870
 comes 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:59.889
 the value of this ninja kim eeuu turtle 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:02.770
 they are almost 9 dollars contacts 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.659
 is an excellent figure the 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.419
 I recommend to all those who are fans 

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:09.099
 of the ninja turtles my rating of 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:09.990
 this ninja turtle of course is that 

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:15.610
 it will be 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:18.029
 9.5 because not 10 because it's missing 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:21.069
 much more articulation let's see how 

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:26.590
 how do you see the next these new ninja 

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:30.020
 those of the class series to see if it's 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:32.950
 better than this figure or worse 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:37.130
 this must be better 

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:40.360
 this is big easy and thanks for watching this 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.360
