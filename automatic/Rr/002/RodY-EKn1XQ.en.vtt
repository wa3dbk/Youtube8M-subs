00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.080
 well this is a common regulator and 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.820
 current 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.790
 the disarming parties 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.769
 are these where contains the spring that 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.859
 operate this knob 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:22.099
 and this part of here where is the other 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:24.860
 spring that is what drives the entrance 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:27.430
 or the passage of gas in this part of here 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.430
 is the diaphragm 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.290
 in this case we are going to disarm we are going to 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.910
 unscrew it from the carafe and then 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.260
 let's develop this part to see 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.260
 how is the operation 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.360
 this is the regulator 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.440
 this is the body that unrolls 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:10.870
 a simple thread has no secret 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:15.460
 to unscrew like this 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.980
 this diaphragm highlights this rubber is 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.400
 pushed 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:26.150
 by this thread this diaphragm what 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.150
 does is push this this piece 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.650
 this piece of bronze pushes 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.430
 and a piece that's on the other side that 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.750
 is the one that is for the passage of gas 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.330
 then the resistance that they generate 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.280
 between the spring that is behind and this 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.450
 resort is what almost does not happen 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.350
 nothing 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.369
 let's take out the spring here 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:55.549
 so you can see how is this is the spring 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.350
 which in theory can be changed to 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.350
 put one lighter 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.180
 these are the springs that come 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.369
 they are quite rigid there is one that comes 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.290
 which is more rigid than this I changed it and 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.230
 I put this one that has less tension than the 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:17.280
 earlier that's so I can 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.980
 operate the diaphragm easier and can 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.120
 take more gas steps and set aside so that 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.100
 react softer to this movie there if 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.280
 you can not put a spring like this 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.330
 which is much more loose very much 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.660
 less tension if then one has to 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.290
 give more thread more laps so that the 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:45.350
 needle lift less amount of 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.350
 grams for each round that one gives 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:54.430
 what one can also do is 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.370
 make sure that the valve that is 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.410
 on the other side that was here is 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.050
 working well and covering well 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.960
 because any garbage that I entered 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.060
 makes it stop working or that is left 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.250
 a gas passage a small loss of 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.160
 gas then now what I'm going to do is 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.400
 take this out this valve here 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.400
 behind 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.349
 and that valve to show you how it is 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.349
 it works 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.280
 these are red 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.670
 here has a spring that is what gives 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.670
 attention to this valve 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.320
 Y 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.250
 this piece 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:06.930
 this piece is that makes 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:11.160
 close gas passage this is pushed 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:14.500
 this piece that is round is pushed 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.710
 against that seat that looks like I'm going to 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.690
 move 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.340
 to see if it looks a little bit more 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.790
 light 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.850
 in there is a seat that is 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.820
 plastic that seat has to be 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.220
 perfectly clean nothing happened to him 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.690
 that I can break it or make a 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.800
 notch because if not then you have to 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:40.190
 change it then in that seat 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.790
 supports this piece this piece is 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:47.940
 pressed 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:49.940
 for this is another and this spring this 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.660
 is what opens or closes the gas passage 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.080
 when we screw this this 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.180
 piece 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.130
 push the tip of this one 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.560
 this is pushed by the diaphragm this 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.250
 piece pushes this tip and lets pass 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.880
 the gas the gas starts to pass when the 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:14.480
 pressure is compensated that is the pressure 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.400
 inside the barrel is what 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.210
 we gave him and we regulate him in the 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.150
 manometer the diaphragm compensates for 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.390
 force then this stops pushing 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:30.230
 inside and between the diaphragm and 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:32.560
 this piece push this spring to 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.330
 back and that's where the step is closed 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.260
 if this is well supported in that 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.650
 Seat cuts all the way if this piece 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:45.150
 does not fit well on that seat 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.100
 continues to pass gas a little 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.710
 so what you have to do is 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.480
 make sure that this piece nods 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:57.980
 perfectly fine about this seat and 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.980
 now let's put everything together again 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.330
 yes this meeting resort 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.220
 someone saw it this happens to me always 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.570
 ah 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.200
 ah 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.430
 haha that was put here I am a 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.430
 phenomenon 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:27.770
 we are looking 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.050
 we arrived 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.259
 all with one hand look at the exercise that 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.259
 it will be
