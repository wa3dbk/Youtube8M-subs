I<00:00:51.449> still<00:00:51.780> need<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.020> add<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.170> floor<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:53.600> making

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600

this<00:00:54.899> was<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> pain<00:00:55.649> because<00:00:56.280> mushrooms<00:00:57.210> do<00:00:57.690> not

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
this was a pain because mushrooms do not

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.799 
this was a pain because mushrooms do not
work<00:00:58.320> very<00:00:58.350> well<00:00:58.940> like<00:00:59.940> if<00:01:00.210> you're<00:01:00.480> trying<00:01:00.719> to

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
work very well like if you're trying to

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.470 
work very well like if you're trying to
plant<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.260> mushroom<00:01:01.680> together<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:03.359> just

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
a mushroom floor and ceiling himself

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.770 
a mushroom floor and ceiling himself
these<00:01:08.460> things<00:01:08.760> up<00:01:08.939> here<00:01:09.150> were<00:01:09.270> pretty<00:01:09.630> easy

you<00:01:10.560> know<00:01:10.680> little<00:01:11.070> houses<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:12.000> windows

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
you know little houses with windows

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.560 
you know little houses with windows
little<00:01:13.320> watchtowers<00:01:13.890> mainly<00:01:14.220> but<00:01:14.909> that's<00:01:15.360> not

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
little watchtowers mainly but that's not

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.429 
little watchtowers mainly but that's not
the<00:01:15.750> main<00:01:15.930> thing<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:18.200> something<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.290> was

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
the main thing for this something I was

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.600 
the main thing for this something I was
working<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:19.920> was<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:21.530> scale<00:01:22.530> replica<00:01:23.250> thinking

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
working on was a scale replica thinking

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.850 
working on was a scale replica thinking
of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> libraries<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.080> can<00:01:25.259> find<00:01:25.500> in

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
of the libraries that you can find in

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.520 
of the libraries that you can find in
like<00:01:26.100> strongholds<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:26.850> stuff<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> cooked

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
like strongholds and stuff so I cooked

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.249 
like strongholds and stuff so I cooked
up<00:01:28.710> myself<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.340> buttload<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.570> smooth<00:01:30.990> stone

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
up myself a buttload of a smooth stone

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.469 
up myself a buttload of a smooth stone
don't<00:01:31.470> know<00:01:31.650> if<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.100> any<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.460> me<00:01:32.670> oh<00:01:32.909> well

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
don't know if I have any on me oh well

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.810 
don't know if I have any on me oh well
but<00:01:33.990> um<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.729> made<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.909> all<00:01:36.060> into<00:01:37.640> into<00:01:38.640> my

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
but um I made it all into into my

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.390 
but um I made it all into into my
library<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.979> was<00:01:41.189> done<00:01:41.369> a

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
library and this is this was done a

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.249 
library and this is this was done a
hundred<00:01:41.729> percent<00:01:42.030> legit<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:43.079> like

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
hundred percent legit just like

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.710 
hundred percent legit just like
everything<00:01:43.530> else<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.100> world<00:01:44.399> but<00:01:45.240> here

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
everything else on this world but here

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.550 
everything else on this world but here
it<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.950> made<00:01:46.950> from<00:01:47.189> all<00:01:47.490> smooth<00:01:48.360> stone<00:01:48.960> stuff

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
it is made from all smooth stone stuff

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.399 
it is made from all smooth stone stuff
because<00:01:50.090> well<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.420> can't<00:01:51.659> make<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.960> mossy<00:01:52.320> or

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
because well you can't make the mossy or

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.219 
because well you can't make the mossy or
cracked<00:01:52.649> one<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.790> um<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.180> looked<00:01:54.960> at<00:01:55.079> some

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
cracked one but um I looked at some

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.190 
cracked one but um I looked at some
pictures<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.329> video<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.630> had<00:01:57.960> where<00:01:58.170> I

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
pictures and and the video I had where I

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.499 
pictures and and the video I had where I
explored<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.280> library<00:01:59.700> for<00:01:59.790> myself<00:02:00.360> or

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
explored the library for myself or

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.060 
explored the library for myself or
something<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.020> I'm<00:02:01.259> not<00:02:01.320> sure<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.649> did<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
something that I'm not sure I did in the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.399 
something that I'm not sure I did in the

did the math

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.850 
did the math
and<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:15.000> make<00:02:15.150> all<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.480> these<00:02:15.990> bookshelves<00:02:16.320> it

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860
