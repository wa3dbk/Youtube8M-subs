00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.940
 educational portal 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.500
 ABC of money in this video we are with you 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.630
 analyze another method 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.969
 unusual way how your money can 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.420
 make new money let's say with 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.220
 with minimal effort we are all with you 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.020
 many years maybe even decades 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.390
 grow in career to 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.189
 earn more and more many 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.779
 years it may even be decades we 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.880
 develop our business in order to 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.800
 earn more and more with 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.189
 this is very surprising to me how 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.180
 some of our fellow citizens refers to 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.820
 your money 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.809
 You know, I also expanded my money 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.660
 right and left 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.670
 I also do not care for my time 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.370
 treated your money to your expenses 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.320
 at the same time money as you know for 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.510
 earned well by certain efforts 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.640
 we are contributions a lot of time at that 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.800
 to make money bring them in 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.500
 his family so that's why we see that 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.840
 that people buy their iphone and on 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.879
 last salary money we see that 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.250
 people buy cars on credit expensive 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.880
 creed machines though could buy more 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.460
 reasonable 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.500
 car putting a more reasonable day 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.479
 why do people care so much 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.430
 to my money 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.939
 There can be a huge number of answers. 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.420
 maybe it is the breadth but the Russian soul 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.729
 maybe this is our desire to appear in 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.560
 rich instead of being alone can 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.750
 be like that cultural influence 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.600
 TV effect glossy magazines 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.299
 where it is fashionable to be successful beautiful 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.460
 wealthy while we can not 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.310
 allow and those things that we buy 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.250
 loan we throw out money literally 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.020
 the wind though many years many hours 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.380
 invest in order to earn these 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.439
 days what is this saying I want today 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.390
 show you that there is another way 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.850
 unusual way how can you bring 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.930
 money in your family budget literally 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.259
 return them i'm talking about a reasonable attitude 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.509
 in caring for your money 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.850
 for example if you go to the store in 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.740
 hungry they are all there you are 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.899
 guaranteed to buy more because 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.170
 that your stomach will dictate you 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.110
 conditions of your brain 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.720
 and you buy more if you take 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.640
 big store cart they are small 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.680
 basket then again 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.770
 buy more you this whole cart with 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.140
 With a slide, they remind the basket where 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.090

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.790
 the amount saves you in total with
