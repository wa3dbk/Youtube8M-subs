00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
the less duplicates you would get ok so

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.700 
the less duplicates you would get ok so
these<00:02:05.369> packs<00:02:05.969> may<00:02:06.450> have<00:02:06.659> gone<00:02:06.960> back<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.590> the

all<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.709> was<00:02:58.890> different<00:02:59.160> if<00:02:59.430> i<00:02:59.489> can<00:02:59.670> remember

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
all that was different if i can remember

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.479 
all that was different if i can remember
off<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.090> top<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.390> my<00:03:00.540> head<00:03:00.890> was<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.040> offensive

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
off the top of my head was the offensive

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.449 
off the top of my head was the offensive
awareness<00:03:03.209> which<00:03:03.900> i<00:03:04.170> think<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.709> odd<00:03:05.010> good<00:03:05.340> the

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
awareness which i think is odd good the

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.250 
awareness which i think is odd good the
gold<00:03:05.670> card<00:03:05.940> was<00:03:06.090> like<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.239> 92<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:06.989> it<00:03:07.050> went<00:03:07.200> up

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
gold card was like a 92 and it went up

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.350 
gold card was like a 92 and it went up
to<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.410> 97<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.310> let's<00:03:08.489> be<00:03:08.640> honest<00:03:08.940> when<00:03:09.090> it's<00:03:09.209> in

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
to a 97 it let's be honest when it's in

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.280 
to a 97 it let's be honest when it's in
the<00:03:09.570> 90s<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:10.260> it's<00:03:10.770> from<00:03:10.950> 92<00:03:11.550> to<00:03:11.580> 97<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.630> don't

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
the 90s and it's from 92 to 97 I don't

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.140 
the 90s and it's from 92 to 97 I don't
think<00:03:13.470> it's<00:03:13.590> gonna<00:03:13.709> be<00:03:13.800> that<00:03:13.920> big<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.940> a

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
think it's gonna be that big of a

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.479 
think it's gonna be that big of a
difference<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:16.260> think<00:03:16.530> one<00:03:16.860> other<00:03:17.130> thing

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
difference and I think one other thing

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.370 
difference and I think one other thing
was<00:03:17.610> different<00:03:18.030> but<00:03:18.150> is<00:03:18.299> all<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:18.750> his<00:03:18.870> shooting

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
was different but is all of his shooting

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.789 
was different but is all of his shooting
his<00:03:19.830> layup<00:03:20.280> all<00:03:20.850> these<00:03:21.209> like<00:03:21.450> Nucky<00:03:22.049> stacks<00:03:22.560> to

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
his layup all these like Nucky stacks to

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.310 
his layup all these like Nucky stacks to
the<00:03:22.920> game<00:03:23.160> they<00:03:23.910> were<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.239> same<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:25.110> heard

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
the game they were the same and I heard

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.930 
the game they were the same and I heard
how<00:03:25.530> much<00:03:25.709> cheese<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.250> going<00:03:26.400> on<00:03:26.670> in<00:03:26.850> that

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
how much cheese is going on in that

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.850 
how much cheese is going on in that
