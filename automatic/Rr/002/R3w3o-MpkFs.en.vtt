 eye tutorial so to original because 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.960

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.760

 terrific is a favorite drink is 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.740
 very rich and we will see nothing to do another 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.050
 hot chocolate-based drink like this 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.340
 that here as a white porcelain cup and 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.340
 let's see how it is done 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.680
 to decorate our cup we need 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.270
 a smooth porcelain cup 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.270
 a permanent marker 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.250
 alcohol and a swab for the ears 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.250
 or cotton 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.260
 Take your role model and jump to 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.260
 draw in the cup 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.330
 If you have a fault, the only thing you have 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.220
 what to do is wet your stick or the 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.220
 cotton in alcohol and erase 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.950
 and start over 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.030
 ah 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.030
 You can erase as many times as you need 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160
 Y 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.420
 when you are satisfied with the result 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:23.400
 will put the cup in the oven at 200 35 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.400
 250 degrees for half an hour 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.490
 then be very careful not to burn yourself 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.490
 this is our cup 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.610
 we're going to be in our cup with a 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.620
 hot chocolate and to do so let's go 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.620
 to use a cup of milk 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.360
 chocolate milk or white I'm going to 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.170
 use white 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.170
 a lemon 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.519
 vanilla essence 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.519
 cinnamon 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.200
 and to decorate whipped cream 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.780
 it's chocolate sparks a place 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.290
 magic with milk in the pot 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.980
 on very slow heat so that the milk does not 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.760
 go to beds 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.739
 with lemon skin 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.180
 and is stirring every bit to 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.180
 make sure that the milk does not stick 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.930
 when it starts to be hot add the 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.470
 chocolate and keep stirring for 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.470
 melt it 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.680
 I put a little vanilla essence to 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.799
 your taste 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.390
 and a little cinnamon, let's leave a couple 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.000
 of minutes on fire to make sure 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.160
 that everything releases the flavor 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.820
 it's a super simple drink and it's 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.820
 delicious 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.940
 we remove the skin of the lemon 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.800
 and we passed it to our super cup 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.740
 Now let's decorate it with a little bit of 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.740
 cream 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.360
 our cloud 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.360
 and chocolate sparks 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:18.220
 puts a nice straw 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:21.610
 and then add something rich to love to walk 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.140
 this a premiere yes sir to do 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.350
 our texts and latex 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:30.180
 We are going to need two tea bags 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:33.750
 black three cloves 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.780
 5 cardamom seeds 1 teaspoon 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.960
 ginger 1 teaspoon cinnamon 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.880
 and three peppercorns in addition though 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.580
 the original does not take it to me I like it 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.740
 add honey 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.110
 and a little bit of vanilla but if 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.210
 you want you can do without this in a 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.509
 pot we're going to put 400 milliliters of 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.509
 Water 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.039
 and we are going to crush the seeds of 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.289
 cardamom to release much more 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.550
 taste 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:07.990
 and we are going to add the water 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:12.690
 besides the ginger 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.690
 cinnamon vanilla essence 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.660
 Honey 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.270
 when it starts to boil I like it 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.030
 add also some skin 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.469
 lemon but this is super optional and 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.419
 when it's boiling, let's put 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:30.330
 our two black tea bags and 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.840
 let's let it infuse for 5 or 7 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.840
 minutes 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.560
 when it's ready let's strain our 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.990
 infusion and with these 400 milliliters of 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.690
 infusion we will be able to do frets 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.430
 putting two parts of milk and one 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:54.590
 diffusion so now let's warm up 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.590
 two thirds of a cup of milk 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.210
 and when it's hot we're going to add 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.210
 our infusion 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.730
 we see everything well 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.480
 and I put our table 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.770
 I like to add a little more 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:26.110
 cinnamon on top 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.110
 a straw and enjoy 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.030
 and this has been all in the video I hope 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:35.970
