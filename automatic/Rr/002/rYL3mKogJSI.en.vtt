00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.640
 Hello dear friends with you, and 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.589
 today I want to show how to reproduce 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.139
 smoke in ks16 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.530
 for this we need the program gk 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.500
 play, that is, here it is a link to 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.109
 the download will be lower than them and version 6 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.609
 Basically, you yourself can download well, I 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:27.300
 I will throw you a link to make it easier after 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.849
 What press brows that is, we find it 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.540
 the most demo that is haze I will 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:38.129
 use the same as in that video 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:41.300
 I have to go go to strike and here it is 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:46.079
 that is what Valerik called 12 3d 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:49.379
 open here there is cynic information 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.809
 that is, the players themselves are less than a couple 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.520
 of things 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.809
 now itâ€™s very important that you are without it 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.809
 don't play dema 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.160
 so to us here we see this 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.620
 here it is like a field go brows and 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:11.310
 now we select in the folder itself 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.330
 counter-strike xl exitus it is 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.900
 everywhere absolutely push open and 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.900
 now we press play 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.900
 m.a. 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.200
 Now we are waiting 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.960
 long well no matter the main result 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.450
 damn 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.729
 shorter pause for time 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:04.060
 in vain but the price of a pause that is this 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:08.070
 Kings itself that is, I did not include the beauty 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.070
 itself where dna as watched 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.530
 surely remember 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.720
 Well, I think that's enough for this in general 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.569
 thanks for watching ie i think you 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.810
 This dna will help a lot since 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.209
 servers banned and asked for a haze 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.080
 and a screenshot to all, thank you swami was 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.080
 valerik bye
