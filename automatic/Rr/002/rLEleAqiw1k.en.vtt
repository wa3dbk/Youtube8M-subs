 congratulate the whole team 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.430

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.740
 Friday and the moto3 we pass to the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.750
 superbike class and we always say the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.340
 class queen but this time really the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.439
 queen class because he gave us some 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.479
 great satisfaction because 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.329
 attention started from pole position 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.310
 baiocco had won race 1 and then today in 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.450
 race 2 what happened now a little 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.970
 of everything because he left again 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.100
 very strong this time in c had 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.180
 alex polita with the bmw 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.369
 then if they haven't made themselves under gods 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.409
 pilots of the barni ivan goi and manuel team 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.290
 poggiali ivan goi managed to pass both 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.579
 clean he never went to win a race 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.470
 spectacular just before alex 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.299
 polita and matteo baiocco ivan goi with 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.350
 this victory brings home the 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.079
 provisional leadership of the championship 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.060
 Italian and the tears just to baiocco 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.130
 let's go and hear the interview later 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.530
 ivan's own race the terrible goal 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.930
 a beautiful race today always in 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.239
 comeback then always exciting though 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.160
 This time yesterday there were all 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.870
 so I could take my step 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.000
 my strategy until the end e 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.489
 from the superbike and the premier class 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.920
 let us pass to the supersport the class that 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.690
 this year sees the largest number of 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.239
 departing at the start and is also the only one 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.209
 class of civ who has the pilot with the 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.090
 number 1 on the fairing yesterday one 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.680
 great disappointment for luca oppedisano 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.450
 betrayed by his motorbike while at the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.019
 command today instead it has rebuilt with the 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.660
 interests 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.590
 today I believe one spectacular race 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.299
 of the most beautiful in the history of 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.099
 Italian league with eleven drivers per 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.900
 finish line in less than a second in 9 i 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.730
 nine tenths the race won it as it has 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.260
 called punto luca oppedisano for only two 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.360
 thousandths of the winner of the race of 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.549
 yesterday federico caricasulo that today does 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.120
 18 years and wins the leadership of 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.980
 championship 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.630
 third place for maximum three roccoli 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.489
 times Italian champion in the past of the 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.290
 in the supersport that returns in the 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.030
 Italian championship but the race is on 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.610
 really spectacular with all the first ones 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.140
 first ten drivers pilots of the al 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.239
 finishing line author of incredible races 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.190
 like, for example, the protagonist of the Morrentine 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.680
 last year in the superstock 600 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.420
 left very back 34th ed 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.530
 arrived sixth and sixth twice today 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.819
 also yesterday sixth 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.370
 now I have to hear from her 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.370
 words of luca oppedisano the winner 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.250
 of the second race class 600 supersport 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.680
 here at mugello lots of snow the race already 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.970
 yesterday in giving it 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.390
 the bike ready 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.690
 today he was born with aida was hard but which one 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.060
 he chose to finally win the 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.760
 pre moto3 class and the one that precisely 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.040
 last year it was called pre gp una 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.070
 absolutely unpredictable class with 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.250
 many drivers two different categories 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.360
 two times and 4 times how it went and 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.790
 way was a real race 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.870
 incredible with dennis foggia and brown 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.670
 Hierarchy that if you play the saint 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.340
 reason if they were also taken 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.020
 of the race direction because they do not have 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.280
 exaggerated but they came close 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.110
 they were also programmed during the 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.970
 race and when they cut in this regard 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.860
 today the winner was won by dennis foggia 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.330
 that leadership is also taken home 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.040
 of the championship 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.080
 according to him he was the winner in the race 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.800
 yesterday and third instead stefano nepa 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.900
 in the 125 because remotely 3 ci 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.820
 are the two classes in the 125 victory 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.049
 for Tony Arbolino champion in office who 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.100
 yesterday failed to lead instead to 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.260
 home victory but with this one 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.930
 affirmation takes the lead to 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.169
 championship second place for vietti 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.669
 ramus and zannoni and now we hear 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.800
 just from the words of the two 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.990
 protagonists dennis foggia for 4 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.460
 timing and tony arbolino for the 2 strokes 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.820
 how did this pre race go? 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.290

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.070

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.140
 not so fought 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.470
