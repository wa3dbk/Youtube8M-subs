Age<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.880> means<00:00:33.090> there's<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.420> three

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
Age that means there's like three

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.310 
Age that means there's like three
thousand<00:00:34.380> years<00:00:34.649> old<00:00:35.719> that's<00:00:36.719> not<00:00:36.930> what<00:00:37.110> we're

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
thousand years old that's not what we're

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.690 
thousand years old that's not what we're
what<00:00:37.680> we<00:00:37.980> are<00:00:38.160> after

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
what we are after

00:00:38.700 --> 00:01:01.900 
what we are after
I'm<00:00:39.000> gonna<00:00:39.420> go<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.750> water

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.740 

huh<00:01:02.870> this<00:01:03.530> is<00:01:03.710> where<00:01:03.860> we're<00:01:04.010> heading

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.960 

I<00:01:07.870> think<00:01:08.410> this<00:01:08.560> boat<00:01:08.800> was<00:01:08.980> built<00:01:09.160> in<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.550> 30s

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
I think this boat was built in the 30s

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.790 
I think this boat was built in the 30s
I'm<00:01:10.270> not<00:01:10.510> sure

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
I'm not sure

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:26.620 
I'm not sure
they<00:01:11.980> even<00:01:12.160> have<00:01:12.370> beer<00:01:13.080> cooler

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.910 

so<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:27.960> arrived<00:01:28.410> at<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.830> island<00:01:30.650> ask<00:01:31.650> is

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
so we have arrived at the island ask is

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.670 
so we have arrived at the island ask is
it<00:01:32.100> quite<00:01:32.460> popular<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:34.070> with<00:01:35.070> volts<00:01:35.930> but<00:01:36.930> as<00:01:37.410> I

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
it quite popular for with volts but as I

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.120 
it quite popular for with volts but as I
arrived<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.220> saw<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.910> beach<00:01:39.260> with<00:01:40.260> literally<00:01:40.830> no

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
arrived I saw a beach with literally no

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.170 
arrived I saw a beach with literally no
people<00:01:41.960> just<00:01:42.960> over<00:01:43.260> there<00:01:43.880> there's<00:01:44.880> also<00:01:45.060> a

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
people just over there there's also a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.260 
people just over there there's also a
beach<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.690> other<00:01:45.840> side<00:01:46.729> that's<00:01:47.729> right

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
beach on the other side that's right

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.760 
beach on the other side that's right
over<00:01:48.900> here<00:01:49.020> first<00:01:49.490> that<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.880> west<00:01:51.090> side<00:01:51.420> of

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
over here first that is the west side of

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.300 
over here first that is the west side of
the<00:01:52.770> island

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
the island

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.010 
the island
and<00:01:53.940> that's<00:01:54.479> probably<00:01:54.750> best<00:01:55.920> due<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.280> its

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
and that's probably best due to its

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.550 
and that's probably best due to its
afternoon<00:01:58.020> Sun<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:03.600> you're<00:02:03.869> probably<00:02:04.350> not

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
afternoon Sun so you're probably not

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.690 
afternoon Sun so you're probably not
this<00:02:05.149> pattern<00:02:06.320> me<00:02:07.320> being<00:02:07.649> very<00:02:07.680> optimistic<00:02:08.070> in

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
this pattern me being very optimistic in

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.470 
this pattern me being very optimistic in
the<00:02:08.759> beginning<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:11.340> then<00:02:11.760> everything<00:02:12.300> goes

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
the beginning and then everything goes

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.920 
the beginning and then everything goes
downwards<00:02:13.170> from<00:02:13.380> there<00:02:13.880> today<00:02:14.880> new<00:02:15.360> strategy

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
downwards from there today new strategy

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.900 
downwards from there today new strategy
I'm<00:02:16.080> gonna<00:02:16.320> be<00:02:16.470> pessimistic<00:02:16.790> from<00:02:17.790> the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
I'm gonna be pessimistic from the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.900 
I'm gonna be pessimistic from the
beginning<00:02:18.890> so<00:02:19.890> let's<00:02:20.040> go<00:02:20.250> get<00:02:20.400> those<00:02:20.640> blue
