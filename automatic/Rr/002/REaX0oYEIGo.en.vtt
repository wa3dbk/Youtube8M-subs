Hi everybody, this is Jessica from JewelryTutorialHQ.com
and Bespangled Jewelry.

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:17.929
Today I'm going to show you how to make a
cool chunky woven bracelet from an old T-shirt.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.810
To make your t-shirt yarn, first cut off the
bottom hem of the shirt using sharp fabric

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.960
scissors.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.400
Fold your shirt in half vertically and then
cut straight across to make strips about an

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.020
inch to an inch-and-a-half wide. The wider
the strips, the thicker and chunkier the bracelet.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.020
I'm using strips about 1 inch wide. When you
open up the strips, you'll have a loop which

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.700
we'll need to cut.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.730
And I'm going to show you how to connect ends
together to make a continuous piece of t-shirt yarn

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.730
that we can use to make our bracelet.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.730
First overlap two of the ends facing each
other by about half an inch. Fold them in

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:12.350
the middle and snip with the scissors to make
a hole in both of the pieces.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.710
Now overlap them again the same way. The piece
that's on top - grab the tail end and from

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.810
underneath, pull it up through both holes
all the way and pull it tight.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.729
Now I have done this one more time so I have
three strips of t-shirt yarn connected together

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.140
for a total of about 8.5 yards - a little
bit over 100 inches, which is going to make

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.299
a bracelet woven on three fingers, which I'm
going to show you how to do.

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.290
First you will grab one end of the strip with
your thumb and pull the long end between your

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.320
first and second fingers, in front of your
middle finger, behind your ring finger, in

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.710
front of your pinky and around, then in front
of your ring finger, behind your middle finger,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.710
then make one big loop around all three fingers,
and then pull the loops over that new big

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.489
loop and slide your fingers back through.

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:22.489
And this is what's going to create the weave.
And you do that again - make one big loop

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:30.349
around all three fingers and pull the loops
up and over and your fingers go back through

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.040
to create the weave.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.040
Now you just keep repeating this over and
over checking your tension every once in awhile.

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:48.230
This is a little bit like knitting or crochet
where your tension determines how even your

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.930
braiding is.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.930
Now this type of weaving can also be done
with two fingers or four fingers - the four

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:07.480
finger weave is going to give you an even
thicker bracelet and two fingers will give

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.069
you a thinner one.

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.189
I'm showing you this with 3 fingers - it's
basically the same technique, you would just

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.900
loop around a different number of fingers
in the beginning.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.629
So now I've done this about four or five times,
I'm going to let go of the piece I'm holding

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:28.909
with my thumb and pull it. You'll see the
weave is starting to develop here.

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:35.909
Pull it tight and you can continue with the
same process - looping around all three fingers

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.689
and pulling the smaller loops over and your
fingers through.

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:46.689
And keep doing that until you have only about
4 or 5 inches left. Now, I sped up the video

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.349
here so I am already done and I'll show you
how to finish this off.

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:01.349
Carefully slide the loops off your fingers,
making sure you keep them intact.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.930
And bring that tail around and through all
three of the loops and pull it tight and that's

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:20.629
going to make a nice secure knot.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.080
Now we can just tie these ends together in
a double knot. You don't have to make it so

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.030
you can untie this knot because the bracelet
is going to be stretchy so it should fit over

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.889
your hand without having to untie it.

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:47.300
Now I'm going to tie this one into a bow and
then just trim off the ends.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.400
And that's it, we're all done, we have a cool
bracelet that was woven from an old t-shirt!

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:58.539
I hope you had fun and I'd love to see you
again soon!
