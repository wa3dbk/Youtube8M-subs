00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
here is the rear axle carrier machine

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.130 
here is the rear axle carrier machine
looks<00:00:34.790> good<00:00:35.030> colors<00:00:35.360> a<00:00:35.480> little<00:00:35.690> bit<00:00:35.899> lighter

than<00:00:36.410> I<00:00:36.530> thought<00:00:36.649> it<00:00:36.710> would<00:00:36.829> be<00:00:37.130> but<00:00:37.880> that's<00:00:38.600> a

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
than I thought it would be but that's a

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:47.500 
than I thought it would be but that's a
look<00:00:38.810> at<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.470> rear<00:00:39.710> right<00:00:39.920> there<00:00:46.450> here's<00:00:47.450> a

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
look at the rear right there here's a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:59.610 
look at the rear right there here's a
look<00:00:47.630> at<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:47.870> front<00:00:49.480> steering<00:00:50.480> knuckle<00:00:50.960> there

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:12.039 

let's<00:01:00.620> look<00:01:00.800> at<00:01:00.950> the<00:01:01.010> front<00:01:01.270> seat<00:01:02.270> up<00:01:11.049> so

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
let's look at the front seat up so

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.880 
let's look at the front seat up so
here's<00:01:12.740> one<00:01:12.950> of<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:13.070> shock<00:01:13.369> caps<00:01:13.700> here<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:15.470> it

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
here's one of the shock caps here and it

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.560 
here's one of the shock caps here and it
comes<00:01:16.070> with<00:01:16.100> these<00:01:16.340> bag<00:01:16.640> of<00:01:16.790> parts<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.270> i<00:01:17.299> guess

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
comes with these bag of parts so i guess

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.870 
comes with these bag of parts so i guess
if<00:01:17.750> you're<00:01:17.930> using<00:01:18.229> their<00:01:19.070> aluminum<00:01:19.430> shock

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
if you're using their aluminum shock

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.850 
if you're using their aluminum shock
tower<00:01:20.150> those<00:01:20.450> are<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.689> standoffs<00:01:21.260> there<00:01:21.590> and

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
tower those are the standoffs there and

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.310 
tower those are the standoffs there and
the<00:01:22.460> longer<00:01:22.670> screws<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:23.450> washers<00:01:23.689> to<00:01:24.049> hold<00:01:24.229> it

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
the longer screws and washers to hold it

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.590 
the longer screws and washers to hold it
in<00:01:24.470> place<00:01:24.619> but<00:01:25.010> if<00:01:25.610> you're<00:01:25.820> using<00:01:25.970> just<00:01:26.360> the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
in place but if you're using just the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.340 
in place but if you're using just the
stock<00:01:26.960> set<00:01:27.229> up<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:29.030> steps<00:01:29.299> crew<00:01:29.540> should<00:01:29.600> fit

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
stock set up the steps crew should fit

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:38.340 
stock set up the steps crew should fit
in<00:01:30.439> there<00:01:30.590> no<00:01:30.710> problem

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350

and lastly here's the red motor mount

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.890 
and lastly here's the red motor mount
because<00:01:42.500> of<00:01:42.680> this<00:01:42.910> looks<00:01:43.910> like<00:01:44.030> an<00:01:44.150> m2<00:01:44.510> screw
