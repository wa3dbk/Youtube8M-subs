00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.849 
eBay solar attic fan as you can see it
is<00:00:27.779> quit<00:00:28.050> working<00:00:29.210> after<00:00:30.210> two<00:00:30.599> weeks<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.590> use

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
is quit working after two weeks of use

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.500 
is quit working after two weeks of use
maybe<00:00:32.340> some<00:00:32.520> wires<00:00:32.700> came<00:00:32.940> loose<00:00:33.120> maybe<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
maybe some wires came loose maybe the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.310 
maybe some wires came loose maybe the
fan<00:00:33.660> burned<00:00:33.899> up<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.320> don't<00:00:35.309> know<00:00:35.370> but<00:00:36.200> it<00:00:37.200> was

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
fan burned up I don't know but it was

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.790 
fan burned up I don't know but it was
only<00:00:37.410> about<00:00:37.530> 50<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.820> 80<00:00:39.050> CFM<00:00:40.050> cubic<00:00:40.320> feet<00:00:40.620> per

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.250 
only about 50 to 80 CFM cubic feet per
minute<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:42.890> we<00:00:43.890> increase<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.660> we<00:00:45.660> did<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
minute so we increase that we did the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.319 
minute so we increase that we did the
bigger<00:00:46.440> solar<00:00:46.770> panel<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:48.350> we<00:00:49.350> got<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> CD

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329

we go one thirty three point seven so

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.719 
we go one thirty three point seven so
we've<00:02:08.440> increased<00:02:08.679> that<00:02:08.890> thirteen<00:02:09.369> degrees<00:02:09.519> it

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
we've increased that thirteen degrees it

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.300 
we've increased that thirteen degrees it
was<00:02:09.819> blowing<00:02:10.030> 121<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:12.269> during<00:02:13.269> testing<00:02:14.310> this

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
was blowing 121 and during testing this

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.039 
was blowing 121 and during testing this
was<00:02:15.519> blowing<00:02:15.879> two<00:02:16.030> hundred<00:02:16.269> CFM<00:02:16.540> with<00:02:16.930> the

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
was blowing two hundred CFM with the

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.780 
was blowing two hundred CFM with the
same<00:02:17.290> fan<00:02:17.560> at<00:02:18.250> 155<00:02:19.500> we<00:02:20.500> lost<00:02:20.769> thirty<00:02:21.400> degrees

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
same fan at 155 we lost thirty degrees

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.390 
same fan at 155 we lost thirty degrees
down<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.180> 121<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.879> then<00:02:24.879> I<00:02:24.970> just<00:02:25.120> increased<00:02:25.599> it

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
down to 121 and then I just increased it

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.069 
down to 121 and then I just increased it
12<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.519> 13<00:02:27.879> degrees<00:02:27.940> with<00:02:28.239> this<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:28.629> put<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.810> fan

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
12 to 13 degrees with this I put a fan

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.280 
12 to 13 degrees with this I put a fan
of<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.680> mirror<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.660> that's<00:02:31.660> shining<00:02:32.110> right<00:02:32.200> on

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
of a mirror and that's shining right on

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.099 
of a mirror and that's shining right on
the<00:02:32.410> box<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.769> don't<00:02:32.799> know<00:02:32.980> if<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.129> can<00:02:33.280> see<00:02:33.519> the

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
the box I don't know if you can see the

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.009 
the box I don't know if you can see the
outline<00:02:35.109> of<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.680> mirror<00:02:36.540> but<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.660> increased

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
outline of the mirror but it increased

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.949 
outline of the mirror but it increased
the<00:02:38.290> heat<00:02:38.799> by<00:02:39.100> 12<00:02:39.940> 13<00:02:40.359> degrees<00:02:40.630> just<00:02:40.660> by

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
the heat by 12 13 degrees just by

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.930 
the heat by 12 13 degrees just by
putting<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.290> mirror<00:02:41.500> on<00:02:41.650> but<00:02:42.639> the<00:02:42.760> main<00:02:42.910> reason

reason we lost those 30 degrees the only
change<00:02:52.209> was<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.599> angle<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.049> box<00:02:53.910> it's<00:02:54.910> now

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
change was the angle of the box it's now

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.150 
change was the angle of the box it's now
mounted<00:02:55.599> flat<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:57.040> angle<00:02:57.340> of<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.430> Sun<00:02:57.700> is

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
mounted flat and the angle of the Sun is

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.309 
mounted flat and the angle of the Sun is
you<00:03:00.160> know<00:03:00.250> 45<00:03:00.760> degrees<00:03:01.150> or<00:03:01.359> you<00:03:01.540> know<00:03:01.840> 35

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
you know 45 degrees or you know 35

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.620 
you know 45 degrees or you know 35
degrees<00:03:02.620> somewhere<00:03:02.859> around<00:03:03.040> there

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
degrees somewhere around there

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.750 
degrees somewhere around there
so<00:03:05.250> if<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:06.489> build<00:03:06.730> your<00:03:07.260> box<00:03:08.700> mounting<00:03:09.700> it

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
so if you build your box mounting it

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.809 
so if you build your box mounting it
flat<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.030> will<00:03:10.269> lose<00:03:10.540> at<00:03:10.840> least<00:03:11.049> 30<00:03:11.290> degrees

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
flat you will lose at least 30 degrees

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.970 
flat you will lose at least 30 degrees
so<00:03:12.819> if<00:03:12.970> this<00:03:13.090> is<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.419> angle<00:03:13.780> of<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.019> Sun<00:03:14.260> as

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
so if this is the angle of the Sun as

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.780 
so if this is the angle of the Sun as
you<00:03:15.040> can<00:03:15.250> see<00:03:15.459> from<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:15.730> shadow<00:03:17.639> mount<00:03:18.639> your

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
you can see from the shadow mount your

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.860 
you can see from the shadow mount your
box<00:03:19.060> or<00:03:19.480> build<00:03:20.109> your<00:03:20.169> box<00:03:20.700> so<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.940> is<00:03:22.090> facing

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
box or build your box so it is facing

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.330 
box or build your box so it is facing
directly<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.349> Sun<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.769> it<00:03:23.829> angle<00:03:24.130> directly

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
directly the Sun and it angle directly

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.479 
directly the Sun and it angle directly
facing<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.150> Sun<00:03:25.919> this<00:03:26.919> will<00:03:27.099> help<00:03:27.250> a<00:03:27.340> lot

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
facing the Sun this will help a lot

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.270 
facing the Sun this will help a lot
increase<00:03:27.970> your<00:03:28.120> temperature<00:03:28.510> a<00:03:28.540> lot<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:29.280> I

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
increase your temperature a lot and I

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.539 
increase your temperature a lot and I
learned<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.030> lesson<00:03:31.470> so<00:03:32.470> if<00:03:33.130> I<00:03:33.220> could<00:03:33.280> figure

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
learned a lesson so if I could figure

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.089 
learned a lesson so if I could figure
out<00:03:33.669> how<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:35.069> get<00:03:36.069> this<00:03:36.280> mirror<00:03:36.669> somehow<00:03:37.569> I<00:03:38.099> get

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
out how to get this mirror somehow I get

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.209 
out how to get this mirror somehow I get
backs<00:03:39.519> on<00:03:39.730> my<00:03:39.939> temperature<00:03:40.799> then<00:03:41.799> it<00:03:41.950> would<00:03:42.099> be

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:42.219 
backs on my temperature then it would be

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:47.210 
backs on my temperature then it would be
a<00:03:42.250> pretty<00:03:42.519> good<00:03:42.610> thing

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.240 

that's<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:48.520> bye-bye
