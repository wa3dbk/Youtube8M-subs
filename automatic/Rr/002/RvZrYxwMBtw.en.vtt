00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
when they use an electric attack that

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.750 
when they use an electric attack that
it's<00:01:07.260> going<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.470> lower<00:01:07.920> down<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.430> no<00:01:08.580> HP

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.950 
you're going to do that anyways guapa
neighs<00:01:38.070> only<00:01:38.310> attacking<00:01:39.150> move<00:01:39.479> actually<00:01:39.840> is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
neighs only attacking move actually is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.780 
neighs only attacking move actually is
flail<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.439> because<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.159> also<00:01:41.280> has<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> focus

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
flail and because it also has a focus

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.010 
flail and because it also has a focus
sash<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.360> we're<00:01:42.509> thinking<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.869> replacing

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
sash but we're thinking of replacing

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.569 
sash but we're thinking of replacing
within<00:01:43.530> do<00:01:43.649> or<00:01:43.770> later<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.100> giving<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.430> a

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
within do or later and giving it a

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.539 
within do or later and giving it a
powerup<00:01:45.180> very<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.659> make<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.869> even<00:01:45.990> stronger

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
powerup very to make it even stronger

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.130 
powerup very to make it even stronger
but<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:48.000> really<00:01:48.299> fast<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:48.990> off

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
but it's really fast so it can get off

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.889 
but it's really fast so it can get off
its<00:01:49.829> flail<00:01:50.130> attack<00:01:50.340> quickly<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.880> bull<00:01:51.509> toggle

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
its flail attack quickly and bull toggle

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.319 
its flail attack quickly and bull toggle
doesn't<00:01:52.170> do<00:01:52.259> quite<00:01:52.470> enough<00:01:52.829> there<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.790> right

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
doesn't do quite enough there and right

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.100 
doesn't do quite enough there and right
you<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:55.590> know<00:01:55.710> doesn't<00:01:56.189> take<00:01:56.430> out<00:01:56.689> much<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.960> La

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
you you know doesn't take out much of La

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.319 
you you know doesn't take out much of La
funny<00:01:58.320> HP<00:01:58.770> but<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.369> see<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.820> wat<00:02:00.090> funny

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
funny HP but I see that wat funny

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.880 
funny HP but I see that wat funny
actually<00:02:00.540> resisted<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.229> attack<00:02:01.439> pretty<00:02:01.710> well

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
actually resisted the attack pretty well

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.140 
actually resisted the attack pretty well
which<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.159> kind<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.520> cool

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
which is kind of cool

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.020 
which is kind of cool
and<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:04.010> cherrim<00:02:05.010> uh<00:02:05.750> basically<00:02:06.750> sets<00:02:07.260> up<00:02:07.440> a

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
and so cherrim uh basically sets up a

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.270 
and so cherrim uh basically sets up a
sunny<00:02:09.030> day<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.540> so<00:02:10.259> now<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.160> know

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280

outs and abouts is happy and like
dancing<00:02:14.070> around<00:02:14.190> like<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:15.450> know<00:02:15.600> it's<00:02:15.990> hot

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
dancing around like you know it's hot

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.220 
dancing around like you know it's hot
stuff<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:18.180> they<00:02:18.330> sent<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.660> gardevoir

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230
