00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.849
 the interrogation for this video was sent to me by my 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.980
 subscriber Irina 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.230
 she sent me such a scheme 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.330
 asked to make out in her videos how 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.039
 it is this element that fits in 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.740
 it's called a relief column with one 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.500
 nakida in this case but 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.930
 columns are facial and purlable 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.480
 in fact, this item fits very 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.289
 it's just an ordinary single column 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.140
 nakidom 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.329
 how do you already know how to knit and if not yet 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.390
 you can then look at my references 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.210
 previous lessons under this video but 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.600
 such a column differs only in those where 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.300
 and how exactly it is mounted on this scheme 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.090
 I already started to knit that is typed 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.000
 air loops made lift two 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.280
 air loops and knitted ordinary 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.730
 columns with a whole series of sc 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.680
 here did not work pay attention that 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.840
 here are such arrows are on the schemes 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.780
 and draw precisely the beginning of the series and in what 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.240
 side to read the scheme and knit and always 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.350
 right to left next row which us 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.689
 will need to knit 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.310
 this is this one here is 3 rows here we are 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.900
 unfold knitting for that is knit 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.409
 we will be like i said 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.040
 right to left right to left but read 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.000
 schemes will be here on the arrow and so it 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.329
 single crochet 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.180
 turned here such a sweetheart from below 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.670
 denotes facial or purl now 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.020
 I will tell you how to distinguish facial and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.710
 wrong side and then I'll show you how they are 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.290
 fit here look I have this 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.860
 I have a military trick and if you own 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.110
 arm bend at elbow and stretch 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.159
 a little in front of you then bend your arms 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.780
 for example, the right one is this 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:01.649
 this way here is the shoulder 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.649
 suppose elbow and arm that 's basically 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.320
 right hand this is the same workers we will assume 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.110
 what how would 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.410
 the main thing yes here's the front column as if 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.900
 main therefore turn 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.990
 here in this direction here as our arm 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.050
 right yes it will be the front column 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.450
 always turn this way 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.330
 Imagine if you just bend Initia 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.630
 pull in front of your left arm bend 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.480
 a little bless your hands 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.360
 would be such a bend in this direction 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.580
 right and the left hand is 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.910
 auxiliary that is not our main 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.890
 therefore, we will assume that in this direction 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.950
 the auxiliary column is 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.900
 wrong side and so decided turn 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.190
 thats right up watching this facial 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.880
 bollards and here is such 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.700
 bend looking left it will 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.210
 wrong side and now I 'll show you how 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.490
 easily and simply these posts fit in 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.640
 our scheme do lift 2 air 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.640
 loops 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:22.140
 1 according to the scheme we have facial relief 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:27.569
 Double crochet look where it is 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:30.359
 attach here the bottom column of the second from 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.849
 edges where there is the first column we were 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.980
 made 2 air loops for lifting then 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.640
 have air loops replaced as it were 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.129
 here's the next column is 2 and this one 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.620
 pigtail yes where would we have to knit 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.540
 here comes the hole where we should 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.129
 were snap an ordinary column with one 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.129
 nakidy we have a bollard 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:53.040
 fit very easily also see for yourself 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:56.189
 we do nakid and now we look where 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.900
 attach look below we go 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:07.049
 passes the column here it is great so here 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:11.519
 the front column is attached like this 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:13.500
 see for a column and then just the same 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.019
 we get an extra loop and 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.389
 we knit only well 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.079
 and knit like a normal column with 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.260
 one nakida 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.560
 one extra two after two 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.560
 additional after two 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.500
 that's our whole relief facial column 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.530
 the usual bar is just a snag 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.130
 where to knit him further according to our scheme 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.080
 there is a raised purl with 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.229
 one nakidom face we tied 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.570
 now showing a purse look 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.849
 you need to clearly see where it is lower 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.880
 bollards which we will be mounted here 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.830
 he is our extra column now purl 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.500
 relief column will be attached to it 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:00.479
 made a cape and now with the reverse 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:05.460
 hand we cling to this bottom 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:09.930
 here you see how to take out a column 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:13.409
 our work loop we need 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.060
 here stretched stretched and now 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.780
 we knit like a normal column with one 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.990
 nakidom 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:23.130
 take an extra two take 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.620
 additional after 2 and we have turned 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.510
 You see what a convex facial 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.860
 column 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.520
 embossed purl who are there somewhere 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:37.790
 in the distance 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:40.270
 if you flip over here you can see further 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.800
 we are going to repeat the pattern 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.980
 front relief column purl 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.970
 facial purl and then just 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:53.960
 look repeat after me and try you 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.970
 everything will do nakid face 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.190
 embossed bar means here 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:05.110
 fastened in front 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:08.800
 we stretch the extra two 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.800
 additional after two 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.780
 now purl embossed column 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.870
 again we look where we bottom 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:23.870
 the post which will be attached and here 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:32.300
 thus purl not knit 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:37.900
 always comfortable but you have everything 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:43.670
 turn out and pulled out now after 2 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:46.120
 2 in principle, this pattern with 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.810
 alternating facial and purl 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.070
 embossed columns 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:55.100
 it suggests, as it were rezinochku ie 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.670
 here's how knitting happens 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.780
 elastic 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:04.400
 so here and when crocheting too 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:11.320
 You can get rezinochku again 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:11.320
 Facial strengthen in this way 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:20.540
 embossed columns fit so easily 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:22.790
 facial and back 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.770
 which in principle in this case with 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:27.230
 one way but as you think i already 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:31.190
 guessed they could be with two 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:37.820
 nakida their essence only where and how 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:40.160
 I hope to attach them to you 

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:43.460
 it was clear you will not be difficult 

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:46.720
 continue to read it in the schemes to find if 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:49.100
 you still have questions for me then write 

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.840
