boot up for the Samsung Galaxy s4 so

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.580 
boot up for the Samsung Galaxy s4 so
here's<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.250> battery<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:13.340> note<00:00:14.340> 2

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.140 

comparing<00:00:19.609> with<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.640> s4<00:00:22.640> so<00:00:23.640> as<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.910> can<00:00:24.090> see

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
comparing with the s4 so as you can see

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.509 
comparing with the s4 so as you can see
the<00:00:26.539> journalist<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.130> battery<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> node

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
the journalist I the battery on the node

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.200 
the journalist I the battery on the node
to<00:00:29.760> its<00:00:29.789> weight<00:00:30.420> longer<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.969> here's<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
to its weight longer and here's the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.040 
to its weight longer and here's the
milliamps<00:00:34.850> so<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:36.030> have<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.770> 2600<00:00:37.770> milliamp<00:00:39.050> for

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
milliamps so we have a 2600 milliamp for

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.490 
milliamps so we have a 2600 milliamp for
the<00:00:40.200> Samsung<00:00:40.980> Galaxy<00:00:41.070> s4<00:00:41.690> versus<00:00:42.690> 30<00:00:43.200> 100

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the Samsung Galaxy s4 versus 30 100

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
the Samsung Galaxy s4 versus 30 100
milli<00:00:44.129> amp<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.750> samsung<00:00:45.750> galaxy<00:00:45.780> note<00:00:46.230> 2

milli amp on a samsung galaxy note 2

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.880 
milli amp on a samsung galaxy note 2
we're<00:00:47.520> talking<00:00:48.180> about<00:00:48.480> at<00:00:49.020> an<00:00:49.500> additional<00:00:50.300> 500

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
we're talking about at an additional 500

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.060 
we're talking about at an additional 500
milliamp<00:00:53.780> for<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.930> samsung<00:00:55.320> galaxy<00:00:55.680> note<00:00:55.860> 2

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
milliamp for the samsung galaxy note 2

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.950 
milliamp for the samsung galaxy note 2
battery

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
battery

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.240 
battery
however<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.670> screen<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.590> on<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.859> samsung

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
however the screen on the on the samsung

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.719 
however the screen on the on the samsung
galaxy<00:01:02.280> note<00:01:02.699> 2<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.270> beer<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.890> probably<00:01:05.640> that

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
galaxy note 2 it's beer so probably that

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:13.399 
galaxy note 2 it's beer so probably that
will<00:01:06.060> compensate<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:11.090> this<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.960> battery

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
will compensate the this is the battery

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.700 
will compensate the this is the battery
life<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.720> possible<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.290> we're<00:01:19.560> gonna

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
life so it's possible that we're gonna

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.880 
life so it's possible that we're gonna
be<00:01:19.950> getting<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.430> same<00:01:20.670> battery<00:01:21.000> life<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
be getting the same battery life on the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.899 
be getting the same battery life on the
the<00:01:23.460> Samsung<00:01:23.790> Galaxy<00:01:23.880> s4<00:01:25.670> comparing<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
the Samsung Galaxy s4 comparing with the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.870 
the Samsung Galaxy s4 comparing with the
samsung<00:01:27.420> galaxy<00:01:27.810> note<00:01:27.990> 2<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.700> let's<00:01:29.700> go<00:01:29.820> ahead

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
samsung galaxy note 2 so let's go ahead

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.569

battery size just to show you how both

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.369 
battery size just to show you how both
the<00:02:47.129> batteries<00:02:47.670> compare<00:02:48.150> in<00:02:48.629> terms<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:49.140> size

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
the batteries compare in terms of size

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.160 
the batteries compare in terms of size
on<00:02:49.620> milliamp<00:02:50.330> here's<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.480> quick<00:02:51.690> look<00:02:51.870> at<00:02:52.080> the
