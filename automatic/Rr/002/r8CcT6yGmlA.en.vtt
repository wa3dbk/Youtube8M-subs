00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
what we saw with goku when he fought

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.810 
what we saw with goku when he fought
against<00:01:34.170> beerus<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:35.009> original<00:01:35.340> sub<00:01:35.460> st.<00:01:35.670> got

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
uh lost the fight ultimately because he

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.210 
uh lost the fight ultimately because he
ran<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.970> time<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.869> basically<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.009> Super

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.569 
Saiyans the evil Saints not super saiyan
but<00:01:42.899> evil<00:01:43.200> stands<00:01:43.409> around<00:01:43.710> them<00:01:43.920> ended<00:01:44.520> up

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.249 
but evil stands around them ended up
destroying<00:01:44.759> them<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.420> that's<00:01:45.720> what<00:01:45.960> happened

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
destroying them so that's what happened

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.499

the register person got is dead now then

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.210 
the register person got is dead now then
again<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.899> know<00:01:49.020> who<00:01:49.350> knows<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:50.040> could

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.100 
possibly see Tony AMA right in the hole
shenron<00:01:52.950> does<00:01:53.939> something<00:01:54.570> or<00:01:54.720> who<00:01:55.079> knows

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
shenron does something or who knows

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.690 
shenron does something or who knows
whatever<00:01:55.590> magical<00:01:56.159> reason<00:01:56.280> instead<00:01:56.610> of

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
whatever magical reason instead of

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.280 
whatever magical reason instead of
bringing<00:01:56.790> back<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.180> honestly<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.689> don't<00:01:58.079> think

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
bringing back but honestly I don't think

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.600 
bringing back but honestly I don't think
is<00:01:58.350> gonna<00:01:58.439> be<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.770> case<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.369> other<00:01:59.520> thing

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
is gonna be the case and the other thing

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.670 
is gonna be the case and the other thing
is<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.600> original<00:02:00.840> Super<00:02:01.020> Saiyan<00:02:01.170> God<00:02:01.320> was

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
is the original Super Saiyan God was

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.800 
is the original Super Saiyan God was
pure<00:02:02.009> hearted<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.939> doubt<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.270> he<00:02:03.540> would<00:02:03.630> be

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
pure hearted so I doubt that he would be

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.080 
pure hearted so I doubt that he would be
evil<00:02:04.380> as<00:02:04.770> well<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.219> there's<00:02:05.369> no<00:02:05.549> way<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.969> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
evil as well so there's no way that the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.370 
evil as well so there's no way that the
virgins<00:02:06.360> were<00:02:06.479> saying<00:02:06.689> God<00:02:06.869> could<00:02:07.170> be<00:02:07.259> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
virgins were saying God could be the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.940 
virgins were saying God could be the
first<00:02:07.649> villain<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.819> series<00:02:09.119> um<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:10.619> as<00:02:10.739> far

all<00:02:13.830> for<00:02:14.070> herself<00:02:14.220> I'll<00:02:14.910> say<00:02:15.180> it's<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.390> case

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
all for herself I'll say it's the case

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.940 
all for herself I'll say it's the case
either<00:02:15.780> because<00:02:16.140> remember<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.470> takes<00:02:16.620> five

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
either because remember it takes five

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.620

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
saying in the first place and then you

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.770 
saying in the first place and then you

like<00:02:59.940> drought<00:03:00.150> super<00:03:00.630> in<00:03:00.750> my<00:03:00.840> opinion<00:03:01.110> is

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
like drought super in my opinion is

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.500 
like drought super in my opinion is
going<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.620> be<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:02.010> brand<00:03:02.730> new<00:03:02.880> experience<00:03:03.420> and

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
going to be a brand new experience and

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.090 
going to be a brand new experience and
anything<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.320> we<00:03:04.500> think<00:03:04.740> is<00:03:04.800> going<00:03:05.010> to

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
anything that we think is going to

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.890 
anything that we think is going to
happen<00:03:05.160> most<00:03:05.580> like<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.880> won't<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:06.360> as<00:03:06.840> I

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.060 
happen most like you won't so as I
discussed<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.410> past<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.740> don't<00:03:07.770> think

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
discussed in the past I don't think

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.710
