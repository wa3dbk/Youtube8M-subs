00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.009
 already civil work has stopped in a 

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.720
 operation against trafficking 

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.790
 anabolic and growth hormones 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.920
 22 people accused of passing these 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.840
 substances in various gyms 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.220
 Spanish television provinces has 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.290
 talked to a young man that for ten 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.290
 years he was injecting himself these drugs 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.820
 Alberto Garrido dreamed of having a 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.500
 Muscled body to feel more 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.420
 popular in its environment led to put 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.580
 intramuscular injections all 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.080
 days the consumption without control provoked 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.980
 a kidney failure that was what 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.320
 made him start a treatment 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.320
 psychiatric to detoxify 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.860
 doctor who treated me told me only 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.050
 said look guys I know what you're 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.540
 doing 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:51.150
 and have a thing if you get 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.920
 3 about 4 hours later better in tow 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.450
 the civil time says that in the past 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.070
 years there has been an increase in 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.960
 criminal organizations that traffic 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.330
 with these drugs so much that in some 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.670
 cocaine traffickers already do it with 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.949
 these substances the government has started 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.210
 to give information in the pharmacies of 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.040
 its harmful effects short period has 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.080
 cost almost two years but Alberto 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.960
 walks and safe and accepting your body 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.180
 one meter 70 centimeters tall and 65 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.760
 kilos of weight an image that nothing has 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.369
 that seeing as it was two years ago this 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.990
 physical was his dream and for this he began to 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.820
 train in the gym until one day 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.340
 someone offered to take some products 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.530
 what he said in those two books, that is, 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.540
 it's much more of the same smoking than this 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.550
 started like this with steroid cycles 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.979
 anabolic and his body started to 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.220
 change is oats that is almost 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.960
 practically like a finger 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.580
 it is impossible to get so 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:49.880
 natural you are seeing that what you get 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.680
 in two months with those products or not 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.870
 you get it neither in two years of the two 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.640
 years and a half naturally the cycles 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.320
 they were increasingly followed by mixing 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.570
 other drugs to counteract 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.160
 side effects I bought them too 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.650
 online at cheaper prices 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.010
 although I knew that some could even 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.490
 being fake injected is so much that 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.870
 not then the muscle does not admit it and you 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.060
 it produces an infection 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.690
 that is full of pus they opened me 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.700
 by the leg and you can imagine a 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.799
 liter of pus they took me out but after 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.900
 he suffered from kidney failure that almost 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.970
 it causes him death was the moment 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.769
 two years in which he decided to start a 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.440
 psychiatric treatment to be cured of 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:35.840
 the vigorexia I was practically without 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.840
 testosterone until six months ago 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.630
 what does that produce for you? 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:44.040
 depression is not interesting at all 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.990
 stimulants anti-inflammatory hormones 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.120
 of growth clenbuterol drugs 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.280
 dangerous without control and associated to 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.800
 sometimes in a fashion favored by the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.930
 more aesthetic than sports bodybuilding 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.840
 that doing a very big muscle very 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.910
 very striking but I really am 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.430
 producing that my bones are more more 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.830
 Fragile weaker than my muscle 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.050
 stools have less elastic capacity 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.210
 with which you have more risk that 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.940
 have break baldness in both men 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.500
 as women and even sudden death is 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.240
 the triptych that the agency has drawn up 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.980
 protection of health in Spain 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.140
 the sport to give information in the 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.970
 pharmacies for the guard group 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.170
 civilian who investigates the illicit traffic 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.670
 of these drugs 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.770
 Alberto is an example of the damage that 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.360
 cause health and how they work 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.460
 the criminal organizations of a 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.680
 very profitable crime what we have gone 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.360
 seeing is that there are drug dealers 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.040
 that have gone to traffickers 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.300
 anabolic because because the penalties 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.310
 they are much lower 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.570
 they say it leaves almost as much money and the 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.570
 risk is much lower
