balls<00:02:39.569> of<00:02:39.780> yarn<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.890> we<00:02:41.010> see<00:02:41.190> here<00:02:42.290> we<00:02:43.290> have

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
balls of yarn that we see here we have

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.890 
balls of yarn that we see here we have
some<00:02:43.650> monsters<00:02:44.069> here<00:02:44.370> such<00:02:45.030> as<00:02:45.269> these<00:02:45.540> crabs

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
some monsters here such as these crabs

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.380 
some monsters here such as these crabs
you<00:02:46.859> can't<00:02:47.099> hit<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.370> walls<00:02:47.579> you<00:02:47.909> can<00:02:48.090> hit<00:02:48.239> the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
you can't hit the walls you can hit the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.710 
you can't hit the walls you can hit the
monsters<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.760> each<00:02:50.760> time<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.269> collect<00:02:51.420> a

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
monsters and each time you collect a

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.240 
monsters and each time you collect a
ball<00:02:52.109> of<00:02:52.230> yarn<00:02:52.470> just<00:02:52.889> like<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.190> original

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
ball of yarn just like the original

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.990 
ball of yarn just like the original
snake<00:02:53.760> game<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.980> your<00:02:55.980> character<00:02:56.489> in<00:02:56.730> case

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
snake game you your character in case

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.789 
snake game you your character in case
this<00:02:57.209> in<00:02:57.420> this<00:02:57.750> case<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.200> sock<00:02:58.409> puppet

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
this in this case the sock puppet

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.599 
this in this case the sock puppet
becomes<00:02:59.579> one<00:02:59.970> length<00:03:00.569> longer<00:03:01.129> you<00:03:02.129> cannot<00:03:02.400> hit

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
becomes one length longer you cannot hit

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:03.949 
becomes one length longer you cannot hit
into<00:03:02.849> yourself<00:03:03.000> which<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.659> will<00:03:03.780> demonstrate

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
into yourself which I will demonstrate

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.020 
into yourself which I will demonstrate
now<00:03:04.849> for<00:03:05.849> example<00:03:07.639> actually<00:03:08.639> I'm<00:03:08.730> not<00:03:08.819> long

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
now for example actually I'm not long

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.110 
now for example actually I'm not long
enough<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.420> into<00:03:09.780> myself<00:03:13.280> but<00:03:14.280> now<00:03:14.549> I<00:03:14.579> guess<00:03:14.940> I

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
enough to into myself but now I guess I

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.890 
enough to into myself but now I guess I
am<00:03:16.190> there<00:03:17.190> we<00:03:17.310> go<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.419> is<00:03:18.569> snake

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
am there we go so that is snake

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.199 
am there we go so that is snake
definitely<00:03:19.829> probably<00:03:20.310> one<00:03:20.519> of<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.849> best<00:03:21.000> out

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
definitely probably one of the best out

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.059 
definitely probably one of the best out
of<00:03:21.239> all<00:03:21.449> these<00:03:21.629> four<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.169> the<00:03:22.650> last<00:03:22.829> one<00:03:23.040> is

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
of all these four and the last one is

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.330 
of all these four and the last one is
coin<00:03:23.430> push<00:03:23.639> frenzy<00:03:24.410> made<00:03:25.410> by<00:03:25.560> freeverse<00:03:26.040> the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
coin push frenzy made by freeverse the

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.670 
coin push frenzy made by freeverse the
developers<00:03:26.879> of<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:27.840> believe<00:03:28.109> flick<00:03:28.440> fishing

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
developers of I believe flick fishing

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.720 
developers of I believe flick fishing
and<00:03:30.079> some<00:03:31.079> other<00:03:31.290> games<00:03:31.530> they're<00:03:32.340> pretty<00:03:32.489> big

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
and some other games they're pretty big

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.210 
and some other games they're pretty big
developer<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:34.169> basically<00:03:34.560> this<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:34.739> kind<00:03:35.190> of

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
developer so basically this is kind of

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.580 
developer so basically this is kind of
like<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.400> arcade<00:03:36.109> machines<00:03:37.109> you<00:03:37.290> probably

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
like the arcade machines you probably

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.020 
like the arcade machines you probably
see<00:03:37.769> not<00:03:37.980> like<00:03:38.129> chuck<00:03:38.370> e<00:03:38.489> cheese's<00:03:38.910> or

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
see not like chuck e cheese's or

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.119 
see not like chuck e cheese's or
something<00:03:39.359> like<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:39.650> where<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:40.769> put<00:03:40.949> in<00:03:41.040> a

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
something like that where you put in a

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.809 
something like that where you put in a
coin<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:43.620> can<00:03:43.769> win<00:03:43.919> coins<00:03:44.220> if<00:03:44.489> the

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
coin and you can win coins if the

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.740 
coin and you can win coins if the
machine<00:03:45.120> pushes<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:46.139> other<00:03:46.319> coins<00:03:46.530> out<00:03:46.769> so

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
machine pushes the other coins out so

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.020 
machine pushes the other coins out so
you<00:03:48.750> get<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:48.959> coin<00:03:49.310> every<00:03:50.310> 30<00:03:50.519> seconds<00:03:50.910> of

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
you get a coin every 30 seconds of

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.360 
you get a coin every 30 seconds of
playing<00:03:51.329> and<00:03:51.569> you<00:03:52.109> get<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.470> coin<00:03:52.829> every<00:03:53.129> three

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
playing and you get a coin every three

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.830 
playing and you get a coin every three
minutes<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:53.790> you're<00:03:53.879> not<00:03:54.030> playing<00:03:54.299> so<00:03:54.599> let's

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
minutes that you're not playing so let's

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.379 
minutes that you're not playing so let's
say<00:03:54.930> my<00:03:55.530> ipod's<00:03:55.980> on<00:03:56.220> but<00:03:56.669> i'm<00:03:56.790> not<00:03:57.120> playing

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
say my ipod's on but i'm not playing

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.360 
say my ipod's on but i'm not playing
this<00:03:57.510> game<00:03:57.629> I<00:03:57.989> get<00:03:58.409> a<00:03:58.440> new<00:03:58.739> coin<00:03:58.919> every<00:03:59.190> three

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
this game I get a new coin every three

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.270 
this game I get a new coin every three
minutes<00:03:59.549> it<00:04:00.239> counters<00:04:00.870> here<00:04:01.230> so<00:04:01.889> I<00:04:01.919> have<00:04:02.069> 10

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
minutes it counters here so I have 10

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.220 
minutes it counters here so I have 10
seconds<00:04:02.639> left<00:04:02.879> but<00:04:03.419> basically<00:04:03.840> what<00:04:04.049> i<00:04:04.079> would

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
seconds left but basically what i would

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.229 
seconds left but basically what i would
do<00:04:04.379> is<00:04:04.530> i<00:04:04.620> would<00:04:04.650> tap<00:04:04.949> here<00:04:05.310> would<00:04:05.760> add<00:04:05.909> a<00:04:05.940> coin

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239
