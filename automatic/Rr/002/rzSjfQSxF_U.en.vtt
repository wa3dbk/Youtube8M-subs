you decide to order from these guys this
is<00:00:23.949> the<00:00:24.130> tremolo<00:00:24.400> when<00:00:24.789> I<00:00:24.820> left<00:00:25.119> it<00:00:25.269> unfinished

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
is the tremolo when I left it unfinished

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.179 
is the tremolo when I left it unfinished
or<00:00:26.019> unpainted<00:00:26.349> so<00:00:26.650> you<00:00:26.740> can<00:00:26.859> see<00:00:26.980> what<00:00:27.099> it

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
or unpainted so you can see what it

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.710 
or unpainted so you can see what it
looks<00:00:27.369> like<00:00:27.550> after<00:00:28.300> you<00:00:28.359> put<00:00:28.510> it<00:00:28.570> together

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
looks like after you put it together

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.810 
looks like after you put it together
basically<00:00:29.080> it's<00:00:29.410> a<00:00:29.439> circuit<00:00:29.769> board<00:00:29.890> bunch<00:00:30.730> of

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
basically it's a circuit board bunch of

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.570 
basically it's a circuit board bunch of

everything<00:00:34.480> we<00:00:34.600> need<00:00:34.809> to<00:00:34.989> build<00:00:35.140> a<00:00:35.199> pedal<00:00:35.530> you

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
everything we need to build a pedal you

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.810 
everything we need to build a pedal you
just<00:00:35.830> got<00:00:35.949> to<00:00:36.040> put<00:00:36.160> it<00:00:36.250> together

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
just got to put it together

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.680 
just got to put it together
this<00:00:37.420> one<00:00:37.660> was<00:00:37.870> 75<00:00:38.379> bucks<00:00:38.649> the<00:00:38.890> tremolo<00:00:39.160> and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
this one was 75 bucks the tremolo and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.729 
this one was 75 bucks the tremolo and
wasn't<00:00:40.690> that<00:00:40.750> hard<00:00:40.899> to<00:00:40.989> put<00:00:41.050> together<00:00:41.290> it<00:00:41.649> was

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
wasn't that hard to put together it was

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.430 
wasn't that hard to put together it was
pretty<00:00:41.950> cool<00:00:42.129> and<00:00:42.340> they<00:00:42.730> comes<00:00:43.030> with<00:00:43.360> a<00:00:43.870> little

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
pretty cool and they comes with a little

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.049 
pretty cool and they comes with a little
training<00:00:44.649> kit<00:00:45.100> so<00:00:45.460> if<00:00:45.640> you've<00:00:45.760> never<00:00:45.879> done

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
training kit so if you've never done

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:47.310 
training kit so if you've never done
soldering<00:00:46.300> on<00:00:46.510> circuit<00:00:46.870> boards<00:00:46.899> and<00:00:47.110> stuff

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
soldering on circuit boards and stuff

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.139

like<00:00:47.440> that<00:00:47.649> you<00:00:48.100> can<00:00:48.129> try<00:00:48.520> on<00:00:48.670> that<00:00:48.789> if<00:00:49.000> it's

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
like that you can try on that if it's

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.029 
like that you can try on that if it's
your<00:00:49.239> first<00:00:49.449> order<00:00:50.350> from<00:00:50.469> them<00:00:50.620> so<00:00:50.829> you<00:00:50.920> don't

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
your first order from them so you don't

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.680 
your first order from them so you don't
screw<00:00:51.370> your<00:00:51.489> pedal<00:00:51.760> up<00:00:51.879> that's<00:00:52.149> very<00:00:52.510> cool

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
screw your pedal up that's very cool

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
speed intensity and a level controls so

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:16.260 
speed intensity and a level controls so
we<00:01:05.080> turn<00:01:05.259> it<00:01:05.350> on<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:15.490> a<00:01:15.520> good<00:01:15.610> quality<00:01:15.819> pedal

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
we turn it on it's a good quality pedal

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.309 
we turn it on it's a good quality pedal

if you want to do a bunch of different
types<00:01:19.450> of<00:01:19.599> tremolo<00:01:19.899> this<00:01:20.289> is<00:01:20.440> not<00:01:20.590> for<00:01:20.800> you<00:01:20.950> if

00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:21.099 
types of tremolo this is not for you if

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:23.430 
types of tremolo this is not for you if
you<00:01:21.190> just<00:01:21.280> want<00:01:21.610> a<00:01:21.670> tremolo<00:01:21.970> to<00:01:22.090> add<00:01:22.450> add<00:01:23.020> to

with the intensity all the way up to a
nice<00:01:43.450> wobble<00:01:43.960> effect<00:01:44.050> or<00:01:44.590> you<00:01:44.650> can<00:01:45.010> kind<00:01:45.310> of

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
nice wobble effect or you can kind of

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.190 
nice wobble effect or you can kind of
mellow<00:01:45.550> it<00:01:45.730> out<00:01:45.850> put<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.630> intensity<00:01:46.900> back<00:01:47.170> a

there's something that I was surprised
with<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.630> I'm<00:02:23.690> going<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.870> take<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.280> intensity

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
with it I'm going to take the intensity

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.110 
with it I'm going to take the intensity
and<00:02:25.700> speed<00:02:25.910> all<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.090> way<00:02:26.180> down<00:02:30.910> just<00:02:31.910> color

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
and speed all the way down just color

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.610 
and speed all the way down just color

into I don't know if would be that

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.600 
into I don't know if would be that
obvious<00:02:44.900> on<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.590> film<00:02:45.890> on<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.190> video<00:02:46.490> when

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
obvious on the film on the video when

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.840 
obvious on the film on the video when
you're<00:02:46.760> watching<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.860> but<00:02:48.860> it<00:02:48.950> does<00:02:49.130> take<00:02:49.820> a

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
you're watching it but it does take a

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.800 
you're watching it but it does take a
little<00:02:50.090> bit<00:02:50.300> high

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
little bit high

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.570 
little bit high
put<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.320> little<00:02:51.560> behind<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.010> takes<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.460> little

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
put a little behind and takes a little

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.280 
put a little behind and takes a little
bit<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.850> low<00:02:52.970> end<00:02:53.120> up<00:02:53.240> and<00:02:53.480> here's<00:02:53.900> one<00:02:54.080> cool

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
bit of low end up and here's one cool

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.900 
bit of low end up and here's one cool
thing<00:02:54.320> about<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.770> if<00:02:54.860> you<00:02:54.950> have<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.340> rate<00:02:55.580> and

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
thing about it if you have the rate and

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.600 
thing about it if you have the rate and
the<00:02:56.660> depth<00:02:56.870> completely<00:02:57.350> off<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:58.160> can<00:02:58.310> use<00:02:58.460> it

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
the depth completely off you can use it

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.090 
the depth completely off you can use it
as<00:02:58.700> kind<00:02:58.880> of<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.120> boost<00:02:59.750> or<00:02:59.990> clean<00:03:00.230> boost<00:03:00.440> too<00:03:00.740> so

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
as kind of a boost or clean boost too so

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.750 
as kind of a boost or clean boost too so
here's<00:03:01.370> without<00:03:01.550> it<00:03:03.100> here's<00:03:04.100> with<00:03:04.490> it<00:03:04.640> with

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
here's without it here's with it with

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.210 
here's without it here's with it with
the<00:03:04.940> level<00:03:05.510> knob<00:03:05.750> up<00:03:05.990> it's<00:03:06.170> just<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.470> touched

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.690 

puts<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.280> little<00:03:10.520> touch<00:03:10.670> extra<00:03:11.090> gain<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:13.400> a

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
puts a little touch extra gain and a

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.720 
puts a little touch extra gain and a
little<00:03:13.910> bit<00:03:14.000> extra<00:03:14.120> volume<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:16.340> that's<00:03:16.520> cool

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
little bit extra volume so that's cool

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.070 
little bit extra volume so that's cool
if<00:03:16.820> you<00:03:16.940> want<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.210> kind<00:03:17.330> of<00:03:17.450> get<00:03:17.900> a

dual-purpose use out of this pedal you
can<00:03:19.880> use<00:03:20.090> it<00:03:20.240> for<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.420> kind<00:03:20.600> of<00:03:20.660> a<00:03:20.750> clean<00:03:21.050> boost

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590
