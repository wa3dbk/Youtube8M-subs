I<00:04:56.750> was<00:04:57.530> disappointed<00:04:57.890> in<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.340> endings<00:04:58.789> which

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
I was disappointed in the endings which

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.869 
I was disappointed in the endings which
are<00:04:59.120> essentially<00:04:59.630> text-based

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:00.879 
are essentially text-based

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:03.059

yeah<00:05:01.330> showing<00:05:01.839> me<00:05:01.990> stats<00:05:02.319> is<00:05:02.559> kind<00:05:02.770> of<00:05:02.889> cool

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
yeah showing me stats is kind of cool

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:06.299 
yeah showing me stats is kind of cool
but<00:05:03.339> that's<00:05:03.819> it<00:05:04.409> even<00:05:05.409> the<00:05:05.499> breeze<00:05:05.740> mode<00:05:06.009> gets

00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:06.309 
but that's it even the breeze mode gets

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:08.100 
but that's it even the breeze mode gets
a<00:05:06.399> better<00:05:06.580> ending<00:05:07.029> and<00:05:07.179> that<00:05:07.599> one<00:05:07.749> tells<00:05:07.990> you

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
a better ending and that one tells you

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.889 
a better ending and that one tells you
to<00:05:08.199> screw<00:05:08.439> off<00:05:08.589> and<00:05:08.619> restart<00:05:09.219> the<00:05:09.309> game<00:05:09.339> oh
