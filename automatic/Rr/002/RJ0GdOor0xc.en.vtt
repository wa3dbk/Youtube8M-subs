Matthew Wilson reformed the center here
I'm<00:00:02.159> commonly<00:00:03.149> asked<00:00:03.480> what's<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.840> difference

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230

the main difference such as differences
that<00:01:09.840> you'll<00:01:10.049> notice<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> worm<00:01:10.860> factors

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that you'll notice in the worm factors

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.730 
that you'll notice in the worm factors
one<00:01:11.490> factor<00:01:11.820> 360<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:13.110> basically<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.650> to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
one factor 360 it's basically going to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.359 
one factor 360 it's basically going to
be<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> stand<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.930> spouts<00:01:16.770> made<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> little

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
be the stand on the spouts made a little

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.270 
be the stand on the spouts made a little
differently<00:01:17.850> between<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.990> two<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:20.040> lids

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
differently between the two and the lids

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.070 
differently between the two and the lids
are<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.549> little<00:01:20.670> bit<00:01:20.850> differently<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.540> here's

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
are a little bit differently and here's

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.859 
are a little bit differently and here's
a<00:01:22.140> close-up<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> worm<00:01:23.040> factory<00:01:23.610> lids<00:01:23.939> the
