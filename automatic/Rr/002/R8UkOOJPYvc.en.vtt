first this opening for the I'm not

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.480 
first this opening for the I'm not
really<00:02:10.869> sure<00:02:11.080> what<00:02:11.200> this<00:02:11.320> is<00:02:11.380> for

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
really sure what this is for

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.690 
really sure what this is for
inside<00:02:13.060> because<00:02:13.660> right<00:02:14.170> now<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.830> underneath

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
inside because right now the underneath

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.050 
inside because right now the underneath
this<00:02:16.630> canopy<00:02:17.050> here<00:02:17.350> it's<00:02:18.070> actually<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.550> hard

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
this canopy here it's actually a hard

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.330 
this canopy here it's actually a hard
piece<00:02:19.240> that's<00:02:19.810> covering<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.560> interior<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.220> it

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
piece that's covering the interior so it

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.490 
piece that's covering the interior so it
doesn't<00:02:21.550> really<00:02:21.750> increase<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.930> Headroom

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
doesn't really increase the Headroom

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.870 
doesn't really increase the Headroom
organs<00:02:23.800> like<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.160> but<00:02:24.340> I'm<00:02:24.430> sure<00:02:24.640> in<00:02:24.790> the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
organs like that but I'm sure in the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.030 
organs like that but I'm sure in the
real<00:02:25.060> van<00:02:25.350> that's<00:02:26.350> what<00:02:26.560> it's<00:02:26.680> for

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
real van that's what it's for

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.340 
real van that's what it's for
and<00:02:27.280> then<00:02:28.000> there's<00:02:28.209> a<00:02:28.300> bit<00:02:28.600> of<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.840> storage

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
and then there's a bit of a storage

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
on that there we go we can close that

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.460 
on that there we go we can close that
and<00:03:14.560> then<00:03:15.150> also<00:03:16.150> if<00:03:16.600> you<00:03:16.630> pull<00:03:16.959> this<00:03:17.080> handle

for access and storage and whatnot and
then<00:03:26.830> on<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.310> other<00:03:27.340> side<00:03:28.560> like<00:03:29.560> breaking<00:03:29.800> the

as well revealing more more of the

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.720 
as well revealing more more of the
interior<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:43.410> after<00:03:44.410> we<00:03:44.530> close<00:03:44.799> that<00:03:44.830> we<00:03:45.580> can

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
interior and after we close that we can

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.590 
interior and after we close that we can
open<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:47.130> I<00:03:48.130> guess<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.730> passenger

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
lot of moving parts and it ends up being

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.600 
lot of moving parts and it ends up being
kind<00:04:04.920> of<00:04:05.100> flimsy<00:04:05.660> anyway<00:04:06.660> so<00:04:07.410> yeah<00:04:07.950> as<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.430> can

actually open up the roof so that we can
actually<00:05:00.480> have<00:05:01.080> a<00:05:01.110> better<00:05:01.320> look<00:05:01.500> at<00:05:01.650> the

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
actually have a better look at the

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.250 
actually have a better look at the
interior<00:05:02.160> so<00:05:03.090> as<00:05:03.420> you<00:05:03.660> probably<00:05:03.840> saw<00:05:04.110> from

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
interior so as you probably saw from

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.340 
interior so as you probably saw from
before<00:05:04.620> these<00:05:04.920> things<00:05:05.300> pop<00:05:06.300> open<00:05:06.510> and<00:05:06.810> this<00:05:07.230> is

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
before these things pop open and this is

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.110 
before these things pop open and this is
what<00:05:07.470> I<00:05:07.500> was<00:05:07.650> saying<00:05:07.830> before<00:05:08.040> the<00:05:08.520> underside

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
what I was saying before the underside

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.140 
what I was saying before the underside
of<00:05:09.150> it<00:05:09.330> is<00:05:09.450> completely<00:05:10.020> blocked<00:05:10.650> so<00:05:11.150> there's

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
of it is completely blocked so there's

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.240 
of it is completely blocked so there's
no<00:05:12.300> real<00:05:12.480> function<00:05:12.960> for<00:05:13.200> it<00:05:13.290> more<00:05:13.530> of<00:05:13.830> a

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
no real function for it more of a

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.750 
no real function for it more of a
declaration<00:05:14.820> of<00:05:15.000> peace<00:05:15.420> here<00:05:15.780> and<00:05:16.770> this<00:05:17.580> is

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
declaration of peace here and this is

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.620 
declaration of peace here and this is
the<00:05:18.030> interior<00:05:18.630> as<00:05:19.200> you<00:05:19.800> can<00:05:19.920> see<00:05:20.100> here<00:05:20.630> that's

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
the interior as you can see here that's

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.170 
the interior as you can see here that's
the<00:05:21.900> table<00:05:22.320> and<00:05:22.550> what<00:05:23.550> happens<00:05:23.880> is<00:05:24.030> you<00:05:24.150> can

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
the table and what happens is you can

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.970 
the table and what happens is you can
actually<00:05:24.510> hold<00:05:25.200> it<00:05:25.410> push<00:05:26.040> the<00:05:26.070> table<00:05:26.430> down<00:05:26.760> and

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
actually hold it push the table down and

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.890 
actually hold it push the table down and
there's<00:05:28.980> a<00:05:29.070> little<00:05:29.520> glass<00:05:29.820> I<00:05:30.180> can<00:05:30.210> put<00:05:30.750> that

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
there's a little glass I can put that

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.160 
there's a little glass I can put that
away<00:05:30.990> and<00:05:31.440> the<00:05:32.370> seats<00:05:32.700> here<00:05:33.090> move<00:05:33.420> about<00:05:33.750> to

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
away and the seats here move about to

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.270 
away and the seats here move about to
create<00:05:34.590> a<00:05:34.770> I<00:05:34.860> think<00:05:35.220> a<00:05:35.670> bed<00:05:37.250> which<00:05:38.250> is

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
create a I think a bed which is

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.610 
create a I think a bed which is
extremely<00:05:39.000> cool<00:05:39.890> so<00:05:40.890> do<00:05:41.220> that<00:05:41.460> and<00:05:41.850> and<00:05:42.690> that

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
extremely cool so do that and and that

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.800 
extremely cool so do that and and that
that<00:05:44.100> one<00:05:44.250> is<00:05:44.280> actually<00:05:44.520> just<00:05:44.880> completely<00:05:45.780> uh

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
that one is actually just completely uh

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.710 
that one is actually just completely uh
I<00:05:46.310> was<00:05:47.310> actually<00:05:47.430> fixed<00:05:47.910> there<00:05:48.060> but<00:05:48.240> this<00:05:48.450> side

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
I was actually fixed there but this side

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.470 
I was actually fixed there but this side
you<00:05:49.590> can<00:05:49.740> actually<00:05:49.890> have<00:05:50.280> a<00:05:50.310> bed<00:05:50.550> there<00:05:50.820> so

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
you can actually have a bed there so

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.480 
you can actually have a bed there so
that's<00:05:51.660> really<00:05:51.810> cool<00:05:52.140> and<00:05:52.860> then<00:05:53.010> you<00:05:53.040> can<00:05:53.250> see

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
that's really cool and then you can see

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.230 
that's really cool and then you can see
little<00:05:53.850> lamps<00:05:54.480> here<00:05:55.790> that<00:05:56.790> one's<00:05:56.940> kind<00:05:57.150> of

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
little lamps here that one's kind of

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.350 
little lamps here that one's kind of
crooked<00:05:58.040> they<00:05:59.040> rotate<00:05:59.430> and<00:05:59.580> then<00:05:59.670> you<00:05:59.880> see<00:06:00.120> a

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
crooked they rotate and then you see a

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.590 
crooked they rotate and then you see a
lava<00:06:00.780> lamp<00:06:01.020> inside<00:06:01.500> it<00:06:01.650> as<00:06:01.770> well<00:06:02.330> try<00:06:03.330> to<00:06:03.360> focus

in on that

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.940

and then I'll give you a better view of

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.510 
and then I'll give you a better view of
the<00:06:08.070> kitchen<00:06:08.490> here<00:06:09.680> there<00:06:10.680> we<00:06:10.890> go<00:06:10.920> the

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
the kitchen here there we go the

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.100 
the kitchen here there we go the
curtains<00:06:13.130> so<00:06:14.130> these<00:06:14.370> were<00:06:14.580> a<00:06:14.610> bit<00:06:14.850> of<00:06:14.970> a

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
curtains so these were a bit of a

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.870 
curtains so these were a bit of a
challenge<00:06:16.110> because<00:06:16.620> I<00:06:17.040> was<00:06:17.400> afraid<00:06:17.640> that<00:06:17.730> I

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
challenge because I was afraid that I

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.810 
challenge because I was afraid that I
would<00:06:18.090> rip<00:06:18.420> the<00:06:18.570> curtains<00:06:18.900> when<00:06:19.140> I<00:06:19.170> was<00:06:19.350> on

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
would rip the curtains when I was on

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.220 
would rip the curtains when I was on
when<00:06:20.820> I<00:06:20.850> was<00:06:20.970> on<00:06:21.030> mounting<00:06:21.690> it<00:06:21.780> onto<00:06:22.110> this

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
when I was on mounting it onto this

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.230 
when I was on mounting it onto this
thing<00:06:22.500> here<00:06:22.770> but<00:06:23.220> it<00:06:23.430> didn't<00:06:23.730> it<00:06:23.820> was<00:06:23.910> actually

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240
