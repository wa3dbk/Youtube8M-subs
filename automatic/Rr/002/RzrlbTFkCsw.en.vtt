00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.780 
so I'm going to go ahead and remove all
that<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.379> then<00:00:40.559> give<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.829> closer<00:00:41.100> look<00:00:41.370> as

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
that and then give you a closer look as

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.510 
that and then give you a closer look as
to<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.120> you're<00:00:42.239> looking<00:00:42.510> for<00:00:42.690> behind<00:00:43.020> there

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
to what you're looking for behind there

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.190 
to what you're looking for behind there
alright<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.579> after<00:00:45.059> removing<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.719> necessary

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
alright so after removing the necessary

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.740 
alright so after removing the necessary
interior<00:00:46.829> panels<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.460> it's<00:00:48.149> tempting<00:00:48.480> to

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
interior panels and it's tempting to

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.959 
interior panels and it's tempting to
remove<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.200> headliner<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:50.100> determined<00:00:50.850> that

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
remove the headliner I determined that

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.660 
remove the headliner I determined that
it<00:00:51.090> was<00:00:51.239> much<00:00:51.480> more<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.989> pain<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> butt

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
it was much more of a pain in the butt

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.250 
it was much more of a pain in the butt
to<00:00:53.670> try<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.940> get<00:00:54.090> these<00:00:54.210> visors<00:00:54.780> out<00:00:55.020> and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
to try to get these visors out and

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.920 
to try to get these visors out and
everything<00:00:55.969> to<00:00:56.969> try<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.270> get<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> headliner

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
everything to try to get the headliner

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.799 
everything to try to get the headliner
out<00:00:58.910> specifically<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.149> little<00:01:00.420> clip<00:01:00.660> right

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
out specifically this little clip right

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:01.880 
out specifically this little clip right
here<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.020> couldn't<00:01:01.320> really<00:01:01.410> figure<00:01:01.620> out<00:01:01.770> how<00:01:01.829> to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
actually what worked the best just a

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.469 
actually what worked the best just a
household<00:01:55.770> old<00:01:56.250> steak<00:01:56.850> knife<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.180> had<00:01:57.299> laying

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
household old steak knife I had laying

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.539 
household old steak knife I had laying

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
around that actually works really well

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.569 
around that actually works really well
so<00:02:00.409> as<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.530> was<00:02:01.649> using<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.130> other<00:02:02.310> knife

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.809 
out of there without messing up the
paint<00:02:25.439> when<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.040> did<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.340> at<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.489> junkyard

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
to go I did go ahead I go around the

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
to go I did go ahead I go around the
inside<00:04:05.080> of<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.650> truck<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:07.680> check<00:04:08.680> to<00:04:08.800> make<00:04:08.950> sure

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
inside of the truck I check to make sure

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.080 
inside of the truck I check to make sure
that<00:04:09.400> it<00:04:09.520> was<00:04:09.610> squeezing<00:04:09.910> through<00:04:12.090> everything

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
that it was squeezing through everything

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.520 
that it was squeezing through everything
the<00:04:13.300> way<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:13.450> should<00:04:13.750> make<00:04:13.930> it<00:04:13.959> make<00:04:14.350> it<00:04:14.470> look

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
the way it should make it make it look

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.229 
the way it should make it make it look
like<00:04:14.709> it<00:04:14.830> was<00:04:14.920> a<00:04:14.950> sandwich<00:04:15.670> ring<00:04:15.819> really<00:04:16.000> good

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
like it was a sandwich ring really good

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.509 
like it was a sandwich ring really good
on<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:17.530> window<00:04:17.829> make<00:04:18.130> sure<00:04:18.160> I<00:04:18.280> get<00:04:18.459> a<00:04:18.489> good

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
on the window make sure I get a good

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.599 
on the window make sure I get a good
seal<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:19.269> it<00:04:19.419> looks<00:04:19.570> like<00:04:19.630> I<00:04:19.810> do<00:04:19.870> so<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.889> would

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
seal and it looks like I do so I would

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.060 
seal and it looks like I do so I would
say<00:04:21.820> that<00:04:22.060> I'm<00:04:22.150> done<00:04:22.360> here<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:23.770> next<00:04:23.950> thing

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
say that I'm done here the next thing

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.159 
say that I'm done here the next thing
I'm<00:04:24.220> going<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.400> do<00:04:24.550> is<00:04:24.760> just<00:04:24.910> kind<00:04:25.120> of<00:04:25.180> put<00:04:26.110> a

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
I'm going to do is just kind of put a

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.250 
I'm going to do is just kind of put a
little<00:04:26.940> painters<00:04:27.940> tape<00:04:28.120> around<00:04:28.870> the<00:04:28.990> edge<00:04:29.140> of

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
little painters tape around the edge of

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.960 
little painters tape around the edge of
it<00:04:29.380> and<00:04:29.980> then<00:04:30.070> let<00:04:30.220> it<00:04:30.250> sit<00:04:30.460> for<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.669> couple<00:04:30.700> days

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
it and then let it sit for a couple days

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.570 
it and then let it sit for a couple days
that<00:04:31.240> way<00:04:31.390> it<00:04:31.510> cures<00:04:31.810> up<00:04:32.020> nice<00:04:32.230> and<00:04:32.260> good<00:04:32.580> one

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
that way it cures up nice and good one

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.680 
that way it cures up nice and good one
thing<00:04:33.730> I<00:04:33.820> will<00:04:33.970> say<00:04:34.000> is<00:04:34.300> that<00:04:34.419> you're<00:04:34.540> not

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
thing I will say is that you're not

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.960 
thing I will say is that you're not
supposed<00:04:34.990> to<00:04:35.050> do<00:04:35.230> this<00:04:35.520> and<00:04:36.520> freezing

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
supposed to do this and freezing

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.670 
supposed to do this and freezing
temperatures<00:04:37.419> or<00:04:37.690> really<00:04:37.930> cool<00:04:38.169> temperatures

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
temperatures or really cool temperatures

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.140 
temperatures or really cool temperatures
because<00:04:38.980> then<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.220> adhesive<00:04:39.700> doesn't<00:04:40.000> dry

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
because then the adhesive doesn't dry

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.150 
because then the adhesive doesn't dry
properly<00:04:40.630> and<00:04:40.810> you've<00:04:41.590> got<00:04:41.710> to<00:04:41.800> make<00:04:41.919> sure<00:04:41.950> you
