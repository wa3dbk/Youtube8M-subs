00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
make a nice ground cover so I'm moving

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.100 
make a nice ground cover so I'm moving
my<00:00:29.650> rocks<00:00:29.950> out<00:00:30.220> of<00:00:30.250> the<00:00:30.369> way<00:00:30.430> I'm<00:00:31.390> taking<00:00:31.779> my

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
my rocks out of the way I'm taking my

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.350 
my rocks out of the way I'm taking my
hands<00:00:32.590> and<00:00:32.710> I'm<00:00:32.890> pulling<00:00:33.340> the<00:00:33.460> mulch<00:00:33.730> off<00:00:34.059> to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
hands and I'm pulling the mulch off to

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.360 
hands and I'm pulling the mulch off to
one<00:00:34.540> side<00:00:34.870> because<00:00:35.170> I<00:00:35.410> want<00:00:35.440> to<00:00:35.650> reuse<00:00:36.129> this

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
one side because I want to reuse this

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.570

mulch<00:00:36.700> and<00:00:36.910> I<00:00:36.940> don't<00:00:37.000> want<00:00:37.390> to<00:00:37.420> have<00:00:37.600> it<00:00:37.720> dirty

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.580 
mulch and I don't want to have it dirty

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.189 
mulch and I don't want to have it dirty
so<00:00:39.580> I'm<00:00:39.699> pushing<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:40.210> mulch<00:00:40.420> off<00:00:40.690> to<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:40.989> side

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
so I'm pushing the mulch off to the side

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.680 
so I'm pushing the mulch off to the side
I<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.940> a<00:00:42.970> small<00:00:43.360> little<00:00:44.190> digging<00:00:45.190> tool<00:00:45.690> so

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
I have a small little digging tool so

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.299 
I have a small little digging tool so
I'm<00:00:46.750> just<00:00:46.870> going<00:00:47.019> to<00:00:47.080> make<00:00:47.199> a<00:00:47.260> hole<00:00:47.559> about<00:00:48.040> the

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
I'm just going to make a hole about the

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.990 
I'm just going to make a hole about the
same<00:00:48.580> size<00:00:49.000> as<00:00:49.449> my<00:00:49.720> pot<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:52.660> I'm<00:00:53.199> digging<00:00:53.530> I

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
same size as my pot as I'm digging I

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.759 
same size as my pot as I'm digging I
carefully<00:00:55.000> move<00:00:55.449> this<00:00:55.720> dirt<00:00:56.350> out<00:00:56.559> of<00:00:56.589> the<00:00:56.739> way

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
carefully move this dirt out of the way

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.160 
carefully move this dirt out of the way
but<00:00:57.339> I'm<00:00:57.430> trying<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:57.909> make<00:00:58.030> sure<00:00:58.059> I<00:00:58.479> don't<00:00:58.540> put

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
but I'm trying to make sure I don't put

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.469 
but I'm trying to make sure I don't put
the<00:00:59.320> dirt<00:00:59.530> on<00:01:00.190> top<00:01:00.519> of<00:01:00.729> the<00:01:00.850> where<00:01:00.970> I<00:01:01.000> move<00:01:01.239> my

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
the dirt on top of the where I move my

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.039 
the dirt on top of the where I move my
mulch<00:01:02.879> probably<00:01:03.879> should<00:01:04.030> have<00:01:04.059> gloves<00:01:04.479> on<00:01:04.750> but

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
mulch probably should have gloves on but

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.130 
mulch probably should have gloves on but
I'm<00:01:05.170> doing<00:01:05.500> this<00:01:05.590> sort<00:01:05.920> of<00:01:06.010> quickly<00:01:06.780> my<00:01:07.780> soil

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
I'm doing this sort of quickly my soil

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.530 
I'm doing this sort of quickly my soil
as<00:01:08.409> you<00:01:08.530> can<00:01:08.680> see<00:01:08.890> is<00:01:09.070> not<00:01:09.430> very<00:01:09.880> good<00:01:10.210> but<00:01:10.479> a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
as you can see is not very good but a

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.620 
as you can see is not very good but a
jus<00:01:10.840> that<00:01:11.049> doesn't<00:01:11.560> care<00:01:14.520> my<00:01:15.520> hole<00:01:15.790> has<00:01:16.090> pre

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
jus that doesn't care my hole has pre

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.590 
jus that doesn't care my hole has pre
rocky<00:01:17.590> soils<00:01:18.369> but<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.760> jus<00:01:18.939> that<00:01:19.119> doesn't

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
rocky soils but the jus that doesn't

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.450 
rocky soils but the jus that doesn't
really<00:01:19.780> care<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.320> only<00:01:20.470> thing<00:01:20.799> that<00:01:21.010> the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
really care the only thing that the

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.820 
really care the only thing that the
ajuga<00:01:21.850> is<00:01:22.240> looking<00:01:22.600> for<00:01:22.810> is<00:01:23.020> some<00:01:23.260> afternoon

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.300 
ajuga is looking for is some afternoon
shade<00:01:24.130> so<00:01:24.969> I<00:01:25.000> can<00:01:25.329> really<00:01:25.539> put<00:01:25.840> this<00:01:25.990> in<00:01:26.310> this

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
shade so I can really put this in this

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.300 
shade so I can really put this in this
hole<00:01:27.520> with<00:01:27.820> this<00:01:28.450> many<00:01:28.719> rocks<00:01:29.020> in<00:01:29.469> it<00:01:29.859> and<00:01:29.920> it

sometimes we will sew it if you're doing
mass<00:01:38.710> plantings<00:01:39.579> you'll<00:01:40.420> often<00:01:40.689> get<00:01:41.259> it<00:01:41.439> in<00:01:41.679> a

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
mass plantings you'll often get it in a

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.260 
mass plantings you'll often get it in a
flat<00:01:42.880> with<00:01:43.770> smaller<00:01:44.770> peat<00:01:45.159> pots<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:46.119> don't

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
flat with smaller peat pots you don't

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.730 
flat with smaller peat pots you don't
have<00:01:46.359> to<00:01:46.479> dig<00:01:46.659> nearly<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.140> size<00:01:47.320> of<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.590> hole

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
have to dig nearly the size of the hole

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.399 
have to dig nearly the size of the hole
when<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.009> goes<00:01:48.159> much<00:01:48.369> faster<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:50.020> this<00:01:50.170> makes

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
when it goes much faster but this makes

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.919 
when it goes much faster but this makes
one<00:01:50.679> nice<00:01:50.920> little<00:01:51.159> piece<00:01:51.429> I<00:01:51.759> push<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.780> dirt

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
one nice little piece I push the dirt

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:54.749 
one nice little piece I push the dirt
back<00:01:53.200> around<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:53.799> notice<00:01:54.189> how<00:01:54.369> I<00:01:54.429> keep<00:01:54.700> the

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
back around it notice how I keep the

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.389 
back around it notice how I keep the
crown<00:01:55.149> just<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.749> tiny<00:01:56.200> bit<00:01:56.590> above<00:01:56.920> ground<00:01:57.219> level

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
crown just a tiny bit above ground level

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.510 
crown just a tiny bit above ground level
all<00:01:58.319> perennials<00:01:59.319> and<00:01:59.649> shrubs<00:02:00.009> should<00:02:00.310> have

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
all perennials and shrubs should have

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.749 
all perennials and shrubs should have
that<00:02:00.789> dirt<00:02:01.299> level<00:02:01.719> just<00:02:01.869> a<00:02:02.020> tiny<00:02:02.350> bit<00:02:02.740> high<00:02:03.009> too

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
that dirt level just a tiny bit high too

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.359 
that dirt level just a tiny bit high too
high<00:02:03.789> won't<00:02:04.389> die<00:02:04.630> too<00:02:05.079> low<00:02:05.289> won't<00:02:05.710> grow

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
high won't die too low won't grow

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.809 
high won't die too low won't grow
now<00:02:07.210> I<00:02:07.240> take<00:02:07.539> that<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.770> mulch<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.580> I<00:02:09.670> had

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
now I take that the mulch that I had

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.870 
now I take that the mulch that I had
pushed<00:02:10.060> back<00:02:10.330> earlier<00:02:10.950> feather<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.250> up<00:02:12.490> around

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
pushed back earlier feather it up around

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.870 
pushed back earlier feather it up around
