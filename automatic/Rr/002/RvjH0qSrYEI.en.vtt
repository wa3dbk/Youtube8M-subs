00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
was getting my ass literally kicked on

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.160 
was getting my ass literally kicked on
that<00:05:00.370> mountain

for<00:05:03.510> men<00:05:03.660> and<00:05:03.840> women<00:05:03.990> telling<00:05:04.770> me<00:05:05.010> how<00:05:05.430> much

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
for men and women telling me how much

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.130

was kind of mind-blowing and

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.030 
was kind of mind-blowing and
embarrassing<00:05:12.150> to<00:05:12.300> me<00:05:12.330> because<00:05:12.450> I<00:05:13.170> sort<00:05:13.800> of<00:05:13.890> see

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040
