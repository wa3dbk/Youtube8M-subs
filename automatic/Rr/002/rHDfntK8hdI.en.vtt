00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
it is in this location because of the

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.720 
it is in this location because of the
fetal<00:00:03.570> scream<00:00:03.899> comes<00:00:04.319> out<00:00:05.009> of<00:00:05.250> data<00:00:05.460> into

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
fetal scream comes out of data into

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.330 
fetal scream comes out of data into
would<00:00:05.940> be<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.390> one<00:00:06.540> side<00:00:06.779> them<00:00:06.899> in<00:00:07.020> there

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
would be the one side them in there

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.799 
would be the one side them in there
through<00:00:08.340> down<00:00:08.610> here<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.059> feel<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.389> fan<00:00:09.599> here

through down here to feel the fan here

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.980 
through down here to feel the fan here

would<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.139> join<00:00:13.320> runs<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.860> winter<00:00:14.480> the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
would you join runs in the winter the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.810 
would you join runs in the winter the
oxy<00:00:15.839> makes<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.139> sore<00:00:16.320> at<00:00:16.350> weather<00:00:16.619> site<00:00:16.920> an

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
oxy makes you sore at weather site an

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.599 
oxy makes you sore at weather site an
obvious<00:00:18.240> place<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.480> have<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> pond<00:00:19.340> so<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.369> dug

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
obvious place to have a pond so I dug

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.950 
obvious place to have a pond so I dug
this<00:00:20.730> about<00:00:21.060> 10<00:00:21.330> years<00:00:21.449> ago<00:00:21.750> or<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:23.779> it's<00:00:24.779> quite

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
this about 10 years ago or so it's quite

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.109 
this about 10 years ago or so it's quite
this<00:00:25.230> relatively<00:00:26.130> deep<00:00:26.340> about<00:00:26.640> 2<00:00:26.820> meters<00:00:27.090> deep

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
this relatively deep about 2 meters deep

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.790 
this relatively deep about 2 meters deep
in<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.480> middle<00:00:27.630> comes<00:00:28.170> up<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:28.470> shelving

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
in the middle comes up in shelving

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.470 
in the middle comes up in shelving
layers<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.220> there's<00:00:29.369> different<00:00:29.490> niches<00:00:30.240> you

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
layers so there's different niches you

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.930 
layers so there's different niches you
know<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:30.929> different<00:00:31.019> plants<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:31.940> and

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
know for different plants and so on and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.549 
know for different plants and so on and
there<00:00:33.329> certainly<00:00:33.510> are<00:00:33.750> some<00:00:33.780> edible<00:00:34.350> things

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
there certainly are some edible things

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.590 
there certainly are some edible things
in<00:00:34.770> there<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:35.430> as<00:00:35.670> much<00:00:36.420> as

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
in there and so on but as much as

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.200 
in there and so on but as much as
anything<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.079> pond<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.590> again<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.520> has<00:00:38.790> system

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
anything the pond is again it has system

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.630 
anything the pond is again it has system
functions<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.899> benefit<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> whole<00:00:40.559> system<00:00:40.980> so

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
functions to benefit the whole system so

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.520 
functions to benefit the whole system so
it<00:00:41.760> obviously<00:00:41.910> helps<00:00:42.390> support<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:43.020> big

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
it obviously helps support a big

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.380 
it obviously helps support a big
population<00:00:43.950> with<00:00:44.250> frogs<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.820> toads<00:00:45.059> and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
population with frogs and toads and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.670 
population with frogs and toads and
mutes<00:00:45.719> who<00:00:46.379> all<00:00:46.620> eat<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.399> lot<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.940> slugs<00:00:48.680> and

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
mutes who all eat a lot of slugs and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.310 
mutes who all eat a lot of slugs and
they<00:00:49.950> those<00:00:50.550> kind<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.879> amphibious<00:00:51.780> animals

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
they those kind of amphibious animals

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.080 
they those kind of amphibious animals
like<00:00:53.930> conditions<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.559> know<00:00:55.649> under<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.219> thick

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
like conditions you know under the thick

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.290 
like conditions you know under the thick
growth<00:00:57.480> over<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.230> whole<00:00:58.440> soil<00:00:59.219> surface<00:00:59.760> and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
growth over the whole soil surface and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.520 
growth over the whole soil surface and
so<00:01:00.449> they're<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:00.899> along<00:01:01.109> with<00:01:01.170> ground

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
so they're in there along with ground

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.689 
so they're in there along with ground
beetles<00:01:01.980> that's<00:01:02.129> also<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.520> those

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
beetles that's also like those

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.759 
beetles that's also like those
conditions<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.539> control<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.320> slugs<00:01:04.589> and

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
conditions and control the slugs and

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.679 
conditions and control the slugs and
snails<00:01:04.830> pretty<00:01:05.460> well<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.880> don't<00:01:06.119> really<00:01:06.450> have

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
snails pretty well and don't really have

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.240 
snails pretty well and don't really have
many<00:01:06.930> problems<00:01:07.170> with<00:01:08.040> slugs<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.460> snails<00:01:10.250> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
many problems with slugs and snails the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.240 
many problems with slugs and snails the
pond<00:01:11.490> also<00:01:11.970> helps<00:01:12.270> support<00:01:12.420> bats<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:14.100> there's

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
pond also helps support bats so there's

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.340 
pond also helps support bats so there's
a<00:01:14.310> very<00:01:14.520> good<00:01:14.549> bat<00:01:14.939> population<00:01:15.570> here<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.990> have

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
a very good bat population here I have

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.230 
a very good bat population here I have
bat<00:01:16.560> boxes<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.100> these<00:01:17.250> two<00:01:17.460> pine<00:01:17.700> trees<00:01:17.970> but

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
bat boxes in these two pine trees but

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.850 
bat boxes in these two pine trees but
there's<00:01:18.420> also<00:01:18.540> bat<00:01:18.840> boxes<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.320> North<00:01:19.560> Woods

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
there's also bat boxes in North Woods

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.510 
there's also bat boxes in North Woods
and<00:01:20.040> various<00:01:20.299> locations<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> there's<00:01:23.460> a

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
and various locations and so there's a

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.780 
and various locations and so there's a
lot<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.670> pipi<00:01:23.909> strolls<00:01:24.240> around<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.900> they<00:01:25.500> are

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
lot of pipi strolls around and they are

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.490 
lot of pipi strolls around and they are
all<00:01:26.790> back<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.270> very<00:01:27.570> good<00:01:27.840> predators<00:01:28.290> of

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
all back to very good predators of

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.830 
all back to very good predators of
things<00:01:29.400> like<00:01:29.549> fruit<00:01:29.729> tree<00:01:29.939> moths<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.689> they're

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
things like fruit tree moths so they're

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.890 
things like fruit tree moths so they're
not<00:01:30.930> coddling<00:01:31.350> moth<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.619> apple<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:31.979> plum<00:01:32.220> off

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
not coddling moth of apple and plum off

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.870 
not coddling moth of apple and plum off
so<00:01:33.900> if<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> good<00:01:34.530> bat<00:01:34.710> population<00:01:35.340> you

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
so if you have a good bat population you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.149 
so if you have a good bat population you
won't<00:01:36.509> get<00:01:36.720> problems<00:01:37.110> from<00:01:37.619> things<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:37.920> that

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
won't get problems from things like that

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.100 
won't get problems from things like that
so<00:01:38.369> now<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.759> apple<00:01:39.030> trees<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.390> don't<00:01:39.630> ever

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
so now I have apple trees I don't ever

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.830 
so now I have apple trees I don't ever
get<00:01:40.380> called<00:01:40.650> them<00:01:40.799> off<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.490> them<00:01:41.820> which<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.630> put

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
get called them off on them which I put

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.319 
get called them off on them which I put
down<00:01:43.079> at<00:01:43.890> least<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.280> part<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.820> know<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.000> that

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
down at least in part you know to that

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.270 
down at least in part you know to that
so<00:01:45.570> maybe<00:01:45.720> other<00:01:45.960> predators<00:01:46.619> involved<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.189> I

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
so maybe other predators involved but I

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.160 
so maybe other predators involved but I
think<00:01:47.490> that's<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.060> certainly<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.479> big<00:01:48.930> part

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
think that's have a certainly a big part

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.179 
think that's have a certainly a big part
in<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:50.930> so<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:51.960> don't<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.500> don't<00:01:52.560> harvest

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
in that so so I don't I don't harvest

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.950 
in that so so I don't I don't harvest
from<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.399> pond<00:01:53.670> intensively

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
from the pond intensively

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.539 
from the pond intensively
laughs<00:01:55.960> itself<00:01:56.350> it's<00:01:56.530> a<00:01:56.590> fairly<00:01:56.799> wild<00:01:57.219> area

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
laughs itself it's a fairly wild area

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.999 
laughs itself it's a fairly wild area
really<00:01:59.399> the<00:02:00.399> pine<00:02:00.759> trees<00:02:01.030> themselves<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.799> far

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
really the pine trees themselves so far

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.560 
really the pine trees themselves so far
when<00:02:03.159> I've<00:02:03.280> been<00:02:03.429> describing<00:02:03.700> you<00:02:04.149> know<00:02:04.179> the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
when I've been describing you know the

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.600 
when I've been describing you know the
function<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.200> different<00:02:05.530> plants<00:02:05.890> you<00:02:06.520> know

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
function of different plants you know

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.830 
function of different plants you know
it's<00:02:06.759> been<00:02:06.909> this<00:02:07.030> is<00:02:07.210> edible<00:02:07.420> all<00:02:07.600> that<00:02:07.719> is

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
it's been this is edible all that is

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.630 
it's been this is edible all that is
little<00:02:08.080> or<00:02:08.319> has<00:02:08.649> a<00:02:08.679> particular<00:02:08.979> use<00:02:10.230> but

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
little or has a particular use but

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.800 
little or has a particular use but
actually<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.730> main<00:02:12.910> function<00:02:13.360> of<00:02:13.450> these<00:02:13.540> pine

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
actually the main function of these pine

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.869 
actually the main function of these pine
trees<00:02:13.840> really<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.769> to<00:02:15.099> provide<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:16.840> shady<00:02:17.470> area

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
trees really is to provide a shady area

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.400 
trees really is to provide a shady area
for<00:02:18.879> sitting<00:02:19.420> underneath<00:02:19.629> in<00:02:19.870> summer<00:02:20.110> because

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
for sitting underneath in summer because

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.530 
for sitting underneath in summer because
you<00:02:20.890> know<00:02:20.980> forest<00:02:21.280> gardens<00:02:21.640> are<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.420> know

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
you know forest gardens are you know

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.289 
you know forest gardens are you know
places<00:02:23.049> where<00:02:23.200> people<00:02:23.620> want<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:23.980> be<00:02:24.069> you<00:02:24.610> know

it's just a nice place to be so that
really<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.720> main<00:02:35.019> function<00:02:35.440> of<00:02:35.500> them

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
really is the main function of them

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.470 
really is the main function of them
having<00:02:36.130> said<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.579> course<00:02:36.610> pine<00:02:37.239> trees

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
having said that of course pine trees

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.190 
having said that of course pine trees
have<00:02:38.099> numerous<00:02:39.099> other<00:02:39.280> uses<00:02:39.700> apart<00:02:40.630> from<00:02:40.750> you

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
have numerous other uses apart from you

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.100 
have numerous other uses apart from you
know<00:02:41.230> valuable<00:02:41.709> timber<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.099> so<00:02:42.310> on<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:43.959> mean

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
know valuable timber and so on so I mean

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.170 
know valuable timber and so on so I mean
one<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.290> them<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.549> new<00:02:45.700> shoots<00:02:46.000> you

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
one of them is that the new shoots you

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.880 
one of them is that the new shoots you
can<00:02:46.390> see<00:02:46.599> on<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.870> pine<00:02:47.110> trees<00:02:47.760> here<00:02:49.500> are<00:02:50.500> very

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
can see on the pine trees here are very

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.920 
can see on the pine trees here are very
high<00:02:51.040> in<00:02:51.069> vitamin<00:02:51.489> C<00:02:51.519> and<00:02:51.730> in<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.150> lot<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.599> parts

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
high in vitamin C and in a lot of parts

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.610 
high in vitamin C and in a lot of parts
of<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.200> world<00:02:53.250> those<00:02:54.250> are<00:02:54.579> used<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.420> make<00:02:55.620> herb

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
of the world those are used to make herb

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.240 
of the world those are used to make herb
tea<00:02:56.920> is<00:02:57.549> very<00:02:57.790> nice<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:59.530> treated<00:02:59.889> a<00:02:59.950> bit<00:03:00.100> like

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
tea is very nice the treated a bit like

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.550 
tea is very nice the treated a bit like
a<00:03:00.280> like<00:03:00.819> a<00:03:00.850> spring<00:03:01.180> tonic<00:03:01.389> in<00:03:01.930> many<00:03:02.170> parts<00:03:02.470> of

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
a like a spring tonic in many parts of

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.580 
a like a spring tonic in many parts of
the<00:03:02.650> world<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.920> also<00:03:07.139> I've<00:03:08.139> been<00:03:08.200> tapping

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
the world and also I've been tapping

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.789 
the world and also I've been tapping
these<00:03:09.489> pine<00:03:10.389> trees<00:03:10.420> for<00:03:10.900> some<00:03:11.109> years<00:03:11.380> now<00:03:11.590> for

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
these pine trees for some years now for

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.979 
these pine trees for some years now for
pine<00:03:12.010> resin<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.790> one<00:03:12.940> on<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.120> right<00:03:13.359> there

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
pine resin the one on the right there

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.140 
pine resin the one on the right there
I've<00:03:14.350> tapped<00:03:14.650> for<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.100> last<00:03:15.310> five<00:03:15.639> years<00:03:15.670> and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
I've tapped for the last five years and

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.699 
I've tapped for the last five years and
I've<00:03:16.239> just<00:03:16.480> started<00:03:16.750> tapping<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.410> one<00:03:17.530> on<00:03:17.650> the

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
I've just started tapping the one on the

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.710 
I've just started tapping the one on the
left<00:03:17.920> this<00:03:18.100> year<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.880> what<00:03:19.060> you<00:03:19.150> can<00:03:19.299> see<00:03:19.510> down

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
left this year to what you can see down

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.720 
left this year to what you can see down
there<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:21.280> pine<00:03:21.700> resin<00:03:21.910> is<00:03:22.920> I'm<00:03:23.920> do<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.310> do<00:03:24.370> that

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
there and pine resin is I'm do I do that

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.280 
there and pine resin is I'm do I do that
not<00:03:24.880> because<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.299> can't<00:03:25.690> live<00:03:25.780> without<00:03:25.900> pine

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
not because I can't live without pine

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.479 
not because I can't live without pine
resin<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:26.650> could<00:03:26.799> live<00:03:26.950> without<00:03:27.099> pine<00:03:27.310> resin

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
resin I could live without pine resin

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.300 
resin I could live without pine resin
but<00:03:28.079> it's<00:03:29.079> really<00:03:29.500> interesting<00:03:29.829> to<00:03:30.040> show

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
but it's really interesting to show

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.809 
but it's really interesting to show
people<00:03:30.489> that<00:03:30.730> it's<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.780> simple<00:03:32.170> process<00:03:32.380> and

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
people that it's a simple process and

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.599 
people that it's a simple process and
that<00:03:33.819> pine<00:03:34.450> resin<00:03:34.630> is<00:03:34.959> a<00:03:35.709> sustainable<00:03:36.310> source

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
that pine resin is a sustainable source

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.479 
that pine resin is a sustainable source
of<00:03:36.790> complex<00:03:37.120> hydrocarbons<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:39.160> you<00:03:39.250> can<00:03:39.370> make

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
of complex hydrocarbons and you can make

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.830 
of complex hydrocarbons and you can make
anything<00:03:39.700> out<00:03:39.910> of<00:03:40.030> pine<00:03:40.180> resin<00:03:40.359> that<00:03:40.569> you<00:03:40.660> want

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
anything out of pine resin that you want

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.170 
anything out of pine resin that you want
to<00:03:40.930> add<00:03:41.019> a<00:03:41.049> boil<00:03:41.849> might<00:03:42.849> have<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.060> go<00:03:43.150> a

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
to add a boil might have to go a

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.309 
to add a boil might have to go a
slightly<00:03:43.419> different<00:03:43.510> chemical<00:03:44.019> route<00:03:44.109> but

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
slightly different chemical route but

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.770 
slightly different chemical route but
you<00:03:44.349> can<00:03:44.530> do<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:44.819> and<00:03:45.819> because<00:03:46.389> of<00:03:46.419> the<00:03:46.569> price

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
you can do it and because of the price

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.780 
you can do it and because of the price
of<00:03:46.810> oil<00:03:47.049> you<00:03:47.470> know<00:03:47.590> over<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:47.829> past<00:03:47.859> few<00:03:48.730> years

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
of oil you know over the past few years

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.520 
of oil you know over the past few years
going<00:03:49.419> up<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:49.690> up<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:49.930> presumably<00:03:50.319> it<00:03:50.440> will

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
going up and up and presumably it will

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.150 
going up and up and presumably it will
gradually<00:03:51.190> continue<00:03:51.700> doing<00:03:51.940> so<00:03:52.980> there<00:03:53.980> are

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
gradually continue doing so there are

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.490 
gradually continue doing so there are
already<00:03:54.340> things<00:03:54.760> now<00:03:55.090> that<00:03:55.959> it's<00:03:56.109> not

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
already things now that it's not

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.289 
already things now that it's not
economical<00:03:57.099> to<00:03:57.160> make<00:03:57.370> out<00:03:57.549> of<00:03:57.700> oil<00:03:57.849> that<00:03:58.030> are

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
economical to make out of oil that are

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.170 
economical to make out of oil that are
made<00:03:58.540> from<00:03:58.720> pine<00:03:58.930> resin<00:03:59.200> instead<00:04:00.180> so

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
made from pine resin instead so

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.810 
made from pine resin instead so
commercially<00:04:01.840> by<00:04:02.590> tapping<00:04:03.190> pine<00:04:03.459> trees<00:04:03.669> is

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
commercially by tapping pine trees is

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.290 
commercially by tapping pine trees is
big<00:04:04.030> worldwide<00:04:04.299> business

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
big worldwide business

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.910 
big worldwide business
mostly<00:04:05.810> where<00:04:06.020> labor<00:04:06.260> is<00:04:06.380> cheap<00:04:06.620> as<00:04:06.770> you'd

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
mostly where labor is cheap as you'd

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.120 
mostly where labor is cheap as you'd
imagine<00:04:07.810> so<00:04:08.810> until<00:04:09.050> quite<00:04:09.080> recently<00:04:09.290> it<00:04:10.010> was

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
imagine so until quite recently it was

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.430 
imagine so until quite recently it was
still<00:04:10.370> in<00:04:10.460> Eastern<00:04:10.730> Europe<00:04:11.000> but<00:04:11.990> now<00:04:12.230> at<00:04:12.380> the

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
still in Eastern Europe but now at the

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.370 
still in Eastern Europe but now at the
moment<00:04:12.800> it's<00:04:12.920> mainly<00:04:13.160> in<00:04:13.280> China<00:04:14.170> but<00:04:15.170> you<00:04:15.260> can

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
moment it's mainly in China but you can

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.900 
moment it's mainly in China but you can
tap<00:04:15.530> any<00:04:15.710> pine<00:04:15.950> trees<00:04:16.250> you<00:04:16.400> don't<00:04:16.550> have<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:16.790> be

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
tap any pine trees you don't have to be

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.030 
tap any pine trees you don't have to be
in<00:04:17.239> a<00:04:17.330> particular<00:04:17.570> part<00:04:18.320> of<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.560> world<00:04:18.739> to<00:04:18.890> do

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
in a particular part of the world to do

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.110 
in a particular part of the world to do
it

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
it

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.800 
it
and<00:04:21.700> basically<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:23.150> tapping<00:04:23.450> procedure

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
and basically the tapping procedure

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.620 
and basically the tapping procedure
involves<00:04:24.500> removing<00:04:24.950> a<00:04:24.980> section<00:04:25.520> of<00:04:25.790> bark<00:04:26.090> the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
involves removing a section of bark the

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.750 
involves removing a section of bark the
outer<00:04:26.780> bark<00:04:27.170> and<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:28.010> inner<00:04:28.160> bark<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.610> inner

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
outer bark and the inner bark the inner

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.720 
outer bark and the inner bark the inner
bark<00:04:29.000> is<00:04:29.590> on<00:04:30.590> these<00:04:30.860> trees<00:04:31.220> is<00:04:31.400> quite<00:04:31.670> thin

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
bark is on these trees is quite thin

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.060 
bark is on these trees is quite thin
that's<00:04:34.730> inner<00:04:35.030> bark<00:04:35.240> it's<00:04:35.990> about<00:04:36.380> four<00:04:36.920> or

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
that's inner bark it's about four or

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.040 
that's inner bark it's about four or
five<00:04:37.280> millimeters<00:04:37.790> thick<00:04:39.190> soft<00:04:41.050> material

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
five millimeters thick soft material

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.170 
five millimeters thick soft material
which<00:04:42.590> is<00:04:42.710> underneath<00:04:42.980> thin<00:04:43.250> outer<00:04:43.400> bark<00:04:43.700> to

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
which is underneath thin outer bark to

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.790 
which is underneath thin outer bark to
get<00:04:44.360> to<00:04:44.450> the<00:04:44.570> wood<00:04:44.780> underneath<00:04:45.140> them<00:04:45.440> that<00:04:45.470> the

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
get to the wood underneath them that the

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.130 
get to the wood underneath them that the
resin<00:04:46.160> seeps<00:04:46.490> out<00:04:46.730> of<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.000> wood<00:04:47.180> basically

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
resin seeps out of the wood basically

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.770 
resin seeps out of the wood basically
and<00:04:48.440> you<00:04:48.620> start<00:04:48.950> off<00:04:49.130> with<00:04:49.160> a<00:04:49.340> small<00:04:49.730> face<00:04:50.480> like

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
and you start off with a small face like

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.070 
and you start off with a small face like
that<00:04:50.990> and<00:04:51.050> work<00:04:51.440> upwards<00:04:51.680> week<00:04:52.100> by<00:04:52.280> week

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
that and work upwards week by week

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.420 
that and work upwards week by week
making<00:04:54.080> it<00:04:54.290> slightly<00:04:54.440> bigger<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:54.980> bigger<00:04:55.130> and

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
making it slightly bigger and bigger and

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.810 
making it slightly bigger and bigger and
going<00:04:55.730> on<00:04:55.850> all<00:04:56.000> summer<00:04:56.270> so<00:04:57.100> the<00:04:58.100> resin<00:04:58.580> seeps

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
going on all summer so the resin seeps

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.370 
going on all summer so the resin seeps
outwards<00:04:59.210> you<00:04:59.330> collect<00:04:59.660> it<00:04:59.840> and<00:05:00.050> then

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
outwards you collect it and then

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.990 
outwards you collect it and then
commercially<00:05:00.950> that's<00:05:01.130> distilled<00:05:01.610> and<00:05:01.820> if<00:05:01.910> you

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
commercially that's distilled and if you

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000 
commercially that's distilled and if you
distilled<00:05:02.360> Thai<00:05:02.540> resin<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:03.650> get<00:05:03.770> a<00:05:03.800> liquid

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
distilled Thai resin you get a liquid

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.220 
distilled Thai resin you get a liquid
which<00:05:04.250> it's<00:05:04.370> turpentine<00:05:04.730> and<00:05:05.150> you<00:05:05.750> get<00:05:05.960> a

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
which it's turpentine and you get a

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.350 
which it's turpentine and you get a
solid<00:05:06.710> left<00:05:06.860> which<00:05:07.040> is<00:05:07.160> rosin<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:07.730> then<00:05:08.120> both

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
solid left which is rosin and then both

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.510 
solid left which is rosin and then both
of<00:05:08.390> those<00:05:08.690> have<00:05:09.380> a<00:05:09.410> lot<00:05:09.560> of<00:05:09.590> direct<00:05:09.890> users<00:05:10.370> but

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
of those have a lot of direct users but

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.740 
of those have a lot of direct users but
they're<00:05:10.640> also<00:05:10.760> used<00:05:11.060> to<00:05:11.180> make<00:05:11.330> a<00:05:11.360> load<00:05:11.630> of

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
they're also used to make a load of

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.500 
they're also used to make a load of
other<00:05:11.870> things<00:05:12.170> and<00:05:12.500> increasingly<00:05:13.330> I'm<00:05:14.330> not

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
other things and increasingly I'm not

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.050 
other things and increasingly I'm not
suggesting<00:05:14.930> there's<00:05:15.080> enough<00:05:15.610> no<00:05:16.610> pine<00:05:16.850> trees

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
suggesting there's enough no pine trees

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.930 
suggesting there's enough no pine trees
to<00:05:17.210> fill<00:05:17.390> the<00:05:17.510> world's<00:05:17.750> cars<00:05:17.960> for<00:05:18.200> surrond

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
to fill the world's cars for surrond

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.340 
to fill the world's cars for surrond
but<00:05:19.940> you<00:05:20.030> can<00:05:20.270> you<00:05:20.540> know<00:05:20.660> you<00:05:20.720> can<00:05:21.080> use

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
but you can you know you can use

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.750 
but you can you know you can use
turpentine<00:05:21.590> as<00:05:22.010> a<00:05:22.040> fuel<00:05:22.310> you<00:05:22.430> can<00:05:22.580> mix

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
turpentine as a fuel you can mix

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.540 
turpentine as a fuel you can mix
turpentine<00:05:23.150> with<00:05:23.840> vegetable<00:05:24.290> oils<00:05:24.560> and<00:05:24.830> you

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
turpentine with vegetable oils and you

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.070 
turpentine with vegetable oils and you
get<00:05:25.670> a<00:05:25.700> fuel<00:05:26.000> we<00:05:26.120> can<00:05:26.240> use<00:05:26.390> and<00:05:26.540> diesel<00:05:26.780> engines

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
get a fuel we can use and diesel engines

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.690 
get a fuel we can use and diesel engines
so<00:05:27.380> I<00:05:27.410> mean<00:05:27.530> you<00:05:27.590> could<00:05:27.950> use<00:05:27.980> it<00:05:28.250> you'll<00:05:28.520> I<00:05:28.580> know

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
so I mean you could use it you'll I know

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.240 
so I mean you could use it you'll I know
people<00:05:29.030> who<00:05:29.270> do<00:05:29.450> you<00:05:30.260> know<00:05:30.380> on<00:05:30.470> the<00:05:30.560> farm<00:05:30.800> basis

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
people who do you know on the farm basis

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.980 
people who do you know on the farm basis
but<00:05:31.700> there's<00:05:31.910> you<00:05:32.240> couldn't<00:05:32.510> on<00:05:32.630> a<00:05:32.660> worldwide

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
but there's you couldn't on a worldwide

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.480 
but there's you couldn't on a worldwide
basis<00:05:33.530> you<00:05:33.620> know<00:05:33.740> it's<00:05:33.860> there's<00:05:34.160> not<00:05:34.340> enough

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
basis you know it's there's not enough

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.060 
basis you know it's there's not enough
pine<00:05:34.730> trees<00:05:34.940> to<00:05:35.090> do<00:05:35.210> that<00:05:35.770> so<00:05:36.770> you<00:05:36.860> know<00:05:36.950> it's

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
pine trees to do that so you know it's

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.060 
pine trees to do that so you know it's
it's<00:05:37.700> interesting<00:05:37.880> from<00:05:38.240> that<00:05:38.420> aspect<00:05:39.070> the

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
it's interesting from that aspect the

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.740 
it's interesting from that aspect the
resin<00:05:40.370> I<00:05:40.520> don't<00:05:40.850> bother<00:05:41.060> to<00:05:41.360> distill<00:05:41.720> the

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
resin I don't bother to distill the

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.480 
resin I don't bother to distill the
resin<00:05:42.080> but<00:05:42.290> in<00:05:42.380> fact<00:05:42.560> I<00:05:42.740> use<00:05:42.980> it<00:05:43.160> when<00:05:43.310> I<00:05:43.340> am

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
resin but in fact I use it when I am

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.450 
resin but in fact I use it when I am
inoculating<00:05:44.560> Logs<00:05:45.560> with<00:05:45.710> mushrooms<00:05:46.190> to<00:05:46.340> grow

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
inoculating Logs with mushrooms to grow

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.100 
inoculating Logs with mushrooms to grow
on<00:05:46.550> logs<00:05:47.500> so<00:05:48.760> I'll<00:05:49.760> explain<00:05:50.090> that<00:05:50.210> process<00:05:50.390> in

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
on logs so I'll explain that process in

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.960 
on logs so I'll explain that process in
a<00:05:51.200> minute<00:05:51.410> because<00:05:51.710> I'll<00:05:51.860> show<00:05:51.890> you<00:05:52.130> the<00:05:52.730> top

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
a minute because I'll show you the top

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.850 
a minute because I'll show you the top
half<00:05:53.210> of<00:05:53.360> this<00:05:53.600> tree<00:05:53.960> actually<00:05:54.290> snapped<00:05:54.650> off

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
half of this tree actually snapped off

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.860 
half of this tree actually snapped off
in<00:05:55.490> a<00:05:55.669> storm<00:05:55.880> you<00:05:56.120> can<00:05:56.240> see<00:05:56.390> the<00:05:56.540> top<00:05:56.720> the

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
in a storm you can see the top the

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.990 
in a storm you can see the top the
jagged<00:05:57.169> top<00:05:57.380> they're<00:05:57.620> almost<00:05:57.950> exactly<00:05:58.460> two

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
jagged top they're almost exactly two

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.600 
jagged top they're almost exactly two
years<00:05:59.240> ago<00:05:59.530> and<00:06:00.530> it's<00:06:00.710> just<00:06:00.770> lying<00:06:01.130> over<00:06:01.460> there

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
years ago and it's just lying over there

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.320 
years ago and it's just lying over there
the<00:06:01.820> other<00:06:01.850> side<00:06:02.150> of<00:06:02.270> this<00:06:02.360> of<00:06:02.630> these<00:06:03.040> branches

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
the other side of this of these branches

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.700 
the other side of this of these branches
are<00:06:05.330> not<00:06:05.570> related<00:06:05.930> that<00:06:06.050> with<00:06:06.230> muffins<00:06:06.590> so

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
are not related that with muffins so

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.550 
are not related that with muffins so
I'll<00:06:06.740> show<00:06:07.040> you<00:06:07.070> what<00:06:07.280> I've<00:06:07.340> done
