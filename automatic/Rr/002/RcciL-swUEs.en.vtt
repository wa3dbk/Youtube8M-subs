00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
about the first path and usually pretty

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:30.399 
about the first path and usually pretty
much<00:05:22.050> good<00:05:22.289> to<00:05:22.319> go<00:05:26.449> Rose<00:05:27.449> what<00:05:27.719> I<00:05:27.780> may<00:05:27.990> just<00:05:28.259> do
