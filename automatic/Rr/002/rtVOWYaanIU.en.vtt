there's<00:01:07.170> no<00:01:07.290> real<00:01:07.500> GM's<00:01:07.979> anymore<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.240> there

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
there's no real GM's anymore so is there

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.830 
there's no real GM's anymore so is there
really<00:01:09.540> anything<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.970> don't<00:01:11.970> really<00:01:12.689> think

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
really anything I don't really think

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.380 
really anything I don't really think
there<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.460> you<00:01:14.460> might<00:01:14.610> see<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> web<00:01:15.000> physics

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
there is you might see the web physics

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.960 
there is you might see the web physics
come<00:01:15.720> back<00:01:15.930> maybe<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:17.280> land<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> web

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
come back maybe and you land on the web

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.749 
come back maybe and you land on the web
softer<00:01:18.330> ladders<00:01:18.720> landing<00:01:19.590> awkwardly<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:20.580> saw

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
softer ladders landing awkwardly we saw

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.840 
softer ladders landing awkwardly we saw
glimpses<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.630> with<00:01:21.810> suicide<00:01:22.200> dives<00:01:22.850> you

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
glimpses of that with suicide dives you

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.640 
glimpses of that with suicide dives you
saw<00:01:24.000> my<00:01:24.150> Seth<00:01:24.360> Rollins<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.960> highlight<00:01:25.200> reel

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
saw my Seth Rollins a highlight reel

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.340 
saw my Seth Rollins a highlight reel
within<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.490> watching<00:01:27.270> suicide<00:01:27.840> valves<00:01:28.229> you

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
within just watching suicide valves you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.560 
within just watching suicide valves you
can<00:01:28.470> see<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.520> potential<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.119> there<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
can see the potential is there for the
