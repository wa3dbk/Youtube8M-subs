inches<00:01:06.539> but<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.170> does<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.649> gives<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.859> a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
inches but that does is it gives you a

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.700 
inches but that does is it gives you a
flatter<00:01:08.249> more<00:01:09.240> easily<00:01:09.810> workable<00:01:10.020> concave<00:01:10.619> in

concave<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.799> tail<00:01:14.039> but<00:01:14.520> that's<00:01:14.700> gonna<00:01:14.939> do

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
concave in the tail but that's gonna do

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.029 
concave in the tail but that's gonna do
is<00:01:15.450> give<00:01:15.659> your<00:01:15.810> foot<00:01:16.079> more<00:01:16.319> geographical

want to know is that this board has a 30

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.179 
want to know is that this board has a 30
inch<00:01:27.149> wheelbase<00:01:27.539> this<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.289> a<00:01:28.319> nice<00:01:28.590> compact

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
inch wheelbase this is a nice compact

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.830 
inch wheelbase this is a nice compact
wheelbase<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:29.700> going<00:01:30.149> fast<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.689> doing

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
wheelbase for going fast and doing

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.929 
wheelbase for going fast and doing
corners<00:01:31.319> you'll<00:01:31.799> really<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.219> this<00:01:32.399> board<00:01:32.670> as

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
corners you'll really like this board as

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.819 
corners you'll really like this board as
well<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.539> fast<00:01:33.689> because<00:01:33.990> 10<00:01:34.469> ply<00:01:34.770> is

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
well for going fast because 10 ply is

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.450 
well for going fast because 10 ply is
thick<00:01:35.249> so<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:35.850> extra<00:01:36.450> stable<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.170> very

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
thick so it's extra stable and very

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.249 
thick so it's extra stable and very
torsionally<00:01:38.460> rigid<00:01:38.789> making<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.359> lot<00:01:39.749> easier

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
torsionally rigid making it a lot easier

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.349 
torsionally rigid making it a lot easier

to feel comfortable on to elaborate more
fully<00:01:42.719> on<00:01:42.959> why<00:01:43.380> having<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.889> directional<00:01:44.549> board

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
fully on why having a directional board

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.730 
fully on why having a directional board
set<00:01:45.450> up<00:01:45.539> and<00:01:45.719> truck<00:01:45.929> set<00:01:46.109> up<00:01:46.200> for<00:01:46.350> going<00:01:46.560> fast

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
set up and truck set up for going fast

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.190 
set up and truck set up for going fast
is<00:01:47.039> gonna<00:01:47.189> be<00:01:47.369> more<00:01:47.609> stable<00:01:47.850> here<00:01:48.630> we<00:01:48.810> go

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
is gonna be more stable here we go

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.859 
is gonna be more stable here we go
with<00:01:49.649> 50<00:01:50.130> degrees<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.119> front<00:01:51.389> let's<00:01:51.659> say

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
with 50 degrees in the front let's say

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.169 
with 50 degrees in the front let's say
and<00:01:52.079> 35<00:01:52.740> degrees<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.219> the<00:01:53.280> tails<00:01:53.579> your<00:01:53.880> front

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
and 35 degrees in the tails your front

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:55.760 
and 35 degrees in the tails your front
truck<00:01:54.389> is<00:01:54.539> going<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.749> be<00:01:54.840> able<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.170> turn<00:01:55.499> more

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
truck is going to be able to turn more

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.300 
truck is going to be able to turn more
with<00:01:56.279> less<00:01:56.520> lean<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.119> it'll<00:01:57.329> be<00:01:57.420> more<00:01:57.630> active

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
with less lean so it'll be more active

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.610 
with less lean so it'll be more active
and<00:01:58.400> easier<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:59.000> turn<00:01:59.210> your<00:01:59.900> back<00:02:00.080> truck<00:02:00.440> at<00:02:00.560> a

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
and easier to turn your back truck at a

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.950 
and easier to turn your back truck at a
35<00:02:00.920> degree<00:02:01.250> angle<00:02:01.790> it's<00:02:02.090> going<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:02.390> be<00:02:02.510> less

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
35 degree angle it's going to be less

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.600 
35 degree angle it's going to be less
tourney<00:02:03.350> but<00:02:03.770> it's<00:02:03.860> going<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.010> be<00:02:04.160> much<00:02:04.340> easier

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
tourney but it's going to be much easier

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.580 
tourney but it's going to be much easier
to<00:02:04.940> gain<00:02:05.090> leverage<00:02:05.420> over<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:06.350> with<00:02:06.470> the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
to gain leverage over so with the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.050 
to gain leverage over so with the
combination<00:02:06.860> of<00:02:07.370> that<00:02:07.490> you'll<00:02:07.670> notice<00:02:07.970> that

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
combination of that you'll notice that

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.580 
combination of that you'll notice that
the<00:02:08.149> board<00:02:08.330> wants<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.690> turn<00:02:08.929> more<00:02:09.200> from<00:02:09.470> the

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
the board wants to turn more from the

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.410 
the board wants to turn more from the
front<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.490> back<00:02:10.700> isn't<00:02:11.000> going<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.360> be

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
front and the back isn't going to be

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.510 
front and the back isn't going to be
turning<00:02:11.690> out<00:02:11.990> as<00:02:12.140> much<00:02:12.320> for<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.220> amount<00:02:13.460> of

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
turning out as much for the amount of

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.190 
turning out as much for the amount of
turn<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.880> front<00:02:14.120> desk<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:14.810> get<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:14.990> much

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
turn the front desk so you get a much

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.190 
turn the front desk so you get a much
more<00:02:15.310> diving<00:02:16.310> sensation<00:02:17.180> as<00:02:17.300> opposed<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.110> a

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
more diving sensation as opposed to a

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.110 
more diving sensation as opposed to a
turn<00:02:18.530> where<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:19.100> front<00:02:19.400> loops<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:19.940> back

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
turn where the front loops and the back

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.540 
turn where the front loops and the back
goes<00:02:20.390> out<00:02:20.540> equally<00:02:21.080> it'll<00:02:21.560> really<00:02:21.860> grab<00:02:22.370> in

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
goes out equally it'll really grab in

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.480 
goes out equally it'll really grab in
the<00:02:22.580> nose<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.090> hole<00:02:23.990> and<00:02:24.410> have<00:02:24.709> a<00:02:24.740> nice<00:02:25.010> stable

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
the nose and hole and have a nice stable

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.830 
the nose and hole and have a nice stable
point<00:02:25.970> in<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.150> back<00:02:26.300> where<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.540> can<00:02:26.660> really

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
point in the back where you can really

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.810 
point in the back where you can really
push<00:02:27.110> off<00:02:27.320> it<00:02:27.560> if<00:02:28.040> you're<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.340> type<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.640> rider

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
push off it if you're the type of rider

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.880 
push off it if you're the type of rider
place<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.330> pump<00:02:29.630> out<00:02:29.780> of<00:02:29.900> corners<00:02:30.230> this<00:02:30.739> is

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
place to pump out of corners this is

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.140 
place to pump out of corners this is
something<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:31.310> will<00:02:31.400> really<00:02:31.550> help<00:02:31.700> being

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
something that will really help being

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.880 
something that will really help being
narrower<00:02:32.570> in<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.750> back<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.170> having<00:02:33.410> that<00:02:33.680> D

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
narrower in the back and having that D

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.770 
narrower in the back and having that D
wedge<00:02:34.070> it'll<00:02:34.640> be<00:02:34.730> more<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.209> work<00:02:35.390> with<00:02:35.570> and

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
wedge it'll be more to work with and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.840 
wedge it'll be more to work with and
your<00:02:35.930> back<00:02:36.230> foot<00:02:36.260> will<00:02:36.800> have<00:02:36.950> more<00:02:37.220> control<00:02:37.459> of

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
your back foot will have more control of

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.310 
your back foot will have more control of
turning<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.750> board<00:02:38.959> than<00:02:39.080> it<00:02:39.200> would

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
turning the board than it would

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.960 
turning the board than it would
typically<00:02:39.650> because<00:02:40.070> you<00:02:40.160> have<00:02:40.340> more<00:02:40.610> leverage

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
typically because you have more leverage

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.180 
typically because you have more leverage
over<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.570> tail<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.020> board<00:02:42.200> one<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.040> the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
over the tail of the board one of the

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.380 
over the tail of the board one of the
things<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.610> will<00:02:43.700> also<00:02:43.910> help<00:02:44.209> with

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
things that will also help with

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.390 
things that will also help with
stability<00:02:44.570> is<00:02:45.110> being<00:02:45.410> lowered<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.010> ground

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
stability is being lowered to the ground

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.540 
stability is being lowered to the ground
and<00:02:46.670> having<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.450> less<00:02:47.900> Turney<00:02:48.530> truck<00:02:49.160> in<00:02:49.400> the

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
and having a less Turney truck in the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.280 
and having a less Turney truck in the
back<00:02:49.730> that's<00:02:50.239> going<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.480> make<00:02:50.660> sure<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:51.080> when

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
back that's going to make sure that when

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.870 
back that's going to make sure that when
you<00:02:51.380> start<00:02:51.440> going<00:02:51.980> fast<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.459> get<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.610> little

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
you start going fast you get a little

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.460 
you start going fast you get a little
bit<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.090> twitch<00:02:53.330> in<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.510> front<00:02:53.780> because<00:02:54.140> the

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
bit of a twitch in the front because the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.870 
bit of a twitch in the front because the
back<00:02:54.650> truck<00:02:54.920> doesn't<00:02:55.250> want<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.430> turn<00:02:55.580> as<00:02:55.760> much

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
back truck doesn't want to turn as much

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.940 
back truck doesn't want to turn as much
it's<00:02:56.330> not<00:02:56.540> going<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.780> want<00:02:56.959> to<00:02:57.080> turn<00:02:57.350> like<00:02:57.650> this

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
it's not going to want to turn like this

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.370 
it's not going to want to turn like this
it's<00:02:58.400> gonna<00:02:58.550> want<00:02:58.820> to<00:02:58.970> wobble<00:02:59.330> like<00:02:59.480> that<00:02:59.810> and

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
it's gonna want to wobble like that and

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.140 
it's gonna want to wobble like that and
if<00:03:00.500> it<00:03:00.620> wobbles<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.250> little<00:03:01.640> bit<00:03:01.730> like<00:03:01.880> this

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
if it wobbles a little bit like this

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.240 
if it wobbles a little bit like this
your<00:03:02.600> tails<00:03:02.870> not<00:03:03.080> going<00:03:03.380> anywhere<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:04.070> what's

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
your tails not going anywhere so what's

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.470 
your tails not going anywhere so what's
going<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.400> end<00:03:04.459> up<00:03:04.700> happening<00:03:05.060> is<00:03:05.239> you'll<00:03:05.390> be

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
going to end up happening is you'll be

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.789
