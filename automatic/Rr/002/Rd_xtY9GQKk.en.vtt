that's<00:01:58.700> inside<00:01:59.119> ok<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.369> put<00:02:01.369> this<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.700> side

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
that's inside ok so put this to the side

have it now I gotta say guys this is a
tiny<00:02:25.099> tiny<00:02:26.380> carrying<00:02:27.380> case<00:02:27.620> like<00:02:28.069> look<00:02:28.910> at

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
tiny tiny carrying case like look at

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.050 
tiny tiny carrying case like look at
this<00:02:29.440> it's<00:02:30.440> not<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.980> flattest<00:02:31.549> or<00:02:31.730> anything

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
this it's not the flattest or anything

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.600 
this it's not the flattest or anything
which<00:02:32.299> I<00:02:32.390> wouldn't<00:02:32.660> expect<00:02:32.840> but<00:02:33.290> this<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.769> tiny

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
which I wouldn't expect but this is tiny

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.089 
which I wouldn't expect but this is tiny
this<00:02:34.940> is<00:02:35.090> a<00:02:35.120> small<00:02:35.690> footprint<00:02:36.170> it's<00:02:36.769> not<00:02:36.950> going

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
this is a small footprint it's not going

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.490 
this is a small footprint it's not going
to<00:02:37.160> be<00:02:37.220> taking<00:02:37.489> up<00:02:37.549> too<00:02:37.700> much<00:02:37.730> room<00:02:37.880> anywhere

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
to be taking up too much room anywhere

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.960 
to be taking up too much room anywhere
so<00:02:39.500> that's<00:02:39.650> cool<00:02:39.890> we'll<00:02:40.370> move<00:02:40.489> that<00:02:40.670> out<00:02:40.819> the

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
so that's cool we'll move that out the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.470 
so that's cool we'll move that out the
way<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.890> alright<00:02:42.890> let's<00:02:43.099> open<00:02:43.340> this<00:02:43.700> up<00:02:43.880> it's

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
way and alright let's open this up it's

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.410 
way and alright let's open this up it's
a<00:02:44.569> hard<00:02:44.780> shell<00:02:44.930> case<00:02:45.200> as<00:02:45.440> v-moda<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:47.120> of

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
a hard shell case as v-moda and of

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.940 
a hard shell case as v-moda and of
course<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.720> has<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.870> clip<00:02:48.170> so<00:02:48.319> you<00:02:48.349> can<00:02:48.560> strap

this<00:03:49.549> design<00:03:49.910> I'm<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.599> fan<00:03:50.959> of<00:03:51.139> these<00:03:52.010> kinds<00:03:52.400> of

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
this design I'm a fan of these kinds of

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.699 
this design I'm a fan of these kinds of
designs<00:03:52.760> where<00:03:53.120> it's<00:03:53.299> raised<00:03:53.900> instead<00:03:54.590> of

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
designs where it's raised instead of

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.650 
designs where it's raised instead of
just<00:03:54.920> a<00:03:55.040> straight<00:03:55.099> L<00:03:55.519> kind<00:03:56.150> of<00:03:56.239> like<00:03:56.329> the<00:03:56.480> beats

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
just a straight L kind of like the beats

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.059 
just a straight L kind of like the beats
have<00:03:56.870> because<00:03:57.349> that<00:03:57.530> means<00:03:57.709> you<00:03:57.799> can<00:03:57.920> use

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
have because that means you can use

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.099 
have because that means you can use
these<00:03:58.250> with<00:03:58.489> more<00:03:58.730> cell<00:03:59.299> phone<00:03:59.540> cases<00:03:59.810> or

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
these with more cell phone cases or

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.340 
these with more cell phone cases or

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
maybe the daisy chain okay that might be

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.430 
maybe the daisy chain okay that might be
it<00:04:18.580> this<00:04:18.910> is<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.239> cable<00:04:19.450> we're<00:04:20.110> going<00:04:20.230> to<00:04:20.290> toss

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
it this is the cable we're going to toss

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.470 
it this is the cable we're going to toss
toss<00:04:20.709> this<00:04:20.920> to<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.130> side<00:04:21.280> it's<00:04:21.459> very<00:04:21.550> long<00:04:22.120> too

toss this to the side it's very long too

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.590 
toss this to the side it's very long too
so<00:04:23.170> I'll<00:04:23.260> put<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.470> step<00:04:23.650> aside<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:25.300> see<00:04:25.480> what

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
so I'll put the step aside and see what

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.140 
so I'll put the step aside and see what
else<00:04:25.690> is<00:04:25.810> inside<00:04:26.020> here<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:27.250> now<00:04:27.670> to<00:04:27.730> the

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
else is inside here and now to the

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.140 
else is inside here and now to the
actual<00:04:28.480> headphones<00:04:29.430> here<00:04:30.430> they<00:04:30.610> go

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
actual headphones here they go

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.950 
actual headphones here they go
these<00:04:31.450> are<00:04:31.600> tiny<00:04:32.520> these<00:04:33.520> at<00:04:33.850> least<00:04:34.060> they<00:04:34.540> look

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
these are tiny these at least they look

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.530 
these are tiny these at least they look
tiny<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:36.310> if<00:04:36.490> you<00:04:36.610> still<00:04:36.910> look<00:04:37.060> inside<00:04:37.300> of<00:04:37.480> the

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
tiny and if you still look inside of the

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.690 
tiny and if you still look inside of the
case<00:04:37.810> you<00:04:38.710> can<00:04:38.860> see<00:04:39.010> there's<00:04:39.190> another<00:04:39.460> little

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
case you can see there's another little

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.410 
case you can see there's another little
portion<00:04:40.210> here<00:04:40.860> that<00:04:41.860> has<00:04:42.310> I<00:04:42.670> guess<00:04:42.730> some<00:04:43.210> more

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
portion here that has I guess some more

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.970 
portion here that has I guess some more
cables<00:04:44.310> so<00:04:45.310> we're<00:04:45.460> gonna<00:04:45.580> pluck<00:04:46.000> this<00:04:46.270> out<00:04:46.980> so

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
cables so we're gonna pluck this out so

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.900 
cables so we're gonna pluck this out so
now<00:04:48.100> you<00:04:48.160> have<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.430> black<00:04:49.030> cable<00:04:49.360> here<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:50.910> this
