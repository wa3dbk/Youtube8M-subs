are used to temperature ranges between

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.960 
are used to temperature ranges between
60<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:53.720> 80<00:00:54.190> which<00:00:55.190> is<00:00:55.400> why<00:00:55.580> they're

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
60 and 80 which is why they're

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.580 
60 and 80 which is why they're
considered<00:00:56.420> houseplants<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:57.140> grow<00:00:57.350> well<00:00:57.560> in

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
two things are what kind of light do I

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.940 
two things are what kind of light do I
put<00:01:06.619> it<00:01:06.710> in<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.070> how<00:01:07.520> do<00:01:07.579> I<00:01:07.759> water<00:01:08.180> it<00:01:08.799> some<00:01:09.799> of

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
put it in and how do I water it some of

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.710 
put it in and how do I water it some of
the<00:01:10.040> things<00:01:10.310> that<00:01:10.520> will<00:01:10.610> give<00:01:10.790> you<00:01:10.909> clues<00:01:11.270> are

colorful leaves reds yellows and oranges

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.830 
colorful leaves reds yellows and oranges
are<00:01:21.590> generally<00:01:22.460> plants<00:01:22.940> that<00:01:23.120> require<00:01:23.540> more

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
are generally plants that require more

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.710 
are generally plants that require more
light<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:25.040> put<00:01:25.370> them<00:01:25.490> in<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.700> window<00:01:26.060> now<00:01:26.420> right

that have plainer foliage something like

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.840 
that have plainer foliage something like
your<00:01:38.840> Chinese<00:01:39.260> evergreen<00:01:39.590> family<00:01:40.070> these

leafy arrow-shaped leaves those can grow

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.090 
leafy arrow-shaped leaves those can grow
in<00:01:44.960> lower<00:01:45.140> light<00:01:46.900> most<00:01:47.900> house<00:01:48.260> plants<00:01:48.290> can

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
in lower light most house plants can

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.649 
in lower light most house plants can
grow<00:01:49.400> in<00:01:49.549> a<00:01:49.640> window<00:01:49.970> unless<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:50.420> live<00:01:50.630> in

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
grow in a window unless you live in

Arizona or California or Florida if you
live<00:01:55.130> in<00:01:55.250> areas<00:01:55.430> like<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.210> may<00:01:56.390> want<00:01:56.600> to

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
live in areas like that you may want to

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.450 
live in areas like that you may want to
put<00:01:56.869> them<00:01:57.049> farther<00:01:57.380> away<00:01:57.619> from<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:58.040> windows

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
put them farther away from the windows

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.969 
put them farther away from the windows
so<00:01:59.240> then<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.600> next<00:01:59.750> most<00:02:00.049> important<00:02:00.590> thing<00:02:00.770> is

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
so then the next most important thing is

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.429 
so then the next most important thing is
how<00:02:01.189> do<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.369> water<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:01.970> well<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:03.020> thickness

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
how do you water it well the thickness

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.130 
how do you water it well the thickness
of<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.710> roots<00:02:03.979> gives<00:02:04.520> you<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:04.729> key<00:02:05.150> to<00:02:05.540> how

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
of the roots gives you a key to how

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.830 
of the roots gives you a key to how
often<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.740> plant<00:02:07.010> needs<00:02:07.189> water

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
often the plant needs water

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.899 
often the plant needs water
you<00:02:08.840> see<00:02:09.110> I<00:02:09.319> lift<00:02:09.769> up<00:02:09.950> this<00:02:10.159> Chinese<00:02:10.610> evergreen

waiting so let's take a look at these

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.410 
waiting so let's take a look at these
roots<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:54.050> see<00:02:54.320> they're<00:02:54.500> much<00:02:54.740> more<00:02:55.040> dense

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420
