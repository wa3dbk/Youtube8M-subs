 this compressed file if you do not 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.170

 they have the winrar here in the corner 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.160

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.690
 so that they download the winrar as 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.900

 and we give in extract so that once 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.100

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.200
 we give you next we return to the 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.880
 next in this part tells us that 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.490
 let's put a serial I'm going to download a 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.230
 little bit highlights here in the folder that 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.810
 download as I told you is the 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.790
 installer and the codes then we go 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.500
 to open the codes double click here 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.140
 are the codes I'm going to choose 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.850
 example first control is to copy 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.590
 I go here Setup 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.510
 here I hit 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.900
 I buy cloud to paste and I give it 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.480
 next here in the language then 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.400
 we choose Spanish or the language that 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.800
 you want me I select in my case 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.540
 Spanish and I give next here we 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.819
 ask where we want to save 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.900
 the program because I leave it like this and I give it 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.910
 following 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.620
 for example in this case my antivirus 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.239
 I was asking yes, what if I 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.090
 I know this program because I'm going to 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.160
 give me to consider trust because I 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.590
 I know it's not virus here it tells me that if 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.390
 want to set up the cursor xp yo leo 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.030
 green I'm going to remove that pigeon because 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.680
 I do not want to and yes, I do not know what 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.260
 Sheath will also remove the pigeon and 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.630
 I give it to finish ready already it was 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.700
 installed can close here and ready a 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.329
 Once we have installed it, we will 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.750
 start 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:03.849
 we look for xp cursor or windows 8 then 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.819
 go to the magnifying glass and write in the cursor x 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.489
 perry and select it here let's see 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.440
 it's like how to change the cursor always 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.810
 this default will not come out yet 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.849
 First, I advise you that before 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.760
 do this restart on your computer 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.160
 because some if they do not restart they do not 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.639
 they will change the cursor then a 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.550
 time 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.469
 and you give him here in this case I 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.689
 I have plenty of cursors because I already 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:30.430
 I have all the packs installed 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.919
 that you can download from my blog 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.620
 and I'm going to select for example this and 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.120
 I give him to apply yet I'm not going to 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.310
 accept because I'll explain here 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.770
 what about the effects if you want 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.990
 have more effects than those that come out 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.689
 with the program because I invite you to 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.340
 watch the video of how to put more effects 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.289
 here I will leave the link in the part 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.810
 top left here is where you 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.789
 they change the effect depending on deciding 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.740
 you click right click left 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.810
 double click good here in all you can 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.400
 change me for example the only effect 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.250
 what I have is this that when the clicks 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.379
 that red ball of fire comes out as it is done 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.120
 we select here and we give change 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:09.699
 strict there we get the list of 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.099
 effects and we select the same here in 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.629
 sound piles that is dove not the 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.270
 we must leave it because if it is not 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:18.279
 disable the same here at the beginning 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.409
 we must remove this pigeon from turning off 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:21.879
 all the same for the sounds by 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:24.219
 example that sound you hear 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:26.139
 when I click this is the one of the 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:28.600
 left down the same if you 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.220
 they select and they give change solid 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.440
 and you are going to choose between 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.120
 sounds that there are and the same the trace in 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.160
 this case I have these bubbles that are 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.230
 come you can choose also there 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.300
 between several traces here and change the 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.780
 good address everything we give to apply 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.430
 and accept ready if you want 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.950
 install the topics here I'm going to 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.450
 explain suppose that you already 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.670
 downloaded these parts of topics 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.310
 then what you have to do 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.050
 is to open the good themes pack 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.440
 obviously first do not decompress double 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.210
 click here are all the topics 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.340
 we select and we give control to 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.480
 select everything and control is stopped 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:10.540
 copy we close here we go to disk equipment 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.540
 local center program country or some 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:18.280
 Double-click program files appear 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:19.720
 we look for xp cursor we give in topics and 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.070
 here are all the issues then 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.350
 only to me do they seem apt to 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:26.170
 you will appear as 10 and 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.300
 here we are going to give uve control so that 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.430
 stick the issues that we just 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.480
 copy and ready and they will appear 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.250
 well, you 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.440
 again they go to this program and since 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.150
 they are going to appear then those cursors 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.590
 that we just placed I do not feel anymore 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.230
