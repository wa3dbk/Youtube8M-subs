I'm<00:03:44.440> not<00:03:44.650> going<00:03:44.830> to<00:03:44.890> solve<00:03:45.220> this<00:03:45.550> because<00:03:45.940> the

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
I'm not going to solve this because the

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.840 
I'm not going to solve this because the
soy<00:03:47.230> sauce<00:03:47.290> is<00:03:47.830> salty<00:03:48.100> so<00:03:48.490> that<00:03:48.610> kind<00:03:48.790> of

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
soy sauce is salty so that kind of

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.350 
soy sauce is salty so that kind of
acting<00:03:49.209> like<00:03:49.270> our<00:03:49.660> seasoning<00:03:50.620> and<00:03:51.250> also<00:03:52.209> I'm

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
acting like our seasoning and also I'm

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.810 
acting like our seasoning and also I'm
going<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:52.959> already<00:03:53.560> have<00:03:53.740> salt<00:03:54.070> in<00:03:54.220> my<00:03:54.280> water

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
going to I already have salt in my water

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
too much salt so this is going to be
