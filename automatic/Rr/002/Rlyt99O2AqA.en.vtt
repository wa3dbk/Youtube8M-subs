00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.499
 already one of the formula last let's 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.339
 play imagination had that too 

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:39.799
 on the counter 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:43.129
 well i do household let's play off 

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:45.019
 Ganter and in advance I want you something 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.579
 now for two times if 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.559
 you are interested in the video so here 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.069
 cde watching a few shots like 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.889
 I just 95 stone farmville the sp 7 

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:58.969
 year ahead, the information as I go 

00:00:54.889 --> 00:01:02.239
 Now let's say 99 percent can give 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:06.109
 is that I'm one on mine 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.689
 channel only videos high loads the de 

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:10.189
 So videos are about to be grumpy 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.990
 do let's play off strike 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.369
 I will not like the other webspace 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.049
 on some server 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.090
 I will not passwords of 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.829
 leave mountain and this whole 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.920
 nonsense because I'm not that one 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:25.039
 fan of it and I do not know that's it 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.719
 not to say that worth seeing 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.810
 There are some people who do it well 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.159
 for example, turbo and so they can 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.960
 yes optically I do not have anything 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.329
 but also my channel 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.969
 you do not find something like that and that's just it 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:41.060
 what you have you people like it 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.859
 stand like for example how to get on de 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.960
 colors can be how you make money on the e 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:47.119
 how to trade on the eu how to 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.100
 waiting for certain events 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.409
 which then deliberately exploit so for themselves 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.920
 exploit and thereby build up 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.039
 Etc 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.710
 I've been with the two for six years 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.810
 Experiences and that means, of course, too 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.549
 that I know a lot about media 2 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.829
 For example, if you have questions so 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.869
 you can also ask questions and ask 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.600
 yes that has the recording now you see 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.680
 just stop my 90s stop in the new 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:17.790
 app is I still have a of 61 he 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.310
 pharma da so his 60 kg 18 so 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.230
 but goes 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.740
 I still have 55 agencies 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:31.580
 I also have a punch on p 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:33.690
 not counting yet 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.000
 I have a little new one 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.240
 Project but I have to stop until Easter 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.490
 wait for the concerts 130 with those 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.320
 I also want to pull perfect champion 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.910
 that should not stop there 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.290
 our server is allowed one but that is 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.840
 just completely submerged or gamble 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.720
 hard and something like that I have before that 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.250
 is just something very demanding 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.760
 does not always show as I do 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.280
 example to run around stone and search 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.560
 that was boring, I would too 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.570
 always cat sitting there if that too 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.420
 So it depends on how it is 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.800
 I also address 50 percent of the time 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.330
 main I want to know what you are 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.070
 want to see 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.720
 and if this old says Jacob please 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.160
 but since that is not so nice 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.390
 I mean, I'm doing that 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.780
 no problem 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.900
 and yes that 's just the thing for 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.959
 a channel wanted the six-year-old 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.200
 offer two experiences and something like that 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.730
 and yes and too frosty advent calendar 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.220
 I think that's really cool what he does 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.500
 that he just so much smaller youtube times 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.360
 Now let's say under the arms 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.209
 picks up more subscriptions 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.090
 Spectators and you have that means you have 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.310
 owe them so much so that 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.540
 also a cool thing of her I would have 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.890
 also so many subscribers respectively 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.030
 if I continue with the last one now 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.500
 six weeks, I will certainly like that 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.570
 many subscribers like him at some point 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.130
 I will also be such an advent calendar 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.989
 It does not have to be that way either 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.540
 it is necessarily in december but 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.800
 at the advent coffee but month well 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.650
 every day action video of one 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.920
 other youtube upload the potential 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.170
 has something to do so 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.000
 I have studied cancer with an example 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.040
 also likes mixtapes and even in the past 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.769
 but at the moment I am already 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.840
 last area will be active, too 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.320
 certainly mixtapes follow 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.810
 I 'll become apa or various others 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.080
 For example, we say pvp or things 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.760
 that's what I stand for and you will 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.470
 See me at this time too 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.790
 they 'll develop something, too 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.620
 very exciting as I have my equipment 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.639
 continue to expand because I'm missing me 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.680
 a lot more 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.510
 I'm in the process of building up and that's why 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.630
 I drive on every crazy and also 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.830
 order now and I'll resulting in the 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.930
 but shop not invest now so 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.360
 blatant because I am actually such a 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.669
 Antibody is rarely what but if 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.840
 I invest something because I do it 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.729
 also smart as for example when the 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.800
 scanner comes in just once 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.870
 did you first time then I buy first 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.479
 five six months not so that is true 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.040
 clear to me as a non-event body 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.139
 that one of you never mind no man 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.930
 90s area you should from time to time 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.870
 get something but I do not shoppe 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.160
 as often as I well even say that was it 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.419
 now from me for the little one 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.770
 you have a few ideas 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.530
 Exceptions or seen 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.240
 two weeks of media steinhauer and so on 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.860
 I say goodbye now too 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.510
 size at this also note yet 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.310
 chilly and his audience I hope so 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.139
 you liked it great and I once 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.850
 on my race over and we turn 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.850
 time live back and studio
