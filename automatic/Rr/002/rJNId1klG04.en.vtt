00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.270
 big metropolis with intense street 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.940
 movement is not surprising that 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.140
 major contributor to pollution 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.319
 atmospheric air of the capital 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.329
 bring exactly motor transport in that 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.619
 number of city buses according to 

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:59.609
 Department of Transport Policy Committee 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.739
 Kazan executive committee transport only in the city 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.879
 there are 1,444 buses 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.899
 daily flight leaves about a thousand 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.280
 two hundred units 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.049
 the lion's share of them are so 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.350
 called red nefaz buses 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.890
 smear and chinese boss inspection 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.970
 Ministry of Ecology 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:16.710
 ensuring environmental 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.340
 security with 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.200
 traffic police inspectors during the autumn 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.820
 smoke tests were carried out 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.509
 exhaust gas passenger and 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:24.919
 trucks 

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:27.949
 just checked 124 buses exceeding 

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:29.639
 details revealed 18 

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:31.079
 percent of the total 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.370
 checked buses 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.180
 This means that approximately every fifth 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.270
 Kazan bus pollutes water 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.350
 care of such cars removed license plates 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.350
 signs sent for repair 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.860
 reasons 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.130
 we observe 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.130
 Portugal 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.340
 Further 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:11.529
 students get 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:13.959
 in the discussion of the Kazan red buses are not 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.219
 subside as fast aging park 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.209
 buses a lot of complaints and in connection with 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.440
 frequent breakdowns 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.190
 if with exhaust activity especially this 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.260
 concerns the Chinese copies to them 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.139
 most complaints 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.119
 it is already obvious to many that the Chinese 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:30.449
 fell short of expectations will not incur hundreds upon 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.689
 quality or environmental friendliness all 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:34.769
 same euro 3 in a consortium of boards 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.119
 engines quickly credited 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:38.939
 There may be several causes of smoke. 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.759
 for example malfunction 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:42.699
 fuel system which in its 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:44.669
 the queue depends on the quality of the fuel 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:46.949
 and high-quality maintenance 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:49.090
 the latter is especially true 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.140
 it so happened that a number of carriers are not 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.590
 managed to organize correctly 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.970
 maintenance of new equipment 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.700
 timely producer 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.750
 supply of spare parts in the end machine 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.700
 operated by jets 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.400
 particulate filters and other 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.779
 faults 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:04.329
 Republican environmentalists offer 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:05.559
 move municipal 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:06.749
 public transport to 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:08.779
 alternative fuel for example in 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.019
 natural gas which is both cheaper and 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.210
 more environmentally friendly 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.950
 precisely both as interest and 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.980
 economic and environmental effect 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.369
 from such a transition to 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:21.249
 into gaseous fuel but very 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:24.049
 great so would the bros into atmospheric air 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.889
 shrink not shrink 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.839
 almost 10 times compared to normal 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:31.669
 motorized fuel gasoline signatures and 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.499
 sole fuel 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:35.579
 in a possible public transition 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.639
 transport to gas fuel already with 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.419
 the next year spoke Rustam 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.189
 minnikhanov 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:41.869
 the president offered to transfer part 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:43.619
 municipal transport to the new 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:45.619
 form as a pilot project for 

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:46.590
 all of Russia 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.300
 He noted that the transition from diesel 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.940
 fuel gas will significantly 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.040
 save and most importantly it 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.719
 environmentally friendly 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:55.349
 good in the republic there are companies that 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.379
 can equip their trucks and buses 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:58.579
 gas equipment 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.559
 for example large gas service 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:03.239
 the center is in quays with 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.249
 using which trucks punish 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:06.609
 they appeared in the lineup 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.629
 KAMAZ 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.540
 they are installed domestic 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.249
 natural gas engines 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:13.139
 corresponding to environmental 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.769
 Euro 4 standard 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.750
 It is worth noting that Hamas is successful 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.340
 implement programs for transition to 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.989
 alternative fuel he 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.000
 The only plant in Russia which is already 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.539
 mastered the production of cars 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.499
 working on methane 

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.129
 gas engine throw out in 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:28.209
 the atmosphere is minimal 

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:30.070
 amount of toxic substances 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.820
 equipment 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.920
 conducted jointly with the company 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.680
 Ritec 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.570
 domestic competitors if and 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.150
 do something like that 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.750
 used imported engine 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.809
 matched euro 4 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:43.289
 Kolomiets and I do not rule out the norm 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.229
 i.e. payments are minimal 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.150
 that's just for our cities for 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.969
 of our 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:49.979
 heavy how to say here are just 3 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.860
 March for big cities in this find 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.039
 such cars stockholm truck 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.220
 cost more 10 2 0 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.820
 but its operation will cost 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.580
 Significantly cheaper as the cost 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.580
 metal significantly lower diesel fuel 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.410
 up to 10 resolutions of regional plenums 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.580
 of Ukraine 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.689
 can't cost 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:11.370
 five percent of the cost 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.309
 except glass a day 

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:15.239
 remember the intergovernmental 

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:17.849
 protocol costs 18 rubles 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.620
 but he is not even more than nine rubles 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.180
 despite the constructive 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.310
 Engine changes in general, KAMAZ remained 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.180
 the same 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.300
 external differences only exhaust pipe 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.210
 located under the front bumper 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.240
 and here the chieftain developed such 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.700
 way 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.139
 no 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:34.819
 if necessary, we can perform 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:37.930
 work mission Kyivstar gsm by the way 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.120
 exerting dump trucks kamaz and already working in 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.690
 Saratov 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.680
 And in Moscow test gas KAMAZ 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.400
 garbage truck 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.030
 fast public transfer 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.830
 transport to gas fuel can 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.020
 contribute to the launch of Tatarstan 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.330
 pilot biogas project from 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.500
 organic waste treatment plants 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.479
 noteworthy is that the resulting fuel 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.740
 will develop your gas cylinder new 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.120
 light alloy generation without which 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.979
 half the usual metal she 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.160
 has a very great perspective from the point 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.460
 practical application and 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.240
 stimulation 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.490
 on motorists like pandev satisfied so 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.129
 and 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:18.779
 enterprises and organizations transition 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.650
 on with the wife and natural gas 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.080
 I want to believe that all these are promising 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.030
 solutions will be implemented in 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.030
 soon the streets of Kazan will run 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.419
 environmentally friendly and safe bus and 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:31.919
 tower time it must come 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.409
 really soon 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:34.989
 as part of the preparation program for 

00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:37.209
 Universiade will be purchased 700 new 

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:38.240
 buses 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.449
 how many of them will be on the gas topic for now 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:42.509
 unknown but absolutely certain that 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:44.780
 they will be practically produced 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.370
 and of course red
