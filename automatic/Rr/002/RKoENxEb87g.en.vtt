 advertising was not the kind of click a couple of cases 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.110
 do lessons and still see why 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.620
 no, why not begin now the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.620
 any will disassemble the soul sings any 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:55.079
 and why is it so in Russia the birches make noise that killed 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.079
 aster 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.320
 leaning against loretta capital 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.450
 elista 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.649
 broadcast 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.080
 I throw 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:23.110
 yes, all for five hotly great 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.350
 again without an answer 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:31.330
 and the leaf from the birch fell 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.330
 it will doom me 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.970
 he like me so with humanity my name is 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.060
 Yaroslav 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.790
 i'm back i hope i can see you today 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.860
 teach you to play a song of a group 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.220
 name machu so in Russia birch rustle 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.290
 interesting so how are we playing with 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.750
 tell you at home on the guitar did not play therefore 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.410
 It turned out as quickly but explain it 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.840
 I think I can 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.700
 so firstly all the chords of a song in 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.950
 a description of everything for which to core dump 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.260
 description there but on our website just 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.360
 hover on the court and there are shown how it 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.670
 it will become that it once again did not explain in 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.440
 Generally brute force and in google so here 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.420
 such a few options firstly if 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.100
 you play a pick 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.190
 here's an example on the first chord on 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:24.690
 stakes of tires played in this way 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.690
 busting 4 3 2 1 2 3 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.650
 4 3 2 1 2 3 and why so Russia is being driven 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.970
 Yes, then I can not just melted 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.439
 constant golf r string can 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.439
 alternate you can play the fourth string 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.849
 and who start with 5 strings and 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.540
 you can ignite the sixth 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.540
 join 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.110
 In general, this device is brute force 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.970
 we play the verses that is all chords 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.400
 we play here like ours at the beginning 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.970
 You can play several times to lose 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.020
 as an entry we enter why so 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.120
 in russia and farther farther we play 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.210
 this is bust 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.210
 am Yashin and so on chords again 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.550
 I repeat everything will be in the description so then 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.620
 another option can be played without a mediator 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:29.940
 purely fingers just the same sort 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.940
 there is a massive 3 2 1 2 3 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.390
 I just have a very clumsy finger better 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:39.000
 to play a pick 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.540
 and that is, the couplets we play with this 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.849
 brute chorus we play in battle 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.989
 the first two chords in the chorus that is it 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:54.049
 chord h and h 7 we play is pure blow 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:56.609
 down heart 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:59.989
 rest of the chords and start the card game 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.989
 and play like this here fight 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:09.670
 and light and light profit on another cord is 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.970
 what i heard the whole 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.970
 bright light 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.730
 top back 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.930
 carry + 1 a from 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.860
 down up up down up down on 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.910
 shoulder 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.010
 he 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.480
 I really turned away from the song very much 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.580
 just decided to make out something 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.110
 simple brute force in general you understood 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.010
 how can you play this song 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.940
 all chords 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.140
 description and by the way chorus can 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.990
 to play like this 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.300
 and if you have fingers fingers fingers in 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.180
 general as well as just our time 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.550
 and h7 clean places starts when she 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.390
 you can play bass strings like this 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.260
 first second third string on so 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.780
 we pull simultaneously the first second 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:04.430
 for the third time we pull for 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.430
 let's play you in general hell 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:15.570
 what's the benefit of the heart again 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:19.050
 hot hot and all five again 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:21.630
 unresponsive ie bass and two tweaks 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.940
 I hope you learned to play a song 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.580
 groups lube called by the way how 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.440
 called Ramenka birch birch 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.510
 subscribe to my channel and become 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.990
 big fingers and now we will be lessons 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.860
 I hope to release everyone is waiting for now 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.860
 humanity yet
