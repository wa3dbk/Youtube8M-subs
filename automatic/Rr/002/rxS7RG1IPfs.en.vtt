there natural laws inherent in things

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.620 
there natural laws inherent in things
like<00:00:24.539> morality<00:00:25.259> is<00:00:25.740> there<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> standard<00:00:26.970> is

like morality is there a standard is
there<00:00:27.839> a<00:00:27.900> law<00:00:28.409> that<00:00:28.890> governs<00:00:29.189> all<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.519> us<00:00:29.669> so

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
there a law that governs all of us so

all agree that there is a moral law a

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.830 
all agree that there is a moral law a
natural<00:00:40.680> law<00:00:40.860> at<00:00:41.130> the<00:00:41.370> moral<00:00:42.150> level<00:00:42.390> that

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
natural law at the moral level that

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.030 
natural law at the moral level that
applies<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.170> all<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.710> us

I'll<00:00:44.460> take<00:00:44.940> murder<00:00:45.240> for<00:00:45.750> example<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
I'll take murder for example the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.350 
I'll take murder for example the
definition<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.550> murder<00:00:47.730> would<00:00:48.060> be<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
definition of murder would be the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.750 
definition of murder would be the
unjustified<00:00:49.290> killing<00:00:49.830> of<00:00:49.980> another<00:00:50.490> human

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.610 
unjustified killing of another human
being<00:00:50.880> and<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.900> think<00:00:52.080> we<00:00:52.230> would<00:00:52.320> all<00:00:52.590> agree

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
being and I think we would all agree

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.710 
being and I think we would all agree
every<00:00:53.430> single<00:00:53.760> one<00:00:53.880> of<00:00:53.940> us<00:00:54.150> that<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
every single one of us that the

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.330 
every single one of us that the
unjustified<00:00:55.440> killing<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.890> another<00:00:56.100> human

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
unjustified killing of another human

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.030 
unjustified killing of another human
being<00:00:56.580> is<00:00:56.730> wrong<00:00:56.940> now<00:00:57.660> where<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.230> differ<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.980> in

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
being is wrong now where we differ is in

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.420 
being is wrong now where we differ is in
the<00:00:59.580> definitions<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.900> is<00:01:01.100> justified<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the definitions what is justified and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.910 
the definitions what is justified and
what<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.880> a<00:01:02.910> human<00:01:03.600> being<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.680> look<00:01:04.829> at

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
what is a human being and if you look at

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920 
what is a human being and if you look at
things<00:01:05.040> throughout<00:01:05.369> history<00:01:05.579> that's<00:01:06.450> where

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
things throughout history that's where

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.320 
things throughout history that's where
we<00:01:07.140> differ<00:01:07.350> not<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.250> standard<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
we differ not on the standard that the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.670 
we differ not on the standard that the
unjustified<00:01:09.870> killing<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.260> another<00:01:10.470> human

unjustified killing of another human

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.280 
unjustified killing of another human
being<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.070> wrong<00:01:11.370> but<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> definitions<00:01:12.870> so

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
being is wrong but on the definitions so

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.470 
being is wrong but on the definitions so
for<00:01:13.560> instance<00:01:14.070> if<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.370> kill<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.150> self-defense

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
for instance if I kill in self-defense

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.410 
for instance if I kill in self-defense
I'm<00:01:16.280> justified<00:01:17.280> because<00:01:17.790> there<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:18.390> a

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
I'm justified because there was a

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.600 
I'm justified because there was a
reasonable<00:01:19.230> apprehension<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:20.130> fear<00:01:20.340> for<00:01:20.490> my

reasonable apprehension of fear for my
life<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.150> which<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.930> acted<00:01:22.680> out<00:01:22.820> Just<00:01:23.820> War

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
life in which I acted out Just War

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.240 
life in which I acted out Just War
theory<00:01:24.479> right<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:24.960> go<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.140> war<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.950> kill

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
theory right we can go to war and kill

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.360 
theory right we can go to war and kill
others<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.690> are<00:01:27.810> justified<00:01:28.350> under<00:01:29.340> a

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
others because we are justified under a

others because we are justified under a
theory<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.060> Just<00:01:30.810> War<00:01:31.070> there's<00:01:32.070> different

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
theory of Just War there's different

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.789 
theory of Just War there's different
types<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.760> mitigation<00:01:33.180> circumstances<00:01:34.170> etc<00:01:34.650> on
