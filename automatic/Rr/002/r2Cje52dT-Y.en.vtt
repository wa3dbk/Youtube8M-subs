00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.520 
things in Windows 10 which is quite nice
but<00:01:05.540> I'm<00:01:06.540> ain't<00:01:06.720> changing<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.049> techs<00:01:07.229> Bora<00:01:07.470> is

but I'm ain't changing the techs Bora is
this<00:01:07.830> oh<00:01:07.979> let's<00:01:08.580> say<00:01:08.820> Microsoft<00:01:09.060> edge<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:10.020> a

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
this oh let's say Microsoft edge it's a

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.649 
this oh let's say Microsoft edge it's a
low<00:01:10.350> loopback<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.430> thought<00:01:12.090> you've<00:01:12.270> ever

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
low loopback so I thought you've ever

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.800 
low loopback so I thought you've ever
used<00:01:13.549> something<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.880> uses<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.270> browser<00:01:15.509> to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
used something that uses the browser to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.359 
used something that uses the browser to
configure<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> settings<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.710> local<00:01:17.100> device

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
configure the settings on local device

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.580 
configure the settings on local device
so<00:01:17.640> if<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.939> install<00:01:18.360> plex<00:01:18.780> server<00:01:19.320> or

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
so if you install plex server or

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.249 
so if you install plex server or
something<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.729> then<00:01:21.540> you'll<00:01:21.840> see<00:01:22.049> one

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
something like that then you'll see one

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.910 
something like that then you'll see one
two<00:01:22.409> seven<00:01:22.650> zero<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.610> zero<00:01:23.659> that<00:01:24.659> one<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
two seven zero and zero that one in the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.170 
two seven zero and zero that one in the
browser<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.520> that's<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.820> sort<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.060> way<00:01:27.150> of

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
browser and that's the sort of way of

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.469 
browser and that's the sort of way of
configuring<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.900> local<00:01:29.000> device<00:01:30.000> through<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
browser for say plagues and that didn't

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.789 
browser for say plagues and that didn't
work<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.750> previous<00:01:33.960> bill<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.530> does

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
work in the previous bill but that does

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.530 
work in the previous bill but that does
now<00:01:35.009> be<00:01:35.189> could<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.490> valleys<00:01:35.880> tick<00:01:36.119> button<00:01:36.329> it

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
now be could be valleys tick button it

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.569 
now be could be valleys tick button it
worked<00:01:36.780> before<00:01:37.110> if<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.439> ticked<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.430> now

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
worked before if you ticked it but now

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.780 
worked before if you ticked it but now
this<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.270> default<00:01:40.220> right<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.430> let's<00:01:41.610> have

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
this is the default right so let's have

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.249 
this is the default right so let's have
a<00:01:41.850> look<00:01:42.030> at<00:01:42.180> something<00:01:42.450> that's<00:01:42.630> changed<00:01:43.079> since

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
a look at something that's changed since

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.319 
a look at something that's changed since
the<00:01:43.439> last<00:01:43.530> video<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.310> did<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.790> that's<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
the last video I did and that's the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.539 
the last video I did and that's the
music<00:01:45.420> app<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:46.020> now<00:01:46.229> called<00:01:46.850> grew<00:01:47.850> music<00:01:48.270> and

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
music app is now called grew music and

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.670 
music app is now called grew music and
it<00:01:50.549> was<00:01:50.759> originally<00:01:51.090> called<00:01:51.270> Xbox<00:01:51.780> music<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
it was originally called Xbox music and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.679 
it was originally called Xbox music and
then<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.159> app<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.549> been<00:01:53.850> recently<00:01:54.180> called

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
then the app it's been recently called

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.660 
then the app it's been recently called
music<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.439> now<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:55.890> called<00:01:56.040> grew<00:01:56.189> music<00:01:56.520> but

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
music and now it's called grew music but

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.819 
music and now it's called grew music but
it's<00:01:56.790> actually<00:01:56.909> groove<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.409> music<00:01:58.680> big

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
it's actually groove and the music big

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.590 
it's actually groove and the music big
is<00:01:59.040> going<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.399> dropped<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.060> shall<00:02:00.450> say

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
is going to be dropped and I shall say

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.870 
is going to be dropped and I shall say
that's<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.110> help<00:02:01.229> with<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.469> transition

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
that's just to help with the transition

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.530 
that's just to help with the transition
so<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:05.040> music<00:02:05.310> app<00:02:05.430> overall<00:02:05.880> hasn't<00:02:06.270> really

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
so the music app overall hasn't really

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.210 
so the music app overall hasn't really
changed<00:02:06.600> its<00:02:07.079> what<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.380> branding<00:02:07.770> exercise

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
changed its what the branding exercise

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.750 
changed its what the branding exercise
but<00:02:09.590> there<00:02:10.590> has<00:02:10.709> been<00:02:10.950> something<00:02:11.190> nice<00:02:11.520> things

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
but there has been something nice things

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.590 
but there has been something nice things
like<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.090> trance

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
like this trance

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.860 
like this trance
parent<00:02:13.340> now<00:02:14.340> playing<00:02:14.670> control<00:02:15.240> across<00:02:15.630> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
parent now playing control across the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.650 
parent now playing control across the
bottom<00:02:16.050> here<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.800> i<00:02:16.890> think<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.430> dark<00:02:18.360> look

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
bottom here and i think this dark look

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.020 
bottom here and i think this dark look
looks<00:02:19.110> really<00:02:19.470> nice<00:02:19.650> now<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.490> is<00:02:20.640> an<00:02:20.760> option

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
looks really nice now it is an option

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.480 
looks really nice now it is an option
you<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.240> switch<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.540> on<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:21.870> off<00:02:22.340> you've<00:02:23.340> got

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
you can switch it on and off you've got

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.740 
you can switch it on and off you've got
all<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.760> artists<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.860> that<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:27.660> know

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
all the artists that that you know

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.020 
all the artists that that you know
coming<00:02:27.960> in<00:02:28.140> circles<00:02:28.800> like<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.670> then

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
coming in circles like that and then

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.170 
coming in circles like that and then
albums<00:02:30.630> are<00:02:30.990> in<00:02:31.400> squares<00:02:32.400> like<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.090> i

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
albums are in squares like that and i

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.360 
albums are in squares like that and i
think<00:02:33.480> it's<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.930> nice<00:02:34.110> little<00:02:34.350> way<00:02:35.340> of

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
think it's a nice little way of

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.150 
think it's a nice little way of
differentiating<00:02:35.730> between<00:02:37.130> artists<00:02:38.130> and

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
differentiating between artists and

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.770 
differentiating between artists and
albums<00:02:38.310> i<00:02:38.670> said<00:02:38.850> this<00:02:38.940> Tramp<00:02:39.240> now<00:02:39.420> playing

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
albums i said this Tramp now playing

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.950 
albums i said this Tramp now playing
control<00:02:40.320> looks<00:02:40.890> quite<00:02:41.160> good<00:02:41.190> as<00:02:41.550> well<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.030> you

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
control looks quite good as well and you

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.660 
control looks quite good as well and you
can<00:02:43.140> adjust<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:45.050> effect<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.290> can<00:02:47.190> have<00:02:47.400> dark

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
can adjust the effect you can have dark

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.970 
can adjust the effect you can have dark
or<00:02:47.940> light<00:02:48.330> as<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:49.140> can<00:02:49.350> in<00:02:50.510> each<00:02:51.510> browser<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.950> i

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
or light as you can in each browser so i

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.890 
or light as you can in each browser so i
think<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.280> music<00:02:53.760> player<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.210> looking<00:02:54.720> good

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
major changes and I've had to reboot

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.240 
major changes and I've had to reboot
this<00:03:26.580> twice<00:03:26.910> today<00:03:27.810> right<00:03:28.620> because<00:03:28.920> they

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
this twice today right because they

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.820 
this twice today right because they
explore<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.820> start<00:03:30.660> menu<00:03:31.320> wasn't<00:03:31.590> quite

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
explore the start menu wasn't quite

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.320 
explore the start menu wasn't quite
start<00:03:32.070> screen<00:03:32.310> wasn't<00:03:32.460> coming<00:03:32.790> up<00:03:32.910> put<00:03:33.120> two

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
start screen wasn't coming up put two

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.470 
start screen wasn't coming up put two
hopefully<00:03:33.750> that's<00:03:34.050> just<00:03:34.320> because<00:03:34.470> it's<00:03:34.740> a<00:03:34.950> a

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
hopefully that's just because it's a a

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.120 
hopefully that's just because it's a a
new<00:03:36.480> install<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.110> it's<00:03:37.590> just<00:03:37.770> sorting<00:03:38.010> itself

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
new install and it's just sorting itself

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.820 
new install and it's just sorting itself
out<00:03:38.460> and<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.570> always<00:03:39.930> err<00:03:40.230> found<00:03:40.500> though<00:03:40.650> if<00:03:40.740> you

out and I always err found though if you

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.290 
out and I always err found though if you
do<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:40.950> PC<00:03:41.280> refresh<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.850> puts<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.090> back<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.270> a

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.670 
do a PC refresh it puts it back to a
clean<00:03:42.510> state<00:03:42.930> after<00:03:43.110> you've<00:03:43.320> done<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.500> lot<00:03:43.650> of

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
clean state after you've done a lot of

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.980 
clean state after you've done a lot of
great<00:03:43.920> build<00:03:44.490> and<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.120> does<00:03:45.330> work<00:03:45.510> better<00:03:45.690> as

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
great build and that does work better as

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.620 
great build and that does work better as
well<00:03:46.200> but<00:03:46.830> overall<00:03:47.070> looking<00:03:47.880> very<00:03:48.090> polished

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
well but overall looking very polished

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.010 
well but overall looking very polished
now<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:49.230> looking<00:03:49.770> like<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.340> finished<00:03:51.020> object

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
now and looking like the finished object

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.570 
now and looking like the finished object
flick<00:03:52.800> it<00:03:52.830> into<00:03:53.130> this<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:55.070> desktop<00:03:56.070> way<00:03:56.280> just

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
flick it into this the desktop way just

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.430 
flick it into this the desktop way just
to<00:03:56.670> show<00:03:56.850> that<00:03:56.880> looks<00:03:57.270> like<00:03:57.510> that's<00:03:57.780> pretty

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
to show that looks like that's pretty

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.110 
to show that looks like that's pretty
much<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.650> same<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.550> I<00:03:59.640> think<00:03:59.850> this<00:03:59.940> is

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
much the same and I think this is

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.780 
much the same and I think this is
looking<00:04:00.390> looking<00:04:00.990> rather<00:04:01.170> nice<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:01.740> you<00:04:02.610> can

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
looking looking rather nice so you can

looking looking rather nice so you can
