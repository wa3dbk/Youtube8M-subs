00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.049
 yes yes yes it is worth worth to create player 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.170
 let's create a player that is called 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.210
 rock or cell and as always we are going to 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.679
 fuck bring me icon I do not think so 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.049
 disassemble that this is American football 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.820
 we're going to make him patriots because 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.010
 today is election day and nothing so 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.380
 patriot how to vote and we're going to do that 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.420
 be from Barcelona you know that city 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.580
 wonderful hawaii and there we are go 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.650
 to make huge big huge huge but 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.170
 we're going to keep the canijo clear 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.720
 of the naranjito the face with the 15 is of 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.090
 that there is no one who faces like there is no one 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.770
 face in madden because he was in evil in 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.480
 25 as he will not be in evil in 15 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.480
 which is a smaller number but actually 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.820
 it's a good later version because it 's 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.559
 that looks a little like me 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.420
 same come let's make great what 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.129
 we are going to do huge we are going to do it 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.960
 We are going to scare him 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.329
 to your rivals that we are going to do with everything 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.550
 to the maximum everything 99 is going to be a beast going 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.039
 to be the train the express of the four 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.260
 will continue his period of Freud is not going to 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.629
 be the script or do my version of me 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.210
 same but my super version of my super 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.940
 myself and let's pray to whoever I am 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.250
 does not matter 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.550
 for example to the Seattle Seahawks 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.090
 champions of 2013 we go there you do not give me 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.090
 fear because I 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.030
 and to the red one reads that it is a train 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.250
 unstoppable that has no technique 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.439
 the only thing he has to say forwards and 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.930
 I do not care who gets in the way 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.430
 defenders are like my little children 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.110
 our good because it is that neither mine 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.060
 I am that neither I see were outside the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.360
 field of vision and yet we're going 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.020
 losing good nothing happens 3 but no 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.079
 They are worth transporting, do not retreat 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.240
 because it 's too high is too much 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.770
 big is too good look mine mine 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.080
 they need 1 2 3 4 to stop it let's go the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.450
 little dance I suppose that these heights 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.950
 we must now win twenty to three agents 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.110
 well, almost finishing the game 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.750
 we tie three but there is still time 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.149
 for the good defense comeback come on 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.610
 three we go feli we go superior you can you 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.520
 Well, you can not, so you already know 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.349
 urologist but in the prologue tom brady it 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.899
 the take out club good tom brady look at it 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:12.750
 happening I was licking an interconnection a 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.549
 transfer from the brady train to 30 is 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.370
 eliminate the change of pace that agility 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:20.490
 please is not fat cheated if healthy 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.160
 if they can not go to one 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.220
 they love each other because they can not stop 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.960
 this annoying pure physics is impossible 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.530
 for so much 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:36.080
 look i'm going to play or touch down eyes the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.080
 little guy touches my ass and he's 1 2 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.810
 3 that falls 4 makes me slide five 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.530
 six seven eight nine ten uncles for 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.560
 stop me and even so can this big 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.769
 link literally metaphorically and everything 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.599
 what you do with the brave interception and 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.640
 what are you doing with the good interception yet 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.310
 we can win we can still win you go 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.769
 only to see badly in is to see badly in learning 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.879
 bad or even touchdown you do what 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.469
 do what you do see what you do good 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.720
 it's the same as we do together there also 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:12.609
 is there is very unglamorous and 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.829
 besides he has not made it happy but 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.200
 victory after all could be 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.090
 perfectly the worst match of the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.400
 history they have brought him exclusively 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.430
 world as always to my channel there what 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.250
 we have an impressive prologue and 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.720
 decisive and legend llosa and up to here the 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.489
 video name I 'm not going to make a video 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.970
 three minutes 30 by very nice that 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.439
 be with a musical montage no no no 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.269
 took advantage of the end of the video to 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:39.189
 tell you my impressions about madden 15 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.990
 that despite being called 15 goes after 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:43.750
 of what was called 25 a weird thing 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.850
 25 5th anniversary and the 15th is because it's from 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.700
 2015 good the game to me has left me a 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.410
 little bit cold does not have interesting things 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.120
 such as a race or my 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.700
 carrier such as ifa no longer have 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.260
 let's say how does nba 2k have simply not 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.730
 you have seen that I can create a 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.950
 player but I have to put it in a 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.960
 roster you can not do any race 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.970
 no history or anything offline 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.920
 has the ultimate team that I was 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.570
 trying but I did not understand it very well 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.480
 I suppose if you know football 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.240
 you appreciate it more but I did not like it 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.030
 graphically it's better than 25 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.350
 obviously but it's not crazy either 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.989
 the cinematics are fine but what 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.790
 calling game to the physicists are a 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.610
 little better than in previous games 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.440
 they no longer seem like super men but 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.970
 that are more or less heavy 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.890
 Players ie it costs them 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.360
 little change of direction and so on 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.820
 despite what you have seen of this 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.740
 impossible player that was rock or celine 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.330
 and good what I like most with 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.370
 difference of this town that you are 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.650
 seeing that it is the section of 'never say 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.090
 never 'they are good real situations 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.340
 from last season and I think that 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.380
 there are also historical ones in which 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.390
 you have to change the destination 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.740
 they did this was also in fifa in 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.190
 the world then then here for example 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:57.130
 I'm taking the tampa bay I'm losing 4 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.050
 30 seconds left and I'm second and 10 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.630
 I think something like that and I have to get 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.460
 race the match before I had to 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.560
 it was just a play and in the snow 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.850
 you had to do with italy is and in the 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.110
 previous you also had to overcome the 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.910
 most are comebacks but sometimes 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.910
 is to get a certain number of touchdowns 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.440
 or prevent others from writing down a 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.060
 comeback of a whole second part what 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.040
 that is and the truth is that I like this 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.140
 and also the community can participate 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.710
 I do not know exactly as well as he 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.720
 mlb 14 you could create these challenges yourself 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.610
 the community could create them I think that 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.160
 here you can not and joaquin because I already 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.770
 had won 26 2017 24 had 10 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.210
 seconds the packers and they were sorry plan 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.550
 the steelers 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.710
 and it's as good as it's already won and the 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.830
 very bastards look what they do to me 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.920
 wheaton pampered because yes and my accent 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.180
 it's down and I have to repeat the whole challenge 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.470
 but good about the challenges really to 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.030
 I like it is the part that I like the most 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.280
 it is also true that I like football 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.960
 American but I'm not a super mega great 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.300
 fan 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.680
 another person who knows more to the best 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.389
 You can appreciate other advantages 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.850
 in this game other things that are fine 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:01.560
 my friend leaves me a little warm not what 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.229
 has had so far I had it 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.630
 electronic within the pnd the east that 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.849
 has that is called electronic to receive you 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.770
 access something like that and with three euros paying 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:13.770
 three euros you have access for a month 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.110
 to all the xbox one games and I think 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.000
 that I also think that only sexual to all 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.099
 the electronic games of sports and 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.750
 so you can play it for free let's say 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.430
 for a month for only these three euros 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.139
 and good I took advantage of that to prove badly in 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.690
 which is the one that I needed to try and 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.520
 Well, it leaves me a little bit even though I 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.960
 it happens very well creating this player not 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.690
 I think I'll go back though many 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.009
 you have asked, I do not rule out anything like 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.800
 I always do not rule out anything if you have 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:40.949
 caught fondness to the great rock or Celica the 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.870
 express of the four the superego as the 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:44.669
 He loves you very much and is going to tell you 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.530
 just when we just completed the 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:48.180
 sac that we will complete below 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.069
 there are false you know what will happen man 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.599
 well if the edited video looks look 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:53.310
 let's make a serve look let's go to 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:55.800
 do roethlisberger road limburger 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.400
 zach and now is when the grain 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.400
 He says 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:05.080
 the arms are bad this animal is 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.080
 physically impossible
