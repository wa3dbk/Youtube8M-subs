00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.460
 but how 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.570
 is 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.829
 Yup 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.630
 as you have seen from the brief 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.620
 presentation I practically built 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.170
 entirely by itself this co on the web or 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.260
 yes because I said costume for not 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.230
 I know this trap 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.060
 then how it works very simple not 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.510
 I will make you review the mechanism as 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.910
 precisely the point of functioning because 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.590
 I've already shown it but I'll explain more or 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.350
 less instead as I did 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.930
 of course the famous blockade dared the 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.890
 kom to the blog that you can find 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.110
 my tutorial on the subject when 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.630
 we will go over this to plate 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.750
 sorry there will be a connection 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.470
 stop which will activate excuse me take off 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.209
 some of this bedrock will activate various 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.310
 I made this comal block 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.680
 simply for a practical reason 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.600
 because in reality I could only use one 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.550
 however I have to create a long code then 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.500
 besides being more difficult for me it was 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.080
 more difficult to explain so I have 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.720
 positioned various as a block according to 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:16.070
 commands I want to give these how 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.530
 block or put the 6 player command 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.780
 the closer you have been found that indeed 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.550
 when you come of the transported in the 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.180
 tower b should appear among the various 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.730
 commands then game mode survival so 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.940
 that if you were in my creative 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.040
 would immediately go into survival and precisely from 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.140
 a thick is would make the rain come and 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.050
 then I tried so many 18,000 sets that 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.170
 everything should come out very well 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.720
 this is then naturally connected 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:48.290
 the last one which is a tp the most player 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.870
 near these coordinates that precisely 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.910
 just the top of the tower as well 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.850
 it works very simple in the moment 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.100
 which you enter the pre-substitute 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.200
 precisely times I build a little at random 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.840
 so you will have the beautiful map made 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.660
 be pressed at plate you will be 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.410
 obliged to reach the maximum 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.769
 height of this thorne here after having 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.019
 route all the tower that remembers 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.229
 let's say it also consists of cobwebs 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.540
 which will then slow down those mountains 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.580
 it will be really pale, at least you will put it on 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.860
 a quarter of an hour ten minutes e 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.110
 you will get the bottom and buoys that happens in 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.710
 a very special thing happens 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.660
 there is another 3 on plate but the fresco 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.139
 vital plate of the shopping directly 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.360
 here at the pre on place old as it is 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.040
 the problem that is once the 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.040
 old at the plate one positioned 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.320
 this circuit is activated in this house 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.560
 remains active and therefore only one 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.240
 activation then what happens to you 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.340
 you will make all the cheeses or if I have it 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.080
 done I am a big asset then 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.530
 you will try to leave the house because 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.479
 do you have to pretend that it is 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.620
 the only way to get out I repeat this 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:06.510
 it is a trap and it is raw but 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.450
 of course it can be improved to 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:13.289
 believe your costume anyway 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:16.889
 exiting very well you have two options oo 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:18.660
 exit directly from the door and then 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.419
 here there will be alleged vi 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.190
 they will always send you there or you can 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.889
 some strange way to try to escape 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.710
 and go into this other than on beck but 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.840
 as you can see, there are gods here too 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.830
 command bloc does not have this second line 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:37.050
 this was a bit of a decision like that 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.340
 that just for the consumes you can maybe 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.139
 put something else 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.479
 to this first line you will have all the 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.590
 usual command that will postpone it there and so 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.090
 below 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.120
 practically the player will find himself 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.740
 locked then let's talk a moment about 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.479
 precisely what are the costumes 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.030
 There are some applications of this map 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:57.360
 many first of all you can use it ad 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.010
 example to create a quiz 2 if someone 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.110
 wrong in the canvases carried in the 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.710
 tower and then etc. to get stuck there 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:07.440
 or you can increase the difficulty a 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.820
 decrease it for example an idea that was me 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.030
 came but then I did not 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.249
 simply because he was afraid that he would 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.559
 excluded 

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:22.809
 that map for water as you see 

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:28.749
 sorry it's full of tnt simply 

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:31.969
 via sorry again via 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:35.119
 of the prec light you could do a 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:36.919
 forced path in the sense that if the 

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:37.549
 player so good to wait for everything 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:39.379
 the weather 

00:06:37.549 --> 00:06:41.929
 shell from the tower you will be of a 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:43.309
 listeners find an exit from the house 

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:45.499
 the last difficulty was that of 

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:47.929
 pass on all these fights by running 

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:50.539
 without dying then maybe the last one 

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:52.639
 plate for example here activated here one 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:54.199
 once pistols he could save himself 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.239
 this for example the classic 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:59.979
 application that you can make a costume 

00:06:56.239 --> 00:07:02.599
 but you can make some of your exos 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:04.729
 they are excellent, in short, all are accepted 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:07.159
 and this as usual a system 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:08.719
 basic you will find the download of 

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:10.610
 map in description so I hope you 

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:12.199
 you enjoyed this video sorry if 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.619
 I'm a little cool but it's not the fault 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:15.339
 my 

00:07:12.619 --> 00:07:15.339
 Hi everyone
