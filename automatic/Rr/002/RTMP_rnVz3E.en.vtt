 for a new video of the game you 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.680
 talk about area 51 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:21.510
 the 51- year-old area was founded in 1925 by 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.210
 the cia so officially so we 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.150
 always that the existing area 51 for 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.890
 specify to locate them in the desert of 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.369
 nevada as can be seen here on the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.669
 screens so here is the state of nevada in 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.669
 America 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.850
 so you can like to see it on 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.800
 the screens 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.309
 this is the state of Nevada in the United States 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.200
 here we have blank area 51 which 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.649
 represents will not be able to approach to 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.190
 over 20 km no it's not us who the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.160
 said 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.739
 yeah if you get back into the area there 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.000
 would be shot along all civilians summer 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:08.180
 will be with can see on the internet and if 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.440
 we have the radars that allows for 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.400
 locate the planes are passed over 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.410
 if you noticed there are 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.130
 ponds we go by helicopter 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:24.550
 are in a sense pose a 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:28.360
 gentlemen we be school camp ya a 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.980
 thing that pursues us the lawyer and there 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.930
 down so the cow and usually go 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.400
 it awakens the battle we did 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.040
 the test that went on there I can not 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.540
 not move and hunting mode 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.960
 take off and flew over him 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.970
 to see if it's the same as soon as you 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.440
 are so detect at almost in the 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.110
 desert there are no cameras everywhere 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.900
 the you are there there they come and 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.850
 like down there you sleep for 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.990
 see what the fact is he remembered and he 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:05.310
 will there be more than that there there 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:07.050
 comes the army trials here we 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.800
 find the plate see a camera 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.610
 operate 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.580
 it is it does not mean to film in the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.920
 zone and shea we can find it 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.010
 in the reports of the 50 line zone 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.270
 low hockey led by movies leroy 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.120
 so all the way down the control tower 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.600
 in the control tower there is a hall 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.420
 of class 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.100
 sorry my call under skype so that 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.100
 as in area 51 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.700
 we can observe that there are three 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.560
 towers control this mandate but the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.080
 reportage 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.650
 so that's after 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.900
 so we have the mountains around that 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.160
 make me think that zone 51 to a 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.490
 ratio tied at 5 gt 1 5 wanted 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.750
 reproduce area 51 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.550
 then we take something that 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.730
 I will show you the cabins where 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.280
 live the employees so from a 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.510
 moment in the years 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.980
 50 and 60 so there was living there in 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.830
 the old huts they have little 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.980
 so it happened so that there is 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.390
 a titan at the airport so it was happening 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.870
 in plane 2 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.819
 las vegas so there for the ola for us 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.909
 it's a titan but at least it was 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:31.560
 limit like air france volumes there 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:33.299
 for that then after they 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.609
 arrived he was landing in the area 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.700
 51 to work they leave and the 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.739
 sources here is in area 51 of 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.900
 test planes etc 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.670
 here we will find who builds 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.090
 weapons we have 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:53.540
 I here we still find the area 51 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:58.590
 here at half-mast in the state of nevada 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.980
 otherwise we still find a weapon again 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.980
 a weapon 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:08.070
 - American flags I thought about 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.540
 area 51 eric lux and america 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.710
 here we find missing the plate he 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.260
 should know that when they were in 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.090
 meeting is not allowed to film 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.560
 to have something to write all 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.600
 were in their quest they had to 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.090
 remember everything and no one was talking to each other 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.220
 between themselves from outside the base 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.150
 no one talked to each other about their 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.350
 families should not know that you 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.750
 are working in the region 51 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.160
 I like reportage where the guy said to his 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.810
 woman every night who repairs bedridden 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.930
 so we do the job of 51 years have 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.720
 stalled after I told you 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:46.950
 the story of bob lazare so bob lazare 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:50.880
 so not fallen in 1989 everything switches for 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:54.450
 the area 51 9 51 was secret until 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.750
 however, there is only carbo 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:00.110
 blazer just baroud they 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.090
 sway all that is on the area 51 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.010
 so here seemingly ignored work 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.530
 are enemies and said that the 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.790
 sheds as we can find at 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.790
 military base 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:15.660
 three hangars three big shed world in 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:18.330
 1 51 point to 10 times plus three years guys 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.930
 1 opened by chance like the 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.990
 describes blazers in what he tells and 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.890
 the other forms deviation 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.890
 they say we 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:35.510
 So here I show you a trick them 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:37.400
 so be careful sir our attention 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:42.230
 classes and the bunker like area 51 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:44.420
 contains undergrounds here also the 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.940
 except we can not access it we search 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.940
 always how to do but even a good 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.650
 glitch forward to breach 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.750
 a non-textured idea there is nothing 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.390
 soft it's like drinking the law 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.860
 so here's what I'm going to do 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:02.300
 it is to him to fester for you 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:05.440
 to show the cabano of employees or 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.440
 work in zone 5 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.760
 this is lake 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.290
 so here we have the houses before 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.900
 it was caravans genres and 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.440
 studios caravan studios 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.120
 hollywood 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.260
 that was it here sometimes there are young people 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.320
 who train etc 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.490
 you can see if you want in the 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.840
 military base with the police in the 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.110
 naming the eight o'clock does not pull you 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.550
 above 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:40.640
 you can see people who 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:42.790
 train here finally short this is it 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:47.150
 everything I had to say 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:51.740
 so the base the base so I forgot to 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:54.620
 say is called greenlight so and I 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.630
 you say allah bassam of bosmelet them 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.800
 can we call it zone 51 all 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.150
 just because she's hunting world 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.850
 maps would divide 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.400
 every dial so we called that 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:08.150
 frames 1 on the maps and 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.669
 the frame numbered and so his wishes 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:16.040
 surrounding area 51 and the frame at 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:16.550
 on the map where the bloom lake base is 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.580
 situated 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.160
 his name is this one 50 years is 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.560
 long 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.460
 51 surrounding the base this is what we 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:28.890
 call the base area 51 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.810
 so I think I finished tuba 

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.370
 I hope you enjoy it mom is 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.730
