 ok now let's take it to m 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.459
 this machine to reproduce what we have 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.170
 makes the project interest are hot the 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.980
 moment 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.980

 we love it 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.930
 not easy to know its temperature 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.300
 this 30th she wash and a little bit more 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.930
 populated where 58.5 Greek 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.610
 so the spells with others they 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.960
 arrive here 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.980
 the milk contains two brothers have the 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.550
 point here 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.100
 we take 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.500
 or because puyehue is called 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.790
 tonic and the aftermath of a big 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.820
 respect for the role just the time she 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.760
 is the 1st time 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:28.330
 and two days and pulled out reminds the 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:33.450
 Dairy times what do you want me 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.450
 returns e.g. Hubert noise 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.949
 because in the earth 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.799
 flush the gabon of her 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:44.320
 I complain more beautiful province 

00:05:41.799 --> 00:05:46.770
 I was there 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.770
 absolutely 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.169
 on the sound of products the tickets just 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.169
 beside 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:01.290
 now how
