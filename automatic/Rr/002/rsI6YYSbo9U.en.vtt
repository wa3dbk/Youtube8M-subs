00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 so now let's move on to ckoi 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.370
 this is phase 6 I thought count and 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.450
 that so in fact we worked 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.429
 tanks it's a year old at brooke east 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:19.289
 okay and now you can at 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.869
 go back to exercise number 12 where he goes 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.789
 give you three fingers in advance 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.560
 so in fact it's going to be more complicated 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.560
 that because we look and space 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.710
 noori makes the most sense 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.620
 and knew and the other rights to nino 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.200
 hot neighboring rights play the 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.440
 third some he plays with a little 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.590
 guys like that they know it's going 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.980
 work all at once and control 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.650
 on the fingers blocked and control over 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.870
 the fingers who has to play at the same time 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.750
 with the gaps so in fact it's a 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:07.070
 exercise nor extraordinary exercise 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.990
 number 12 may before attacking this 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.170
 exercise you must first be well 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.220
 heated and you must have already worked 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.220
 every finger is rotten no 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.350
 Oh 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.710
 which is very important in 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.210
 brown exercises you have to sing 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.210
 really sing big it's your right 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.020
 we 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.650
 you will also mark what the 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.100
 romantic composers 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.130
 it avoids more than 100 kg 1 the jacket 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.390
 on the black keys because in the 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.899
 romantic music you can not do 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.290
 other 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.520
 then the classic fingering two hernias 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.640
 and no longer valid 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.980
 and if we play all the fingers on all 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.980
 the keys and that's what will you 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.350
 know that's how you learn to 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.200
 sigean things and after exercise 12 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.370
 this option you go to exercise 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.910
 number 13 or in innsbruck first and 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.940
 second 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.060
 it makes you play with your fingers 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.270
 remain the 3-4-5 its mass look like 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.270
 it
