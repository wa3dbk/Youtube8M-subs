00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.290
 christmas tac I told you that 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.969

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.670
 as I share appear of things in 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.740
 this moment with you I wanted of course 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.789
 share this list with you I am 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.470
 I'm told it could give you some 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.240
 small ideas so for you or to offer 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.920
 it 'll be nice so if you want 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.390
 to know the gifts I loved 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.670
 receive for Christmas I invite you to 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.840
 watch the video so it's gone 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.859
 against I warn you right now 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.360
 are not the gifts that I'm going 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.770
 to receive Christmas we do not know all 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.270
 gifts but it's really small 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.309
 ideas so to give you ideas 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.930
 but here and then if my loved ones here 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.820
 by that you never know it's a little 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.930
 message so here is the first 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.360
 thing I chose girls so 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.309
 it's an iphone case that recharges 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.960
 also with an integrated charger 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.950
 I think it's super convenient because 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.120
 that me every time I go out I 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.430
 am always good to lug around with 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.510
 my long iphone charge because they 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.309
 are discharging all the time and I think 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.660
 that's the case for you too and I 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.780
 all the time obliged to load it so 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.800
 in the middle of the day if not my battery 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.480
 finished so here I think it can 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.820
 to be hyper useful I could carry 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.290
 everywhere my famous phone me I am 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.330
 to take instagram I 'm addicted to 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.680
 facebook etc and of course when i use 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.119
 all these applications that are discharged 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.700
 hyper fast you want I think it 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.259
 could be awesome super useful and I 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.580
 not think it too much too expensive so a 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.650
 radar gift that I would very much like 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.060
 a lot to see form of l in second 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.860
 the girls I chose the candles so 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.970
 i know all the youtube bezons 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.650

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.270
 youtube buzz to not have candles 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.710
 so I would really like a candle 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.090
 Finally, several also home 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.439
 yankee kandel people wanted them 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.549
 last it was super complicated to 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.869
 to receive and so on 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.100
 I did not want to order 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.020
 had told me that there was some about paris 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.729

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.049
 closer so the shot I have no 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.460
 candles so I would love to have 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.780
 especially since I know that 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.579
 moment they make little smell or 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.130
 at yankee candles with very very 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.119
 good scents for Christmas I remember 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.740
 the more I think there are scents 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.689
 marshmallow and that's learning from 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.100
 things that are hyper hyper good that are 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.909
 also clean so odors 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.499

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.880
 vinh and I would love to have full 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:58.890

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.289
 especially when the tour is in full swing 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.849
 cocooning day and so on I find 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.650
 that it's very hot that I would like 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.690

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.250
 fourth gift this time so 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.959
 I would love to have a map

 in terms of make up at any time 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.040
 flow gaulle and I have never enough there 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.079
 I think to learn from small 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.879
 small powder from bobby brown so 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.299
 super super good so highlighter 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.069
 etc. 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.900
 I have lots of ideas in mind I get tired 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.760
 never ever go shopping at 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.019
 sephora so I think a good map 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.730
 gift it would not be bad too 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.099
 then in fifth position the cities 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.170
 and so chooses 2g victoria scrubs 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.790
 Shebab's secret or in any world body 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.530
 simply because I have more and that 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.390
 I love the scents I greatly 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.530
 really crazy I have more is the 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.000
 rise that I do so I add of 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.200
 water and I try to make sure that 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.849
 it's still because I love 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.400
 really that I had ordered on the 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.440
 v ina.fr website and I think I'm going 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.209
 reorder order but if ever my 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.859
 sister or friend or whoever 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.180
 passed by there know that I would love 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.599
 have milks scrubs for the 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.549
 body 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.200
 here are all the small ranges like that 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.299
 I also like small gel 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.709
 antibacterial chemaf and body works 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.660
 who are really very very good with 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.919
 small scents super nice I 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.599
 believe that you have a little bit left in my 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.609
 dressing but I like to see my little 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.840
 stock so that too that would make me hyper 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.459
 fun for Christmas 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.500
 then challenge in sixth position I 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.389
 chose beauty products so for 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.069
 the shower at home with the cat 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.750
 yves rock or from lush I like 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.160
 a lot very much that but really I 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.540
 believe that for all those who love 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.459
 cocooning days like me it's 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.440
 really the best of the best is the must 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.510
 so here to take candy with 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.530
 nice little products I saw 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.239
 in this moment especially there are some 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.530
 absolutely beautiful collections I 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.200
 I went past her body shop 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.489
 and unfortunately 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.020
 I did not have time to stop for 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.879
 to see that more closely but to 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.260
 Christmas collections super super pretty 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.370
 so I'd like to have some 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.620
 pretty christmas boxes 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.420
 so if someone goes through there think about it 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.830
 then in seventh position then there 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.660
 it's the best of the best it's something 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.430
 which I discovered on instagram and that 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.920
 I find absolutely beautiful on his 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.390
 great to pour selphy by car 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.950
 so I think it's really classy it's 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.420
 so really boring it's a 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.730
 pink mirror as you want to see on 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.900
 the photo that really makes it possible to succeed 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.519
 her wings girl since we have a mirror 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.410
 right in front of us we hold it as 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.090
 these and it takes super nice 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.340
 pictures anyway I think and that's 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.000
 hyper girly her roses it's flashy it's 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.200
 super pretty 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.579
 so I personally would like 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.510
 a lot tested after you tell me in 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.040
 comments what do you think 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.300
 but I think it's really 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.020
 cannon and it's a very very beautiful 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.580
 innovation 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.410
 so I hope I have them too 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.580
 for Christmas and to finish the girls 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.870
 I would love to have a bag 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.490
 for my macbook because it's true 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.540
 that I carry a lot a lot in 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.340
 this moment so every time I 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.750
 displacements I carry it 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.310
 and unfortunately I do not really know 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.570
 what do you think I have a bag but who 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.190
 is not two years old so I would like 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.540
 a lot to have something for the 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.650
 carry even to put it in 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.240
 shoulder strap I think it's hyper 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.560
 practical because in my purse 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.940
 you can imagine that he does not fit 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.740
 not at all so I would like a lot 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.300
 having a very practical bag is 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.770
 also a hull because I had 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.840
 a hull all pink or ai showed 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.440
 in a very very old videos on 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.240
 Youtube 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.400
 and that's sega so that's me 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.960
 just disgusted I have the front hull but 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.210
 I do not have the back shell in fact it's 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.620
 really exploded I had ordered it on 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.120
 amazon is so here I would like 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.500
 have a new pink hull because 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.450
 I find that hyper girly I think 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.080
 it's super nice to customize and 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.210
 so 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.830
 so I'd like to see my macbook again 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.600
 all in pink so I hope the father 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.800
 Christmas will think to have for that and always 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.940
 with the levy bags I would like 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.590
 many have a satchel for my 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.120
 reflex this time because I'm going 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.910
 carry around quite often i'm going to do 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.350
 a lot of outdoor look book so 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.610
 there I think that really a bag this 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.349
 would be the best of the best because I have 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.820
 not at all and then I'm going to buy a 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.740
 camera still a lot more expensive 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.780
 and I really think I need a 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.490
 bag because I think otherwise I 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.349
 am going to blow it up and I'm going to cry 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.430
 so that would be great too for 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:41.080
 protect my 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.340
 my camera because right now 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.510
 I put it in my bag I put 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.520
 really anywhere I put it in 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.680
 sachets and that's it does not do too much 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.420
 I think it will explode for a moment or 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.680
 to another to avoid that he exposes to a 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.450
 moment when one of them I think it 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.040
 when I will be really good so 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.270
 here and so here is edima video is 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.320
