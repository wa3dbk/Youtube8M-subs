 you can either use the s video cable 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:31.580
 that connect or with the snails as 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.780

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.090
 next we need another 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.660
 normal edition staeck connection with 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.870
 the fans on one side and on the 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.690
 others and the scart connection of the 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.070
 because that we from the tv on the 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.810
 laptop gets a signal looks like this 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.810
 there are once a regulator for input 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.660

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.850
 So now I'll show you how 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:21.050
 I all links so that a ye 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:24.200
 Signal on laptop carries her links 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:30.260
 the usb grammer with the jeans plug 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:34.250
 and with the scart connection it is for 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.280
 since we are watching TV on the laptop 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.320
 a signal gets open with it 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.300
 while he can play and jump on 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.950
 The laptop could be considered as 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.320
 Next we take the snack 3 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:57.799
 playstation rectangles put them purely 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:01.760
 and cinch cable connects you to yours 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.610
 tv with the tv either 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.780
 could take over scart or her 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.710
 beautiful jacks left but one 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.479
 TV 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.239
 you can carry her hers 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.940
 there we take the video grabber and the 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.760
 scart connection and stuck in the squad 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.050
 finish with you in the television and 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.800
 the video advertiser in your laptop of it 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:30.420
 grad in the end in your television and 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.660
 the video grabber in the laptop in the 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.959
 laptop and the july link lamp lit up 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.090
 then turn on the playstation 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:44.040
 and get a picture on the tv 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.850
 Now we open the program 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.420
 the program 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:52.650
 that looks like horner state 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.310
 vs to dvd then it's just one 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.450
 attitude thing who clicks on 4 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.160
 the right case bypasses the device 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.530
 the video said from tv 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.989
 Getting laptops with me was like that 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.319
 that I had a black and white picture 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.380
 first then I'm on the wheels 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.549
 gone on control 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.470
 here you can for example with spd 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.989
 pds wanted to make over s video must you 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:27.060
 click on it then opens 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:31.319
 another window and stood with me as 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.260
 i could first explain ntc of her 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:38.130
 pressed on palm and confirmed 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.250
 so that comes in color so take now 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:48.030
 I'll show you the playoffs 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:52.139
 the teachers and you do not look around 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.840
 clique the signal is on a laptop 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.500
 I hope the video has failed until 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.989
 soon 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.989
