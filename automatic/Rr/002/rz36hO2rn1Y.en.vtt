him I wouldn't do that this is just the

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.849 
him I wouldn't do that this is just the
glitch<00:04:13.220> you<00:04:14.060> probably<00:04:14.389> know<00:04:14.720> from<00:04:14.750> fifa<00:04:15.440> 11<00:04:15.500> as

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
glitch you probably know from fifa 11 as

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.060 
glitch you probably know from fifa 11 as
well<00:04:16.130> um<00:04:16.959> sometimes<00:04:17.959> this<00:04:18.139> happens<00:04:18.380> on<00:04:18.799> the

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
well um sometimes this happens on the

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.870 
well um sometimes this happens on the
web<00:04:19.280> app<00:04:19.489> and<00:04:19.760> I<00:04:20.049> don't<00:04:21.049> know<00:04:21.229> why<00:04:21.530> he<00:04:21.880> doesn't

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
web app and I don't know why he doesn't

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.909 
web app and I don't know why he doesn't
manage<00:04:23.210> to<00:04:23.419> sort<00:04:23.690> that<00:04:23.810> out<00:04:23.870> that's<00:04:24.349> quite<00:04:24.830> an

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
manage to sort that out that's quite an

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.200 
manage to sort that out that's quite an
annoying<00:04:25.220> glitch<00:04:25.460> in<00:04:25.700> my<00:04:25.849> pain

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
annoying glitch in my pain

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.210 
annoying glitch in my pain
and<00:04:26.360> I<00:04:26.569> think<00:04:26.750> they<00:04:27.199> definitely<00:04:27.350> should<00:04:27.740> work

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
and I think they definitely should work

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.909 
and I think they definitely should work
on<00:04:28.550> preventing<00:04:29.270> this<00:04:29.419> move<00:04:30.169> back<00:04:30.410> to<00:04:30.560> Naldo

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
on preventing this move back to Naldo

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.159 
on preventing this move back to Naldo
mapping<00:04:31.850> he's<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:32.270> really<00:04:32.539> good<00:04:32.690> sent<00:04:32.960> it<00:04:33.050> back

mapping he's a really good sent it back

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.439 
mapping he's a really good sent it back
and<00:04:33.380> if<00:04:33.470> you<00:04:33.560> have<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.770> coins<00:04:34.039> for<00:04:34.340> him<00:04:34.550> for<00:04:35.150> a

him in the 4222 formation as you can see
on<00:04:51.319> the<00:04:51.410> card<00:04:51.620> and<00:04:52.490> he's<00:04:52.639> got<00:04:52.819> 76<00:04:53.449> in<00:04:53.690> face<00:04:53.960> and

on the card and he's got 76 in face and
in<00:04:54.440> shooting<00:04:54.889> which<00:04:55.069> is<00:04:55.340> quite<00:04:55.819> solid

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
in shooting which is quite solid

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.990 
in shooting which is quite solid
actually<00:04:56.630> in<00:04:56.780> this<00:04:56.900> game<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.139> think<00:04:57.340> then<00:04:58.340> 82<00:04:58.970> in

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
actually in this game I think then 82 in

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.570 
actually in this game I think then 82 in
passing<00:04:59.599> 87<00:05:00.380> dribbling<00:05:00.770> I<00:05:00.919> believe<00:05:01.310> he<00:05:01.460> has

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
passing 87 dribbling I believe he has

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.230 
passing 87 dribbling I believe he has
got<00:05:01.789> four<00:05:02.090> star<00:05:02.360> skill<00:05:02.599> moves<00:05:02.870> only<00:05:03.400> so<00:05:04.400> if<00:05:05.030> you

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
got four star skill moves only so if you

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.150 
got four star skill moves only so if you
don't<00:05:05.479> need<00:05:05.720> a<00:05:05.750> five-star<00:05:06.440> still<00:05:06.710> lack<00:05:06.889> and

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
don't need a five-star still lack and

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.920 
don't need a five-star still lack and
your<00:05:07.430> scent<00:05:07.759> attacking<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.270> field<00:05:08.479> position

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
your scent attacking the field position

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.830 
your scent attacking the field position
if<00:05:09.080> you're<00:05:09.289> going<00:05:09.470> for<00:05:09.800> a<00:05:10.210> Brazil<00:05:11.210> squad<00:05:11.539> for

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
if you're going for a Brazil squad for

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.409 
if you're going for a Brazil squad for
example<00:05:12.320> then<00:05:13.190> ego<00:05:13.669> is<00:05:13.789> a<00:05:13.820> really<00:05:14.120> good<00:05:14.210> choice

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
example then ego is a really good choice

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.180 
example then ego is a really good choice
actually<00:05:14.720> and<00:05:15.139> I<00:05:15.259> believe<00:05:15.560> his<00:05:15.800> free-kick

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
actually and I believe his free-kick

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.629 
actually and I believe his free-kick
start<00:05:16.610> very<00:05:16.789> good<00:05:16.940> as<00:05:17.060> well<00:05:17.919> and<00:05:18.919> finally<00:05:19.460> on

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
start very good as well and finally on

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.659 
start very good as well and finally on
the<00:05:19.820> first<00:05:20.060> place<00:05:20.360> this<00:05:20.599> week<00:05:20.900> and<00:05:21.199> another

formation 79 in pace which is really

pretty<00:05:41.539> solid<00:05:41.870> as<00:05:41.960> well<00:05:42.169> so<00:05:42.860> you<00:05:43.000> can't<00:05:44.000> just

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
pretty solid as well so you can't just
