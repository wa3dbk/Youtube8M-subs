00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 so we're going to have a weird one that lets us monitor his house 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.670
 celebration is in this announcement a mechanism that will ensure the engineering and 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.760
 vote buying 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.460
 the afssaps had raised doubts this is the fantasy of the man this 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.000
 year the fantasy of the man cedh happen maybe to control everything a 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.370
 day at the top of his couch 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.160
 it's called home automation so it's been around for years 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.949
 in the game to open his 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.300
 his his garage the distance 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.960
 Segolene get started 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.810
 the remote TV the gas heating in all that there is the idea 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.699
 it is to help its excesses not too expensive because for the moment it exists 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.900
 opposite is rather a month so it's very very difficult to have the 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.750
 the domotic game croatia uruguay is very very very expensive 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.320
 but the idea is to say like today many many homes 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.230
 are equipped with borssele 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.510
 the arrival to control everything or coming from home via internet 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.539
 that is to say to be able to control his house 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.850
 sincerely it's a small convoy convoy box appeared to be related to his 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.149
 sarah his boxing 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.629
 for a ter 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.379
 and it's the brain who vote against Iran if you buy the elements 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.030
 wanted to control your home is critiquable rare 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.120
 she is exhausted 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.719
 you will be able from your computer or you will be watching if there is any 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.900
 was created in car laboratories to which the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.759
 north-west while the seat of a name but on which we can then really 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.920
 to sierre and lausanne so know the house but you too are 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.650
 warned on alert 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.650
 % and if ever there were cameras everywhere at the cgslb but if that's it 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.290
 what I want is to simply play other things or renew 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.900
 my parking remotely things like that winter sexa democratizes 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.280
 completely home automation and we can choose what we do not know him 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.620
 instead of making huge trench at home for master parades everywhere 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.300
 because everything is in the semifinals we agree film the idea is not bad because 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.390
 that it's for everyone 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.060
 asked that everyone can their home what they want to do 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.920
 at the level of home automation 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.100
 because you made a film that we've shown you we knew 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.490
 here you know it will allow me to do 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.490
 no I did not want the role I do not like 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.070
 because all the radio crews actually communicate with the sensors 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.090
 wireless 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.960
 ii then thanks to a small application that were made on your 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.180
 pc extremely simple way that in recent years it's completely 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.950
 false has spoken that he is offline 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.139
 he has the possibility then from a distance 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.289
 thanks to his phone thanks to the internet the power 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:15.399
 to receive alerts in real time its users that he decided to 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:17.799
 receive sms filmed 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.729
 hence the voice call so we are completely free of management 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:23.589
 and we will even be able to create scenarios 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:26.849
 very simple allowing for example to simulate a presence in ag 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.919
 the gap with the heating for example that at a distance 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.739
 in the wait of a box 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.199
 waxed loafers in the basic package 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:41.430
 mounted on security 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.429
 with the possibility for the user of giuly 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:47.769
 all of the accessories fire detector chest a detector of 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:48.339
 smoke 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:51.659
 open detectors of energy consumption criteria 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.219
 we have a rotating camera 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:55.709
 but you will power and internet telephony was able 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.719
 to see at home time on 360-degree tour what's going on 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.719
 exactly done around the chef 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:03.690
 we also damaged 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.179
 a small sim card 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:06.120
 inside 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.530
 and then also the shaking crisis which makes our competitor 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.839
 electricity at home 

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:12.559
 we can not continue to give ourselves the opportunity with your phones to 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:16.129
 see from a distance and keep the face completely secure from 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.129
 home for quite a few hours 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.439
 a cousin know what's happening in real time 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.650
 sixty others to go through an intermediary - you need to know 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.629
 in 99 6% of cases we talk about false alarms 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.259
 in 5% of cases 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:36.959
 come on call you on the high cell phone 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.119
 and in addition in 100% of cases only the police and military authorities a 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.339
 women 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:42.419
 Warning 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.659
 this is an all-penetrating penetration test was detected in 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.629
 ultimately reducing this whole chain we come first to reduce 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.519
 our costs and are processed by servers the information in real time 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.519
 he did not do anything but it's really free 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.989
 and it is well we must know the thief had caught in the act 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:02.949
 he had said 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:06.510
 they will want to read you know it's still a little bit hidden 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.870
 but what's good is in the smoke detector because it was 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.949
 used water hootsuite 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.299
 it's the same with an old skin and reinstalling itself the sweet weather and 6 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.949
 mpi we will drink but we must rebroadcast the law nome 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.090
 it sounds like a gift to stop the goal and then to according to your means you 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.259
 buy skype and especially your desires you have brains I would say 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:28.159
 and threw us down the most active cities in those words you have

 need there's app for them to detect nearby handsome kids have them 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.909
 also had pressed to cheseaux arrival on the potato 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:39.029
 that's why it was done with the vote only participated to the right
