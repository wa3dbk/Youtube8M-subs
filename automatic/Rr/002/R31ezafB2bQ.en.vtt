00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.380
 friends returning home with a chub 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.660
 fishing, I decided to call on the river where 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.669
 main white predator instead of chub 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.669
 is i prefers to hold on 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:25.050
 near bridge piers 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:28.559
 flooded trees that is approximately 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.989
 same places as the chub and 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:32.219
 at this time of the year in spring he prefers 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.579
 as well as chub 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.820
 small wobblers in shape like 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.309
 mine on the rivers rarely meet on his 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.089
 the roads are hard rock and not abundant 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.789
 rolls 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:48.059
 Great place to catch a white predator 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.370
 will bridge the remains of construction debris 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.829
 and piles of the bridge are artificial 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.339
 Tarikatam and the plot below abounds 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.249
 jets and a little but promising 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:02.670
 is the plot not only not wife above 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:06.500
 the bridge is optimally located meters in 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.119
 fifteen twenty above its bridge and 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.979
 throwing a wobbler under the opposite 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.869
 Coast 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.939
 post it to demolish so 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.790
 so he turned around just coming 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.979
 to bridge piers 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.369
 such fishing involves a large number 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.689
 hooks but often she is very justified 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.689
 let's see this 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.120
 raisins on the site 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.420
 and 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.879
 not 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.569
 set aside 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.330
 don't lift battery 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.670
 an important factor in the success of catching a predator 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.709
 even in the correct perspective 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.909
 the location is correct 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.939
 positioning 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:34.609
 often we ignore the top 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:36.709
 rolling round meticulously 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:40.400
 lower part where are abundantly present 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.090
 return water jet edge also tend 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.840
 anglers 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:48.069
 fish carefully the area below the bridge 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.109
 ignoring the plot above yes such a catch 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:54.549
 fraught with a large number of hooks 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.549
 believe it is worth it 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:38.379
 Yes 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.979
 need to leave is 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.530
 right from the support you can 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.740
 sins are sleeping 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:37.740
 beauty
