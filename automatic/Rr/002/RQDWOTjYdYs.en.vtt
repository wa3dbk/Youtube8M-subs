going to be in a band dad you know but
the<00:00:59.820> funny<00:01:00.000> thing<00:01:00.059> was<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.539> books<00:01:00.750> about<00:01:00.870> that

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079

generational<00:01:01.620> change<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.980> know<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> 60s

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
generational change you know in the 60s

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.899 
generational change you know in the 60s
until<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.930> sixties<00:01:04.350> young<00:01:04.890> men<00:01:05.129> want<00:01:05.880> to

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
become their fathers then come a 60s

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.980 
become their fathers then come a 60s
anything<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:08.970> their<00:01:09.150> fathers<00:01:09.479> there<00:01:09.840> was<00:01:09.930> a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
anything but their fathers there was a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.070 
anything but their fathers there was a
big<00:01:10.170> left<00:01:10.409> turn<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:10.890> us<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.189> think<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.930> in<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
big left turn for us I think in in the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.200 
big left turn for us I think in in the
UK<00:01:13.439> socially<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.280> stuff<00:01:14.670> like<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.060> think

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
UK socially and stuff like that I think

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.910 
UK socially and stuff like that I think
that<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> books<00:01:15.840> kind<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.259> covers<00:01:16.830> that

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
that the books kind of covers that

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.890 
that the books kind of covers that
generational<00:01:17.430> change<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:18.000> what's<00:01:18.509> really<00:01:18.720> love

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900

about him even though he had a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.530 
about him even though he had a

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
lifestyles I think his father had had

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.030 
lifestyles I think his father had had
more<00:04:04.910> problems<00:04:05.330> with<00:04:05.600> BA<00:04:05.810> than<00:04:06.140> my<00:04:06.470> father<00:04:06.710> was

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
more problems with BA than my father was
