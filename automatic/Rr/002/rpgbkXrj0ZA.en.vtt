that's<00:00:42.450> what<00:00:42.600> I'm<00:00:42.750> going<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.930> be<00:00:42.989> talking

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260

find when there's no supervision and
most<00:00:49.440> dogs<00:00:49.800> will<00:00:49.950> learn<00:00:50.250> quickly<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:51.059> if

most dogs will learn quickly that if

most dogs will learn quickly that if
they<00:00:51.360> make<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.960> their<00:00:52.170> crate<00:00:52.410> they<00:00:52.680> will

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
they make it in their crate they will

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.279 
they make it in their crate they will
have<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.219> sit<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:54.030> most<00:00:54.780> dogs<00:00:55.110> are

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
have to sit in it as most dogs are

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.290 
have to sit in it as most dogs are
fairly<00:00:55.559> high<00:00:55.890> genic<00:00:56.219> they<00:00:57.120> will

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
fairly high genic they will

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.479 
fairly high genic they will
instinctively<00:00:57.750> hold<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.770> until<00:00:58.800> they<00:00:59.309> let

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
instinctively hold it in until they let

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.939 
instinctively hold it in until they let
out<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.730> their<00:01:00.090> crate<00:01:00.649> provided<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.770> don't

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
out of their crate provided you don't

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.039 
out of their crate provided you don't
leave<00:01:02.219> them<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.579> there<00:01:02.730> too<00:01:02.969> long<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.390> course<00:01:03.420> I

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
leave them in there too long of course I

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.620 
leave them in there too long of course I
would<00:01:04.830> say<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.250> maximum<00:01:05.790> time<00:01:06.030> for<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> dog<00:01:06.600> to

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
would say the maximum time for a dog to

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.390 
would say the maximum time for a dog to
be<00:01:06.869> left<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.290> his<00:01:07.470> crate<00:01:07.830> during<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> day

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
be left in his crate during the day

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.750 
be left in his crate during the day
should<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.510> about<00:01:09.630> two<00:01:10.170> hours<00:01:10.760> obviously

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
should be about two hours obviously

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.219 
should be about two hours obviously
during<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> night<00:01:12.570> when<00:01:12.900> they're<00:01:13.080> sleeping

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
during the night when they're sleeping

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.240 
during the night when they're sleeping
it<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:13.860> be<00:01:14.040> longer<00:01:14.820> but<00:01:15.509> during<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> day<00:01:16.350> two

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
it can be longer but during the day two

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.219 
it can be longer but during the day two
hours<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.729> really<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> maximum<00:01:18.720> amount<00:01:18.869> of

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
hours is really the maximum amount of

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.020 
hours is really the maximum amount of
time<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.390> how<00:01:21.810> do<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.110> choose<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.439> crate<00:01:23.030> it's

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
time so how do you choose a crate it's

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.999 
time so how do you choose a crate it's
obviously<00:01:24.509> more<00:01:24.810> cost-effective<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.860> to

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
obviously more cost-effective you to

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.590 
obviously more cost-effective you to
choose<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> crate<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.759> big<00:01:27.000> enough<00:01:27.299> for<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
choose a crate this big enough for the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.679 
choose a crate this big enough for the
dog<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.869> grow<00:01:28.229> into<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.710> possible<00:01:29.630> so<00:01:30.630> it

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
dog to grow into it possible so it

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.480 
dog to grow into it possible so it
should<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:30.869> big<00:01:31.140> enough<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> adult<00:01:32.250> dog

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
should be big enough for the adult dog

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.550 
should be big enough for the adult dog
to<00:01:32.759> stand<00:01:33.030> up<00:01:33.240> comfortably<00:01:33.810> without

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
to stand up comfortably without

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.700 
to stand up comfortably without
crouching<00:01:35.250> turn<00:01:36.150> around<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.020> stretch<00:01:37.380> out

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
crouching turn around in and stretch out

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.039 
crouching turn around in and stretch out
but<00:01:38.040> no<00:01:38.189> bigger<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:39.150> don't<00:01:39.360> want<00:01:39.509> him<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.750> use

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
but no bigger you don't want him to use

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.230 
but no bigger you don't want him to use
one<00:01:40.320> part<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.950> bed<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.790> other<00:01:41.909> part

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
one part of this bed and the other part

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.139 
one part of this bed and the other part
of<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.570> toilet<00:01:43.189> because<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.369> adult<00:01:44.670> dog<00:01:44.970> is

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
of this toilet because the adult dog is

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.090 
of this toilet because the adult dog is
likely<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:45.689> considerably<00:01:46.619> larger<00:01:47.070> than

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
likely to be considerably larger than

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.969 
likely to be considerably larger than
the<00:01:47.369> puppy<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:49.140> usually<00:01:49.439> going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.860> be

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
the puppy and it's usually going to be

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.160 
the puppy and it's usually going to be
necessary<00:01:50.189> for<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.000> use<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> barrier<00:01:51.840> to

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
necessary for you to use a barrier to

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.469 
necessary for you to use a barrier to
reduce<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.890> internal<00:01:53.430> size<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.000> cranked

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
reduce the internal size of the cranked

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.039 
reduce the internal size of the cranked

you can use a wire grill or board to do
this<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.560> fine<00:01:58.890> whilst<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.549> puppy<00:01:59.969> once

so<00:02:13.160> how<00:02:13.520> do<00:02:13.580> you<00:02:13.880> create<00:02:14.120> rain<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:15.650> crate

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
so how do you create rain and crate

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.400 
so how do you create rain and crate
training<00:02:16.460> basically<00:02:17.120> works<00:02:17.330> like<00:02:17.510> this<00:02:17.870> your

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
training basically works like this your
