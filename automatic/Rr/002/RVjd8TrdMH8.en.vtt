00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
a cloth reactor and tedious Paxman so

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.700 
a cloth reactor and tedious Paxman so
right<00:00:32.640> from<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.880> little<00:00:33.149> quiet<00:00:33.440> night<00:00:34.440> time

guess we're going to have a club fall

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.440 
guess we're going to have a club fall
onto<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:42.079> teapot<00:00:43.160> kind<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.250> like<00:00:44.430> Ted<00:00:44.760> museum<00:00:45.329> or

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
onto a teapot kind of like Ted museum or

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.200 
onto a teapot kind of like Ted museum or
something<00:00:46.070> ok<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.129> first<00:00:47.519> we'll<00:00:47.730> start<00:00:47.910> off<00:00:48.089> by

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
something ok so first we'll start off by

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.840 
something ok so first we'll start off by
making<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.600> ground<00:00:48.809> control<00:00:49.710> click<00:00:50.460> drag

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
making the ground control click drag

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.549 
making the ground control click drag
make<00:00:51.719> an<00:00:51.839> even<00:00:52.079> plane<00:00:52.670> can<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:53.699> our<00:00:53.879> ground<00:00:54.559> and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
make an even plane can be our ground and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.720 
make an even plane can be our ground and
we're<00:00:56.039> going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.190> make<00:00:56.370> bucks<00:00:57.530> make<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.679> even

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
to make it have a little bit physics you

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.270 
to make it have a little bit physics you
know<00:02:15.320> just<00:02:15.590> in<00:02:15.710> case<00:02:15.740> you<00:02:15.980> want<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.130> make<00:02:16.250> a

it we're not going to doing that just
get<00:02:22.250> in<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.400> habit<00:02:22.550> of<00:02:22.730> doing<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:23.270> I<00:02:23.570> keep

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
get in the habit of doing this I keep

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.410 
get in the habit of doing this I keep
leaving<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.320> space<00:02:24.970> all<00:02:25.970> right<00:02:26.180> now<00:02:26.300> we're

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
leaving a space all right now we're

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.080 
leaving a space all right now we're
going<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.600> make<00:02:26.690> our<00:02:26.810> cloth<00:02:27.820> so<00:02:28.820> come<00:02:29.000> over

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
you start learning I'm gonna make it

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.180 
you start learning I'm gonna make it
even<00:02:37.180> again<00:02:38.950> put<00:02:39.950> that<00:02:40.250> big<00:02:40.520> will<00:02:40.700> close<00:02:42.190> we're

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
even again put that big will close we're

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.330 
even again put that big will close we're
going<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.370> move<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.730> up<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.480> over<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.770> teapot

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
going to move it up and over the teapot

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.710 
going to move it up and over the teapot
if<00:02:46.580> you<00:02:46.640> want<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:46.910> fall<00:02:47.150> onto<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.540> teapot<00:02:48.020> and

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
if you want to fall onto the teapot and

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.250 
if you want to fall onto the teapot and
we're<00:02:50.720> going<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:50.960> keep<00:02:51.110> it<00:02:51.260> out<00:02:51.350> of<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.500> shot

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
we're going to keep it out of the shot

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.490 
we're going to keep it out of the shot
so<00:02:54.260> much<00:02:54.410> as<00:02:54.650> we<00:02:54.800> can<00:02:56.140> okay

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
so much as we can okay

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.770 
so much as we can okay
now<00:02:59.100> make<00:02:59.370> sure<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.760> come<00:02:59.910> over<00:03:00.060> here<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.210> the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
now make sure to come over here to the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.950 
now make sure to come over here to the
modifier<00:03:01.230> tab<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.770> give<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.790> good<00:03:03.690> number

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
modifier tab and give it a good number

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.470 
modifier tab and give it a good number
of<00:03:04.340> segments<00:03:06.050> segments<00:03:07.050> matter<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.680> lot<00:03:08.190> in

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
of segments segments matter a lot in

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.560 
of segments segments matter a lot in
cloth<00:03:09.480> modifier<00:03:13.640> so<00:03:14.640> how<00:03:14.760> much<00:03:14.970> it'll<00:03:15.209> Bend

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
cloth modifier so how much it'll Bend

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.890 
cloth modifier so how much it'll Bend
and<00:03:15.959> be<00:03:16.440> realistic<00:03:17.450> kind<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.480> like<00:03:18.690> the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
and be realistic kind of like the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.620 
and be realistic kind of like the
threads<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:21.060> don't<00:03:21.240> want<00:03:21.360> too<00:03:21.540> many<00:03:22.910> so<00:03:23.910> 17

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
threads you don't want too many so 17

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.890 
threads you don't want too many so 17
and<00:03:24.990> 17<00:03:25.320> is<00:03:25.740> good<00:03:26.420> okay<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.480> then<00:03:27.570> come<00:03:27.810> over

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
and 17 is good okay and then come over

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.510 
and 17 is good okay and then come over
here<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:29.250> your<00:03:29.540> bar<00:03:30.540> on<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.050> left<00:03:31.290> click<00:03:32.280> the

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:40.529 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:42.670 

you

and also here you can just click drag

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.590 
and also here you can just click drag
not<00:04:55.789> really<00:04:56.030> working

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.040 

huh

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.249 

so<00:05:03.909> create<00:05:04.909> the<00:05:05.060> animation<00:05:05.210> real<00:05:05.720> quick<00:05:05.960> have

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
so create the animation real quick have

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.940 
so create the animation real quick have
a<00:05:06.319> bigger<00:05:06.530> picture<00:05:06.949> of<00:05:06.979> it

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.430 

so<00:05:11.880> now<00:05:12.030> club<00:05:12.300> does<00:05:12.920> take<00:05:13.920> a<00:05:14.250> while<00:05:14.340> to<00:05:14.760> render

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
so now club does take a while to render

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.140 
so now club does take a while to render
especially<00:05:16.440> in<00:05:16.500> a<00:05:16.560> bigger<00:05:16.860> picture<00:05:17.730> which<00:05:18.030> is

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
especially in a bigger picture which is

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.900 
especially in a bigger picture which is
why<00:05:18.270> you<00:05:18.300> don't<00:05:18.480> want<00:05:18.660> too<00:05:18.930> many<00:05:19.320> segments<00:05:20.070> it

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
why you don't want too many segments it

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.510 
why you don't want too many segments it
will<00:05:21.030> take<00:05:21.180> a<00:05:21.210> lot<00:05:21.450> longer<00:05:21.950> just<00:05:22.950> use<00:05:23.220> as<00:05:23.370> many

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
will take a lot longer just use as many

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.540 
will take a lot longer just use as many
as<00:05:23.760> necessary<00:05:24.120> make<00:05:24.810> it<00:05:24.930> look<00:05:25.080> real<00:05:25.350> don't<00:05:26.280> use

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
as necessary make it look real don't use

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:34.790 
as necessary make it look real don't use
an<00:05:27.150> over<00:05:27.420> exaggerated<00:05:28.970> okay
