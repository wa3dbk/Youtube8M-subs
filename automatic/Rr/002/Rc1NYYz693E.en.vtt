five<00:03:50.050> six<00:03:50.290> hours<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:50.860> wasn't<00:03:51.760> using<00:03:51.880> guns<00:03:52.240> I<00:03:52.570> was

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
five six hours I wasn't using guns I was

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.630 
five six hours I wasn't using guns I was
trying<00:03:53.170> to<00:03:53.200> avoid<00:03:53.350> everything<00:03:53.860> and<00:03:54.190> hide<00:03:54.340> past

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
trying to avoid everything and hide past

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.810 
trying to avoid everything and hide past
everything<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.330> I<00:03:56.080> just<00:03:56.830> wasn't<00:03:57.400> having<00:03:57.550> that

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
everything and I just wasn't having that

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.710 
everything and I just wasn't having that
much<00:03:58.030> fun<00:03:59.520> I'm<00:04:00.520> sure<00:04:00.790> that<00:04:01.150> there<00:04:01.420> are<00:04:01.570> the

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
much fun I'm sure that there are the

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.420 
much fun I'm sure that there are the
opportunity<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:02.350> do<00:04:02.530> a<00:04:02.560> lot<00:04:02.920> of<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.100> areas

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
opportunity to do a lot of the areas

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.979 
opportunity to do a lot of the areas
with<00:04:03.550> stealth<00:04:03.880> because<00:04:04.120> some<00:04:04.300> areas<00:04:04.660> seem<00:04:04.840> to

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
with stealth because some areas seem to

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.780 
with stealth because some areas seem to
suit<00:04:05.140> it<00:04:05.290> better<00:04:05.500> than<00:04:05.680> others<00:04:05.920> but<00:04:06.070> the<00:04:06.610> game

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
suit it better than others but the game

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.640 
suit it better than others but the game
seems<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.300> throw<00:04:07.600> you<00:04:07.660> into<00:04:07.930> situations<00:04:08.140> where

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
seems to throw you into situations where

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.800 
seems to throw you into situations where
it<00:04:09.130> wants<00:04:09.550> you<00:04:09.640> to<00:04:09.790> kill<00:04:10.030> or<00:04:10.300> it<00:04:10.570> at<00:04:10.660> least

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
it wants you to kill or it at least

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.020 
it wants you to kill or it at least
