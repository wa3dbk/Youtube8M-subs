00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
way but i'm considering surrendering and

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.439

releasing<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.039> nation<00:00:23.369> or<00:00:23.460> two<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.910> i'm

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
releasing a nation or two and i'm

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.810 
releasing a nation or two and i'm
thinking<00:00:24.750> as<00:00:25.050> long<00:00:25.230> as<00:00:25.380> they're<00:00:25.560> still<00:00:25.920> if

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
thinking as long as they're still if

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.609 
thinking as long as they're still if
their<00:00:27.000> primary<00:00:27.420> culture<00:00:27.750> if<00:00:27.869> like<00:00:28.199> if<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.500> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
their primary culture if like if it's a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.650 
their primary culture if like if it's a
province<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.250> has<00:00:29.400> my<00:00:29.789> culture<00:00:30.390> as<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
province that has my culture as the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.680 
province that has my culture as the
primary<00:00:30.900> like<00:00:31.260> saying<00:00:31.500> norman<00:00:31.890> i<00:00:32.070> think<00:00:33.059> then

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
primary like saying norman i think then

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.990 
primary like saying norman i think then
I<00:00:34.399> don't<00:00:35.399> think<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:36.059> lose<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.450> course<00:00:37.579> so<00:00:38.579> I'm

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
I don't think we lose the course so I'm

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.030 
I don't think we lose the course so I'm
thinking<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.570> reconquest<00:00:39.989> for<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.469> course<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
thinking a reconquest for of course and

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.280 
thinking a reconquest for of course and
a<00:00:41.129> surrender<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.730> coalition<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.600> just

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
a surrender to the coalition is is just

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.700 
a surrender to the coalition is is just
faster<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.160> easier<00:00:44.750> than<00:00:45.750> trying<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.289> win<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
faster and easier than trying to win the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.930 
faster and easier than trying to win the
coalition<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:48.920> um<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.399> I'm<00:00:50.489> gonna<00:00:50.640> try<00:00:50.820> is

not have course on Norman so that is

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.429 
not have course on Norman so that is
unfortunate<00:01:21.450> but<00:01:22.080> ruse<00:01:22.380> with<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.680> until<00:01:22.979> 78

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
ok so it's 15 years but we could easily

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.289 
ok so it's 15 years but we could easily
take<00:01:28.890> these<00:01:29.070> three<00:01:29.310> back<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:29.909> like<00:01:30.000> really

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
trade and of course Normandy is now free

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.270 
trade and of course Normandy is now free
hmm

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.440 

less<00:01:41.280> less<00:01:42.000> than<00:01:42.240> ideal

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.870 

I<00:01:46.890> wish<00:01:47.890> I<00:01:48.039> knew<00:01:48.159> a<00:01:48.189> little<00:01:48.340> bit<00:01:48.460> more<00:01:48.700> about

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
I wish I knew a little bit more about

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.980 
I wish I knew a little bit more about
like<00:01:49.060> how<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.299> determine<00:01:51.509> C<00:01:52.509> like<00:01:52.659> it<00:01:52.780> shows

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
like how to determine C like it shows

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.990 
like how to determine C like it shows
culture<00:01:53.469> in<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.710> French<00:01:53.920> group<00:01:54.100> moments<00:01:54.640> it's

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
culture in the French group moments it's

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.669 
culture in the French group moments it's
part<00:01:55.270> of<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:55.390> culture<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:56.619> how<00:01:56.770> do<00:01:56.829> you<00:01:56.920> know

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
part of the culture but how do you know

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.880 
part of the culture but how do you know
which<00:01:59.679> one<00:01:59.979> specifically<00:02:00.640> you<00:02:00.850> will<00:02:00.969> not<00:02:01.060> lose

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
which one specifically you will not lose

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.620 
which one specifically you will not lose
primary<00:02:02.890> cultures<00:02:03.159> francium<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:03.970> I<00:02:04.000> guess<00:02:04.210> it

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
primary cultures francium so I guess it

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.789 
primary cultures francium so I guess it
gets<00:02:04.750> just<00:02:04.899> whichever<00:02:05.289> one<00:02:05.409> it<00:02:05.500> says<00:02:05.590> at<00:02:05.740> the

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
gets just whichever one it says at the

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.339 
gets just whichever one it says at the
very<00:02:05.829> top<00:02:06.130> francium<00:02:06.670> sit<00:02:07.060> so<00:02:08.050> we<00:02:08.110> could<00:02:08.259> have

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
very top francium sit so we could have

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.520 
very top francium sit so we could have
done<00:02:08.470> other<00:02:08.769> countries<00:02:09.220> like<00:02:09.519> I<00:02:10.410> bet<00:02:11.410> these

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
done other countries like I bet these

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.070 
done other countries like I bet these
ones<00:02:11.800> we<00:02:11.980> would<00:02:12.459> have<00:02:12.549> lost<00:02:12.730> but<00:02:13.150> anything<00:02:13.959> up

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
ones we would have lost but anything up

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.289 
ones we would have lost but anything up
here<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.620> could<00:02:15.459> have<00:02:15.549> given<00:02:15.670> up<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.090> kept<00:02:16.239> the

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
the v4 that's great just reflecting on

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.809 
the v4 that's great just reflecting on
it<00:02:50.530> i<00:02:50.709> think<00:02:50.889> the<00:02:50.980> mistakes<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.519> I<00:02:51.549> made<00:02:51.730> in

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
it i think the mistakes and I made in

it i think the mistakes and I made in
this<00:02:51.850> campaign<00:02:52.329> is<00:02:52.389> you<00:02:53.200> know<00:02:53.260> we<00:02:53.350> have<00:02:53.470> plenty

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
this campaign is you know we have plenty

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.710 
this campaign is you know we have plenty
of<00:02:53.739> money<00:02:53.910> right<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.389> reason<00:02:55.569> we<00:02:55.630> had

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
of money right and the reason we had

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.180 
of money right and the reason we had
plenty<00:02:55.900> of<00:02:55.989> money<00:02:56.109> cuz<00:02:56.380> i<00:02:56.440> moved<00:02:56.620> my<00:02:56.680> capital

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
plenty of money cuz i moved my capital

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.220 
plenty of money cuz i moved my capital
and<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:57.850> went<00:02:58.090> for<00:02:58.299> these<00:02:58.600> important<00:02:58.989> centers

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
and I went for these important centers

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.160 
and I went for these important centers
of<00:02:59.380> trade<00:02:59.650> in<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:01.090> English<00:03:01.329> Channel<00:03:01.510> node<00:03:01.840> to

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
of trade in the English Channel node to

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.990 
of trade in the English Channel node to
try<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.440> get<00:03:02.620> adjacency<00:03:03.310> up<00:03:03.489> here<00:03:03.730> but<00:03:03.880> I<00:03:03.910> think

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
try to get adjacency up here but I think

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.430 
try to get adjacency up here but I think
that<00:03:04.359> going<00:03:04.510> for<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:04.870> is<00:03:05.109> too<00:03:05.319> much

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
that going for that is too much

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.599 
that going for that is too much
aggressive<00:03:05.769> expansion<00:03:05.889> because<00:03:06.340> there's<00:03:06.549> a

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
aggressive expansion because there's a

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.780 
aggressive expansion because there's a
couple<00:03:06.760> provinces<00:03:07.329> in<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.569> hre<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:09.340> Torp<00:03:09.609> ins

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
couple provinces in the hre and Torp ins

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.710 
couple provinces in the hre and Torp ins
not<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:10.420> hre<00:03:10.810> however<00:03:12.090> holland<00:03:13.090> is<00:03:13.269> and

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
not in the hre however holland is and

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.309 
not in the hre however holland is and
the<00:03:14.019> hre<00:03:14.470> doesn't<00:03:14.950> like<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.519> they<00:03:16.150> do<00:03:17.109> not

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
the hre doesn't like that they do not

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.680 
the hre doesn't like that they do not
like<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:17.889> at<00:03:18.069> all<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.579> holland<00:03:19.030> is<00:03:19.150> 21

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
like that at all and holland is 21

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.280 
like that at all and holland is 21
development<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:22.019> really<00:03:23.019> didn't<00:03:23.260> work

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
development so that really didn't work

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.670 
development so that really didn't work
out<00:03:23.500> for<00:03:23.560> me<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:26.079> truth<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:26.350> that<00:03:26.410> i<00:03:26.650> don't

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
out for me and the truth is that i don't

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.530 
out for me and the truth is that i don't
think<00:03:26.859> we<00:03:27.040> need<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.250> money<00:03:27.400> so<00:03:27.609> i<00:03:28.329> think<00:03:28.420> what

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
think we need the money so i think what

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.879 
think we need the money so i think what
would<00:03:28.690> be<00:03:28.780> better<00:03:28.959> off<00:03:29.280> doing<00:03:30.280> is<00:03:31.739> first<00:03:32.739> off

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
would be better off doing is first off

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.319 
would be better off doing is first off
how<00:03:33.069> quickly<00:03:33.519> are<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:33.849> going<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.090> end<00:03:34.180> up<00:03:34.269> with

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
how quickly are you going to end up with

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.449 
how quickly are you going to end up with
those<00:03:34.599> ideas<00:03:34.989> do<00:03:35.470> we<00:03:35.560> have<00:03:35.709> time<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.010> take

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
those ideas do we have time to take

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.099 
those ideas do we have time to take
brittany<00:03:36.940> feed<00:03:37.209> them<00:03:37.359> to<00:03:37.510> provinces<00:03:37.959> and

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
brittany feed them to provinces and

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.660 
brittany feed them to provinces and
annex<00:03:38.410> them<00:03:38.620> before<00:03:38.920> they<00:03:39.010> get<00:03:39.130> there<00:03:39.190> second

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
annex them before they get there second

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.479 
annex them before they get there second
idea<00:03:41.849> yeah<00:03:42.849> I<00:03:42.880> definitely<00:03:43.060> think<00:03:43.569> we<00:03:43.720> do<00:03:44.459> so<00:03:45.459> I

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
idea yeah I definitely think we do so I

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:46.920 
idea yeah I definitely think we do so I
will<00:03:45.760> still<00:03:45.970> do<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.239> in<00:03:46.359> the<00:03:46.419> next<00:03:46.450> campaign

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
will still do that in the next campaign

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.150 
will still do that in the next campaign
will<00:03:47.109> go<00:03:47.230> for<00:03:47.410> Brittany<00:03:47.650> get<00:03:47.799> those<00:03:47.980> six

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
will go for Brittany get those six

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.699 
will go for Brittany get those six

start a war with whoever they're
adjacent<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.520> and<00:04:05.820> then<00:04:06.720> rather<00:04:07.200> than<00:04:07.380> give<00:04:07.950> it

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040

so<00:04:11.160> that<00:04:11.280> we<00:04:11.370> have<00:04:11.400> range<00:04:12.090> up<00:04:12.300> here<00:04:12.600> then<00:04:12.840> we

so that we have range up here then we

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.349 
so that we have range up here then we
eat<00:04:13.050> Scotland<00:04:16.760> Scotland's<00:04:17.760> all<00:04:17.880> cheap<00:04:18.180> so

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
eat Scotland Scotland's all cheap so

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.860 
eat Scotland Scotland's all cheap so
that'd<00:04:18.510> be<00:04:18.660> good<00:04:19.079> territory<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:19.680> have<00:04:20.870> course

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
that'd be good territory to have course

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.810 
that'd be good territory to have course
Scotland<00:04:22.440> then<00:04:22.770> gives<00:04:23.010> us<00:04:23.130> adjacency<00:04:23.580> to

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
Scotland then gives us adjacency to

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.370 
Scotland then gives us adjacency to
Norway<00:04:24.270> which<00:04:24.480> we<00:04:24.630> can<00:04:24.750> then<00:04:24.780> use<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.020> declare

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
Norway which we can then use to declare

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.350 
Norway which we can then use to declare
war<00:04:25.530> in<00:04:25.650> Norway<00:04:25.980> and<00:04:26.160> then<00:04:26.280> we<00:04:26.370> blob<00:04:26.790> up<00:04:26.970> into

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
war in Norway and then we blob up into

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.510 
war in Norway and then we blob up into
Scandinavia<00:04:28.050> that<00:04:28.230> way<00:04:28.380> let<00:04:29.040> me<00:04:29.130> just<00:04:29.250> avoid

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
Scandinavia that way let me just avoid

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.790 
Scandinavia that way let me just avoid
all<00:04:29.700> of<00:04:29.850> this<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:30.450> more<00:04:31.020> importantly<00:04:31.590> all<00:04:31.770> of

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
all of this and more importantly all of

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.640 
all of this and more importantly all of
this<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:32.760> more<00:04:33.140> importantly<00:04:34.140> all<00:04:34.320> of<00:04:34.350> that

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
this and more importantly all of that

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.830 
this and more importantly all of that
two<00:04:34.980> hundred<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.430> ninety<00:04:36.150> thousand<00:04:36.630> troops

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
two hundred and ninety thousand troops

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.200 
two hundred and ninety thousand troops
that<00:04:37.110> I<00:04:37.140> had<00:04:37.290> to<00:04:37.380> fight<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:38.210> then<00:04:40.700> other<00:04:41.700> than

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
that I had to fight and then other than

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.910 
that I had to fight and then other than
that<00:04:42.480> I<00:04:42.720> mean<00:04:42.780> it's<00:04:43.050> just<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.440> think<00:04:43.680> it's<00:04:43.860> just

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
that I mean it's just I think it's just

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.790 
that I mean it's just I think it's just
expand<00:04:44.400> in<00:04:44.520> that<00:04:44.610> direction<00:04:44.880> and<00:04:45.560> by<00:04:46.560> taking

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
expand in that direction and by taking

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.040 
expand in that direction and by taking
land<00:04:47.130> in<00:04:47.250> Ireland<00:04:47.640> will<00:04:47.790> have<00:04:47.940> land<00:04:48.210> base<00:04:48.510> to

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
land in Ireland will have land base to

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.010 
land in Ireland will have land base to
fight<00:04:49.350> England<00:04:49.740> and<00:04:49.830> straight<00:04:50.100> up<00:04:50.130> for<00:04:51.020> so

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
fight England and straight up for so

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.900 
fight England and straight up for so
their<00:04:52.169> Navy<00:04:52.380> won't<00:04:52.650> matter<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:53.130> if<00:04:53.640> we<00:04:53.760> need

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
their Navy won't matter and if we need

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.430 
their Navy won't matter and if we need
to<00:04:53.940> we<00:04:54.090> can<00:04:54.240> eat<00:04:54.450> some<00:04:54.630> of<00:04:54.750> northern<00:04:55.110> England

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
to we can eat some of northern England

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.600 
to we can eat some of northern England
which<00:04:55.620> is<00:04:55.770> actually<00:04:55.950> there's<00:04:56.370> a<00:04:56.460> few

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
which is actually there's a few

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.700 
which is actually there's a few
provinces<00:04:57.030> up<00:04:57.150> here<00:04:57.300> they're<00:04:57.450> low<00:04:57.660> we<00:04:58.560> get

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
provinces up here they're low we get

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.390 
provinces up here they're low we get
like<00:04:58.830> five<00:04:59.160> development<00:04:59.730> here<00:05:00.060> a<00:05:01.280> little<00:05:02.280> thin

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
like five development here a little thin

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.280 
like five development here a little thin
and<00:05:02.550> fly<00:05:02.760> for<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.090> two<00:05:03.270> in<00:05:03.570> Scotland<00:05:04.110> that<00:05:04.140> are

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
and fly for the two in Scotland that are

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.930 
and fly for the two in Scotland that are
probably<00:05:04.590> not<00:05:04.740> as<00:05:04.890> desirable<00:05:06.260> and<00:05:07.940> then

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
probably not as desirable and then

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.240 
probably not as desirable and then
they've<00:05:09.060> got<00:05:09.240> like<00:05:09.390> Gwen<00:05:09.690> it<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.100> just<00:05:11.100> eat

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
they've got like Gwen it and just eat

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.159 
they've got like Gwen it and just eat
all<00:05:11.400> of<00:05:11.430> it<00:05:11.580> really<00:05:14.150> okay<00:05:15.150> all<00:05:15.630> right<00:05:15.780> well<00:05:15.810> um

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
this is an exceptionally short video but

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.460 
this is an exceptionally short video but
I<00:05:18.300> was<00:05:18.450> just<00:05:18.540> experimenting<00:05:18.900> a<00:05:19.200> little<00:05:19.260> bit

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
I was just experimenting a little bit

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.530 
I was just experimenting a little bit
and<00:05:19.620> yeah<00:05:20.610> I'm<00:05:20.850> gonna<00:05:21.060> wrap<00:05:21.210> this<00:05:21.330> one<00:05:21.390> up

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
and yeah I'm gonna wrap this one up

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.270 
and yeah I'm gonna wrap this one up
we're<00:05:21.780> gonna<00:05:21.900> start<00:05:22.380> v4<00:05:22.800> here<00:05:23.010> in<00:05:23.070> the<00:05:23.160> next

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
we're gonna start v4 here in the next

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.050 
we're gonna start v4 here in the next
one<00:05:23.780> so<00:05:24.890> that's<00:05:25.890> unfortunate<00:05:26.520> but<00:05:26.700> hey<00:05:26.940> I've

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
one so that's unfortunate but hey I've

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.659 
one so that's unfortunate but hey I've
learned<00:05:27.270> a<00:05:27.390> little<00:05:27.479> bit<00:05:27.600> and<00:05:28.669> aggressive

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
learned a little bit and aggressive

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.750 
learned a little bit and aggressive
expansion<00:05:31.160> it's<00:05:32.160> a<00:05:32.310> little<00:05:32.400> bit<00:05:32.580> higher

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
expansion it's a little bit higher

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.810 
expansion it's a little bit higher
higher<00:05:33.390> now<00:05:34.040> the<00:05:35.040> I<00:05:35.070> don't<00:05:35.430> need<00:05:35.520> to<00:05:35.610> know<00:05:35.729> what

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
higher now the I don't need to know what

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.190 
higher now the I don't need to know what
the<00:05:35.880> exact<00:05:36.150> modifier<00:05:36.540> is<00:05:36.720> but<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.020> higher

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
the exact modifier is but the higher

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.540 
the exact modifier is but the higher
your<00:05:37.380> development<00:05:37.830> is<00:05:37.979> the<00:05:38.190> more<00:05:38.400> aggressive

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
your development is the more aggressive

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.240 
your development is the more aggressive
expansion<00:05:38.790> you<00:05:39.240> get<00:05:39.450> so<00:05:40.410> just<00:05:40.919> be<00:05:41.010> aware<00:05:41.040> of

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
expansion you get so just be aware of

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.710 
expansion you get so just be aware of
that<00:05:41.430> all<00:05:42.210> right<00:05:42.330> well<00:05:42.419> thanks<00:05:42.479> for<00:05:42.690> watching
