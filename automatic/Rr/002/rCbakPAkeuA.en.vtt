mahogany shell basically and what Gil

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:58.900 
mahogany shell basically and what Gil
does<00:02:57.950> is<00:02:58.100> you<00:02:58.190> start<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.610> piece<00:02:58.760> of

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
does is you start to the piece of

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.300 
does is you start to the piece of
mahogany<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.660> hollows<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.440> all<00:03:00.590> out<00:03:00.800> okay

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
mahogany and the hollows it all out okay

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.009 
mahogany and the hollows it all out okay
so<00:03:01.340> I<00:03:01.550> believe<00:03:01.850> it's<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:02.269> think<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.630> half-inch

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
so I believe it's a I think a half-inch

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.020 
so I believe it's a I think a half-inch
stick<00:03:03.350> all<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.650> way<00:03:03.769> around<00:03:04.100> now<00:03:04.220> mahogany

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
stick all the way around now mahogany

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.060 
stick all the way around now mahogany
you've<00:03:05.480> got<00:03:05.600> this<00:03:05.690> hollow<00:03:05.930> shell<00:03:06.320> and<00:03:06.560> then<00:03:06.980> he

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
you've got this hollow shell and then he

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.850 
you've got this hollow shell and then he
takes<00:03:07.250> this<00:03:07.760> very<00:03:08.150> very<00:03:08.600> very<00:03:08.750> light<00:03:09.260> Japanese

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
takes this very very very light Japanese

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.920 
takes this very very very light Japanese
wood<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:10.370> inlays<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:10.970> into<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.450> mahogany

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
wood and inlays it into the mahogany

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.020 
wood and inlays it into the mahogany
okay<00:03:12.410> so<00:03:12.470> now<00:03:12.680> you've<00:03:12.830> got<00:03:12.860> this<00:03:13.130> core<00:03:13.550> of<00:03:13.580> this

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
okay so now you've got this core of this

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.550 
okay so now you've got this core of this
incredibly<00:03:14.510> light<00:03:14.720> resonant<00:03:15.320> wood

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
incredibly light resonant wood

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.130 
incredibly light resonant wood
surrounded<00:03:16.550> by<00:03:16.700> mahogany<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:17.480> then<00:03:17.870> he<00:03:17.959> takes

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
surrounded by mahogany and then he takes

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.259 
surrounded by mahogany and then he takes
the<00:03:18.320> maple<00:03:18.620> top<00:03:18.799> and<00:03:19.010> puts<00:03:19.190> it<00:03:19.310> on<00:03:19.459> so<00:03:20.000> what<00:03:20.150> you

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
the maple top and puts it on so what you

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.000 
the maple top and puts it on so what you
end<00:03:20.390> up<00:03:20.510> with<00:03:20.570> is<00:03:20.900> an<00:03:20.989> incredibly<00:03:21.410> resonant

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
end up with is an incredibly resonant

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.160 
end up with is an incredibly resonant
and

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
and

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.360 
and
it's<00:03:24.170> just<00:03:24.349> in<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.590> room<00:03:24.770> without<00:03:24.980> being

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
it's just in the room without being

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.320 
it's just in the room without being
amplified<00:03:30.130> it's<00:03:31.130> really<00:03:31.880> loud<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.270> almost

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
amplified it's really loud it almost

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.910 
amplified it's really loud it almost
sounds<00:03:32.690> like<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.840> semi<00:03:33.050> hollow<00:03:33.260> guitar<00:03:33.650> in<00:03:33.830> the

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
sounds like a semi hollow guitar in the

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.839 
sounds like a semi hollow guitar in the
room<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:35.860> so<00:03:36.860> you<00:03:36.920> end<00:03:37.040> up<00:03:37.069> with<00:03:37.130> a<00:03:37.250> incredibly

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
room and so you end up with a incredibly

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.699 
room and so you end up with a incredibly
resonant<00:03:38.239> guitar<00:03:38.450> but<00:03:38.599> it's<00:03:38.720> also<00:03:38.840> very<00:03:39.380> light

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
resonant guitar but it's also very light

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.589 
resonant guitar but it's also very light
about<00:03:40.099> six<00:03:40.430> pounds<00:03:40.610> something<00:03:41.150> like<00:03:41.300> that<00:03:41.540> I

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
about six pounds something like that I

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.660 
about six pounds something like that I
think<00:03:41.720> so<00:03:42.200> anybody<00:03:42.739> with<00:03:42.920> a<00:03:42.980> bad<00:03:43.160> back<00:03:43.400> out

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
think so anybody with a bad back out

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.820 
think so anybody with a bad back out
there<00:03:43.880> this<00:03:44.120> is<00:03:44.180> your<00:03:44.630> saving<00:03:45.260> grace<00:03:45.290> can<00:03:45.709> be
