 racing history so a beautiful 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.440
 race they did not fill up 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.030
 only 14 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.460
 yes, but I think we still have 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.730
 very solid bases and I would be almost 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.510
 a shot almost a little back so 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.219
 will have to try to apply what 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.620
 okay bah listen I wanted to get 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.020

 so put in the head on 9 dagada castelet 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.070
 who really likes it incredibly 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.630
 this course clearly had its sounds and 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.640
 in his garden cagnes-sur-mer it is alas 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.840
 true mare of vincennes flat runs 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.770
 a little bit of trouble climbing the odds 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.030
 are now red cards 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.260
 cagnes-sur-mer to us has shown this 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.820
 winter at the court or three times the win 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.049
 twice there a disqualification but 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.759
 hey we do not care 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.650
 here she has won but she is capable 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.689
 to walk a tiny 14 on this 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.830
 course in the lead is going to be hard to 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.390
 beat so does not stupidity 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.869
 normally it's a mare is capable 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.509
 to go forward 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.710
 the mom of people so rarely 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.240
 unhappy in a course so 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.430
 on his last victory this is the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.799
 favorite logic she is shaped like 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.299
 she just proved it 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.920
 14 if he repeats his sale is normally 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.470
 it's hard for the distance noailles 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.150
 behind you classify the 14th recital 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.119
 carisaie who this time déferré of 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.250
 four feet is a good horse 1 our 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.140
 good age horses in the south east 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.700
 there is no briand we had aimed a 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.930
 at the beginning of the meeting, which was not missed 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.220
 he has he really has it was really 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.450
 sick and behind he tried what 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.490
 to climb to vincennes but it had not 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.050
 been not to look like hilarious Korean koo 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.700
 hitched with his irons to prepare this 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.080
 race there I had yannick shining the 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.460
 horse is fine he and he told me 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.440
 that he was as good as at the beginning of 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.300
 meeting when he had animals so 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.489
 he is afraid of course tagada 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.650
 castelet but hey I felt in these 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.459
 professions normally the showdown in 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.470
 What the first three 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.090
 yeah that's richer empire szasz 15 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.060
 10 to 25 meters but they are only three to 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.290
 their posts and who will have his ease 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.269
 if he can start it all out 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.440
 and which can exchange three horses 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.480
 head that ends up four and a half five 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.450
 to two years old and sasha able to do 700 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.069
 meters very loud so normally it's 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.140
 very much agree it's really the 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.420
 two bases what I think behind 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.769
 you rank the 13 sophie of the bright that is 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.280
 obviously move with big 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.450
 ambitions 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.720
 yes me it makes sense she won her 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.000
 quinté on the ash 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.290
 Paris so it was well worth it 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.430
 before she was third of recital 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.840
 carisaie so we have a line 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.010
 interesting she was unhappy in 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.450
 one of the turning points the summer came to finish very 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.010
 quickly it was the note she was 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.510
 third super good by the way she has 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.400
 precisely she won the quinté behind at 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.690
 vincennes good last she is 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.790
 a little disappointed but it was very upbeat 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.440
 then had an easy course she was 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.280
 nose to the wind then it was still 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.320
 more statement that today 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.870
 she is a mare who likes to wait 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.310
 flat tracks go 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.250
 each time to credit efforts 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.830
 wonderful finals so good I think 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.450
 that normally lola dance even if they 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.129
 find themselves a bit far line in 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.799
 right she is able to finish very 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.769
 quickly and ouanaminthe being long lines 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.120
 straight to kaniola serves just so 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.980
 must be able to in the quinté very 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.129
 well in 4th position to classes and 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.110
 leucate twenty the marten brothers have 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.180
 always very formidable inevitable 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.159
 of course the martens brothers not the 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.329
 horse is doing a great rally so there is 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.099
 nothing to say and did all its shopping 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.900
 now it's not a big debinner 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.910
 so he can find both choices 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.680
 of 25 meters can be not far from 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.299
 him wen that 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.849
 I think they are superior to him 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.099
 still so after now the 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.019
 horse is full pot brand at all 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.000
 martens goes to kaniola they do all 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.530
 Arrivals so it's the same 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.879
 a very good chance to be in the 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.140
 quinté this is really the four 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.280
 shows of the race that is obvious 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.920
 paper there the first four fights 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.090
 site and yes it seems that's it going to be 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.379
 a question of order a little bit I 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.329
 do you agree rightly so we're going 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:06.109
 listen to what vincent martens said 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.849
 aline bouakaz who is really regular 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:11.030
 the latter as long as you think of his 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.230
 candidacy in the district of ginza the 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.169
 choice and skin him he's in great 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.090
 form for the moment so here is a 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:18.979
 choice that we need the right course we have 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.579
 head it 's not my place so is a 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.889
 good course 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.990
 the right is she got there that we can 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.300
 to say that it's a really a commitment 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.039
 interesting yes no he is well placed in 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.849
 toddlers sometimes need to 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:34.270
 horse and to the woman for him so 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.949
 not far away should do well here he has it 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.990
 says this is the path that will make the 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.399
 candidate not a steps step but 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.849
 when he has the good course he was working 

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:45.339
 in logic very well and in 5th you 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.569
 classify uccello jet that his 

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:47.259
 last performances are not 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:48.610
 exceptional 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.830
 it's not exceptional but when we 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.139
 look at his times every time 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.969
 they ran up or 25 meters from 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.199
 lots not easy so it's a small 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:57.849
 horse that must be hidden must not be too much 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.770
 make efforts but he is able to 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.679
 to follow 14 in the lead does not scare him 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.879
 but it does it every time so there 

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:05.499
 it's really a great opportunity to 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:07.089
 him because he goes in the lead I think 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:08.259
 that his entourage has prepared them as 

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:09.459
 it takes because it's really a 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:10.809
 great opportunity compared to 

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:13.080
 previous commitments in the end it's 

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:16.119
 a very nice race for access 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.189
 here he goes in the lead and he is very 

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:19.689
 practice so I think he's going it's 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:23.080
 nicolas ensch he's gonna he gave me the 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:24.669
 course surely little arm but that's it 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.159
 I see he is able to make 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.089
 nice end of race data so hey he 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.189
 has its place in the quinté 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:32.740
 very well, well, we'll understand you 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:34.930
 are still pretty confident but we have 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.950
 a little bit obliged to reading the 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.140
 starters they are that 14 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.510
 here are the four shows first four 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:45.230
 of the believer are normally oaths 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:47.360
 the other the bases are spread out here 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.530
 so good we cross our fingers but hey 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.750
 the shot feels good we say very well 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.790
 you are always very formidable to 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.410
 predictions and so we will follow you there 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.150
