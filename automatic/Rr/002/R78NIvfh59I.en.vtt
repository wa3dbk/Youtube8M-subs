 Evenings later with the information there 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.260
 on the wheel 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.820
 great companions as they were very 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.049
 Good evening, I send you a greeting from 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.030
 the facilities of the wheel 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.320
 we find with gerardo try before 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.930
 that nothing jerry thanks for the interview 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.970
 that unfortunately what happened the 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.470
 Last Tuesday, jerry, you had a problem 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.899
 in the right knee you will be four 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.570
 three to four months out I say it's a 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:29.380
 it's bad news in the particular and 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.990
 Well, I really think that as a player 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.469
 it's the worst thing that can happen to you but good 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.640
 I said I think 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.190
 physically I am hurt but 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.679
 mentally I'm strong so I 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.649
 I have faith that soon we will be back 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:47.379
 and well now I will work on what is my 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.969
 rehabilitation and it's important not to 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.010
 he has to hold the referee accountable 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.799
 miguel angel ayala up here as what 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.000
 you take it I think that or left my 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:58.119
 injury I do not blame anyone 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.829
 I really know that I am exposed we are 

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:02.350
 exposed to 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.120
 to hurt us the conditions of what 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.910
 better were not the ones to play but 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.430
 I think it's good for one as a player 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.140
 if they tell you, we're going to give you five minutes 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.270
 raining but has the possibility of 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.230
 win then he will play so I think that 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.660
 this was 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.820
 because we are exposed nothing more 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.110
 an injury never comes at a good time 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.360
 I re but I saw that I had a selection 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.560
 Mexican that comes in qualifiers that 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.510
 it was important for the chepo of the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.130
 tower as it arrives arrives this injury that 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.320
 is going to leave you four months out 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.110
 that they change if it's really complicated 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.020
 I hope or less time but 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.450
 good if life has challenges has 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.789
 does not have to get up is in the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.010
 sense tell you I will work on my 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.830
 rehabilitation and good 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.930
 I have faith that soon he will return to me 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.820
 team do things well and soon 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.260
 can be the selection in the selection 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.840
 will have to give results and also with 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.120
 or without you is how you see it from the outside and 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.730
 they know they have my full support I spoke 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.920
 with my colleagues and they know that I from 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.390
 outside or what can help is going to be 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.820
 there that I am committed to them 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.050
 same the selection has to have that 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.750
 get your pass 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.130
 we all know that and we know that 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.560
 this bad step is going to be forgotten 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.980
 because because the continuation of the 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.900
 time is important and good come in 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.520
 things already better you told me you are not going to 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.610
 accelerate this rehabilitation process 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.840
 I do not have to accelerate, it's not 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.250
 issue of that we have to recover 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.550
 well to the fullest 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.370
 likewise give the most in the 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.540
 team and in the selection 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.980
