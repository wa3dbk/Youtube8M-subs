00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.460 
which I thought was amazing if you can
actually<00:01:42.030> do<00:01:42.119> something<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.720> that

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
actually do something like this that

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.560 
actually do something like this that
would<00:01:43.619> be<00:01:43.710> pretty<00:01:43.829> sweet<00:01:44.270> beulah<00:01:45.270> just

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
would be pretty sweet beulah just

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.270 
would be pretty sweet beulah just
overall<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.049> game<00:01:46.259> looks<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.740> be<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> lot

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
overall this game looks to be a lot

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.550 
overall this game looks to be a lot
better<00:01:47.310> than<00:01:47.880> what<00:01:48.149> call<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.630> duty<00:01:48.960> ghosts<00:01:49.259> was

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
better than what call of duty ghosts was

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.260 
better than what call of duty ghosts was
call<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.280> duty<00:01:50.310> ghosts<00:01:50.610> really<00:01:50.820> wasn't<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
call of duty ghosts really wasn't a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.120 
call of duty ghosts really wasn't a
great<00:01:51.450> game<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:52.229> game<00:01:52.409> seems<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.890> be

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
great game this game seems to be

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.800 
great game this game seems to be
somewhat<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.759> an<00:01:53.850> improvement<00:01:54.119> as<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.630> maker

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
somewhat of an improvement as the maker

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.090 
somewhat of an improvement as the maker
said<00:01:55.110> they<00:01:55.200> wanted<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.560> make<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.829> game<00:01:56.040> more

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
said they wanted to make this game more

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.219 
said they wanted to make this game more
like<00:01:56.520> call<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.850> duty<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.899> can<00:01:58.020> tell<00:01:58.049> by

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
like call of duty and as you can tell by

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.109 
like call of duty and as you can tell by
that<00:01:58.409> some<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.310> these<00:01:59.369> kill<00:01:59.610> streaks<00:01:59.820> here<00:02:00.000> in

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
that some of these kill streaks here in

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.090 
that some of these kill streaks here in
some<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.450> ways<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> guns<00:02:01.500> look<00:02:01.829> and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
some of the ways that the guns look and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.980 
some of the ways that the guns look and
stuff<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.520> really<00:02:02.729> does<00:02:03.060> remind<00:02:03.509> me<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.930> much

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
stuff it really does remind me so much

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.039 
stuff it really does remind me so much
of<00:02:04.140> black<00:02:04.740> ops<00:02:05.040> 2<00:02:05.399> which<00:02:06.030> if<00:02:06.210> any<00:02:06.450> case<00:02:06.719> is

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
of black ops 2 which if any case is

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.300 
of black ops 2 which if any case is
something<00:02:07.409> close<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.950> should<00:02:08.160> be<00:02:08.280> a

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
something close to it it should be a

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.400 
something close to it it should be a
pretty<00:02:08.640> decent<00:02:09.209> game<00:02:09.420> who<00:02:09.899> knows<00:02:10.080> what<00:02:10.289> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
pretty decent game who knows what the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.110 
pretty decent game who knows what the
type<00:02:10.560> will<00:02:10.739> do

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
type will do

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.729 
type will do
call<00:02:11.360> of<00:02:11.540> duty<00:02:11.569> but<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.110> advanced<00:02:12.349> warfare

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
call of duty but the advanced warfare

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.470 
call of duty but the advanced warfare
series<00:02:12.980> seems<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:13.849> be<00:02:13.879> going<00:02:14.060> in<00:02:14.269> the<00:02:14.330> right

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
series seems to be going in the right

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.479 
series seems to be going in the right
direction<00:02:14.659> at<00:02:15.200> least<00:02:15.230> for<00:02:15.620> now<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:16.220> can<00:02:16.370> also

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
direction at least for now you can also

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.250 
direction at least for now you can also
see<00:02:16.790> towards<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.299> end<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.659> will<00:02:17.810> see<00:02:17.989> a<00:02:18.019> lot

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260
