00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
and steel magnifying glasses spark

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.259 
and steel magnifying glasses spark
odds<00:02:13.409> and<00:02:13.709> lots<00:02:14.099> of<00:02:14.250> other<00:02:14.430> different<00:02:14.700> fire

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
odds and lots of other different fire

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.130 
odds and lots of other different fire
making<00:02:15.599> items<00:02:17.239> food<00:02:18.239> is<00:02:18.420> another<00:02:18.719> great

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
making items food is another great

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.369 
making items food is another great
concern<00:02:19.969> take<00:02:20.969> lots<00:02:21.299> of<00:02:21.569> high-calorie<00:02:22.019> food

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
concern take lots of high-calorie food

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.770 
concern take lots of high-calorie food
with<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:23.370> more<00:02:23.579> the<00:02:23.760> better<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.510> fatty

with you the more the better the fatty
are<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.079> better<00:02:25.400> because<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:27.060> cold<00:02:27.359> winter

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
are the better because the cold winter

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.559 
are the better because the cold winter
