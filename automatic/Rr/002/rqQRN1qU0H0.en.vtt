00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.960

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.330

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.310
 very successful career and with many 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.710
 important collaborations which has been 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.359
 good what have been the teachings that 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.700
 maybe you have had to have learned from 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.040
 those of those collaborate because I worked with 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.940
 one of my idols that was the yang efe 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.820
 lopez 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.620
 and working with her she taught me that 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.050
 It is very important to feel safe from you 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.660
 same but at the same time and know why i 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.969
 stay with one percent to stay 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.100
 good person although you are achieving 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.530
 many things and traveling all over the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.350
 world that has all your fans that you 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:01.230
 family is the most important thing and it does not exist 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:03.620
 the greim albert has his children and his 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.620

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.820

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.180
 let's say that tips gave you some of the 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.940
 people with whom this collaborates 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:22.260
 with my full suit and he taught me that 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.880
 that it does not matter if you want to rap on 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.270
 English are Spanish if you want to be 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:32.729
 spanglish the stage and logic will be and he 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.580
 it is not only the love that is ours 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.200
 egg to him he can can go all over the 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.860
 world and all its fans to be like 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.090
 omÃ¡n win and not not the most Latinos 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.440

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.050
 collaboration with jake baldwin that 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.330
 You feel that your song brought him 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.410
 it has flow and nothing 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.530
 it has a very very different urban style 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.660
 and I love how its like its 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.479
 way of being and not the way it house 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.310
 thuringiensis no times codina is 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.700
 preparing your disc and we can then 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.700
 expecting collaborations like this can not 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.700
 say ya 7 but I'm working with with 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.590
 many people who and naut aran is for 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.810
 me the most base in shanghai there's 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.660
 many producers and it does not cost near 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.700
 to me not terminal loads but I 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.310
 I feel very excited and when the day 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.840
 comes where we can put the name of the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.400
 album I'm going to ask my fans that 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.560
 they help me put the name because 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.630
 I think they are part of that 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.230
 because it's a big part and in the tissue 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.470
 art 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.330
 the doctor and jefferson are also me 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.010
 I feel very excited not without doubt the 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.810
 album with what they have told us is going to 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.900
 be very good so weekend wave 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.610
 as it comes out as you keep with the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.800
 feet on the ground when when I already eat 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.530
 the lights go out as you focus 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.870
 with my family they are and all of them 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.290
 they are the reason why and we stopped 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.470
 we were so high end am and not without them and 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.930
 Cadiz because traveling so much working 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.239
 so much when you're in the interview in 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.280
 the study and novena or millwall and sis 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.160
 when you are at home and they treat you 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:15.120
 normal and when I'm just from here not 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.120
 leave and I feel relaxed calm and not 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.840
 drop anxiety and what are your 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.939
 next goals or as you see yourself in 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.969
 a short time to see what happens and not 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.590
 I'm very focused on me in my album 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:29.989
 I would like to have my own clothing line 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.590
 because i am a fashionista from tina volviera 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.150
 fan and I would like to do something with autism 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.030

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.239

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.569

 It's something very special for my show and already 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.200
 see what else does not seem super good to me 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.060
 being so young because I have the 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.280
 initiative to take advantage of, not the 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.599
 fame and resources to help others 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.980
