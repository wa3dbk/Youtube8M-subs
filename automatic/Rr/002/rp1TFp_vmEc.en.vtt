when<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:02.060> was<00:02:02.360> just<00:02:02.600> past<00:02:02.869> Christmas<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:03.890> if

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
when it was just past Christmas so if

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.160 
when it was just past Christmas so if
you<00:02:04.580> wondering<00:02:04.940> why<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.090> still<00:02:05.420> up<00:02:05.600> there<00:02:05.630> that

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
you wondering why I still up there that

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:17.060 
you wondering why I still up there that
is<00:02:06.229> who<00:02:06.710> hi

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.770 

so<00:02:18.070> once<00:02:18.310> your<00:02:18.520> hair<00:02:18.700> is<00:02:18.730> at<00:02:19.000> length<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.600> want

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
so once your hair is at length you want

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.170 
so once your hair is at length you want
it<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.080> be<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.290> let<00:02:20.770> out<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.220> remaining<00:02:21.820> parts

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
it to be I let out the remaining parts

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:31.020 
it to be I let out the remaining parts
of<00:02:22.330> my<00:02:22.540> hair<00:02:22.810> then<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.260> split<00:02:23.560> that<00:02:23.920> into<00:02:24.550> half

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.000 

so<00:02:31.570> I<00:02:31.600> didn't<00:02:31.900> want<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.080> take<00:02:32.320> up<00:02:32.500> too<00:02:32.530> much<00:02:32.800> of

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
so I didn't want to take up too much of

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.710 
so I didn't want to take up too much of
my<00:02:33.220> layers<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.790> basically<00:02:34.090> just<00:02:34.210> wanted<00:02:34.600> to

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
my layers I basically just wanted to

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.420 
my layers I basically just wanted to
meet<00:02:34.900> in<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.170> mob<00:02:35.380> since<00:02:35.620> over<00:02:35.800> time<00:02:36.190> my

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
meet in the mob since over time my

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.640 
meet in the mob since over time my
layers<00:02:36.730> just<00:02:36.760> went<00:02:37.210> really<00:02:37.570> uneven<00:02:38.020> how<00:02:38.440> they

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
layers just went really uneven how they

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.530 
layers just went really uneven how they
grow<00:02:38.830> out<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.190> everything<00:02:39.670> so<00:02:40.090> why<00:02:40.240> did<00:02:40.510> I

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
grow out and everything so why did I

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.330 
grow out and everything so why did I
just<00:02:40.720> grab<00:02:41.020> two<00:02:41.200> random<00:02:41.530> sections<00:02:41.980> of<00:02:42.160> my

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
just grab two random sections of my

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.220 
just grab two random sections of my
nails<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.880> I<00:02:42.940> just<00:02:43.180> started<00:02:43.510> tuning<00:02:43.660> them<00:02:44.080> up

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
nails and I just started tuning them up

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.560 
nails and I just started tuning them up
I<00:02:44.440> don't<00:02:45.220> really<00:02:45.550> know<00:02:45.820> how<00:02:46.060> I'm<00:02:46.210> explaining

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
I don't really know how I'm explaining

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.600 
I don't really know how I'm explaining
this<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.230> I'm<00:02:47.320> not<00:02:47.500> really<00:02:47.770> explaining<00:02:48.340> this

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
this so I'm not really explaining this

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.510 
this so I'm not really explaining this
at<00:02:48.820> all<00:02:49.090> but<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:50.470> could<00:02:50.620> basically<00:02:51.190> see<00:02:51.400> you

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
at all but you could basically see you

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.580 
at all but you could basically see you
know<00:02:51.790> what<00:02:52.120> I'm<00:02:52.300> doing<00:02:52.660> I<00:02:52.840> don't<00:02:53.050> really<00:02:53.350> know
