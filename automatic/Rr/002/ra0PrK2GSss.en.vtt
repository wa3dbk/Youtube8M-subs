 when the guest list is ready 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.589
 is already the next question 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.749
 We want to invite the guests 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:17.939
 finished invitation and wedding cards are nice 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.789
 but even the most beautiful cards from the shop are individually processed 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.919
 something very special 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.449
 that many couples send original and unique invitations 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.249
 want Dietmar 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.020
 After all, the wedding is the WHO most individual in the world 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.680
 and that should also be noticed by the guests 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.640

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.999
 Insert sheets with a very small buffer of adhesives into the classrooms 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.869
 Although it is suitable for 4 almost always for the berths 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.630
 but often can be with color-coordinated paper additional effects 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.060
 achieve 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.240
 When it comes to unusual forms, it usually takes a bit of word processing 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.170
 be tried 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.640
 but the effort is worth it because cards with insert sheets are simply speech 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.920
 even if the first page should be provided with text 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.920

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.580
 and delete 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.680

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.730
 two tiny wedding dress are placed him 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.600

 A little skill in using the pair of scissors will require the bride and groom 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.840
 when making paper cuts 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.450
 But beginners should necessarily have simple motifs world 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.340
 that does not detract from the beauty of the cards, on the contrary, they are often the ones 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.669
 clear motives extremely effective 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:17.490
 German would be a small church are not too difficult to turn off 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.749
 and suitable for the wedding day 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.809
 there are witnesses and variations of such cards 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:28.169
 at the first, the motif is cut out of the cover of the card 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.689
 a tone in tone or contrasting sown that remains einlege 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.269
 it's motive then effective 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.019
 the second version is a bit more complicated and needs something more 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:38.949
 clarity 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:40.550

 dapd when opening the card the subject out 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.309
 For this trick, only the berth is scissored 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:50.979
 but paper should be used for stability 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:55.199
 Such folding cards succeed best then initially a ready-bought 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.229
 Card is taken apart 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:01.259

 for example, powerful brush strokes fright 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.999
 There is almost a harmonious pastel color over the ports of the world 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:23.389
 a great effect 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.959
 The card production becomes perfect with the perfectly professional 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.779

 with the balloon in the seventh heaven 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.999
 more elaborate are three-dimensional maps 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.709
 we fly to the seventh heaven 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.289
 Lucky for us to accompany the launch site 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:52.029
 For example, in the invitation text it says to be a hot air balloon ride 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:57.199
 for the captive balloon are small balloons with Pappmaschee and makes 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:59.159
 if the partnership is firm 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.289
 that the balloon is carefully cut in half 

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:03.979
 painted unfriendly 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.440
 maybe even with a wedding train deep 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.029
 or a lettering 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:11.029
 Half a balloon is stuck on the cardboard for each card 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.329
 under it comes a basket 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.599
 offered a strip game for that 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.159
 and glued on 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:18.809
 do not forget the strings 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:21.949
 otherwise the ball flies without a suitcase 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.319
 as the invitation 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:26.330
 in the basket with it 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.340
 simple but no matter 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.740
 noble effects can sometimes be achieved with fairly simple means 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.030
 The basis for the following proposal is a white dress Kate 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:41.110
 made of gold foil are formed two rings with irregular surface 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.139
 here are intertwined and should not be too small 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.650
 with foil or with a metallic pen, the card gets half a size 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.949
 Inches from Count Rand 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:53.409
 a rectangular golden frame 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:56.289
 in this context, the rings come into their own 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.360
 in silver too, such an invitation becomes fabulous 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.979
 but you have to decide for a color 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.779
 because the effect comes from a targeted selection and one of urgent

 now begins the sweet life 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:32.120

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.009
 and when opening the packaging 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.499
