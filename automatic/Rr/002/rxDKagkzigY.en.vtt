00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
too many things that happen in it that

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.009 
too many things that happen in it that
it's<00:00:29.640> actually<00:00:29.939> one<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.240> harder<00:00:30.570> skins<00:00:30.840> to

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
it's actually one of the harder skins to

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.319 
it's actually one of the harder skins to
get<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.410> one<00:00:32.160> main<00:00:32.430> problem<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.090> want<00:00:33.210> to

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
get so one main problem that I want to

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.049 
get so one main problem that I want to
warn<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.600> about<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:35.010> floor<00:00:35.309> there

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
warn you about is that the floor there

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.270 
warn you about is that the floor there
is<00:00:36.090> some<00:00:36.600> problems<00:00:37.500> with<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> collision<00:00:37.980> on

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
is some problems with the collision on

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.850 
is some problems with the collision on
the<00:00:38.399> floor<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.059> items<00:00:39.960> actually<00:00:40.379> fall<00:00:40.620> through

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the floor so items actually fall through

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.470 
the floor so items actually fall through
the<00:00:41.040> floor<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.309> you'll<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.149> try<00:00:42.450> and

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the floor so you'll have to like try and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.150 
the floor so you'll have to like try and
get<00:00:42.690> items<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.170> drop<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.559> buildings<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.129> think

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
get items to drop on buildings I think

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.279 
get items to drop on buildings I think
people<00:00:44.550> were<00:00:44.610> saying<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.719> recommended

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
people were saying like recommended

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.750 
people were saying like recommended
doing<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.649> buildings<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.219> would<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.550> pick

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
doing it on buildings I would just pick

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.580 
doing it on buildings I would just pick
up<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.030> items<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.450> midair<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:48.899> fast<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:49.379> like

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
up the items in midair as fast as like

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.010 
up the items in midair as fast as like
when<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.100> kill<00:00:50.370> him<00:00:50.520> they<00:00:50.700> drop<00:00:51.030> kinda<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.960> you

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
when you kill him they drop kinda so you

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.689 
when you kill him they drop kinda so you
can<00:00:52.230> kind<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.440> grab<00:00:52.680> them<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.039> midair<00:00:53.250> but

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
can kind of grab them in midair but

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.569 
can kind of grab them in midair but
that's<00:00:54.149> really<00:00:54.420> difficult<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.460> was<00:00:56.460> lucky

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
that's really difficult so I was lucky

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.279 
that's really difficult so I was lucky
to<00:00:56.760> get<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.210> don't<00:00:57.360> know<00:00:57.449> how<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> got<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.079> but

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
to get it I don't know how I got it but

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.200 
to get it I don't know how I got it but
I<00:00:58.469> might<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.309> gotten<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.640> from<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.879> friend<00:01:00.090> or

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
I might have gotten it from a friend or

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.760 
I might have gotten it from a friend or
something<00:01:00.420> but<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.109> difficult<00:01:01.320> one<00:01:01.620> to

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
something but it's a difficult one to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.049 
something but it's a difficult one to
get<00:01:02.010> I'm<00:01:02.160> telling<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.640> ahead<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.940> time

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
get I'm telling you this ahead of time

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.210 
get I'm telling you this ahead of time
so<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.830> when<00:01:04.830> he<00:01:04.949> drops<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:06.860> try<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:07.890> get<00:01:08.130> it

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
so just when he drops it try and get it

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.800 
so just when he drops it try and get it
on<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.340> building<00:01:08.790> or<00:01:08.970> something<00:01:09.210> else<00:01:09.540> that's

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
on a building or something else that's

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.780 
on a building or something else that's
not<00:01:09.990> right<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> floor<00:01:11.220> because<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.580> falls

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
not right on the floor because it falls

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.609 
not right on the floor because it falls
through<00:01:12.380> anyways

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
through anyways

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.440 
through anyways
