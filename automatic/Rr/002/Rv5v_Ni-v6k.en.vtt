mate you and just yet

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
mate you and just yet
so<00:03:14.310> we<00:03:15.090> get<00:03:15.239> there<00:03:15.769> what<00:03:16.769> else<00:03:16.890> comes<00:03:17.850> like

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
so we get there what else comes like

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.170 
so we get there what else comes like
that<00:03:18.180> will<00:03:18.570> base<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.989> pylons<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:20.070> water<00:03:20.640> tower

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
that will base it pylons and water tower

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.770 
that will base it pylons and water tower
bits<00:03:22.040> houses<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.160> stuff<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:24.299> track<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.720> the

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
bits houses and stuff the track and the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.630 
bits houses and stuff the track and the
transformer<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.530> everything<00:03:25.890> else<00:03:26.070> I<00:03:26.310> think

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
transformer and everything else I think

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.160 
transformer and everything else I think
we've<00:03:26.760> all<00:03:26.880> seen<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.120> before<00:03:27.450> from<00:03:27.959> other

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
we've all seen that before from other

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.730 
we've all seen that before from other
videos<00:03:28.709> from<00:03:28.830> other<00:03:29.040> people

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.850 

I<00:03:32.990> think<00:03:33.990> it's<00:03:34.110> time<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.290> do<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.470> running<00:03:34.770> in

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
I think it's time to do a running in

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.050 
I think it's time to do a running in
video<00:03:35.630> right<00:03:36.630> I<00:03:37.350> think<00:03:37.650> now<00:03:37.950> we're<00:03:38.160> all<00:03:38.460> ready

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
video right I think now we're all ready

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.710 
video right I think now we're all ready
to<00:03:39.410> hear<00:03:40.410> on<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.620> track<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:42.300> put<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.540> logo

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
to hear on the track so I put the logo

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.770 
to hear on the track so I put the logo
on<00:03:43.020> first<00:03:43.350> I'm<00:03:44.340> doing<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.760> order<00:03:45.090> what<00:03:45.510> names

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
on first I'm doing the order what names

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.020 
on first I'm doing the order what names
on<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.320> box<00:03:46.560> as<00:03:46.830> well<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:49.310> would<00:03:50.310> do<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:50.910> on<00:03:51.000> a

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
on the box as well I would do it on a

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.570 
on the box as well I would do it on a
straight<00:03:51.450> bit<00:03:51.750> normally<00:03:52.560> I'd<00:03:53.100> recommend

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
straight bit normally I'd recommend

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.990 
straight bit normally I'd recommend
putting<00:03:53.940> on<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.150> straight<00:03:54.480> bit<00:03:54.690> anyway<00:03:55.050> but<00:03:56.000> at

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
putting on a straight bit anyway but at

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.150 
putting on a straight bit anyway but at
the<00:03:57.300> moment<00:03:57.510> I<00:03:57.860> almost<00:04:00.620> strike<00:04:01.620> this<00:04:01.770> I<00:04:01.950> can't

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
the moment I almost strike this I can't

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.770 
the moment I almost strike this I can't
let<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.370> get<00:04:02.580> to<00:04:02.760> there<00:04:02.970> very<00:04:03.240> easily<00:04:03.450> with

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.120 

doesn't<00:05:00.750> seem<00:05:00.960> to<00:05:01.139> want<00:05:01.290> to<00:05:01.500> come<00:05:01.710> for<00:05:01.949> some

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
doesn't seem to want to come for some

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:13.670 
doesn't seem to want to come for some
reason<00:05:06.139> oh<00:05:11.600> that's<00:05:12.600> typical<00:05:13.139> of<00:05:13.199> going<00:05:13.590> the

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
reason oh that's typical of going the

00:05:13.680 --> 00:06:20.900 
reason oh that's typical of going the
wrong<00:05:13.830> way

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.940 

well<00:06:21.910> I'm<00:06:22.660> certainly<00:06:22.990> happy<00:06:23.170> with<00:06:23.500> it<00:06:23.650> I<00:06:23.830> mean

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
well I'm certainly happy with it I mean

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.410 
well I'm certainly happy with it I mean
I<00:06:24.130> know<00:06:24.280> something<00:06:24.640> like<00:06:24.730> a<00:06:24.760> little<00:06:24.940> star<00:06:25.210> like

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420 
I know something like a little star like

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.130 
I know something like a little star like
that<00:06:25.660> but<00:06:25.930> I<00:06:26.200> think<00:06:27.180> the<00:06:28.180> bank<00:06:28.420> for<00:06:28.720> money<00:06:28.840> of

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
that but I think the bank for money of

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.250 
that but I think the bank for money of
these<00:06:29.320> things<00:06:29.970> are<00:06:30.970> really<00:06:31.390> really<00:06:31.810> good

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.260 
these things are really really good

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.630 
these things are really really good
I<00:06:32.290> mean<00:06:32.650> considering<00:06:33.130> in<00:06:33.280> something<00:06:33.520> like<00:06:33.580> a

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:33.640 
I mean considering in something like a

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.540 
I mean considering in something like a
small<00:06:33.910> little<00:06:34.120> while<00:06:34.330> orochon<00:06:35.190> you<00:06:36.190> know<00:06:36.310> it

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
small little while orochon you know it

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.420 
small little while orochon you know it
