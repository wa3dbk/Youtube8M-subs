00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
think I'm pronouncing that correctly if

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.160 
think I'm pronouncing that correctly if
not<00:00:35.450> I<00:00:35.810> don't<00:00:36.170> think<00:00:36.500> anyone<00:00:36.800> cares<00:00:37.030> but<00:00:38.030> uh

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
not I don't think anyone cares but uh

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.390 
not I don't think anyone cares but uh
yeah<00:00:39.170> so<00:00:40.010> because<00:00:40.610> of<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.140> diverse<00:00:42.190> range<00:00:43.190> of

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
yeah so because of the diverse range of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.470 
yeah so because of the diverse range of
professions<00:00:44.060> and<00:00:44.390> by<00:00:44.960> diverse<00:00:45.230> I<00:00:45.500> mean<00:00:45.680> four

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
professions and by diverse I mean four

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.790 
professions and by diverse I mean four
of<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:47.930> enemies<00:00:48.260> that<00:00:48.410> you're<00:00:48.500> going<00:00:48.649> to<00:00:48.710> be

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
of the enemies that you're going to be

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.790 
of the enemies that you're going to be
fighting<00:00:49.070> you<00:00:49.820> can't<00:00:50.030> really<00:00:50.270> use<00:00:50.539> one

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
fighting you can't really use one

fighting you can't really use one
specialized<00:00:51.800> build<00:00:52.430> to<00:00:53.000> farm<00:00:53.570> all<00:00:53.840> of<00:00:54.019> them

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
specialized build to farm all of them

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.189 
specialized build to farm all of them
but<00:00:55.489> if<00:00:55.730> you're<00:00:55.910> not<00:00:56.180> going<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.510> use<00:00:56.690> something

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
but if you're not going to use something

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.290 
but if you're not going to use something
like<00:00:57.230> SOS<00:00:57.920> it<00:00:58.609> would<00:00:58.760> probably<00:00:59.030> be

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
like SOS it would probably be

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.380 
like SOS it would probably be
advantageous<00:00:59.949> to<00:01:00.949> use<00:01:01.609> something<00:01:02.090> that<00:01:02.120> hits

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
advantageous to use something that hits

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.470 
advantageous to use something that hits
through<00:01:02.660> blocks<00:01:02.960> because<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.940> assassins

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
through blocks because the assassins

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.350 
through blocks because the assassins
have<00:01:05.600> like<00:01:05.870> a<00:01:06.370> 5000<00:01:07.370> percent<00:01:07.460> chance<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:08.120> block

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
have like a 5000 percent chance to block

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.990 
have like a 5000 percent chance to block
and<00:01:08.950> whenever<00:01:09.950> they<00:01:10.250> do<00:01:10.310> they're<00:01:10.790> going<00:01:10.910> to

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
and whenever they do they're going to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.880 
and whenever they do they're going to
hit<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:11.270> for<00:01:11.420> 20<00:01:11.690> damage<00:01:11.870> so<00:01:12.410> you'll<00:01:12.590> slowly

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
hit you for 20 damage so you'll slowly

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.400 
hit you for 20 damage so you'll slowly
kill<00:01:13.190> yourself<00:01:13.580> as<00:01:13.730> you<00:01:13.820> attack<00:01:14.180> them<00:01:14.420> even<00:01:15.290> if

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
kill yourself as you attack them even if

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.590 
kill yourself as you attack them even if
you're<00:01:15.530> just<00:01:15.740> like<00:01:16.070> Wanda<00:01:16.850> ng<00:01:16.880> at<00:01:17.060> them<00:01:17.330> like

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
you're just like Wanda ng at them like

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.140 
you're just like Wanda ng at them like
using<00:01:17.869> a<00:01:18.049> staff<00:01:18.320> or<00:01:18.590> wand<00:01:18.829> and<00:01:19.130> hurling<00:01:19.820> balls

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
using a staff or wand and hurling balls

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.109 
using a staff or wand and hurling balls
of<00:01:20.420> magic<00:01:20.930> at<00:01:21.110> them<00:01:21.520> they'll<00:01:22.520> block<00:01:22.790> it<00:01:23.030> and

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
of magic at them they'll block it and

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.700 
of magic at them they'll block it and
hit<00:01:23.329> you<00:01:23.509> even<00:01:23.750> though<00:01:23.840> they're<00:01:24.020> like<00:01:24.170> 500

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
hit you even though they're like 500

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.649 
hit you even though they're like 500
feet<00:01:24.829> away<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.939> there's<00:01:26.479> that<00:01:26.810> um<00:01:28.390> also<00:01:29.390> you

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
feet away so there's that um also you

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.510 
feet away so there's that um also you
should<00:01:29.750> probably<00:01:30.020> bring<00:01:30.320> a<00:01:30.380> block<00:01:30.770> because

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
should probably bring a block because

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.580 
should probably bring a block because
there's<00:01:32.149> a<00:01:32.240> lot<00:01:32.299> of<00:01:32.420> physical<00:01:32.810> damage<00:01:33.350> and

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
there's a lot of physical damage and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.679 
there's a lot of physical damage and
blocking<00:01:34.549> would<00:01:34.700> help<00:01:34.939> a<00:01:35.240> lot<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:36.229> uh<00:01:37.689> Rangers

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
blocking would help a lot and uh Rangers

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.929 
blocking would help a lot and uh Rangers
they<00:01:39.530> don't<00:01:39.770> really<00:01:39.860> deal<00:01:40.340> a<00:01:40.369> lot<00:01:40.579> of<00:01:40.729> damage

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
they don't really deal a lot of damage

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.999 
they don't really deal a lot of damage
but<00:01:41.570> their<00:01:42.079> traps<00:01:42.469> are<00:01:42.710> kind<00:01:42.860> of<00:01:42.890> annoying

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
but their traps are kind of annoying

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.859 
but their traps are kind of annoying
especially<00:01:43.610> Viper's<00:01:44.299> nest<00:01:44.329> because<00:01:44.689> you

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
especially Viper's nest because you

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.840 
especially Viper's nest because you
won't<00:01:45.079> pass<00:01:45.290> it<00:01:45.500> just<00:01:45.680> explodes<00:01:46.189> on<00:01:46.430> you<00:01:46.670> hurt

down cripple sheet which makes it hard

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.920 
down cripple sheet which makes it hard
to<00:01:52.310> kite<00:01:52.579> if<00:01:52.850> that's<00:01:53.390> what<00:01:53.600> you're<00:01:53.750> going<00:01:53.840> to

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
to kite if that's what you're going to

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.109 
to kite if that's what you're going to

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
fight them um yes so in this part right

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.130 
fight them um yes so in this part right
here<00:02:02.600> sometimes<00:02:03.560> depending<00:02:04.399> on<00:02:04.810> what<00:02:05.810> time

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
here sometimes depending on what time

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.170 
here sometimes depending on what time
frame<00:02:06.530> it's<00:02:06.799> taking<00:02:07.189> you<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.430> farm<00:02:07.759> it<00:02:07.789> can<00:02:08.060> be

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
frame it's taking you to farm it can be

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.400 
frame it's taking you to farm it can be
a<00:02:08.210> little<00:02:08.390> difficult<00:02:08.539> because<00:02:08.960> the<00:02:09.200> groups

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
a little difficult because the groups

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.370 
a little difficult because the groups
will<00:02:09.740> punch<00:02:10.399> up<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.820> little<00:02:11.060> bit<00:02:11.210> so<00:02:11.900> if<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.290> do

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
will punch up a little bit so if you do

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.410 
will punch up a little bit so if you do
it<00:02:12.500> like<00:02:12.620> really<00:02:12.800> fast<00:02:13.220> then<00:02:14.120> they'll<00:02:14.390> be

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
it like really fast then they'll be

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.350 
it like really fast then they'll be
bunched<00:02:14.870> up<00:02:14.990> if<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.290> do<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.850> about<00:02:16.850> regular

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
bunched up if you do it about regular

bunched<00:04:14.730> up<00:04:14.880> and<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.120> have<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.300> go<00:04:15.390> into<00:04:15.540> a

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
bunched up and you have to go into a

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.449 
bunched up and you have to go into a
small<00:04:15.930> little<00:04:16.080> area<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:16.799> they'll<00:04:16.950> all<00:04:17.100> attack

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
small little area so they'll all attack

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.260 
small little area so they'll all attack
you<00:04:17.730> so<00:04:18.419> uh<00:04:19.340> it<00:04:20.340> takes<00:04:20.549> too<00:04:20.760> long<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:20.970> kill<00:04:21.180> him

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
you so uh it takes too long to kill him

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.880 
you so uh it takes too long to kill him
because<00:04:21.330> there's<00:04:21.570> just<00:04:21.720> so<00:04:22.020> many<00:04:22.230> enemies<00:04:22.500> in

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
because there's just so many enemies in

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.560 
because there's just so many enemies in
those<00:04:23.040> groups<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.520> they<00:04:23.580> just<00:04:23.760> bunch<00:04:24.000> up<00:04:24.240> so

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
those groups and they just bunch up so

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.600 
those groups and they just bunch up so
my<00:04:24.720> recommendation<00:04:24.930> would<00:04:25.440> be<00:04:25.590> to<00:04:25.980> actually

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
my recommendation would be to actually

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.600 
my recommendation would be to actually
just<00:04:27.419> map<00:04:27.900> travel<00:04:28.260> back<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.410> town<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:29.100> then

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
just map travel back to town and then

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.120 
just map travel back to town and then
start<00:04:29.970> over<00:04:30.360> after<00:04:30.540> you<00:04:31.350> kill<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.590> last<00:04:31.919> group

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
start over after you kill the last group

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.830 
start over after you kill the last group
of<00:04:32.280> three<00:04:32.460> Rangers<00:04:32.880> so<00:04:33.590> yeah<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:35.600> that's<00:04:36.600> it

of three Rangers so yeah and that's it

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.780
