00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
increase the amount of slots you get so

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.640 
increase the amount of slots you get so
it's<00:03:34.300> very<00:03:34.420> similar<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.780> monster<00:03:35.140> again<00:03:35.500> in

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
it's very similar to monster again in

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.009 
it's very similar to monster again in
that<00:03:35.800> regard<00:03:36.180> but<00:03:37.180> instead<00:03:37.630> of<00:03:37.750> actually

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
that regard but instead of actually

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.920 
that regard but instead of actually
crafting<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.799> things<00:03:39.069> your<00:03:39.670> skills<00:03:40.000> you<00:03:40.420> have

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
crafting the things your skills you have

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.680 
crafting the things your skills you have
to<00:03:41.260> just<00:03:42.040> like<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.220> drop<00:03:42.489> rate<00:03:42.700> from<00:03:43.360> enemies

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
to just like a drop rate from enemies

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.259 
to just like a drop rate from enemies
you<00:03:44.410> can<00:03:44.560> also<00:03:44.709> buy<00:03:45.250> some<00:03:45.880> of<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.060> lesser

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
you can also buy some of the lesser

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.360 
you can also buy some of the lesser
cards<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:47.410> ones<00:03:47.590> aren't<00:03:47.830> very<00:03:47.950> good<00:03:48.040> and

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
cards the ones aren't very good and

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.210 
cards the ones aren't very good and
trade<00:03:49.269> them<00:03:49.299> with<00:03:49.660> an<00:03:49.900> NPC<00:03:50.349> as<00:03:50.470> well<00:03:50.680> so<00:03:50.980> if<00:03:51.130> you

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
trade them with an NPC as well so if you

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.410 
trade them with an NPC as well so if you
have<00:03:51.370> some<00:03:51.580> available<00:03:52.000> that<00:03:52.180> you<00:03:52.239> don't

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
have some available that you don't

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.150 
have some available that you don't
really<00:03:52.510> need<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:53.290> can<00:03:53.440> swap<00:03:53.680> them<00:03:53.860> for<00:03:53.890> once

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
really need you can swap them for once

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.800 
really need you can swap them for once
there<00:03:54.370> might<00:03:54.580> be<00:03:54.610> more<00:03:55.150> suited<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.510> your<00:03:55.599> play

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
there might be more suited to your play

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.990 
there might be more suited to your play
style<00:03:56.019> a<00:03:56.230> lot<00:03:56.680> of<00:03:56.769> cards<00:03:57.040> also<00:03:57.250> have<00:03:57.489> negative

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
style a lot of cards also have negative

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.420 
style a lot of cards also have negative
effects<00:03:58.269> on<00:03:58.390> them<00:03:58.569> as<00:03:59.380> well<00:03:59.650> as<00:03:59.769> positive<00:04:00.130> so

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
effects on them as well as positive so

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.050 
effects on them as well as positive so
it<00:04:00.549> might<00:04:00.670> have<00:04:00.849> like<00:04:01.860> maybe<00:04:02.860> 22<00:04:03.250> damage<00:04:03.849> and

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
it might have like maybe 22 damage and

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.259 
it might have like maybe 22 damage and
then<00:04:04.150> maybe<00:04:04.510> like<00:04:05.489> less<00:04:06.489> health<00:04:06.760> or<00:04:06.940> something

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
then maybe like less health or something

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.319 
then maybe like less health or something

now I haven't actually talked about it
yet<00:04:58.970> but<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.420> combat<00:04:59.750> it's<00:05:00.290> fairly<00:05:00.530> similar

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
yet but the combat it's fairly similar

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.690 
yet but the combat it's fairly similar
to<00:05:01.720> dynasty<00:05:02.720> Warriors<00:05:03.110> not<00:05:03.770> not<00:05:04.250> like<00:05:04.550> the

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
to dynasty Warriors not not like the

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.860 
to dynasty Warriors not not like the
sense<00:05:04.910> of<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.090> game<00:05:05.240> and<00:05:05.420> a<00:05:05.480> lot<00:05:05.690> of<00:05:05.720> people

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
sense of the game and a lot of people

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.110 
sense of the game and a lot of people
don't<00:05:06.080> really<00:05:06.170> like<00:05:06.380> dynasty<00:05:06.740> Warriors<00:05:07.120> so

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
don't really like dynasty Warriors so

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.090 
don't really like dynasty Warriors so
dumb<00:05:08.300> AI<00:05:08.510> and<00:05:08.840> things<00:05:09.080> like<00:05:09.200> that<00:05:09.260> but<00:05:09.620> there

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
dumb AI and things like that but there

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.370 
dumb AI and things like that but there
we<00:05:10.160> go<00:05:10.280> is<00:05:10.340> down<00:05:10.400> but<00:05:11.390> it's<00:05:11.570> at<00:05:11.720> fairly<00:05:12.140> similar

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
we go is down but it's at fairly similar

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.770 
we go is down but it's at fairly similar
to<00:05:12.500> doing<00:05:12.650> some<00:05:12.800> oreos<00:05:13.010> whereas<00:05:13.340> triangle<00:05:13.880> is

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
to doing some oreos whereas triangle is

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.990 
to doing some oreos whereas triangle is
just<00:05:15.140> like<00:05:15.320> your<00:05:15.620> normal<00:05:15.770> attack<00:05:16.130> and<00:05:16.610> circle

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
just like your normal attack and circle

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.340 
just like your normal attack and circle
it's<00:05:17.120> like<00:05:17.270> a<00:05:17.300> strong<00:05:17.630> attack<00:05:17.870> button<00:05:18.200> and

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
it's like a strong attack button and

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.990 
it's like a strong attack button and
using<00:05:18.860> different<00:05:19.220> combinations<00:05:19.700> of<00:05:19.700> them

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
using different combinations of them

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.970 
using different combinations of them
like<00:05:20.630> say<00:05:20.780> three<00:05:21.110> hits<00:05:21.320> with<00:05:21.470> triangle<00:05:21.890> and

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
like say three hits with triangle and

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.300 
like say three hits with triangle and
inner<00:05:22.130> circle<00:05:22.520> will<00:05:22.700> do<00:05:22.820> different<00:05:23.210> moves<00:05:24.310> see

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
inner circle will do different moves see

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
inner circle will do different moves see
if<00:05:25.370> we<00:05:25.430> can<00:05:25.550> show<00:05:25.700> some<00:05:25.820> off<00:05:25.970> now<00:05:28.090> so<00:05:29.090> if<00:05:29.180> I<00:05:29.270> do

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
if we can show some off now so if I do

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.250 
if we can show some off now so if I do
for<00:05:31.210> ya<00:05:32.210> you<00:05:32.480> get<00:05:32.630> different<00:05:32.780> moves<00:05:33.080> so<00:05:33.170> you

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
for ya you get different moves so you

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.620 
for ya you get different moves so you
can<00:05:33.380> also<00:05:33.500> hold<00:05:33.770> down<00:05:33.950> circle<00:05:34.400> with<00:05:35.180> this<00:05:35.330> this

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
can also hold down circle with this this

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.050 
can also hold down circle with this this
is<00:05:35.780> exclusive<00:05:36.320> to<00:05:36.350> this<00:05:36.470> weapon<00:05:36.770> I<00:05:36.830> think<00:05:37.060> you

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
is exclusive to this weapon I think you

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.470 
is exclusive to this weapon I think you
can<00:05:38.210> do<00:05:38.330> all<00:05:38.540> sorts<00:05:38.570> of<00:05:38.780> different<00:05:38.930> attacks

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
can do all sorts of different attacks

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.270 
can do all sorts of different attacks
but<00:05:41.480> yeah<00:05:41.600> combat<00:05:42.440> list<00:05:42.590> seems<00:05:42.770> pretty<00:05:43.010> big

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
but yeah combat list seems pretty big

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.900 
but yeah combat list seems pretty big
and<00:05:43.850> it's<00:05:44.330> pretty<00:05:44.540> fun<00:05:44.870> it's<00:05:45.310> it<00:05:46.310> does<00:05:46.670> feel<00:05:46.700> a

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
and it's pretty fun it's it does feel a

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.790 
and it's pretty fun it's it does feel a
lot<00:05:47.150> like<00:05:47.360> sort<00:05:47.810> of<00:05:47.870> dinosauria<00:05:48.470> sort<00:05:48.740> of

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
lot like sort of dinosauria sort of

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.220 
lot like sort of dinosauria sort of
combat<00:05:49.010> system<00:05:49.340> but<00:05:49.490> obviously<00:05:50.030> the<00:05:50.900> enemies

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
combat system but obviously the enemies

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.750 
combat system but obviously the enemies
are<00:05:51.260> a<00:05:51.410> lot<00:05:51.590> more<00:05:51.620> intelligent<00:05:52.280> and<00:05:52.370> actually

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
are a lot more intelligent and actually

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.810 
are a lot more intelligent and actually
pose<00:05:52.940> a<00:05:52.970> challenge<00:05:54.400> so<00:05:55.400> there<00:05:55.580> you<00:05:55.610> have<00:05:55.670> it

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820

the first fight as you can see this menu
is<00:05:57.500> very<00:05:57.770> similar<00:05:57.950> to<00:05:58.070> one<00:05:58.250> side<00:05:58.460> of<00:05:58.490> yet<00:05:58.670> again
