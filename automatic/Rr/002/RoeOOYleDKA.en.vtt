00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
you're in this position notice how my

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.590 
you're in this position notice how my
hand<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.490> up<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:14.880> not<00:01:15.150> down<00:01:15.299> here

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600

the<00:01:18.960> dumb<00:01:19.140> roll<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.830> thumb<00:01:20.070> roll<00:01:20.220> caused<00:01:20.490> us

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the dumb roll the thumb roll caused us

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.660 
the dumb roll the thumb roll caused us
to<00:01:21.450> go<00:01:21.600> up<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.159> what's<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.549> to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
to go up so this is what's going to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.230 
to go up so this is what's going to
happen

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.530 

when<00:01:26.690> you<00:01:26.750> go<00:01:26.870> backwards<00:01:27.500> you<00:01:27.800> have<00:01:28.610> all<00:01:29.210> this

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
when you go backwards you have all this

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.600 
when you go backwards you have all this
weight<00:01:29.750> back<00:01:29.960> here<00:01:30.260> it's<00:01:31.070> going<00:01:31.190> to<00:01:31.280> help<00:01:31.400> you

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
weight back here it's going to help you

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.700 
weight back here it's going to help you
get<00:01:32.000> momentum<00:01:37.540> now<00:01:38.540> you're<00:01:38.720> backing<00:01:39.050> regular

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
get momentum now you're backing regular

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.630 
get momentum now you're backing regular

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
back so you're going to use all your

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:16.090 
back so you're going to use all your
wrist<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:09.290> push<00:02:09.500> back<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:14.890> momento<00:02:15.890> should

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
wrist to push back the momento should

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.190 
wrist to push back the momento should
carry<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.430> back<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.880> this<00:02:17.030> point<00:02:17.300> without

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
carry you back to this point without

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.260 
carry you back to this point without
having<00:02:18.380> properly<00:02:19.040> or<00:02:19.370> without<00:02:19.910> having<00:02:20.180> to

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
having properly or without having to

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:27.350 
having properly or without having to
push<00:02:20.630> with<00:02:20.840> your<00:02:20.870> middle<00:02:21.170> finger

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:36.490 

anyways<00:02:28.140> Oh<00:02:30.240> go<00:02:30.690> forward<00:02:30.990> middle<00:02:31.800> finger

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.080 

backwards<00:02:37.500> all<00:02:37.770> momentum<00:02:38.310> swinging<00:02:40.640> that<00:02:41.640> was

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
backwards all momentum swinging that was

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.620 
backwards all momentum swinging that was
awful

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
awful

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.940 
awful
dang<00:02:43.320> back<00:02:45.020> so<00:02:46.020> now<00:02:46.170> your<00:02:46.320> right<00:02:46.440> hand<00:02:46.710> it's

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
dang back so now your right hand it's

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.160 
dang back so now your right hand it's
essentially<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.610> same<00:02:47.640> concept<00:02:48.420> you're

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
essentially the same concept you're

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.670 
essentially the same concept you're
gonna<00:02:49.350> use<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.310> middle<00:02:50.490> finger<00:02:53.510> forward<00:02:54.680> and

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
gonna use the middle finger forward and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:06.280 
gonna use the middle finger forward and
then<00:02:55.830> go<00:02:55.860> backwards<00:03:01.760> momentum<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.170> risk

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
then go backwards momentum and you risk

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:15.470 
then go backwards momentum and you risk
all<00:03:07.760> in<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.940> wrist<00:03:11.060> okay<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.270> I<00:03:14.240> so<00:03:15.240> I<00:03:15.270> hope

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
all in the wrist okay so I so I hope
