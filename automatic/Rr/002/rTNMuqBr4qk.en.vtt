00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.610 
myself and there's not much of a
difference<00:02:18.850> between<00:02:19.420> last<00:02:19.900> month<00:02:20.260> or<00:02:20.500> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
difference between last month or the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.010 
difference between last month or the
last<00:02:20.800> two<00:02:21.070> months<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.580> did<00:02:22.030> have<00:02:22.360> some<00:02:22.720> kind<00:02:22.960> of

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
last two months I did have some kind of

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.540 
last two months I did have some kind of
a<00:02:23.110> mental<00:02:23.500> breakdown<00:02:23.560> though

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
a mental breakdown though

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.940 
a mental breakdown though
when<00:02:24.850> did<00:02:25.000> wardo<00:02:25.300> left<00:02:25.540> bed<00:02:25.930> six<00:02:26.500> months<00:02:26.800> on

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
when did wardo left bed six months on

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.010 
when did wardo left bed six months on
the<00:02:26.980> button<00:02:27.430> he<00:02:27.910> left<00:02:28.120> her<00:02:28.240> bed<00:02:28.390> he's<00:02:28.690> sleeping

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
the button he left her bed he's sleeping

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.250 
the button he left her bed he's sleeping
upstairs<00:02:29.260> in<00:02:29.560> his<00:02:29.680> room<00:02:29.740> now<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.570> think<00:02:32.020> it

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
upstairs in his room now and I think it

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.540 
upstairs in his room now and I think it
must<00:02:32.350> have<00:02:32.440> been<00:02:32.560> hormones<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.459> everything

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
must have been hormones and everything

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.770 
must have been hormones and everything
like<00:02:33.910> that<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:34.150> was<00:02:34.240> just<00:02:34.420> very<00:02:34.510> overwhelming

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
like that it was just very overwhelming

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.670 
like that it was just very overwhelming
and<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:35.560> cried<00:02:35.980> like<00:02:36.010> that<00:02:36.880> night<00:02:37.150> so<00:02:37.750> much<00:02:38.470> I

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
and I cried like that night so much I

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.910 
and I cried like that night so much I
cried<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:41.020> need<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.290> get<00:02:41.440> up<00:02:41.560> again

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
cried you need to get up again

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.040 
cried you need to get up again
I<00:02:42.180> think<00:02:43.180> it's<00:02:43.300> because<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.630> know<00:02:43.690> he's

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
I think it's because I know he's

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.720 
I think it's because I know he's
probably<00:02:44.260> gonna<00:02:44.470> be<00:02:44.620> our<00:02:44.709> last<00:02:44.920> baby<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.670> I

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
probably gonna be our last baby and I

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.180 
probably gonna be our last baby and I
just<00:02:46.000> oh<00:02:46.270> it<00:02:46.900> was<00:02:47.050> just<00:02:47.260> so<00:02:47.440> emotional<00:02:47.950> for<00:02:47.980> me

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
just oh it was just so emotional for me

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.370 
just oh it was just so emotional for me
and<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.459> just<00:02:48.670> sobbed<00:02:49.450> into<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:49.959> pillow<00:02:50.170> that

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
and I just sobbed into the pillow that

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.630 
and I just sobbed into the pillow that
night<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.770> then<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.980> next<00:02:51.010> day<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.340> was<00:02:51.580> fine

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
night and then the next day I was fine

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.270 
night and then the next day I was fine
aside<00:02:52.360> from<00:02:52.540> that<00:02:52.600> hormonal<00:02:53.290> II<00:02:53.500> my<00:02:54.070> face

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
aside from that hormonal II my face

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.310 
aside from that hormonal II my face
broke<00:02:54.580> out<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.510> think<00:02:55.780> that<00:02:56.050> was<00:02:56.170> probably

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
broke out so I think that was probably

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.100 
broke out so I think that was probably
related<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.130> that<00:02:57.250> but<00:02:58.120> there<00:02:58.270> was<00:02:58.450> one<00:02:58.810> other

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
related to that but there was one other

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.949 
related to that but there was one other
issue<00:02:59.620> that<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.640> wanted<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.060> talk<00:03:01.930> about

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
issue that I wanted to talk about

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.020 
issue that I wanted to talk about
because<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.470> had<00:03:02.770> said<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.520> in<00:03:03.640> my<00:03:03.670> last

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
because I had said it in my last

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.960 
because I had said it in my last
postpartum<00:03:04.600> update<00:03:04.959> but<00:03:05.200> then<00:03:05.350> I<00:03:05.440> ended<00:03:05.709> up

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
postpartum update but then I ended up

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.660 
postpartum update but then I ended up
meeting<00:03:06.970> again<00:03:07.360> up<00:03:07.660> I<00:03:08.140> ended<00:03:08.980> up<00:03:09.070> editing<00:03:09.549> it

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
meeting again up I ended up editing it

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.610 
meeting again up I ended up editing it
out<00:03:09.820> this<00:03:10.299> is<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.540> point<00:03:10.780> of<00:03:10.870> these<00:03:10.989> pregnancy

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
out this is the point of these pregnancy

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.170 
out this is the point of these pregnancy
and<00:03:11.769> postpartum<00:03:11.980> updates<00:03:12.670> is<00:03:12.850> that<00:03:13.060> they're

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
and postpartum updates is that they're

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.850

not text books you know they're just

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.650 
not text books you know they're just

these things and sharing with you guys I

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.229 
these things and sharing with you guys I
think<00:03:20.200> it's<00:03:20.440> really<00:03:20.560> interesting<00:03:20.650> if<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.580> get

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
think it's really interesting if you get

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.120 
think it's really interesting if you get
that<00:03:22.390> from<00:03:22.690> these<00:03:22.870> videos<00:03:23.049> one<00:03:23.739> of<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.920> issues

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
that from these videos one of the issues

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.430 
that from these videos one of the issues
that<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.310> had<00:03:24.549> after<00:03:24.880> having<00:03:25.269> Eduardo<00:03:25.720> and<00:03:26.350> I

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
that I had after having Eduardo and I

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.920 
that I had after having Eduardo and I
think<00:03:26.650> this<00:03:26.769> is<00:03:26.920> probably<00:03:27.160> because<00:03:27.850> I<00:03:28.209> had<00:03:28.600> two

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
think this is probably because I had two

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.570 
think this is probably because I had two
very<00:03:29.410> close<00:03:29.650> together<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.220> had<00:03:30.340> two

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
very close together and had two

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.270 
very close together and had two
back-to-back<00:03:30.820> so<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:31.840> hadn't<00:03:32.200> board<00:03:32.410> my<00:03:32.650> with

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
back-to-back so I hadn't board my with

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.979 
back-to-back so I hadn't board my with
my<00:03:33.400> second<00:03:33.760> pregnancy<00:03:33.880> after<00:03:34.630> my<00:03:34.720> second
