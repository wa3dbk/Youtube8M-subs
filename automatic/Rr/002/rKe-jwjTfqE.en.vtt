00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
Baker I got a pretty good idea oh by the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.980 
Baker I got a pretty good idea oh by the
way<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> support<00:00:27.029> I'm<00:00:27.660> gonna<00:00:27.840> have

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
way this is the support I'm gonna have

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.589 
way this is the support I'm gonna have
me<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> bearing<00:00:29.070> right<00:00:29.490> here<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:30.029> holds<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
me a bearing right here that holds the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.760 
me a bearing right here that holds the
axle<00:00:31.170> down<00:00:32.070> there<00:00:32.450> steady<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:34.350> kids<00:00:34.620> run

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
axle down there steady and kids run

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.610 
axle down there steady and kids run
smooth<00:00:35.239> now<00:00:36.239> my<00:00:36.480> backsplash<00:00:36.840> put<00:00:37.410> on<00:00:37.500> their

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
smooth now my backsplash put on their

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.020 
smooth now my backsplash put on their
wood<00:00:37.920> glue<00:00:38.100> I'm<00:00:38.219> about<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.489> sand<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:38.969> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
wood glue I'm about to sand it in a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.350 
wood glue I'm about to sand it in a
moment<00:00:39.440> but<00:00:40.440> let<00:00:40.559> me<00:00:40.620> go<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> axle<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:42.329> it

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
moment but let me go to the axle so it

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.060 
moment but let me go to the axle so it
was<00:00:42.750> about<00:00:42.899> three<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.290> half<00:00:43.440> inches<00:00:43.770> too<00:00:44.040> long

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
was about three and half inches too long

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.790 
was about three and half inches too long
so<00:00:44.789> what<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:44.969> did<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.050> went<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.289> my<00:00:46.379> dad's<00:00:46.559> shop

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
so what I did is I went to my dad's shop

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.529 
so what I did is I went to my dad's shop
we<00:00:47.010> cut<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.489> at<00:00:48.059> about<00:00:48.239> three<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.480> half

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
we cut this at about three and half

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.779 
we cut this at about three and half
inches<00:00:48.870> out<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.890> got<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.280> little<00:00:50.430> coupler

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
inches out and got this little coupler

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.660 
inches out and got this little coupler
from<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.090> conduit<00:00:51.420> section<00:00:51.840> electrical<00:00:52.670> part

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
from the conduit section electrical part

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.200 
from the conduit section electrical part
of<00:00:54.680> it<00:00:55.680> blows<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.690> 3/4<00:00:58.289> an<00:00:58.530> inch<00:00:59.210> here

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
of it blows and this is 3/4 an inch here

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.470 
of it blows and this is 3/4 an inch here
is<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> problem<00:01:01.190> how<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.250> get<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> flange<00:01:02.940> cuz

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
is the problem how to get a flange cuz

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.410 
is the problem how to get a flange cuz
we<00:01:03.600> were<00:01:03.719> gonna<00:01:03.899> use<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.140> pulley<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.610> course

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
we were gonna use a pulley but of course

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.370 
we were gonna use a pulley but of course
it<00:01:06.869> was<00:01:07.280> ended<00:01:08.280> up<00:01:08.400> being<00:01:08.610> easier<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.380> just

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
it was ended up being easier to just

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.130 
it was ended up being easier to just
find<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.680> flange<00:01:11.180> but<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.420> flange<00:01:12.720> does<00:01:13.020> not

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
find a flange but the flange does not

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.830 
find a flange but the flange does not
fit<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:14.130> threads<00:01:14.570> on<00:01:15.570> an<00:01:16.020> axle<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.840> wibbels

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
fit the threads on an axle so wibbels

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.300 
fit the threads on an axle so wibbels
sleeve<00:01:19.170> here<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> little<00:01:20.009> connector

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
sleeve here we have a little connector

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.620 
sleeve here we have a little connector
but<00:01:23.310> never<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.610> bag<00:01:23.850> without<00:01:24.060> see<00:01:24.299> exactly

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
but never the bag without see exactly

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.330 
but never the bag without see exactly
what's<00:01:24.900> called<00:01:29.990> well<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.170> still<00:01:31.439> set<00:01:31.950> screw

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
what's called well it's still set screw

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.899 
what's called well it's still set screw
coupling<00:01:32.810> well<00:01:33.810> anyway<00:01:34.369> that's<00:01:35.369> what<00:01:35.610> says<00:01:35.820> it

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
coupling well anyway that's what says it

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.420 
coupling well anyway that's what says it
says<00:01:36.060> there's<00:01:36.930> two<00:01:37.140> ends<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.680> there's<00:01:38.220> no

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
says there's two ends to this there's no

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.219 
says there's two ends to this there's no
grooves<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> inside<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.869> outside<00:01:39.900> it

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
grooves on the inside on the outside it

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.359 
grooves on the inside on the outside it
was<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.380> coupler<00:01:40.759> male<00:01:41.930> both<00:01:42.930> male<00:01:43.229> ends<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:44.100> we

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
was a coupler male both male ends so we

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.190 
was a coupler male both male ends so we
we<00:01:44.640> we<00:01:45.000> figured<00:01:45.390> if<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.509> did<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> tight<00:01:46.049> enough

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
we we figured if we did a tight enough

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.960 
we we figured if we did a tight enough
on<00:01:46.380> here<00:01:47.420> alright<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:49.259> would<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:50.280> could<00:01:50.520> self

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
on here alright it would it could self

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.260 
on here alright it would it could self
basically<00:01:51.840> self-tapping<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.799> screw<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.270> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
basically self-tapping this screw in the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.450 
basically self-tapping this screw in the
axle<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.979> there<00:01:56.219> pretty

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
axle on this and it is on there pretty

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.740 
axle on this and it is on there pretty
tight<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:57.180> they<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.570> got<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.719> flange<00:01:59.090> 3/4<00:02:00.090> 3/4

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
tight and they just got a flange 3/4 3/4

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.639 
tight and they just got a flange 3/4 3/4
and<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.920> actually<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:03.780> actually<00:02:03.810> fits<00:02:04.320> this

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
and it actually it actually fits this

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.550 
and it actually it actually fits this
right<00:02:04.860> here<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.159> course<00:02:05.990> we'll<00:02:06.990> go<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
right here of course we'll go on to the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.969 
right here of course we'll go on to the
Majestic<00:02:08.129> will<00:02:08.569> which<00:02:09.569> will<00:02:09.780> spin<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.890> a
