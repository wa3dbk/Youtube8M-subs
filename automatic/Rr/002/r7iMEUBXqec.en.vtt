but<00:00:16.590> in<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.800> first<00:00:17.070> pack<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.730> do<00:00:17.820> not

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
but in this first pack I do not

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.710 
but in this first pack I do not
recognize<00:00:18.570> which<00:00:19.560> name<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.310> was<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:20.970> it

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
recognize which name that was so it

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.660 
recognize which name that was so it
looks<00:00:21.930> like<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.230> don't<00:00:22.410> get<00:00:22.650> any<00:00:22.890> rare<00:00:23.310> players

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
pretty much day where you you know just

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.130 
pretty much day where you you know just
kind<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.479> give<00:01:37.110> respect<00:01:37.650> back<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.479> about<00:01:39.479> your

kind of give respect back and about your
maybe<00:01:40.920> your<00:01:41.159> troops<00:01:41.579> or<00:01:41.820> anything<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.509> you

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
maybe your troops or anything that you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.600 
maybe your troops or anything that you
guys<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:43.049> their<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.290> don't<00:01:43.500> know<00:01:43.619> exactly<00:01:44.310> how

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
guys have their I don't know exactly how

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.289 
guys have their I don't know exactly how
the<00:01:45.210> UK<00:01:45.540> does<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.820> well<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.850> think<00:01:48.000> that

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
the UK does that and well I think that

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.179 
the UK does that and well I think that
name<00:01:48.540> was<00:01:48.780> cool<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.140> popped<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:49.920> he's

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
name was cool that popped up he's

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.490 
name was cool that popped up he's
probably<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.640> Chelsea<00:01:51.060> left<00:01:51.299> back<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.140> he's

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
probably the Chelsea left back and he's

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.490 
probably the Chelsea left back and he's
84<00:01:53.189> overall<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.030> probably<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.780> good<00:01:54.869> pool

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
84 overall this is probably a good pool

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.380 
84 overall this is probably a good pool
I'm<00:01:55.710> guessing<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.369> early<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.210> year<00:01:57.360> i

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
I'm guessing this early on the year i

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.090 
I'm guessing this early on the year i
think<00:01:57.509> i'm<00:01:57.990> almost<00:01:58.200> certain<00:01:58.469> girls<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:58.920> over

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
think i'm almost certain girls for over

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.249 
think i'm almost certain girls for over
twenty<00:01:59.399> thousand<00:01:59.729> coins<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> good

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
twenty thousand coins so that is a good

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.319 
twenty thousand coins so that is a good
pool<00:02:01.530> right<00:02:01.710> there<00:02:01.820> ashley<00:02:02.820> cole<00:02:03.119> from

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
pool right there ashley cole from
