00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
iPads gonna move around also it's kind

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.670

of<00:03:10.510> difficult<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.870> see<00:03:11.020> from<00:03:11.170> this<00:03:11.260> angle<00:03:11.470> but

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
of difficult to see from this angle but

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.950 
of difficult to see from this angle but
if<00:03:11.860> you've<00:03:12.010> laid<00:03:12.220> down<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:13.510> eye<00:03:13.540> guy<00:03:13.900> it

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
if you've laid down the eye guy it

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.110 
if you've laid down the eye guy it
doesn't<00:03:14.230> lay<00:03:14.560> down<00:03:14.800> flat<00:03:15.190> just<00:03:15.640> because<00:03:15.940> the

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
doesn't lay down flat just because the

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.420 
doesn't lay down flat just because the
way<00:03:16.240> the<00:03:16.420> case<00:03:16.660> is<00:03:16.870> designed<00:03:17.080> it'll<00:03:18.040> slope

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
way the case is designed it'll slope

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.280 
way the case is designed it'll slope
downwards<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.120> little<00:03:19.330> bit<00:03:19.480> once<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:19.930> put<00:03:20.140> the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
downwards a little bit once you put the

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.440 
downwards a little bit once you put the
iPad<00:03:20.620> in<00:03:20.800> there<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.010> lay<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.250> down<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:22.000> so

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
iPad in there and lay it down and so

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.240 
iPad in there and lay it down and so

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
hole for the charge port is a little

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.280 
hole for the charge port is a little
difficult<00:03:40.330> to<00:03:40.390> get<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:40.720> you<00:03:40.810> have<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.050> raise<00:03:41.260> up

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
difficult to get to you have to raise up

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.170 
difficult to get to you have to raise up
a<00:03:41.560> little<00:03:41.709> arm<00:03:41.920> on<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.130> side<00:03:42.160> but<00:03:42.700> doing<00:03:43.030> that

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
a little arm on the side but doing that

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.630 
a little arm on the side but doing that
bends<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.780> rubber<00:03:44.110> and<00:03:44.380> change<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.310> shape<00:03:45.520> of

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
bends the rubber and change the shape of

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.490 
bends the rubber and change the shape of
the<00:03:45.760> port<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:46.270> it's<00:03:46.420> I'm<00:03:47.050> not<00:03:47.110> going<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:47.440> say

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
the port so it's I'm not going to say

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.190 
the port so it's I'm not going to say
it's<00:03:47.650> impossible<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:48.670> charge<00:03:49.270> the<00:03:49.510> iPad<00:03:49.630> while

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
it's impossible to charge the iPad while

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.420 
it's impossible to charge the iPad while
this<00:03:50.380> is<00:03:50.500> installed<00:03:50.800> but<00:03:51.010> it's<00:03:51.160> pretty

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
this is installed but it's pretty

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.199 
this is installed but it's pretty
difficult<00:03:51.640> and<00:03:52.060> it<00:03:52.600> takes<00:03:52.810> a<00:03:52.930> long<00:03:53.080> time

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
difficult and it takes a long time

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.300 
difficult and it takes a long time
so<00:03:55.209> overall<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:56.020> eye<00:03:56.050> guy<00:03:56.440> for<00:03:56.709> iPad<00:03:57.040> is<00:03:57.280> a

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
so overall the eye guy for iPad is a

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.080 
so overall the eye guy for iPad is a
good<00:03:57.640> quality<00:03:58.570> accessory<00:03:59.230> if<00:03:59.380> you<00:03:59.530> want<00:03:59.770> your

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090
