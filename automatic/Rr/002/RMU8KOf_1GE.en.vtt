one of the things that's most overlooked

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.500

in<00:00:18.869> any<00:00:19.170> carry<00:00:19.500> system<00:00:20.039> but<00:00:20.640> maybe<00:00:20.880> one<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
in any carry system but maybe one of the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.060 
in any carry system but maybe one of the
most<00:00:21.689> viable<00:00:21.990> things<00:00:22.410> particularly<00:00:22.890> if

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
most viable things particularly if

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.250

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
you're carrying heavy guns so it's very

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.080

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.520 
properly and just very impressive I
think<00:05:33.330> that's<00:05:33.690> something<00:05:33.930> selection<00:05:34.470> to

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
think that's something selection to

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.810 
think that's something selection to
consider<00:05:34.950> if<00:05:35.070> you're<00:05:35.160> gonna<00:05:35.280> carry<00:05:35.580> a<00:05:35.640> gun

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.090 
consider if you're gonna carry a gun
regular<00:05:36.420> basis<00:05:36.870> I<00:05:36.990> think<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.590> belts<00:05:37.920> in<00:05:38.040> the

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
regular basis I think the belts in the

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.220 
regular basis I think the belts in the
central<00:05:38.520> part<00:05:38.790> of<00:05:38.940> that<00:05:39.060> carry<00:05:39.330> system<00:05:39.840> it's

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
central part of that carry system it's

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.260 
central part of that carry system it's
very<00:05:40.380> important<00:05:41.010> to<00:05:41.070> get<00:05:41.190> a<00:05:41.220> good<00:05:41.430> belt<00:05:41.700> and<00:05:41.970> I
