probably familiar with the Bushnell
elite<00:00:27.740> 6500<00:00:28.740> series<00:00:28.949> which<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.760> pretty<00:00:30.000> much

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
elite 6500 series which is pretty much

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.209 
elite 6500 series which is pretty much
the<00:00:30.359> pinnacle<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.929> our<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.410> our<00:00:31.529> hunting

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
the pinnacle of our of our hunting

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.360 
the pinnacle of our of our hunting
optics<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.660> then<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.290> also<00:00:34.440> had<00:00:34.739> Bush

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
optics and then we have also had Bush

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.459 
optics and then we have also had Bush
the<00:00:35.700> regular<00:00:36.000> Bushnell<00:00:36.390> elite<00:00:36.420> line<00:00:36.870> we're

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the regular Bushnell elite line we're

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.020 
the regular Bushnell elite line we're
actually<00:00:37.829> separating<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.579> out<00:00:38.700> we're<00:00:38.940> gonna

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
actually separating it out we're gonna

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.060 
actually separating it out we're gonna
have<00:00:39.149> three<00:00:39.750> levels<00:00:40.110> we're<00:00:40.590> gonna<00:00:40.680> make<00:00:40.920> it

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
have three levels we're gonna make it

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.310 
have three levels we're gonna make it
easier<00:00:41.340> for<00:00:41.370> people<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.969> understand<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.989> 20

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
easier for people to understand the 20

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.319 
easier for people to understand the 20
different<00:00:43.649> options<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> elite<00:00:44.700> line<00:00:44.910> that

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
different options in the elite line that

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.670 
different options in the elite line that
can<00:00:45.480> be<00:00:45.510> almost<00:00:45.690> overwhelming<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.559> have

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
can be almost overwhelming you have

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.869 
can be almost overwhelming you have
twenty<00:00:46.980> schools<00:00:47.160> which<00:00:47.520> once<00:00:47.730> you're<00:00:47.850> not

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
twenty schools which once you're not

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.910 
twenty schools which once you're not
exactly<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.899> we're<00:00:49.020> gonna<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.590> Bushnell

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
exactly so we're gonna have the Bushnell

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.880 
exactly so we're gonna have the Bushnell
elite<00:00:50.090> 3500<00:00:51.090> series<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.690> three<00:00:52.590> times

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
elite 3500 series is three times

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
magnification

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.569 
magnification
it<00:00:54.090> has<00:00:54.570> our<00:00:54.840> rain<00:00:55.050> guard<00:00:55.260> HD<00:00:55.739> coating<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.399> has

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
it has our rain guard HD coating it has

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.090 
it has our rain guard HD coating it has
lead-free<00:00:57.300> glass<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.440> very<00:00:58.649> high-end

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
lead-free glass it's a very high-end

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.360 
lead-free glass it's a very high-end
optic<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.420> we've<00:01:00.840> also<00:01:01.070> compacted<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.100> size

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
optic and we've also compacted the size

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.460 
optic and we've also compacted the size
down<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.910> year<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.329> totally<00:01:03.899> new<00:01:03.930> scope

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
down this year it's a totally new scope

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.730 
down this year it's a totally new scope
and<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:05.309> 25<00:01:05.970> percent<00:01:06.000> smaller<00:01:06.869> than<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
and it's 25 percent smaller than the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.890 
and it's 25 percent smaller than the
previous<00:01:07.920> Bushnell<00:01:08.520> elites<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.330> then<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.720> can

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
previous Bushnell elites and then we can

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.929 
previous Bushnell elites and then we can
step<00:01:10.170> up<00:01:10.350> one<00:01:10.530> more<00:01:10.740> step<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.760> would<00:01:11.850> be

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
step up one more step and that would be

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.630 
step up one more step and that would be
the<00:01:12.150> Bushnell<00:01:12.540> elite<00:01:12.920> 4500<00:01:13.920> series<00:01:14.340> there's

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
the Bushnell elite 4500 series there's

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.580 
the Bushnell elite 4500 series there's
about<00:01:15.090> eight<00:01:15.330> or<00:01:15.479> nine<00:01:15.509> depending<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.380> which

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
about eight or nine depending on which

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.820 
about eight or nine depending on which
reticles<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.820> configurations<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.720> want<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
reticles and configurations you want the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.410 
reticles and configurations you want the
4500<00:01:20.729> series<00:01:21.090> again<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.990> going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.470> our

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
4500 series again is going to have our

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.840 
4500 series again is going to have our
rain<00:01:24.420> garden<00:01:24.570> HD<00:01:24.750> coating<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.670> it's<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.759> to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
rain garden HD coating and it's going to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.179 
rain garden HD coating and it's going to
have<00:01:26.970> four<00:01:27.240> times<00:01:27.270> magnification<00:01:28.040> so<00:01:29.040> it's

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
have four times magnification so it's

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.660 
have four times magnification so it's
going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:30.920> series<00:01:31.920> three<00:01:32.159> power<00:01:32.369> to

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
going to have a series three power to

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.149 
going to have a series three power to
4500<00:01:33.540> series<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:33.990> pollen<00:01:34.350> yep<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.770> then

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
4500 series for pollen yep and then

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.560 
4500 series for pollen yep and then
again<00:01:35.430> if<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.670> want<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.850> step<00:01:36.060> up<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.390> the

you're<00:01:50.880> trying<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.210> explain<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.920> 30

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
you're trying to explain this the 30

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.770 
you're trying to explain this the 30
millimeter<00:01:53.490> tube<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> more<00:01:54.180> durable<00:01:54.570> tube

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
millimeter tube is a more durable tube

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.469 
millimeter tube is a more durable tube
but<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.439> also<00:01:55.560> gives<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.950> more<00:01:56.009> range<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:57.299> move

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
but it also gives you more range to move

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.300 
but it also gives you more range to move
the<00:01:57.659> reticle<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.320> for<00:01:58.560> long-range<00:01:58.979> shooting

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
the reticle so for long-range shooting

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.830 
the reticle so for long-range shooting
that's<00:01:59.549> where<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.880> 30<00:02:00.180> millimeter<00:02:00.540> tubes

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
that's where the 30 millimeter tubes

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.090 
that's where the 30 millimeter tubes
