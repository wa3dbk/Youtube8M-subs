00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 and everyone I come back to you with 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.940
 some very simple ideas and very 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.950
 greedy for the snack 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.320
 so in this case the first recipe 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.349
 it's just a skewer of 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.980
 Strawberry banana with punks is topped 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.020
 Nutella 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.300
 so it's very simple so you'll have 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.250
 need these fruits a little help there 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.510
 and I bought a preparation already 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.310
 ready at lidl 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.050
 if they really wanted a real 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.580
 recipe in quotation marks I put the link 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.580
 to the video she liked cup 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.899
 you really do toddlers 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.520
 pancake in your canvas or in 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.040
 the occurrence for me it will be my plancha 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:46.739
 and here it is cooked in two small 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:48.090
 seconds it's very very simple and that's it 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.320
 the result I do not know what you 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.690
 think about it but in any case I can you 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.520
 to say she was delicious second 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.309
 recipe is gone for pancakes to 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.539
 the pineapple so nothing very complicated 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.559
 you need pineapple slices 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.020
 can be found in a tin 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.670
 in the supermarkets of a 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.559
 pancake mix this time 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.570
 I took scene at home crossroads and 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.600
 I reduced the quantities by half for 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.100
 have a much thicker dough and 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.740
 then here you will need some 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.840
 fred so you cheat the weird pineapple 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.570
 actually in the pancake mix 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.799
 and then put her on your stove 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.210
 or on your plancha 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.420
 there is only a small added 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.369
 preparation layer on top by 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.080
 against really good advice it's 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.119
 to wait for it to be well cooked if not 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.619
 it's going to be raw inside gold at 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.600
 level of the pineapple hole 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.970
 so do not hesitate to leave a small 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.770
 little more time than usual you are 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.840
 would have seen it's a very very recipe 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.689
 fast and with a few pieces of 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.920
 fruit his coming right away in 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.540
 third recipes are skewers 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.729
 banana choco scam that gives 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.280
 really want i simply 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.799
 jail 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.110
 chocolate bananas already badly or a 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.790
 little little nutella and voila 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.799
 for the mellowness it was a preparation 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.780
 carpeaux I am not very good 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.729
 cooker so that's it but you have 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.920
 full of recipes on the internet of 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.020
 banana slices of marshmallows and 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.880
 the cops with a tiny 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.069
 private led cookie cutter a little bit of 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.080
 soft and it gives small circles 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.319
 it's super pretty and it's really the 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.630
 ideal size from kana 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.400
 this and there is more than assembling the 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.840
 tripled it's really very very simple 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.709
 as I wanted to say it's really for 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.810
 I wanted to show you 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.860
 do you know if the fee is you 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.860
 receive the world for example 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.230
 for a much more greedy touch 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.660
 that I decided to add such a 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.400
 to and some little sweet pearls and 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.400
 thing that rendering is too young 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.099
 last recipes it's about panic 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.620
 exclude nutella and I think it's my 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.270
 recipe that terry had that first 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.280
 so it's very simple I took a 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.760
 pancake preparation at cap frau 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.709

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.260

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.110
 preparation key to fann than ex by 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.760
 on top we just add to that so a 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.010
 little nutella funds of locle backpack 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.440
 what you want and especially do not need 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.420
 that the nutella burns it is absolutely necessary 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.370

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.870
 pancakes on serves milestone mans 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.870
 essential to the recipe 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.180
 I 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.290
 once again for this greedy side 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.910
 I added units the end of the game but 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.860
 it's really not necessary so it 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.390
 There is some inside but I had 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.310
 about for decoration 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.650

 fruits in this case here these are 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.220
