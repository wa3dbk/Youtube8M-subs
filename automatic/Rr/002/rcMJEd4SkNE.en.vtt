that up you can delete that one where a

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.250 
that up you can delete that one where a
file<00:05:05.300> if<00:05:05.419> you<00:05:05.450> want<00:05:05.630> but<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:05.870> would<00:05:06.020> just<00:05:06.140> keep

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.810 
file if you want but I would just keep
my<00:05:06.500> documents<00:05:06.980> just<00:05:07.130> for<00:05:07.340> reference<00:05:07.490> in<00:05:07.790> case

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
my documents just for reference in case

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.430 
my documents just for reference in case
you<00:05:08.240> accidentally<00:05:08.690> believe<00:05:08.990> this<00:05:09.229> one

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
you accidentally believe this one

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.110 
you accidentally believe this one
because<00:05:09.950> this<00:05:10.100> contains<00:05:10.490> all<00:05:10.669> the<00:05:10.760> stuff<00:05:10.970> that

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
because this contains all the stuff that

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.580 
because this contains all the stuff that
you<00:05:11.210> need<00:05:11.360> to<00:05:11.390> actually<00:05:11.810> play<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:11.990> game<00:05:12.260> so<00:05:12.470> if

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
you need to actually play the game so if

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.260 
you need to actually play the game so if
you<00:05:12.710> actually<00:05:13.040> delete<00:05:13.370> one<00:05:13.820> of<00:05:13.910> these<00:05:14.030> random

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
you actually delete one of these random

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.420 
you actually delete one of these random
files<00:05:14.720> right<00:05:14.990> here<00:05:15.020> that<00:05:15.470> mostly<00:05:15.979> won't<00:05:16.220> even

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
files right here that mostly won't even

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.010 
files right here that mostly won't even
recognize<00:05:16.820> and<00:05:17.060> know<00:05:17.150> what<00:05:17.300> they<00:05:17.419> are<00:05:17.600> you

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
recognize and know what they are you

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.940 
recognize and know what they are you
don't<00:05:18.110> have<00:05:18.260> to<00:05:18.350> touch<00:05:18.470> them<00:05:18.710> but<00:05:18.740> if<00:05:18.919> you

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
don't have to touch them but if you

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.250 
don't have to touch them but if you
actually<00:05:19.160> move<00:05:19.580> them<00:05:19.820> or<00:05:20.060> delete<00:05:20.240> them<00:05:20.510> it'll

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
actually move them or delete them it'll

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.080 
actually move them or delete them it'll
just<00:05:21.500> make<00:05:21.650> the<00:05:21.800> game<00:05:21.830> unstable<00:05:22.580> and<00:05:22.790> probably

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
just make the game unstable and probably

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.360 
just make the game unstable and probably
unplayable<00:05:23.390> because<00:05:23.810> you<00:05:23.870> won't<00:05:23.960> run<00:05:24.200> okay<00:05:25.100> so

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
unplayable because you won't run okay so

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.850 
unplayable because you won't run okay so
now<00:05:26.120> we<00:05:26.180> see<00:05:26.479> a<00:05:26.510> lot<00:05:26.750> of<00:05:26.780> raw<00:05:27.050> files<00:05:27.350> here<00:05:27.680> that

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
now we see a lot of raw files here that

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.650 
now we see a lot of raw files here that
you<00:05:27.950> won't<00:05:28.130> see<00:05:28.370> if<00:05:28.550> you<00:05:28.700> actually<00:05:28.940> got<00:05:29.330> a<00:05:29.360> game

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
you won't see if you actually got a game

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.840 
you won't see if you actually got a game
off<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:29.930> CV<00:05:30.470> but<00:05:30.979> a<00:05:31.040> lot<00:05:31.220> of<00:05:31.340> these<00:05:31.400> files<00:05:31.640> say

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
off the CV but a lot of these files say

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.850 
off the CV but a lot of these files say
and<00:05:32.090> actually<00:05:32.240> all<00:05:32.630> these<00:05:32.900> files<00:05:33.200> except<00:05:33.680> one

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
and actually all these files except one

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.320 
and actually all these files except one
you<00:05:34.010> don't<00:05:34.160> need<00:05:34.280> to<00:05:34.340> worry<00:05:34.550> about<00:05:34.610> all<00:05:35.030> you

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
which is application to launch the game

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.480 
which is application to launch the game
plan<00:05:39.260> you<00:05:39.500> do<00:05:39.650> is<00:05:39.710> just<00:05:39.890> double<00:05:40.070> click<00:05:40.310> on<00:05:40.430> it

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
and then I'll just run on the console

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.400 
and then I'll just run on the console
