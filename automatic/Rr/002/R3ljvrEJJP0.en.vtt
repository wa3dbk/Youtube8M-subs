the wind you know the fly rod was gonna
come<00:00:53.010> out<00:00:53.130> later<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.750> know<00:00:55.140> that's<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
come out later so you know that's a

pretty big thing with the fly in a windy

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.050 
pretty big thing with the fly in a windy
conditions<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:59.520> know<00:00:59.610> once<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.850> get<00:00:59.940> an

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
conditions if you know once we get an

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.570 
conditions if you know once we get an
official<00:01:00.150> pull<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.690> fly<00:01:00.900> rod<00:01:01.110> out<00:01:01.520> wasn't<00:01:02.520> a

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
official pull the fly rod out wasn't a

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.759 
official pull the fly rod out wasn't a
really<00:01:02.910> great<00:01:03.180> scenario<00:01:03.810> for<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.259> very

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
really great scenario for that very

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.280 
really great scenario for that very
often<00:01:05.299> so<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> flower<00:01:06.689> odds<00:01:06.840> stayed<00:01:07.110> below

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
often so the flower odds stayed below

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.490 
often so the flower odds stayed below
but<00:01:08.160> the<00:01:09.090> times<00:01:09.330> they<00:01:09.510> did<00:01:09.690> come<00:01:09.870> out<00:01:10.050> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
but the times they did come out the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.350 
but the times they did come out the
spinning<00:01:10.890> tackle<00:01:11.040> went<00:01:11.400> below<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.030> was<00:01:12.120> out

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
spinning tackle went below so it was out

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.760 
spinning tackle went below so it was out
of<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.600> picture<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.320> think<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.590> really

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
of the picture and I think it's really

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.810 
of the picture and I think it's really
important<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> think<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> lot<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.490> kayak

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
important I think a lot of kayak

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.010 
important I think a lot of kayak
fishermen<00:01:15.120> there's<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.420> much<00:01:15.570> stuff<00:01:15.780> outside

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
fishermen there's so much stuff outside

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.710 
fishermen there's so much stuff outside

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
the kayak they you know they lose that

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.480 
the kayak they you know they lose that

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
opportunity to keep their boat plant you

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.300 
opportunity to keep their boat plant you
know<00:01:20.580> both<00:01:20.790> free<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.960> snags<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.980> all<00:01:23.100> that
