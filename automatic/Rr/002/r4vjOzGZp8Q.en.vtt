00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.999
 of those water bottles of 5 and 10 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.999
 liters 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:59.629

00:00:53.469 --> 00:01:02.120
 tool and this is a graph 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:06.200
 he is an instrument that uses the heat to 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:10.460
 You cut things, it's this affection. 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.880
 here invested with cork to you 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.479
 do not burn this whole part when 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.000
 you call he accepted he calls 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.750
 this means that it is not an instrument 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.740
 for kid ok 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.200
 here we have his bowls 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.100
 basically a lot of sand neither for you 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:39.920
 is to exchange ideas for the kitchen draw a 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:43.130
 on each side and you change the people 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.229
 is also fulfilled here and if it is fulfilled 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.460
 is to use at your station 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:55.420
 usually we use only one or two 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:02:01.460
 people here have also a lot of 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.800
 suggestion of angel's drawing idea 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.180
 for us to use on 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:11.750
 work and that's just the flash 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.730
 and my desire is very good, but if you 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.360
 do not wanna do it if you do not want 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:23.000
 pass embarrassment 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:26.990
 The good way is for you to pick up a 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.660
 and touch the screen of the 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:35.500
 computer 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.500
 be careful not to 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.380
 not to ruin your screen than 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:49.670
 your computer 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:52.070
 but then you use plastic there you can 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.600
 use plastic and you can also use 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:02.080
 a pen can should not use a pen 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.080
 is of the permanent marker type 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:14.810
 well then some of the drawings that I 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:21.650
 I've been looking at copying and inspiring myself 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:24.470
 serious to this our class today you 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:30.230
 can see the idea that I said 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:33.130
 previously to touch a piece of 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.010
 Plastic any plastic baggie 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:40.070
 those who come around the magazine in the 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:46.220
 your supermarket fruit packing 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:49.820
 there you will use the permanent marker and 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.980
 you will lean against your 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.730
 computer as the wings are more 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:04:01.340
 complicated are more difficult I copied 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:04.930
 with them right on the computer should 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.989
 you do not have to like one of those 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.630
 of those basic programs that come 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:14.170
 thousand pictures said 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:19.060
 that of that other one has no problem 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:23.680
 always have one always have some website to 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:31.300
 where you can is get this kind of 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:35.820
 image on the internet ok I'll have one 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.820
 idea I saw another day on the internet 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:13.900
 seems to work now, just give a 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.900
 here and here 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:39.810
 is that it can enter here is cia 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:06:00.020
 well beyond the angel 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.020
 We're going to star 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:10.040
 this is the packaging of a refrigerator 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.290
 and this is what we will use to do 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.290
 the stars 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:34.890
 This one is going to be the star of the 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:37.160
 tree and the rest we 'll put 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:41.550
 in the rest of the tree 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:46.410
 so let's remember is to count the darkness 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:48.540
 It's very simple that getting two more 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:52.140
 This will depend on the size of the 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:57.530
 you will use and also the gauge 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.530
 absurd you in my case I'm using two 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:08.790
 neither here as you can see I did 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:13.490
 a clipping that is what we are 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.490
 not use to give volume in this she 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:20.760
 Good, I usually wear one myself. 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:25.080
 To do this happens that he just 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:28.460
 talk then we will use a 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.460
 fruit knife
