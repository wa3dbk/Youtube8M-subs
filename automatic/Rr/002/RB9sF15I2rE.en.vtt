00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
we're going to Google no DC then we are

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:38.020 
we're going to Google no DC then we are
going<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.920> grab<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.970> 1.6<00:00:24.869> beta<00:00:26.090> and<00:00:28.910> we'll<00:00:29.910> get

already<00:01:00.520> have<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:01.890> go<00:01:02.890> over<00:01:03.010> here<00:01:03.430> you<00:01:04.270> just<00:01:04.800> go

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
already have it go over here you just go

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.130 
already have it go over here you just go
to<00:01:06.340> null<00:01:06.550> DC<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.680> you<00:01:09.580> extract<00:01:10.180> to<00:01:10.780> whatever

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
to null DC and you extract to whatever

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:20.010 
to null DC and you extract to whatever
folder<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:11.950> then<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:14.080> will<00:01:14.260> have<00:01:14.290> a<00:01:19.020> series

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
folder and then you will have a series

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:27.020 
folder and then you will have a series
of<00:01:21.750> folders<00:01:24.000> okay<00:01:25.000> before<00:01:25.510> you<00:01:26.050> can<00:01:26.380> run<00:01:26.560> this

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
of folders okay before you can run this

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.020 
of folders okay before you can run this
you<00:01:28.030> need<00:01:28.300> to<00:01:28.660> grab<00:01:28.960> the<00:01:29.229> bios<00:01:29.619> files<00:01:29.950> I'm<00:01:30.430> not

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
you need to grab the bios files I'm not

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.690 
you need to grab the bios files I'm not
going<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:31.300> tell<00:01:31.510> you<00:01:31.540> where<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.869> get<00:01:32.110> them<00:01:32.700> but

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
going to tell you where to get them but

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.300 
going to tell you where to get them but
you<00:01:33.880> just<00:01:34.060> name<00:01:34.330> them<00:01:35.010> DC<00:01:36.010> boot<00:01:36.690> GC<00:01:37.690> flash<00:01:38.310> like

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
you just name them DC boot GC flash like

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.910 
you just name them DC boot GC flash like
so<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.710> then<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:43.420> about<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:43.780> then<00:01:44.770> you'll

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
so and then it's about it then you'll

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.090 
so and then it's about it then you'll
open<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.280> emulator

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
open the emulator

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.789 
open the emulator
and<00:01:47.420> you<00:01:48.420> will<00:01:49.280> select<00:01:50.280> your<00:01:50.610> plug-in

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
and you will select your plug-in

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.380 
and you will select your plug-in
depending<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:52.950> what<00:01:53.280> your<00:01:53.430> configuration<00:01:54.270> you

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
depending on what your configuration you

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.460 
depending on what your configuration you
have<00:01:54.689> your<00:01:55.560> easy<00:01:55.860> there<00:01:56.100> joystick<00:01:56.759> or<00:01:57.470> your

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
have your easy there joystick or your

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.520 
have your easy there joystick or your
keyboard<00:01:59.420> there's<00:02:00.420> also<00:02:00.659> network<00:02:01.140> play<00:02:01.350> but

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
keyboard there's also network play but

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.570 
keyboard there's also network play but
it's<00:02:01.649> kind<00:02:01.830> of<00:02:01.860> buggy<00:02:04.100> so<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.190> can<00:02:05.369> figure

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
it's kind of buggy so you can figure

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.350 
it's kind of buggy so you can figure
that<00:02:05.790> then<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.810> go<00:02:06.960> into<00:02:07.289> your<00:02:07.789> video<00:02:08.789> options

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
that then you go into your video options

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.940 
that then you go into your video options
you<00:02:09.600> get<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.959> full<00:02:10.200> screen<00:02:10.530> screen

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
you get that full screen screen

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.750 
you get that full screen screen
resolution<00:02:12.380> extra<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.650> know<00:02:13.680> geometry<00:02:14.250> stuff

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
resolution extra you know geometry stuff

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.160 
resolution extra you know geometry stuff
and<00:02:16.430> things<00:02:17.430> like<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:18.600> also<00:02:18.720> go<00:02:18.989> into

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
and things like that you also go into

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.590 
and things like that you also go into
settings<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.739> if<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.640> enable<00:02:20.940> Dinah<00:02:21.330> rack

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
settings and if you enable Dinah rack

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.630 
settings and if you enable Dinah rack
and<00:02:21.870> CP<00:02:22.440> pass<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:23.069> will<00:02:24.920> vastly<00:02:25.920> increased

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
and CP pass you will vastly increased

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.340 
and CP pass you will vastly increased

I<00:02:30.260> guess<00:02:31.260> I've<00:02:31.470> done<00:02:31.850> then<00:02:32.960> you<00:02:33.960> just<00:02:34.200> go<00:02:34.350> to

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
I guess I've done then you just go to

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.590 
I guess I've done then you just go to
normal<00:02:35.220> dude<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:36.950> grab<00:02:37.950> yourself<00:02:38.390> some<00:02:39.390> ice

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
normal dude and grab yourself some ice

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.250 
normal dude and grab yourself some ice

as<00:02:48.770> you<00:02:49.070> can<00:02:49.190> see<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.850> emulator<00:02:50.330> fires<00:02:50.930> up<00:02:51.320> to

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
as you can see the emulator fires up to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.140 
as you can see the emulator fires up to
life<00:02:51.710> and<00:02:52.630> then<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.660> lock
