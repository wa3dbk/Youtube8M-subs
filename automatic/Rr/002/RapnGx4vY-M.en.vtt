00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 The Carmo Staff of the 4 Super Tips 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.420
 about the cortec engine actually on the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.090
 place 16 the 10 16 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.889
 the athletic will go from 4 till I'll talk 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.130
 about the invator who has time to stop 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.140
 run and return alone to console over 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.420
 Call with difficulty to pick up 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.939
 Let's talk about switching bombs. 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.529
 fuel over the engine 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.529
 many other tips 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.700
 The first tip is about 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:41.600
 s10 blazer that stops working and 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.480
 Come back alone but when you come here 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.120
 and fiddle with the whip and kauda rocker 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.870
 here in her plug she has already returned to 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.230
 to function 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.170
 the tip here loosen the screws here 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.050
 plate and pull out a 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.910
 Professional resounding, you 're going to give 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.129
 this tip the mechanic lacks it running alone 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.870
 on the wiper blade and it's time for it 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.960
 stop and go to work 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.060
 another super tip is about a car 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.460
 that stopped working from nowhere apart there 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.050
 in the mall budget and suddenly 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.110
 It does not get any more, it looks cool. 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.540
 this central of positives here is of wires 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.120
 positive people often give you bad contact 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.549
 opens here gives a work vacuum in the 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.049
 terminals and this car comes back to work 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.750
 normally 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:30.440
 another very nice tip about this 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.119
 wonderful treasure motorcycle is about 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.710
 the nozzles 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.740
 He has a MaranhÃ£o species . 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.800
 legs and the tip of this leg has 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.270
 a sphere line the quality of the jet has 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.790
 that being in the shape of a diamond 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.260
 some ebco company machines can 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.350
 simulate the operation so that you 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.230
 can correct the jet one of the great 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.020
 benches in this case here are you to use 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:58.040
 ethanol in the car do not try to put alcohol 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.890
 ethanol in an engine of this car in the bar 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.750
 because it will damage the 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.000
 quality of this jet instead of having already 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.640
 thrown on the engine valve will be 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.440
 played will be spread but it was 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.780
 performed sometimes until it locks the tip 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.269
 of this injector and you will have pain 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.830
 head then use gasoline 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.560
 course we have a little ethanol 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.489
 but never use ethanol because it will stop 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.980
 the nozzles 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.290
 another big tip in this case here 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.360
 pickup truck just looking here 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.920
 I already know that she uses a 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:34.310
 9-turn fuel is in the pardon of 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.600
 12 volts fooling me out 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.940
 so the 9-volt 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.280
 she wears white resistance here 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.350
 has a white resistance in this area 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.900
 there the fuel pump is 9 pocket 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.380
 that is, if you put a pump of 12 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.690
 Volts will quickly give problem this 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.570
 if this is the case here you use a 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.410
 pump of 12 with calm of 9 also goes 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.900
 give problem 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.510
 in the beginning the truck runs the earth 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.390
 if exchange pump runs spend 12 days 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.420
 This car does not work, but it does not. 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.240
 because the pump is a pump of 12 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.980
 She's going to work very bad to give the 4 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.840
 bar needed to stay running 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.630
 will work very badly only with nine 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.030
 volts and it is 9 volts will work well 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.980
 at first it just will not last long 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.530
 because you are getting 12 in her job 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.550
 then the fuel pump of the 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.710
 blazer and s10 has to be the correct one 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.640
 Very correct, my friends, so good then. 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.300
 it's there 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.440
 these are some tips from the s10 blazer 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.920
 with a dead vortec engine are you 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.870
 taking good care of 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.210
 observing these details you have a 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.250
 engine was a long time running 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.560
 perfectly is a car 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.930
 awesome 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.460
 Ok let's talk a little so let's go 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.860
 I also want to talk about this 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.960
 hose we have here one 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.720
 Air flow meter 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.960
 there can be no false air 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.690
 after this meter it needs 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.730
 count all the air that is entering 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.900
 on the car engine and do not count 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.250
 100% air 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.980
 you will get a fake air intake 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.460
 you will have a mix and irregular're 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.739
 good 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.530
 another tip a sensor from another only in that 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.500
 The broth is next to the crankshaft 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.010
 low're usually hand contact in 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.660
 fiscal terminal to not pick up passes the 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.390
 time we give a lock 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.520
 something swing club and he comes back to 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.960
 Okay, so I guess. 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.060
 basically this is what i want to tell 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.880
 This is a car for you. 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.150
 very good 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.300
 I really like him and I recommend to 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.170
 someone is a super design a super engine 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.060
 so it's there without further ado that year 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.430
 those 'the guy' in the car that 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.950
 It really is a ball show car. 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.450
 I really like this project but I 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.170
 I did not tell you the following where the 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.850
 place in the engine is good 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.160
 unfortunately it's under the alternator 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.530
 You removed another one from the car to 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.200
 find a location and engine number 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.750
 and I already got some cars and some 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.440
 I know the threat was not there then 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.540
 calm can miss operation you go into 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.890
 contact with the employee they lead to 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.720
 documentation likely to 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.240
 documentation will be checked and 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.330
 It has happened personal issue an 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.070
 document you go there to do the redial 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.020
 You can correct the same with the 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.280
 Angel will not you're there it is 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.960
 importantly congratulations 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.330
 I know you accelerate accelerates one
