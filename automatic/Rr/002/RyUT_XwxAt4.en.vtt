00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.470
 a giant three-dimensional dragon of 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.759

 files but a version as with the 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.510
 gray skin instead of orange that is what 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.030
 more normal the truth is that it has been 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.430
 very good on youtube out there that is 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.680
 incredible also the eye area is 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.080
 impressive the effect that has a 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.970
 pikachu and a dish is the blas trees 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.370

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.350
 great but good what has most 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.270
 called the attention of this chapter 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.570

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.699
 incredible and last giant dragon let's go 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.680
 even to enter inside him because 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.899
 It has some areas and even a little 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.430
 decorated inside but it 's 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.979
 awesome this whole area that you see 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.280
 here that makes shadow is one of the 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.160
 parts of the dragon's wings as you see 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.050
 it's amazing it seems a kind of 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.520
 building all this side but they are your 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.860
 wings now we will see it better in others 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.600
 planes and I also wanted to take another 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.140
 look at the pixels that you have of 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.149

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.369
 how good are we going to see it now I do not know 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.200
 how long will it have taken him to do 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.400
 this dragon but look at the height 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.050
 what has 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.450
 now in other planes even yes that 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.770

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.380
 pokemon pixel char hoist in its 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.750
 gray version I liked it too 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.400
 quite the truth is very well the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.190
 blas stories is also very cool 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.260
 and in youtube equal but good nothing nothing 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.600
 nothing compared to this dragon in three 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.360
 dimensions gigantism let's see all 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.149
 your area and you see that is the part of 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.790
 dragon trunk body area 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.650
 all the legs the back of the 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.170
 legs of alante that have a little 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.450
 collected as if you were flying and 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.150
 all that area of ​​the tail is 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.980
 impressive has scales there are also 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.940
 effects as colors on the scales 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.280
 of amazing shadows this as you see 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.090
 we are in the area of one of the wings of 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.650
 the left wing and well let's go 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.570
 giving a great spin because we are going to 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.130
 to be able to go inside even 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.860
 you will see the size that you have fixed the 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.470
 height or we are on top of a dragon 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.610
 giant is that it's amazing 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.210
 drawn attention in a way 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.250
 printed 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.410
 look at the neck and head area 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.120
 that we will now see because the zone of 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.660
 head also has the face made 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.150
 even the eyes are as purple is 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.180
 super super good and good has tickets 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.490
 in the area of ​​the wings as you see 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.950
 here is a zone out there in the back 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.840
 as a kind of trunks to keep 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.910
 little things the clouds go through 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.740
 of the dragon so that you get to the idea 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.440
 of a little and all the height that it has and 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.450
 the size and we will see that inside 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.820
 there are some wings with stairs for 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.280
 to be able to go in or out and all this 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.760
 But look, it's amazing the whole area 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.010
 of the tail of the legs of the 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.810
 neck and head everything is empty in its 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.990
 inner thing that is very good too 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.480
 to be able to enter but good 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.090
 take a look outside first as 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.230
 You see the wings there, they look amazing 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.760
 what an incredible size and I will look at what 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.480
 which is the area of ​​the queue because it has 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.959
 called much much attention the 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.269
 the size of the tail set that gives the 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.830
 turn around on the map and look at the 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.239
 height and wings is that it is 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.220
 awesome guys 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.860
 I hope you leave a lot of comments 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.980
 of your opinion I suppose that a conan 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.069
 you will love some comments because I 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.599
 that I know of something that can be improved or 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.900
 what has caught your attention 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.940
 dragon what you want so good to 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.069
 from this area of ​​the tail we are going to 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.480
 go to what is the head of the dragon and 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.220
 then let's go inside to 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.530
 that you see the great size that it has 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.579
 because let's go you could live inside 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.799
 you can quietly make a forest 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.900
 in there because it's super super big 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.180
 so, well, the 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.669
 area outside to be here 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.590
 prowling and climbing so good 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.270
 we're just going to put some blocks 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.430
 to go up because the part of 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.070
 so, let's say it has to be 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.180
 well decorated to attract attention 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.620
 so he does not have those details 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.139
 how can it be stairs or something 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.419
 well but inside if you have it so 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.560
 well we'll take a little ride like you 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.210
 I say let's go to the area of ​​the 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.590
 head that also calls a lot the 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.550
 attention because you see it in the face of 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.560
 dragon 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.720
 it's awesome to see how we're doing 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.350
 on top of those scales that you have on the 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.970
 neck area 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.130
 and well around here you can also 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.410
 keep watching the themes of the pokemon 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.930
 the picacho that we had already seen 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.460
 it looks out there and well over here we go 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.710
 putting blocks this is a bit shabby 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.600
 to climb but good is so that it 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.610
 can then remove and do not disturb the 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.560
 construction for conan so that it 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.670
 can teach more people so good 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.070
 this is what it is 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.770
 the head of the dragon in what would be his 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.290
 smell in the mouth area has 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.600
 bright stone and as you can see the face 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.010
 he is awesome he has purple eyes 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.890
 it attracts a lot of attention from afar 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.290
 the truth is that we go looks like a dragon 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.850
 giant but real is that is 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.280
 awesome I liked it very much 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.410
 I wish there were dragons in minecraft and 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.200
 they could ride or something like that some way 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.660
 pc I think I've seen that you can 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.850
 to mount a dragon would be amazing and 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.430
 well over here you see mother stone that 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:49.820
 is here of some cliché that has 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.870
 already done in those subjects I do not get and 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.340
 well we are inside what is the 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.350
 head of the dragon that as you can see 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.990
 the eyes and all the part of the nose of the 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.820
 dragon forward and you can go as 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.040
 I tell you all over the interior area this 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.320
 would be what is the neck area 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.000
 that we have seen before by one of these 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.620
 areas we have also peered before 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.140
 to go to the area where you could 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.380
 enter so good look at the body 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.670
 of the dragon is impressively large 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.410
 also everything is set with blocks 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.200
 illuminated so that the 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.820
 truth is that the 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.460
 inner area there are stairs to be able 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.350
 go through the rooms where we want and 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.970
 the entire tail area that is also 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.040
 out there although you can also see the 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.340
 Back legs area are super 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:34.250
 fijaros my mother too large or is 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.960
 there are rooms inside and everything is amazing and 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.090
 well I will also look at the area 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.760
 of the tail because it also seems to me that 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:43.820
 It is quite large and it will look good as 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.290
 You see fix the interior size that 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.870
 it has or is called a lot of attention 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.420
