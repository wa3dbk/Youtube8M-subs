00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello to all who visit the page 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.060
 web for yourself this video is not 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.450
 it's nothing more than a little advice for 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.820
 all those who dedicate yourselves to the king courage 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.620
 especially for the most inexperienced to the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.389
 that many times breaks a 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.580
 I can screw you into a small 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.980
 hurry and do not know how to proceed you not 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.140
 We have experience will teach us 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.050
 for this video since you already know how to do it 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.900
 in the way that I'm going to explain to 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.949
 disassemble the present plate 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.430
 it broke my screw on the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.980
 front part I wanted to take it out since the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.710
 aluminum is a bad is a metal a 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.379
 pretty soft material about everything 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.019
 when it is heated or by the own heat 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.750
 of the plate tends to stick or 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.360
 adhere more strongly to metal more 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.370
 hard to have next to try 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.440
 take out the screw the aluminum is a 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.199
 softer material tends to stick by 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.630
 so the screw was broken 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.820
 part of the screw 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.559
 inside the hole therefore 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.840
 we could not highlight it or place a 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.810
 screw again the first option that 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.240
 I adopted was to try to make a notch 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.240
 as seen with a saw blade 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.299
 walk to see if with a screwdriver 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.909
 flat I got to extract the screw thing 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.869
 what I tried but was effectively 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.240
 adhered to the part to the base and it was 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.840
 impossible to take it out the second option that 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.979
 I adopted was such to see with a drill with 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:41.090
 a full-size screw bit 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:44.390
 that he was going to place a hole to be able to 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.430
 make a hole and let me in 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.490
 Screw screw place 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.390
 they place a screw of sheet metal a 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.610
 screw for metal 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.190
 the screw thread has a plate 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.210
 I felt hard much more separated than a 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:04.479
 normal thread screw therefore 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.960
 adheres and holds perfectly to the 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.960
 metals 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.300
 so in case you find 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.270
 with a similar problem 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.180
 of cheese or match a screw thread 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.580
 normal you know that you always have as 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.290
 option the screws the sheet metal thread 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.720
 only what you have to do is 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.190
 with a drill and a drill empty the 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.150
 hole and 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.080
 place a screw of a caliber 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.810
 slightly higher 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.510
 Up to the size of the bit we have 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.910
 made the hole I hope that of the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.710
 Help serve little advice on 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.440
 all of the spartan many screws and 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.570
 you have to apply it and above all 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.900
 continue visiting the website repair you 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.900
 same
