end<00:02:18.959> up<00:02:19.050> with<00:02:19.260> an<00:02:19.380> afro<00:02:19.530> just<00:02:20.190> very<00:02:20.940> curly<00:02:21.450> big

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
end up with an afro just very curly big

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.580 
end up with an afro just very curly big
hair<00:02:22.319> big<00:02:22.530> hair<00:02:23.099> big<00:02:23.190> short<00:02:23.610> hair<00:02:23.819> yeah<00:02:24.590> ok

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
hair big hair big short hair yeah ok

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.110 
hair big hair big short hair yeah ok
know<00:02:25.709> what<00:02:25.950> one<00:02:26.160> length<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.610> lot<00:02:26.879> easier

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
know what one length is a lot easier

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.690 
know what one length is a lot easier
than<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.629> layered<00:02:27.870> look<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.709> weight<00:02:28.950> should

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
than the layered look the weight should

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.789 
than the layered look the weight should
pull<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:29.970> down<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.690> problem<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.470> longer

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
pull it down the problem is the longer

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.220 
pull it down the problem is the longer
it<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.130> bigger<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.849> gets<00:02:32.880> sure<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.049> what<00:02:34.200> I

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
it is the bigger it gets sure so what I

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.589 
it is the bigger it gets sure so what I
did<00:02:34.349> is<00:02:34.530> divided<00:02:35.459> technique<00:02:35.849> that<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.150> can<00:02:36.420> keep

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
did is divided technique that I can keep

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.220 
did is divided technique that I can keep
the<00:02:36.810> length<00:02:37.019> that<00:02:37.709> remove<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.280> bulk<00:02:38.519> in<00:02:39.269> six

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
the length that remove the bulk in six

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.890 
the length that remove the bulk in six
years<00:02:40.410> in<00:02:40.680> making<00:02:40.950> i<00:02:41.280> understand<00:02:41.849> it<00:02:42.720> has

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
years in making i understand it has

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.289 
years in making i understand it has
evolved<00:02:43.380> over<00:02:43.470> time<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:44.190> know<00:02:44.299> someone's

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
evolved over time you know someone's

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.910 
evolved over time you know someone's
trying<00:02:45.569> to<00:02:45.660> handle<00:02:45.989> something<00:02:46.260> here<00:02:46.530> haha

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
trying to handle something here haha

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.839 
trying to handle something here haha
don't<00:02:47.579> tell<00:02:47.849> me<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.299> is<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:49.110> hair<00:02:49.769> you<00:02:50.459> cut

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
don't tell me this is the hair you cut

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.830 
don't tell me this is the hair you cut
off<00:02:51.209> this<00:02:52.140> is<00:02:52.349> from<00:02:52.590> her<00:02:52.799> about<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:54.510> didn't

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
off this is from her about you didn't

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.759 
off this is from her about you didn't
make<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:55.410> wig<00:02:55.829> yeah<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.700> big<00:02:56.970> wave<00:02:57.290> two<00:02:58.290> or<00:02:58.470> three

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
make a wig yeah a big wave two or three

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.340 
make a wig yeah a big wave two or three
my<00:02:59.250> good<00:02:59.819> like<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.510> some<00:03:00.720> lot<00:03:00.959> of<00:03:01.139> here

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
my good like that is some lot of here

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.440 
my good like that is some lot of here
now<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:01.709> isn't<00:03:01.920> off<00:03:02.220> length<00:03:02.609> is<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.209> very

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
now this isn't off length is that very

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.240 
now this isn't off length is that very
meant<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:04.049> means<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.440> same<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:04.859> fact<00:03:05.100> she

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
meant it means the same in fact she

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.830 
meant it means the same in fact she
could<00:03:05.459> grow<00:03:05.609> it<00:03:05.760> longer<00:03:05.970> if<00:03:06.120> she<00:03:06.329> wants<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.690> oh

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
could grow it longer if she wants it oh

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.900 
could grow it longer if she wants it oh
my<00:03:07.260> goodness<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.130> when<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.400> where<00:03:08.609> did<00:03:08.760> this

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
my goodness so when it where did this

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.449 
my goodness so when it where did this
hit<00:03:09.209> where<00:03:09.420> did<00:03:09.569> it<00:03:09.660> all<00:03:09.810> come<00:03:09.870> from<00:03:10.139> well<00:03:10.889> we

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
hit where did it all come from well we

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.860 
hit where did it all come from well we
don't<00:03:11.639> want<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:12.180> happy<00:03:14.269> yeah<00:03:15.269> we<00:03:15.329> want<00:03:15.540> them

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
don't want you happy yeah we want them

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.660 
don't want you happy yeah we want them
to<00:03:15.900> remain<00:03:16.319> invisible<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:17.220> this<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.489> where

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
to remain invisible and this is where

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.690 
to remain invisible and this is where
the<00:03:17.790> technique<00:03:18.209> took<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.780> while<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:18.989> evolve

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
the technique took a while to evolve

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.129 
the technique took a while to evolve
because<00:03:20.700> we<00:03:20.850> want<00:03:21.060> we<00:03:21.630> want<00:03:21.660> them<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:21.989> be

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
because we want we want them to be

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.360 
because we want we want them to be
hidden<00:03:22.760> if<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:24.000> look<00:03:24.150> within<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.410> hair<00:03:25.650> there

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
hidden if you look within the hair there

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.080 
hidden if you look within the hair there
are<00:03:26.519> these<00:03:26.670> little<00:03:26.730> pieces<00:03:28.489> but<00:03:29.489> they<00:03:29.670> have<00:03:29.910> to

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
are these little pieces but they have to

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.210 
are these little pieces but they have to
it<00:03:30.389> should<00:03:30.720> remain<00:03:30.989> invisible<00:03:31.380> at<00:03:31.769> all<00:03:31.920> times

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
it should remain invisible at all times

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.180 
it should remain invisible at all times
even<00:03:32.519> if<00:03:32.790> she<00:03:33.000> she<00:03:33.630> pulls<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.019> back<00:03:34.200> now<00:03:35.130> you

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
even if she she pulls it back now you

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.080 
even if she she pulls it back now you
call<00:03:35.549> this<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.790> panel<00:03:36.660> cutter<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.290> cut

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
call this a panel cutter to cut

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.030 
call this a panel cutter to cut
checkerboard<00:03:39.090> tunnels<00:03:39.720> either<00:03:40.170> yeah<00:03:40.530> exactly

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
checkerboard tunnels either yeah exactly

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.199 
checkerboard tunnels either yeah exactly
because<00:03:41.340> they've<00:03:41.549> got<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.760> be<00:03:41.790> easy<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.090> find

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
because they've got to be easy to find

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.620 
because they've got to be easy to find
the<00:03:42.540> next<00:03:42.660> time<00:03:42.930> we<00:03:43.109> do<00:03:43.230> this<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:44.250> that's<00:03:45.120> the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
the next time we do this so that's the

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.170 
the next time we do this so that's the
other<00:03:45.720> part<00:03:45.959> that<00:03:46.109> took<00:03:46.349> a<00:03:46.380> while<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.970> find<00:03:47.970> an

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
other part that took a while to find an

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.410 
other part that took a while to find an
easier<00:03:48.599> way<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:49.079> cut<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.799> same<00:03:50.040> pieces<00:03:50.420> so

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
easier way to cut the same pieces so

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.990 
easier way to cut the same pieces so
that<00:03:51.500> we<00:03:52.500> keep<00:03:52.739> up<00:03:53.010> looking<00:03:53.430> individual

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
that we keep up looking individual

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.030 
that we keep up looking individual
ringlets<00:03:54.660> like<00:03:55.260> this<00:03:55.470> is<00:03:55.620> absolutely

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
ringlets like this is absolutely

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.420 
ringlets like this is absolutely
remarkable<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.880> now<00:03:57.120> can-can<00:03:58.040> her<00:03:59.040> hair<00:03:59.250> be

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
remarkable and now can-can her hair be

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.699 
remarkable and now can-can her hair be
worn<00:03:59.669> up<00:03:59.880> can<00:04:00.450> she<00:04:00.630> wear<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:00.989> after<00:04:01.139> all<00:04:01.470> you

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
worn up can she wear it after all you

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.440 
worn up can she wear it after all you
see<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.190> well<00:04:02.430> we<00:04:02.549> try<00:04:02.849> to<00:04:02.910> keep<00:04:03.269> them

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
see it well we try to keep them

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.350 
see it well we try to keep them
invisible<00:04:03.780> at<00:04:04.109> all

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
invisible at all

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.020 
invisible at all
times<00:04:04.570> like<00:04:04.810> we<00:04:05.140> try<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.650> keep<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:06.280> perimeter

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
times like we try to keep the perimeter

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.630 
times like we try to keep the perimeter
no<00:04:07.990> tunnels<00:04:08.410> near<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.680> perimeter<00:04:08.890> and<00:04:09.400> that's

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
no tunnels near the perimeter and that's

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.400 
no tunnels near the perimeter and that's
the<00:04:09.820> part<00:04:09.970> that<00:04:10.090> has<00:04:10.420> evolved<00:04:10.960> and<00:04:11.080> are<00:04:11.230> still

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
the part that has evolved and are still

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.190 
the part that has evolved and are still
evolving<00:04:11.710> to<00:04:12.100> try<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.340> keep<00:04:12.520> them<00:04:12.700> invisible

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
evolving to try to keep them invisible

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.319 
evolving to try to keep them invisible
because<00:04:14.200> most<00:04:15.040> people<00:04:15.430> with<00:04:15.610> this<00:04:15.790> hair<00:04:16.060> type

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
because most people with this hair type

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.900 
because most people with this hair type
you<00:04:16.840> where's<00:04:17.320> it<00:04:17.500> up<00:04:17.620> a<00:04:17.739> lot<00:04:17.890> we<00:04:18.430> want<00:04:18.609> to<00:04:18.730> make

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
you where's it up a lot we want to make

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.800 
you where's it up a lot we want to make
it<00:04:19.060> easier<00:04:19.329> for<00:04:19.600> her<00:04:19.780> so<00:04:20.380> we<00:04:20.680> make<00:04:20.920> sure<00:04:20.950> that

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
it easier for her so we make sure that

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.780 
it easier for her so we make sure that
they<00:04:22.810> try<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:23.140> stay<00:04:23.380> invisible<00:04:23.680> I<00:04:24.040> can't<00:04:24.550> see

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
they try to stay invisible I can't see

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.550 
they try to stay invisible I can't see
any<00:04:25.060> are<00:04:25.180> there<00:04:25.360> any<00:04:25.540> there<00:04:25.810> that<00:04:26.020> coming<00:04:26.380> can

any are there any there that coming can

any are there any there that coming can
you<00:04:26.590> answer<00:04:26.890> me<00:04:27.490> if<00:04:27.850> you<00:04:28.060> look<00:04:28.180> very<00:04:28.480> very

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
you answer me if you look very very

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.750 
you answer me if you look very very
carefully<00:04:29.470> around<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.860> perimeter<00:04:30.340> they<00:04:30.490> very

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
carefully around the perimeter they very

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.210 
carefully around the perimeter they very
fine<00:04:31.150> and<00:04:31.840> I<00:04:31.960> guess<00:04:32.170> but<00:04:32.470> because<00:04:32.800> her<00:04:32.950> hair<00:04:33.190> is

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
fine and I guess but because her hair is

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.090 
fine and I guess but because her hair is
curly<00:04:34.030> that<00:04:34.330> that<00:04:35.110> would<00:04:35.320> help<00:04:35.500> sort<00:04:35.980> of

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
curly that that would help sort of

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.610 
curly that that would help sort of
that's<00:04:36.850> right<00:04:37.030> behind<00:04:37.419> it<00:04:37.660> is<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:37.960> bigger<00:04:38.380> it

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
that's right behind it is the bigger it

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.650 
that's right behind it is the bigger it
gets<00:04:38.650> can<00:04:39.160> you<00:04:39.250> do<00:04:39.430> this<00:04:39.610> with<00:04:40.060> someone<00:04:40.540> who

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
gets can you do this with someone who

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.530 
gets can you do this with someone who
has<00:04:40.900> a<00:04:41.230> lot<00:04:41.590> of<00:04:41.650> hair<00:04:42.100> but<00:04:42.340> is<00:04:42.610> straight<00:04:43.330> that's

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
has a lot of hair but is straight that's

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.750 
has a lot of hair but is straight that's
right<00:04:43.750> as<00:04:43.840> long<00:04:43.900> as<00:04:44.200> it's<00:04:44.380> bulky<00:04:44.710> we<00:04:45.250> can<00:04:45.460> do<00:04:45.640> it

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
right as long as it's bulky we can do it

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.700 
right as long as it's bulky we can do it
but<00:04:45.940> with<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.600> size<00:04:46.780> of<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.080> tunnels<00:04:47.470> vary

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
but with the size of the tunnels vary

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.760 
but with the size of the tunnels vary
from<00:04:47.950> person<00:04:48.220> to<00:04:48.550> person<00:04:49.080> in<00:04:50.080> different<00:04:50.470> areas

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
from person to person in different areas

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.440 
from person to person in different areas
like<00:04:50.890> the<00:04:51.070> size<00:04:51.250> of<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.550> telesphere<00:04:51.880> beside

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
like the size of the telesphere beside

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.170 
like the size of the telesphere beside
is<00:04:52.950> completely<00:04:53.950> different<00:04:54.100> than<00:04:54.520> the<00:04:54.850> tunnels

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
is completely different than the tunnels

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.140 
is completely different than the tunnels
through<00:04:55.390> the<00:04:55.480> back<00:04:55.660> so<00:04:56.590> straight<00:04:57.340> here<00:04:57.580> as

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
through the back so straight here as

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.330 
through the back so straight here as
long<00:04:58.390> as<00:04:58.540> it's<00:04:58.720> bulky<00:04:58.960> that<00:04:59.680> can<00:04:59.860> be<00:04:59.980> done<00:05:00.100> it's

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
long as it's bulky that can be done it's

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.040 
long as it's bulky that can be done it's
just<00:05:00.460> going<00:05:00.790> on<00:05:00.880> really<00:05:01.270> carefully<00:05:01.930> because
