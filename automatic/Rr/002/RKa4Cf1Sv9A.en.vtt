00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
going to do is choose a cul-de-sac which

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.599 
going to do is choose a cul-de-sac which
I<00:00:21.529> know<00:00:21.590> is<00:00:22.130> in<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:22.520> opposite<00:00:22.910> direction<00:00:24.609> just

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
I know is in the opposite direction just

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:33.250 
I know is in the opposite direction just
to<00:00:25.880> test<00:00:26.539> and<00:00:26.869> show<00:00:27.500> how<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:31.780> tomtom<00:00:32.780> will

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
to test and show how the tomtom will

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.350 
to test and show how the tomtom will
readjust<00:00:33.680> itself<00:00:34.340> when<00:00:34.489> it<00:00:34.579> realizes<00:00:35.000> we're

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
readjust itself when it realizes we're

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.540 
readjust itself when it realizes we're
going<00:00:35.630> the<00:00:35.719> wrong<00:00:35.870> way<00:00:35.950> so<00:00:36.950> we're<00:00:37.190> going<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:37.399> go

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
in an intersection just to explain how

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.830 
in an intersection just to explain how
it<00:01:09.080> works<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.530> how<00:01:09.680> it<00:01:09.710> readjusts<00:01:10.070> itself<00:01:10.840> ok

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
it works and how it readjusts itself ok

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.330 
it works and how it readjusts itself ok
we're<00:01:11.990> getting<00:01:12.170> ready<00:01:12.290> to<00:01:12.380> go<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:12.890> I'm<00:01:13.040> going

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
we're getting ready to go and I'm going

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.950 
we're getting ready to go and I'm going
to<00:01:13.490> completely<00:01:13.790> ignore<00:01:14.000> what<00:01:14.479> tom-toms

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
to completely ignore what tom-toms

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.630 
to completely ignore what tom-toms
telling<00:01:15.290> me<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.530> do<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:15.830> start<00:01:16.040> off<00:01:16.189> with<00:01:16.430> which

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
telling me to do to start off with which

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.120 
telling me to do to start off with which
is<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:16.939> turn<00:01:17.150> right<00:01:17.450> up<00:01:17.659> ahead

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
is to turn right up ahead

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.810 
is to turn right up ahead
after<00:01:20.060> 100<00:01:20.960> meters<00:01:21.590> turn<00:01:22.219> right<00:01:22.960> turn<00:01:23.960> right

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
after 100 meters turn right turn right

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.219 
after 100 meters turn right turn right
so<00:01:25.820> it's<00:01:26.000> suggesting<00:01:26.479> I<00:01:26.570> do<00:01:26.630> a<00:01:26.780> loop<00:01:27.079> around

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
so it's suggesting I do a loop around

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.350 
so it's suggesting I do a loop around
the<00:01:27.470> block<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:27.950> in<00:01:28.039> fact<00:01:28.220> i'm<00:01:28.430> getting<00:01:28.700> go<00:01:29.329> a

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
the block and in fact i'm getting go a

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.859 
the block and in fact i'm getting go a
defined<00:01:29.810> term<00:01:30.140> light<00:01:31.299> so<00:01:32.299> this<00:01:32.420> is<00:01:32.450> a<00:01:32.570> lovely

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
defined term light so this is a lovely

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.959 
defined term light so this is a lovely
voice<00:01:33.170> but<00:01:33.590> i'm<00:01:33.770> completely<00:01:34.340> ignoring<00:01:34.610> her<00:01:34.820> at

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
voice but i'm completely ignoring her at

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.370 
voice but i'm completely ignoring her at
the<00:01:35.060> moment<00:01:35.390> because<00:01:35.630> she's<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:35.869> front<00:01:36.170> seat

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
the moment because she's a front seat

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.389 
the moment because she's a front seat
back<00:01:36.649> seat<00:01:36.679> driver<00:01:41.470> so<00:01:42.470> it<00:01:42.679> now<00:01:42.860> starts<00:01:43.280> to

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
back seat driver so it now starts to

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.100 
back seat driver so it now starts to
realize<00:01:43.819> that<00:01:43.850> i'm<00:01:44.210> hitting<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.689> wrong<00:01:44.840> way

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
realize that i'm hitting the wrong way

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.319 
realize that i'm hitting the wrong way
and<00:01:45.500> it<00:01:46.250> rejects<00:01:46.789> the<00:01:47.000> map<00:01:47.179> there<00:01:47.450> it<00:01:47.539> goes

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
and it rejects the map there it goes

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.999 
and it rejects the map there it goes
turn<00:01:50.329> left<00:01:53.020> so<00:01:54.020> it's<00:01:54.170> realized<00:01:54.619> that<00:01:54.890> i'm

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
turn left so it's realized that i'm

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.980 
turn left so it's realized that i'm
going<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.520> wrong<00:01:55.640> way<00:01:55.700> you<00:01:56.390> might<00:01:56.720> notice

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
going the wrong way you might notice

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.419 
going the wrong way you might notice
down<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.409> bottom<00:01:57.649> left<00:01:57.830> that's<00:01:58.039> telling<00:01:58.340> me

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
down the bottom left that's telling me

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.089 
down the bottom left that's telling me
that<00:01:58.580> i'm<00:01:58.700> doing<00:01:58.819> about<00:01:59.119> 47<00:02:00.020> out<00:02:00.590> of<00:02:00.799> 50

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:01.099 
that i'm doing about 47 out of 50

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:03.669 
that i'm doing about 47 out of 50
kilometers<00:02:01.640> it's<00:02:02.479> telling<00:02:02.869> me<00:02:02.899> how<00:02:03.229> far<00:02:03.439> in

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
kilometers it's telling me how far in

even a nice little weeks now here's the

even a nice little weeks now here's the
interesting<00:03:54.290> thing<00:03:54.920> I'm<00:03:55.099> stopped<00:03:55.489> at<00:03:55.640> a

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
interesting thing I'm stopped at a

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.460 
interesting thing I'm stopped at a
traffic<00:03:55.970> light<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.480> didn't<00:03:56.780> mention<00:03:57.319> it<00:03:57.410> at

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
traffic light it didn't mention it at

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.890 
traffic light it didn't mention it at
all<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:58.550> mentioned<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.060> roundabout<00:03:59.569> that's

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
all that mentioned the roundabout that's

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.600 
all that mentioned the roundabout that's
further<00:04:00.170> ahead<00:04:00.410> so<00:04:00.920> it<00:04:01.040> tends<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.459> ignore

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
further ahead so it tends to ignore

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.340 
further ahead so it tends to ignore
traffic<00:04:02.300> lights<00:04:02.480> and<00:04:02.720> things<00:04:02.870> if<00:04:03.110> you're<00:04:03.230> just

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.150 

there<00:04:15.330> are<00:04:15.450> no<00:04:15.540> speed<00:04:15.959> cameras<00:04:16.500> in<00:04:16.680> this<00:04:16.829> area

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
there are no speed cameras in this area

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.490 
there are no speed cameras in this area
