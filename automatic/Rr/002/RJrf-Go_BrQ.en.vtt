the<00:02:49.120> real<00:02:49.420> challenge<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:50.490> transition<00:02:51.490> to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
the real challenge of transition to

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.820 
the real challenge of transition to
maintaining<00:02:52.060> both<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.630> when<00:02:53.020> this<00:02:53.350> production

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
maintaining both is when this production

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.340 
maintaining both is when this production
line<00:02:53.980> starts<00:02:54.550> up<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.450> transition<00:02:56.320> from

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
line starts up and to transition from

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.590 
line starts up and to transition from
legacy<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.490> new<00:02:57.790> it's<00:02:58.120> going<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.390> be<00:02:58.480> our

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
legacy to new it's going to be our

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.420 
legacy to new it's going to be our
challenge<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:01.660> we<00:03:01.960> also<00:03:02.140> have<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.590> increase

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
challenge and we also have the increase

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.130 
challenge and we also have the increase
in<00:03:03.640> volume<00:03:03.850> on<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.239> military<00:03:04.660> product<00:03:05.020> as

in volume on the military product as

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.900 
in volume on the military product as
well<00:03:05.440> is<00:03:05.860> there<00:03:06.100> a<00:03:06.130> little<00:03:06.340> more<00:03:06.430> pressure<00:03:06.730> on

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
well is there a little more pressure on

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.229 
well is there a little more pressure on
them<00:03:07.360> with<00:03:08.170> this<00:03:08.380> line<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:09.010> other<00:03:09.239> engines

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
them with this line and other engines

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.650 
them with this line and other engines
they've<00:03:10.390> rolled<00:03:10.600> out<00:03:11.459> it's<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.670> new<00:03:12.820> design<00:03:13.090> and

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
they've rolled out it's a new design and

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.990 
they've rolled out it's a new design and
it's<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.290> new<00:03:14.440> build<00:03:14.980> process<00:03:15.550> so<00:03:15.790> there<00:03:15.940> will

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
it's a new build process so there will

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.820 
it's a new build process so there will
be<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.180> little<00:03:16.450> bit<00:03:16.600> bigger<00:03:17.080> challenge<00:03:17.620> but

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
be a little bit bigger challenge but

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.900

countries from Turkey to Taiwan Mexico
China<00:04:23.750> and<00:04:24.110> so<00:04:24.560> we<00:04:24.680> have<00:04:24.800> to<00:04:24.890> do<00:04:24.980> everything<00:04:25.340> we

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
China and so we have to do everything we

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.520 
China and so we have to do everything we
can<00:04:25.730> to<00:04:25.790> be<00:04:26.030> as<00:04:26.090> efficient<00:04:26.630> as<00:04:26.720> we<00:04:26.840> can<00:04:27.110> here<00:04:27.410> in

can to be as efficient as we can here in

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.620 
can to be as efficient as we can here in
Connecticut<00:04:28.040> so<00:04:28.250> it's<00:04:28.880> important<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.390> we're
