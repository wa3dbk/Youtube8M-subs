here it is overall the entirety of the
track<00:00:39.200> yes<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.379> built<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.860> flatland<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:42.000> be

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
track yes I built it on flatland to be

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.119 
track yes I built it on flatland to be
easy

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
easy

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.080

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
animals in here kind of thought of

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.410 
animals in here kind of thought of
taking<00:00:50.100> them<00:00:50.370> out<00:00:50.489> at<00:00:50.670> first<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.059> then<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.300> was

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
taking them out at first but then I was

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.819 
taking them out at first but then I was
like<00:00:51.510> hey<00:00:51.719> wouldn't<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.260> be<00:00:52.379> neat<00:00:52.559> if<00:00:52.590> there's

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
like hey wouldn't it be neat if there's

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.459 
like hey wouldn't it be neat if there's
obstacles<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.670> these<00:00:54.480> are<00:00:54.629> living<00:00:54.809> obstacles

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
obstacles and these are living obstacles

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.209 
obstacles and these are living obstacles
the<00:00:55.980> animals<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.180> anyways<00:00:57.859> got<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> waterfall

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the animals so anyways got a waterfall

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.009 
the animals so anyways got a waterfall
jump<00:00:59.850> here<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:01.820> some<00:01:02.820> speed<00:01:03.090> boosters<00:01:03.539> these

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
jump here and some speed boosters these

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.490 
jump here and some speed boosters these
are<00:01:04.170> speed<00:01:04.409> boosters<00:01:04.890> right<00:01:05.159> here<00:01:06.500> some

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
are speed boosters right here some

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.780 
are speed boosters right here some
cactuses<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.460> dodge<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.830> I<00:01:10.830> don't<00:01:11.340> know<00:01:11.580> how

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
cactuses to dodge and I don't know how

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.750 
cactuses to dodge and I don't know how
these<00:01:11.970> animals<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.659> up<00:01:12.869> here<00:01:13.490> other<00:01:14.490> than

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
these animals get up here other than

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.539 
these animals get up here other than
that<00:01:15.530> there's<00:01:16.530> two<00:01:16.830> different<00:01:16.979> pathways<00:01:17.520> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
that there's two different pathways to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.240 
that there's two different pathways to
choose<00:01:18.000> one<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.810> deadly<00:01:19.200> cactus<00:01:19.740> pathway

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
choose one is the deadly cactus pathway

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.219 
choose one is the deadly cactus pathway
or<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.520> other<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> longer<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:21.869> it's<00:01:22.020> got

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
or the other is the longer but it's got

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.890 
or the other is the longer but it's got
speed<00:01:22.470> boosts<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:24.030> take<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.780> as

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
speed boosts so you can take that and as

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.890 
speed boosts so you can take that and as
you<00:01:25.080> continue<00:01:25.909> nearing<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> end<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
you continue nearing the end of the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.190 
you continue nearing the end of the
course<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:29.670> get<00:01:29.850> more<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.210> more<00:01:30.299> cactuses

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
course you get more and more cactuses

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.050 
course you get more and more cactuses
spaced<00:01:31.680> closer<00:01:32.070> together<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:35.000> yeah<00:01:36.000> you

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
spaced closer together and yeah you

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.270 
spaced closer together and yeah you
actually<00:01:36.420> drive<00:01:36.659> right<00:01:36.840> through<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.350> it's

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
actually drive right through that it's

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.420 
actually drive right through that it's
pretty<00:01:38.490> neat<00:01:38.700> as<00:01:38.939> for<00:01:39.509> scenery<00:01:39.720> here<00:01:40.430> we've

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
pretty neat as for scenery here we've

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.450 
pretty neat as for scenery here we've
got<00:01:42.500> lost<00:01:43.500> cabin<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.250> woods<00:01:45.409> possibly

this should not be happening that's not
cool<00:02:05.490> uh<00:02:06.490> I<00:02:06.940> broke<00:02:07.690> that<00:02:09.090> okay<00:02:10.090> we<00:02:10.450> need<00:02:10.539> to

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
cool uh I broke that okay we need to

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.540 
cool uh I broke that okay we need to
turn<00:02:10.840> fire<00:02:11.110> spread<00:02:11.470> off<00:02:12.540> okay<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:14.770> this<00:02:15.340> is

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
turn fire spread off okay so this is

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.900 
turn fire spread off okay so this is
supposed<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.880> be<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.060> guess<00:02:16.420> some<00:02:16.660> sort<00:02:16.930> of

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
supposed to be I guess some sort of

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.660 
supposed to be I guess some sort of
temple<00:02:18.910> for<00:02:19.650> some<00:02:20.650> weird<00:02:20.830> people<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.459> live

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
temple for some weird people that live

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.930 
temple for some weird people that live
out<00:02:21.760> in<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:21.970> bush<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:24.690> it's<00:02:25.690> new<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.790> then

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
out in the bush and it's new and then

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.729 
out in the bush and it's new and then
this<00:02:28.120> is<00:02:28.330> like<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.870> old<00:02:29.080> one

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
this is like the old one

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.190 
this is like the old one
that's<00:02:30.310> all<00:02:30.520> ruined<00:02:31.150> surrounding<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.959> life

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
that's all ruined surrounding the life

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.510 
that's all ruined surrounding the life
tree<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:33.910> still<00:02:34.120> living<00:02:35.280> holding<00:02:36.280> the

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
tree that is still living holding the

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.300 
tree that is still living holding the
glowstone<00:02:37.480> fruit<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.890> what<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.010> don't<00:02:39.160> even

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
glowstone fruit and what I don't even
