so<00:01:26.840> let's<00:01:27.840> get<00:01:27.990> started<00:01:28.470> first<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.950> all<00:01:30.229> to

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
so let's get started first of all to

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.180 
so let's get started first of all to
save<00:01:31.740> your<00:01:32.010> wire<00:01:32.420> some<00:01:33.420> guys<00:01:33.600> are<00:01:33.900> cutting

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
save your wire some guys are cutting

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:42.910 
save your wire some guys are cutting
this<00:01:35.190> out<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.850> make<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.380> main<00:01:37.380> shaft<00:01:37.760> for<00:01:38.760> the

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.920 

MCPS<00:01:43.920> which<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.760> use<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.090> main<00:01:45.330> this

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
MCPS which you can use this main this

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.660 
MCPS which you can use this main this
right<00:01:46.200> here<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.619> make<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> main<00:01:47.070> shaft<00:01:47.369> and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
right here to make the main shaft and

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.880 
right here to make the main shaft and
get<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.909> some<00:01:48.090> little<00:01:48.240> tiny<00:01:48.570> drill<00:01:48.930> bits<00:01:49.229> so

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
get you some little tiny drill bits so

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.039 
get you some little tiny drill bits so
what<00:01:50.159> we'll<00:01:50.310> do<00:01:50.430> first<00:01:50.670> what<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.630> did<00:01:51.869> was

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
what we'll do first what I did was

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.620 
what we'll do first what I did was
straighten<00:01:52.409> out<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.799> wire<00:01:52.830> so<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:54.119> can<00:01:54.390> slip

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
straighten out the wire so I can slip

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.920 
straighten out the wire so I can slip
the<00:01:54.810> wire<00:01:54.990> through<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.430> little<00:01:56.930> you're

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
the wire through just a little you're

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.420 
the wire through just a little you're
just<00:01:58.140> gonna<00:01:58.290> sit<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.680> wire<00:01:58.860> through<00:01:59.159> just

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
just gonna sit in the wire through just

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.070 
just gonna sit in the wire through just
a<00:01:59.549> little<00:01:59.850> so<00:01:59.970> it'd<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.360> hanging<00:02:00.720> out<00:02:00.810> from

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
a little so it'd be hanging out from

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.380 
a little so it'd be hanging out from
this<00:02:01.259> end<00:02:01.530> that's<00:02:02.159> where<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.580> can<00:02:02.729> take<00:02:02.970> this

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
this end that's where you can take this

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.960 
this end that's where you can take this
here<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:05.310> slide<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.240> tail<00:02:06.450> boom<00:02:06.750> away<00:02:07.290> from

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
here and slide the tail boom away from

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.009 
here and slide the tail boom away from
now<00:02:08.970> I've<00:02:09.239> done<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:10.170> actually<00:02:10.829> take<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.610> I

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
now I've done this I actually take it I

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.920 
now I've done this I actually take it I
take<00:02:13.019> the<00:02:13.290> tail<00:02:13.590> boom<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.670> actually<00:02:15.209> start

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
take the tail boom and actually start

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.190 
take the tail boom and actually start
breaking<00:02:16.439> it

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
breaking it

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.470 
breaking it
breaking<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.290> up<00:02:18.410> like<00:02:18.769> so<00:02:19.099> so<00:02:19.970> I'm<00:02:20.239> just

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
breaking it up like so so I'm just

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.119 
breaking it up like so so I'm just
sitting<00:02:20.780> here<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:20.900> know<00:02:21.170> just<00:02:21.590> breaking<00:02:21.890> it

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
sitting here you know just breaking it

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.880 
sitting here you know just breaking it
up<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.300> won't<00:02:23.540> have<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.780> desolder<00:02:24.440> and

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
up so I won't have to desolder and

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.420 
up so I won't have to desolder and
solder<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:27.830> wire<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:30.530> keeps<00:02:30.890> me<00:02:31.160> from

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
solder the wire and this keeps me from

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.970 
solder the wire and this keeps me from
doing<00:02:31.910> all<00:02:32.180> this<00:02:32.360> soldering<00:02:32.780> work<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:33.650> how'd<00:02:33.830> I

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
doing all this soldering work so how'd I

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.780 
doing all this soldering work so how'd I
do<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.220> I<00:02:34.700> break<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.510> up<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:35.840> as<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.590> see<00:02:36.860> it

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
do that I break it up and as you see it

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.490 
do that I break it up and as you see it
comes<00:02:38.120> apart<00:02:38.739> real<00:02:39.739> easy<00:02:40.420> all<00:02:41.420> right<00:02:41.629> so

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
comes apart real easy all right so

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.369 
comes apart real easy all right so
there's<00:02:42.769> your<00:02:43.010> wire<00:02:43.750> along<00:02:44.750> with<00:02:45.019> your<00:02:45.170> tail

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
there's your wire along with your tail

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.740 
there's your wire along with your tail
well<00:02:45.890> along<00:02:46.129> with<00:02:46.160> your<00:02:46.489> mouth<00:02:46.670> okay

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
well along with your mouth okay

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.300

frames you'll want to put a flat spot

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.640 
frames you'll want to put a flat spot
here<00:03:06.700> so<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:08.000> is<00:03:08.030> slide<00:03:08.360> through<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:09.290> frames

actually take a piece of it bear will
take<00:04:04.099> a<00:04:04.130> piece<00:04:04.370> of<00:04:04.400> it<00:04:04.730> like<00:04:04.910> this<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.560> I<00:04:06.560> slide

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
take a piece of it like this and I slide

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:13.259 
take a piece of it like this and I slide
it<00:04:07.400> on<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.450> inside<00:04:09.819> of<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:12.500> motor<00:04:12.769> mount

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
it on the inside of the motor mount

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.440 
it on the inside of the motor mount
which<00:04:14.269> will<00:04:14.510> help<00:04:14.690> sim<00:04:15.079> it<00:04:15.290> soon<00:04:15.880> all<00:04:16.880> right<00:04:16.970> so

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
which will help sim it soon all right so

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.449 
which will help sim it soon all right so
just<00:04:17.660> take<00:04:17.930> it<00:04:17.959> and<00:04:18.289> slide<00:04:18.530> it<00:04:18.590> in<00:04:18.919> you<00:04:19.340> don't

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
just take it and slide it in you don't

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.810 
just take it and slide it in you don't
have<00:04:19.579> to<00:04:19.760> be<00:04:19.940> as<00:04:20.180> long<00:04:20.750> as<00:04:20.930> I<00:04:21.049> got<00:04:21.320> it<00:04:21.530> so<00:04:21.979> just

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
have to be as long as I got it so just

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.820 
have to be as long as I got it so just
take<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:23.389> you<00:04:23.599> slide<00:04:23.990> it<00:04:24.169> in

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
take it and you slide it in

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.080 
take it and you slide it in
so<00:04:25.009> it<00:04:25.370> actually<00:04:25.750> worked<00:04:26.750> as<00:04:26.960> assumed<00:04:27.940> as<00:04:28.940> you

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
so it actually worked as assumed as you

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.999 
so it actually worked as assumed as you
see<00:04:29.300> here<00:04:29.539> is<00:04:29.780> working<00:04:30.229> as<00:04:30.379> a<00:04:30.409> sim<00:04:30.740> all<00:04:31.669> right

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
see here is working as a sim all right

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.640 
see here is working as a sim all right
so<00:04:34.009> you<00:04:34.669> take<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.360> tail<00:04:35.629> boom<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.319> you<00:04:36.409> take

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
so you take the tail boom and you take

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.850 
so you take the tail boom and you take
the<00:04:36.830> Shem<00:04:37.129> and<00:04:37.569> Shem<00:04:38.569> it<00:04:38.750> in<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.620> on<00:04:41.199> put<00:04:42.199> just

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
the Shem and Shem it in and on put just

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.520 
the Shem and Shem it in and on put just
loose<00:04:43.220> use<00:04:43.520> it<00:04:43.669> as<00:04:43.789> a<00:04:43.819> shim<00:04:44.210> shim<00:04:44.990> it<00:04:45.139> in<00:04:45.259> place

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
loose use it as a shim shim it in place

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.200 
loose use it as a shim shim it in place
of<00:04:45.740> what<00:04:45.889> not<00:04:46.129> I<00:04:46.840> then<00:04:48.129> make<00:04:49.129> sure<00:04:49.159> it's<00:04:49.370> it's

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
of what not I then make sure it's it's

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.860 
of what not I then make sure it's it's
pulled<00:04:50.599> out<00:04:50.870> flat<00:04:51.470> enough<00:04:51.800> all<00:04:52.550> right<00:04:52.759> so<00:04:53.300> what

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
pulled out flat enough all right so what

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:02.830 
pulled out flat enough all right so what
I<00:04:53.900> do<00:04:54.020> next<00:04:54.560> is<00:04:55.039> I<00:04:56.590> take<00:04:57.590> some<00:04:58.990> CA<00:04:59.990> glue<00:05:00.319> and<00:05:01.840> go

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
I do next is I take some CA glue and go

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.899 
I do next is I take some CA glue and go
around<00:05:02.960> the<00:05:03.349> edges<00:05:03.830> of<00:05:03.979> it<00:05:04.039> just<00:05:04.520> just<00:05:04.819> a

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
around the edges of it just just a

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.209 
around the edges of it just just a
little<00:05:04.940> bit<00:05:05.449> just<00:05:06.169> go<00:05:06.379> around<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:06.710> edges<00:05:06.889> of

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:07.219 
little bit just go around the edges of

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:09.180 
little bit just go around the edges of
it<00:05:07.810> all<00:05:08.810> right

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
and there's the mouth all right I take

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.520 
and there's the mouth all right I take
some<00:05:14.539> accelerator<00:05:16.090> and<00:05:17.090> heat<00:05:17.449> it<00:05:17.599> with<00:05:18.349> this

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
some accelerator and heat it with this

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.640 
some accelerator and heat it with this
celebrating<00:05:19.219> all<00:05:20.210> right<00:05:20.330> once<00:05:21.080> that<00:05:21.319> is<00:05:21.469> done

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
celebrating all right once that is done

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.760 
celebrating all right once that is done
of<00:05:22.639> course<00:05:22.849> you'll<00:05:23.120> have<00:05:23.270> the<00:05:23.449> motor<00:05:23.719> you<00:05:24.590> have

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
of course you'll have the motor you have

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.430 
of course you'll have the motor you have
the<00:05:24.919> motor<00:05:25.129> for<00:05:25.490> it<00:05:25.669> and<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:26.900> just<00:05:26.930> slide<00:05:27.379> the

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
the motor for it and you just slide the

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.700 
the motor for it and you just slide the
motor<00:05:27.740> in<00:05:28.569> whatnot<00:05:29.569> you<00:05:29.930> know<00:05:29.960> it'll<00:05:30.680> be

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
motor in whatnot you know it'll be

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.279 
motor in whatnot you know it'll be
already<00:05:31.279> still<00:05:31.699> in<00:05:31.909> there<00:05:32.120> so<00:05:32.360> this<00:05:32.630> is<00:05:32.690> like<00:05:33.259> I

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
already still in there so this is like I

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.129 
already still in there so this is like I
said<00:05:33.529> one<00:05:33.740> to<00:05:33.860> spare<00:05:34.069> motors<00:05:34.430> ahead<00:05:34.669> and<00:05:35.360> just

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
said one to spare motors ahead and just

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:38.950 
said one to spare motors ahead and just
basically<00:05:36.550> slide<00:05:37.550> the<00:05:37.849> motor<00:05:38.000> here<00:05:38.360> whatnot

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
basically slide the motor here whatnot

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.399 
basically slide the motor here whatnot
all<00:05:39.680> right<00:05:39.889> once<00:05:40.729> you<00:05:40.819> do<00:05:41.029> that<00:05:41.300> you<00:05:41.810> know<00:05:41.960> just

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 
all right once you do that you know just

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:49.100 
all right once you do that you know just
take<00:05:42.650> it<00:05:42.919> and<00:05:43.550> wrap<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.630> wire<00:05:44.659> around

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:56.740 

so<00:05:49.740> wrap<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.610> wire<00:05:50.789> around<00:05:50.819> it<00:05:51.650> like<00:05:52.650> so

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.850 

all<00:05:57.750> right<00:05:57.840> once<00:05:58.199> you<00:05:58.289> wrap<00:05:58.470> the<00:05:58.650> wire<00:05:58.830> around

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
all right once you wrap the wire around

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:07.450 
all right once you wrap the wire around
it<00:05:59.400> there<00:06:00.210> is<00:06:00.419> a<00:06:00.449> red<00:06:01.110> spot<00:06:02.629> right<00:06:03.629> here<00:06:04.159> on<00:06:05.539> the

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
it there is a red spot right here on the

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.409 
it there is a red spot right here on the
tail<00:06:08.460> boom<00:06:08.729> mount<00:06:09.509> right<00:06:09.780> here<00:06:10.639> so<00:06:11.639> the<00:06:12.090> on<00:06:12.240> the

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
tail boom mount right here so the on the

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.050 
tail boom mount right here so the on the
on<00:06:12.599> the<00:06:12.750> on<00:06:13.080> the<00:06:13.199> wire<00:06:13.409> so<00:06:14.129> this<00:06:14.550> right<00:06:15.000> here

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
on the on the wire so this right here

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.189 
on the on the wire so this right here
will<00:06:15.750> plug<00:06:16.110> in<00:06:16.970> if<00:06:17.970> you<00:06:18.569> can<00:06:18.690> see<00:06:18.900> right<00:06:19.169> here

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 
will plug in if you can see right here

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.360 
will plug in if you can see right here
on<00:06:19.770> the<00:06:19.830> inside<00:06:20.729> of<00:06:21.300> the<00:06:21.930> board<00:06:22.169> not<00:06:23.009> on<00:06:23.219> the

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
on the inside of the board not on the

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.619

outside<00:06:23.879> of<00:06:24.090> the<00:06:24.180> ball

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:24.629 
outside of the ball

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:27.800 
outside of the ball
could<00:06:24.900> it<00:06:25.020> be<00:06:25.110> reversed<00:06:25.740> polarity<00:06:26.449> on<00:06:27.449> the

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
could it be reversed polarity on the

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.860 
could it be reversed polarity on the
rail<00:06:28.199> would<00:06:28.440> plug<00:06:28.740> on<00:06:29.069> the<00:06:29.340> end<00:06:29.370> side<00:06:30.360> of<00:06:30.719> the

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
rail would plug on the end side of the

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.610 
rail would plug on the end side of the
board<00:06:32.030> just<00:06:33.030> like<00:06:33.240> so<00:06:33.479> it<00:06:33.719> will<00:06:33.870> go<00:06:34.020> in<00:06:34.229> so<00:06:34.469> your

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
board just like so it will go in so your

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.459 
board just like so it will go in so your
red<00:06:34.830> wire<00:06:35.099> will<00:06:35.340> be<00:06:35.370> facing<00:06:35.759> in<00:06:36.389> on<00:06:36.870> the<00:06:37.110> inside

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:37.469 
red wire will be facing in on the inside

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:41.540 
red wire will be facing in on the inside
