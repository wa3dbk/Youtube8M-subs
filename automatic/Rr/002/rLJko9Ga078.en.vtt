00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
exactly what trainer Abel Sanchez said I

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.959 
exactly what trainer Abel Sanchez said I
think<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.500> both<00:00:46.680> guys<00:00:46.950> at<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.579> beginning

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
think that both guys at the beginning

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.600 
think that both guys at the beginning
will<00:00:48.239> be<00:00:48.360> aware<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.719> each<00:00:49.079> other<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.590> think<00:00:50.460> by

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
will be aware of each other I think by

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.639 
will be aware of each other I think by
the<00:00:50.670> time<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.239> second<00:00:51.600> round<00:00:51.719> comes<00:00:52.050> around<00:00:52.379> I

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the time the second round comes around I

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.490 
the time the second round comes around I
think<00:00:53.460> glove<00:00:53.789> caen<00:00:54.030> will<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.690> establishes

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
think glove caen will have establishes

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.979 
think glove caen will have establishes
jab<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.010> will<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.699> pot<00:00:56.940> shotting<00:00:57.420> Lemieux<00:00:57.750> in

jab and will be pot shotting Lemieux in
the<00:00:58.920> third<00:00:59.129> round<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.730> think<00:01:00.239> they<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> good

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the third round I think they have a good

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.410 
the third round I think they have a good
round<00:01:01.199> between<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.890> both<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.309> them<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.670> in

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.390 
than a fighter who goes in there and
uses<00:02:25.050> his<00:02:25.320> damn<00:02:25.680> brain<00:02:27.560> after<00:02:28.560> all<00:02:28.710> that's<00:02:29.280> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
uses his damn brain after all that's the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.180 
uses his damn brain after all that's the
reason<00:02:29.790> God<00:02:29.970> gave<00:02:30.030> us<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.660> brain<00:02:30.900> right<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.950> we

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
reason God gave us a brain right so we

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.870 
reason God gave us a brain right so we
could<00:02:32.400> use<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:34.530> when<00:02:34.740> I<00:02:34.890> see<00:02:35.250> any<00:02:35.520> fighter

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
could use it so when I see any fighter

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.440 
could use it so when I see any fighter
using<00:02:36.330> his<00:02:36.480> brain<00:02:36.660> I<00:02:37.610> give<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.880> fighter<00:02:39.150> a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
using his brain I give that fighter a

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.720 
using his brain I give that fighter a
lot<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.230> respect<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:42.750> if<00:02:43.110> golovkin<00:02:43.890> goes<00:02:44.490> in

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
lot of respect so if golovkin goes in

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.620 
lot of respect so if golovkin goes in
there<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.180> he<00:02:46.050> does<00:02:46.350> box<00:02:46.770> and<00:02:47.190> he<00:02:47.910> does<00:02:48.180> pot

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
there and he does box and he does pot

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.080 
there and he does box and he does pot
shot<00:02:48.990> I<00:02:49.850> think<00:02:50.850> that's<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.180> great<00:02:51.210> strategy<00:02:52.140> I

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
shot I think that's a great strategy I

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.180 
shot I think that's a great strategy I
mean<00:02:54.090> if<00:02:54.270> David<00:02:54.600> Lemieux<00:02:54.870> only<00:02:55.440> fights<00:02:55.740> one

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
mean if David Lemieux only fights one

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.699 
mean if David Lemieux only fights one
way<00:02:56.430> why<00:02:57.270> would<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:57.720> give<00:02:57.959> him<00:02:58.170> his<00:02:58.380> best

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
way why would you give him his best

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.280 
way why would you give him his best
chance<00:02:58.830> of<00:02:59.340> knocking<00:02:59.700> you<00:03:00.090> out<00:03:00.120> right<00:03:00.570> this

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
chance of knocking you out right this

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.560 
chance of knocking you out right this
all<00:03:01.470> makes<00:03:01.650> sense<00:03:01.860> right<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:03.090> know<00:03:03.150> as<00:03:03.390> I'm
