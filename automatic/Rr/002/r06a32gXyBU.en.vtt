00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.460
 since the idea came out five years ago 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.410
 we are going to work already in what 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.890
 was of execution since the 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:21.670
 terrain is defined this if it is going to be 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.150
 here I have put the work in November of 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.150
 2012 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.470
 really me because the first one is like 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.480
 that we had never done one and then 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.449
 the whole theme of the exhibits was very 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.940
 complicated but we have to work with 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.940
 biology people for 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:49.489
 all the specifications of the forms 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:52.909
 of the ponds the capabilities of everything 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.430
 the subject of the volumes of the weights 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.559
 that was very complicated and obviously 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.260
 also with the geometry of the building 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.780
 with very difficult at the beginning to trace 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.399
 all the routes and the routes because 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.280
 unlike other aquariums you 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.780
 that he has that is very particular because 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.990
 it's like a kind of script is a 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.440
 history and it's a linear journey is not 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.869
 like aquarium bikes that you reach towards a 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.909
 Distributed lobby as you want here 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.090
 it's a whole sequence then the 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.090
 tie all that with the geometry the 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.259
 architecture of the place is the most 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.470
 complicated you record basically recreate a 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.330
 little the environment of the species and of 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.310
 the different zones because everything is for 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.520
 zones you do not have the bottom of the sea 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.439
 the reef the beach the moon 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.890
 then I study an attractive form the 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.890
 idea was 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.350
 and simulate those environments in the most 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.350
 attractive and real not
