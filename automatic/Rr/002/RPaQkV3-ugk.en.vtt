the GTI performance package we're going

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.839 
the GTI performance package we're going
to<00:00:07.770> start<00:00:08.010> by<00:00:08.099> telling<00:00:08.340> you<00:00:08.550> some<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.790> the

to start by telling you some of the
differences<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.330> set<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:09.990> car<00:00:10.260> apart<00:00:10.380> from

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
differences that set this car apart from

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.230 
differences that set this car apart from
the<00:00:10.950> other<00:00:11.130> GT<00:00:11.519> eyes<00:00:11.610> you're<00:00:11.820> gonna<00:00:11.880> see<00:00:12.210> on

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
the other GT eyes you're gonna see on

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:27.189 
the other GT eyes you're gonna see on
the<00:00:12.480> road<00:00:12.690> let's<00:00:13.469> go<00:00:13.559> take<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> peek<00:00:13.950> at<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.190> now

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.630 

so<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.500> normal<00:00:28.769> person<00:00:28.920> looking<00:00:29.460> at<00:00:29.580> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
so to the normal person looking at the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.269 
so to the normal person looking at the
GTI<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.720> GTI<00:00:31.050> performance<00:00:31.080> package<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
GTI and the GTI performance package the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.040 
GTI and the GTI performance package the
two<00:00:32.520> would<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.850> very<00:00:33.180> hard<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> differentiate

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
two would be very hard to differentiate

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.560 
two would be very hard to differentiate
by<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.530> looking<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.100> outside<00:00:35.219> alone<00:00:35.730> all

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
by just looking at the outside alone all

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.880 
by just looking at the outside alone all
the<00:00:36.840> GT<00:00:37.110> eyes<00:00:37.200> are<00:00:37.320> gonna<00:00:37.410> have<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.710> red

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
the GT eyes are gonna have the red

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.340 
the GT eyes are gonna have the red
stripe<00:00:38.280> along<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.760> front<00:00:39.030> grille<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.350> it

very quick and easy way to notice a

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.950 
very quick and easy way to notice a
difference<00:00:52.460> but<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.579> also<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:54.149> another

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
difference but you also have another

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.720 
difference but you also have another
feature<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.039> notice<00:00:56.250> which<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
feature that you can notice which is a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.360 
feature that you can notice which is a
larger<00:00:57.239> brake<00:00:57.539> rotor<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.140> that's<00:00:59.010> gonna<00:00:59.160> be

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
larger brake rotor and that's gonna be

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.700 
larger brake rotor and that's gonna be
found<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> front<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.780> rear<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.590> the

hood of the GTI performance package
you're<00:01:14.100> not<00:01:14.220> going<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.400> be<00:01:14.460> able<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:14.850> any

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
you're not going to be able to see any

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.850 
you're not going to be able to see any
difference<00:01:15.210> compared<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> normal<00:01:16.350> GTI

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
difference compared to the normal GTI

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.070 
difference compared to the normal GTI
this<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.000> still<00:01:18.240> got<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> 2-liter

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
this is still got the 2-liter

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.590 
this is still got the 2-liter
turbocharged<00:01:19.920> gasoline<00:01:20.009> engine<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:20.970> it's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
turbocharged gasoline engine and it's

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.170 
turbocharged gasoline engine and it's
rated<00:01:21.869> at<00:01:21.960> about<00:01:22.250> 258<00:01:23.250> foot-pounds<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.790> torque

rated at about 258 foot-pounds of torque

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.210 
rated at about 258 foot-pounds of torque
however<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.140> performance<00:01:25.290> package<00:01:25.979> gives

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
however the performance package gives

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.880 
however the performance package gives
you<00:01:26.369> an<00:01:26.490> increase<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.030> 10<00:01:27.299> horsepower<00:01:27.590> so<00:01:28.590> this

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
you an increase of 10 horsepower so this

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.670 
you an increase of 10 horsepower so this
one<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.220> rated<00:01:29.369> at<00:01:29.610> 220<00:01:30.600> horsepower<00:01:30.900> compared

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
one is rated at 220 horsepower compared

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.370 
one is rated at 220 horsepower compared
to<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> normal<00:01:32.040> GTI<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.490> 210<00:01:33.210> now<00:01:34.079> if<00:01:34.290> you

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
to the normal GTI is 210 now if you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.719 
to the normal GTI is 210 now if you
looked<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.650> little<00:01:34.680> bit<00:01:34.950> deeper<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.400> engine

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
looked a little bit deeper in the engine

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.760 
looked a little bit deeper in the engine
and<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:36.060> had<00:01:36.180> x-ray<00:01:36.540> mechanic<00:01:36.990> vision<00:01:37.290> we'd<00:01:37.680> be

all the way up above 7,000 rpms if you

all the way up above 7,000 rpms if you

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
want to take it that high but you really

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.710 
want to take it that high but you really
don't<00:02:58.370> need<00:02:58.519> to<00:02:58.580> because<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.060> peak<00:02:59.390> torque

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
don't need to because the peak torque

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.110 
don't need to because the peak torque
starts<00:03:00.110> around<00:03:00.410> just<00:03:00.830> below<00:03:01.070> 2,000<00:03:01.730> rpms

starts around just below 2,000 rpms
which<00:03:02.690> is<00:03:03.620> probably<00:03:04.010> more<00:03:04.190> realistic<00:03:04.570> for<00:03:05.570> the
