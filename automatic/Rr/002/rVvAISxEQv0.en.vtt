thought<00:05:35.860> there<00:05:36.040> might<00:05:36.190> be<00:05:36.340> for<00:05:36.490> a<00:05:36.550> second

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
thought there might be for a second

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.310 
thought there might be for a second
because<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.270> Sony<00:05:37.540> releases<00:05:37.900> yet<00:05:38.229> this

if<00:05:41.650> maybe<00:05:41.740> they'd<00:05:42.220> have<00:05:42.340> inside<00:05:42.669> artwork<00:05:42.790> but

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
if maybe they'd have inside artwork but

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.690 
if maybe they'd have inside artwork but

whole plot basically much like how the
digi<00:06:46.040> books<00:06:46.280> work<00:06:46.640> except<00:06:47.600> this<00:06:47.720> time<00:06:48.320> the

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
digi books work except this time the

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.950 
digi books work except this time the
story<00:06:48.920> book<00:06:49.070> is<00:06:49.190> actually<00:06:49.420> no<00:06:50.420> longer<00:06:50.630> part<00:06:50.900> of

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
story book is actually no longer part of

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.900 
story book is actually no longer part of
the<00:06:51.050> Digi<00:06:51.350> book<00:06:51.530> you<00:06:52.100> know<00:06:52.220> they<00:06:52.340> probably<00:06:52.610> did

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.910 
the Digi book you know they probably did

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.420 
the Digi book you know they probably did
do<00:06:53.120> this<00:06:53.300> because<00:06:53.540> that<00:06:54.290> way<00:06:54.890> children<00:06:55.310> aren't

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.430 
do this because that way children aren't

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.750 
do this because that way children aren't
like<00:06:55.640> ruining<00:06:56.150> the<00:06:56.560> actual<00:06:57.560> movie<00:06:57.950> every<00:06:58.610> time

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:58.760 
like ruining the actual movie every time

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.550 
like ruining the actual movie every time
they<00:06:58.910> want<00:06:59.060> to<00:06:59.120> read<00:06:59.240> the<00:06:59.360> story<00:06:59.690> was<00:06:59.930> in<00:07:00.350> the

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 
they want to read the story was in the

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.580 
they want to read the story was in the
case<00:07:00.740> of<00:07:00.919> dizzy<00:07:01.310> books<00:07:01.900> it<00:07:02.900> might<00:07:03.080> might<00:07:03.530> be

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:03.590 
case of dizzy books it might might be

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.280 
case of dizzy books it might might be
more<00:07:03.950> of<00:07:04.010> a<00:07:04.070> problem<00:07:04.340> for<00:07:04.610> kids<00:07:05.140> so<00:07:06.140> that's

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.290 
more of a problem for kids so that's

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.840 
more of a problem for kids so that's
probably<00:07:06.440> why<00:07:06.620> they<00:07:06.770> made<00:07:06.919> it<00:07:07.040> separate<00:07:07.580> but

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:07.850 
probably why they made it separate but

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.670 
probably why they made it separate but
for<00:07:08.300> someone<00:07:08.510> like<00:07:08.630> me<00:07:08.930> who's<00:07:09.110> a<00:07:09.140> collector
