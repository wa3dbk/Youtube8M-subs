00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 greetings youtube two you are rent in 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.960
 this video will show you more tricks of 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.240
 final fantasy touch for gba these 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.400
 tricks that you will see below cost me 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.650
 get them so that they do not pass 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.109
 the same job that I will spend 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.630
 Well, I'll start by opening the game, I do not know 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.109
 worry I will explain step by step what 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.109
 they must do 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.910
 I'll go into the tavern and look for a 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.350
 mission that requires an artifact that I 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.350
 do not have attentive 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.450
 As you can see, they ask me for the object 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.450
 dictionary which I do not have 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.150
 now I will introduce the tricks of the 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.620
 artifacts 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.620
 remember break bank 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.930
 this is the master code without this 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.930
 will work the tricks 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.659
 and now to look for the artifact of 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.240
 dictionary some names can be 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.970
 distinguish and others do not but they are all 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.340
 the artifacts that's how I found them 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.740
 and since I'm lazy I did not want to take the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.020
 time to identify artifacts 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.820
 from this list, I'll take care of them 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.280
 you haha 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.750
 this will take a while since I do not know in 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.750
 where is the dictionary 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.150
 there you see it in this case if it says the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.150
 correct name 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.850
 do not see now I have the dictionary a 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.430
 once they prove that the artifact that 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.440
 they were looking for they are removing the code right away 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.390
 when I tried it for the first time I had 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.620
 a few problems that I will tell you 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.620
 at the end of this video 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.620
 good 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.180
 very well that's what I wanted 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.760
 show them and now the problems of this 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.130
 trick to start can not use it with 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.620
 two artifacts at a time because it will be created 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.270
 a mess and will not walk what it means 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.040
 than to do those missions that 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.050
 require more than one object should 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.600
 get at least one of the two to 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.970
 then introduce the trick also this 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.710
 trick changes the artifact from the top of 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.780
 the list that you want 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.910
 have for the trick that they put 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.520
 example if we have salamantina in the 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.620
 top of the list and introduce the trick 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.630
 of the dictionary is adam and team already 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.670
 will replace with the dictionary another 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.160
 problem is that you can only do it with one 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.410
 mission at the same time an example if you are 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.720
 using the dictionary on a mission and the 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.730
 dictionary is at the top of the list 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.040
 and we introduce the trick for another 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.020
 artifact that dictionary will be replaced 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.600
 by the chosen device and it will remain 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.940
 marked as in use on a mission that 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.650
 belonged to the dictionary and once 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.110
 finished the mission that artifact 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.660
 will remain marked and can not be deleted 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.270
 which is annoying and if that happens 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.190
 this trick will no longer serve you because 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.260
 every time they use that artifact 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.810
 will change but will continue in the same mission 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.730
 that belonged to the dictionary which 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.250
 means they can not use that 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.320
 artifact although they change it millions of 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.570
 good times those are the problems that 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.090
 I have discovered but I think there is more 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.670
 so I tell them to be careful 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.130
 use it and do not abuse this trick and 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.970
 I hope you enjoy it please leave 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.970
