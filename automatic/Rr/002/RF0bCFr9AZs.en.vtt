story co-written by William C beats and
we<00:00:27.900> think<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.140> adds<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.410> lot<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.740> resistance

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
we think it adds a lot to the resistance

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.529 
we think it adds a lot to the resistance

invasion from more civilian perspective
you<00:00:33.600> can<00:00:33.690> see<00:00:33.870> visually<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.500> very<00:00:34.800> much<00:00:34.980> what

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
you can see visually it's very much what

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.940 
you can see visually it's very much what
I<00:00:35.309> think<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.670> resistance<00:00:36.120> player<00:00:36.390> expects<00:00:37.260> no

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
I think a resistance player expects no

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.400 
I think a resistance player expects no
compromises<00:00:38.760> were<00:00:39.420> made<00:00:39.690> bringing<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.200> over

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
compromises were made bringing this over

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.139 
compromises were made bringing this over
to<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.680> PlayStation<00:00:41.250> Vita<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> really

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
to the PlayStation Vita we have a really

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.709 
to the PlayStation Vita we have a really
rich<00:00:42.360> visual<00:00:42.829> lighting<00:00:43.829> environment<00:00:44.719> now

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
rich visual lighting environment now

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.910 
rich visual lighting environment now
we're<00:00:45.840> bringing<00:00:45.930> back<00:00:46.110> familiar<00:00:46.590> enemies

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
we're bringing back familiar enemies

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.580 
we're bringing back familiar enemies
like<00:00:47.100> these<00:00:47.309> leaping<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.079> familiar<00:00:49.079> weapons

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
like these leaping and familiar weapons

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.319 
like these leaping and familiar weapons
like<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.070> carbine<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.700> were<00:00:50.789> firing<00:00:51.059> with

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
like the carbine that were firing with

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.110 
like the carbine that were firing with
you

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
you

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.950 
you
one<00:00:54.120> really<00:00:54.269> cool<00:00:54.359> thing<00:00:54.539> about<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
one really cool thing about the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.479 
one really cool thing about the
resistance<00:00:55.410> world<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> weapons

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
resistance world is that the weapons

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.310 
resistance world is that the weapons
always<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:56.850> great<00:00:57.300> secondary<00:00:57.839> modes<00:00:58.109> in

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
always have great secondary modes in

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.750 
always have great secondary modes in
this<00:00:58.440> case<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.039> touch<00:00:59.190> anywhere<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
this case I can touch anywhere in the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.329 
this case I can touch anywhere in the
front<00:01:00.000> screen<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.480> lava<00:01:01.110> instant<00:01:01.620> explosion

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
front screen and lava instant explosion

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:03.619 
front screen and lava instant explosion
grenade<00:01:02.579> right<00:01:02.610> at<00:01:02.909> that<00:01:03.000> spot<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.449> world

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
grenade right at that spot in the world

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.119 
grenade right at that spot in the world
so<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:03.930> actually<00:01:04.199> even<00:01:04.290> more<00:01:04.530> flexible<00:01:05.070> than

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
so it's actually even more flexible than

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.219 
so it's actually even more flexible than
it<00:01:05.280> was<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.700> PlayStation<00:01:06.210> 3<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.659> can

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
it was on the PlayStation 3 I can

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.990 
it was on the PlayStation 3 I can
basically<00:01:07.530> spot<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> point<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> world<00:01:08.790> and

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
basically spot a point in the world and

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.170 
basically spot a point in the world and
say<00:01:09.149> I<00:01:09.180> want<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.450> blow<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.869> up<00:01:09.930> right<00:01:10.229> now<00:01:11.180> now

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
say I want to blow that up right now now

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.370 
say I want to blow that up right now now
we<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> new<00:01:12.539> weapon<00:01:12.869> here<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.350> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
we have a new weapon here this is a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.410 
we have a new weapon here this is a
camerin<00:01:13.950> version<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.700> chain<00:01:14.940> gun<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.390> it

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
camerin version of a chain gun so it

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.300 
camerin version of a chain gun so it
takes<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.750> little<00:01:15.869> while<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.229> spin<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:17.220> once

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
takes a little while to spin up but once

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.100 
takes a little while to spin up but once
it<00:01:17.490> does<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.789> got<00:01:17.970> nine<00:01:18.330> barrels<00:01:18.690> of

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
it does it's got nine barrels of

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.660 
it does it's got nine barrels of
destructibility<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:23.280> we're<00:01:23.399> basically

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
destructibility so we're basically

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.399 
destructibility so we're basically
working<00:01:24.149> our<00:01:24.330> way<00:01:24.360> through<00:01:24.479> Ellis<00:01:25.380> Island

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
working our way through Ellis Island

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.320 
working our way through Ellis Island
research<00:01:26.130> facility<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> secret

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
research facility so this is a secret

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.050 
research facility so this is a secret
base<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:28.380> serpa<00:01:28.830> created<00:01:29.190> underneath<00:01:29.670> Ellis

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
base that serpa created underneath Ellis

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.550 
base that serpa created underneath Ellis
Island<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.509> Ellis<00:01:30.750> Island<00:01:30.869> after<00:01:31.140> we're

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
Island the Ellis Island after we're

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.469 
Island the Ellis Island after we're
familiar<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.060> alternate

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
familiar with but in the alternate

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.719 
familiar with but in the alternate
reality<00:01:33.929> of<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.710> resistance<00:01:35.100> universe<00:01:35.490> this

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
reality of the resistance universe this

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.639 
reality of the resistance universe this
is<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> research<00:01:36.270> facility<00:01:36.450> where<00:01:37.440> they're

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
is a research facility where they're

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.469 
is a research facility where they're
looking<00:01:38.069> at<00:01:38.159> Chimeran<00:01:38.640> technology<00:01:39.240> and

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
looking at Chimeran technology and

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.330 
looking at Chimeran technology and
learning<00:01:39.869> how<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.200> use<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.649> for<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:41.159> war

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
learning how to use it for the war

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.550 
learning how to use it for the war
effort<00:01:41.390> in<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.569> case<00:01:42.780> we're<00:01:42.960> picking<00:01:43.289> up<00:01:43.380> a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
effort in this case we're picking up a

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.010 
effort in this case we're picking up a
piece<00:01:43.800> of<00:01:43.830> gray<00:01:44.220> tech<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.000> we're<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:45.990> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
piece of gray tech and we're going to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.570 
piece of gray tech and we're going to
have<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.289> ability<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.679> actually<00:01:46.950> use<00:01:47.369> this

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.609 
the item onto the device now that I have
the<00:02:08.190> gray<00:02:08.369> tech<00:02:08.609> I<00:02:08.850> have<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:09.780> decide<00:02:10.440> how<00:02:10.590> to

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the gray tech I have to decide how to

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.500 
the gray tech I have to decide how to
shape<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.100> and<00:02:11.220> how<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.730> want<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.060> apply<00:02:12.269> it<00:02:12.329> to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
shape it and how I want to apply it to

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.190 
shape it and how I want to apply it to
the<00:02:12.600> weapon<00:02:14.359> so<00:02:15.359> for<00:02:15.540> instance<00:02:15.570> if<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:15.959> want<00:02:16.140> to

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
the weapon so for instance if I want to

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.170 
the weapon so for instance if I want to
make<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.320> torus<00:02:16.739> shape<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:17.070> can<00:02:17.250> pinch<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.940> front

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
make a torus shape I can pinch the front

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.849 
make a torus shape I can pinch the front
and<00:02:18.269> back<00:02:18.390> screens<00:02:18.780> turn<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.500> gray<00:02:19.650> check

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
and back screens turn the gray check

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.440 
and back screens turn the gray check
into<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.100> torus<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.549> if<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.760> put<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.090> into<00:02:21.299> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
into a torus and if I put this into the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.300 
into a torus and if I put this into the
gun<00:02:21.630> it's<00:02:22.140> going<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.380> give<00:02:22.500> me<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.620> fast<00:02:22.890> reload

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
gun it's going to give me a fast reload

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.190 
gun it's going to give me a fast reload
where<00:02:23.609> I<00:02:23.640> can<00:02:23.790> back<00:02:23.970> up<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.359> try<00:02:24.930> another

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
where I can back up and try another

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.020 
where I can back up and try another
option<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.859> maybe<00:02:26.100> stretch<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.640> gray<00:02:26.790> tech

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
option and maybe stretch the gray tech

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.509 
option and maybe stretch the gray tech
into<00:02:27.329> a<00:02:27.359> line<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.989> if<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.769> do<00:02:28.829> this<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.370> my

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
into a line and if I do this to my

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.849 
into a line and if I do this to my
weapon<00:02:29.970> I'm<00:02:30.120> going<00:02:30.269> to<00:02:30.329> get<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.690> upgraded<00:02:31.620> shot

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
weapon I'm going to get a upgraded shot

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.009 
weapon I'm going to get a upgraded shot
a<00:02:31.890> depleted<00:02:32.280> uranium<00:02:32.489> shot<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.630> as<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.780> player

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
a depleted uranium shot so as a player

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.330 
a depleted uranium shot so as a player
goes<00:02:34.230> through<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.470> game<00:02:34.650> they<00:02:34.799> actually<00:02:35.190> have

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
goes through the game they actually have

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.860 
goes through the game they actually have
the<00:02:35.549> choice<00:02:35.850> of<00:02:36.150> how<00:02:36.299> they<00:02:36.420> upgrade<00:02:36.720> their

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
the choice of how they upgrade their

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.390 
the choice of how they upgrade their
weapons<00:02:37.170> as<00:02:37.290> opposed<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.709> just<00:02:37.769> being<00:02:37.950> a

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
weapons as opposed to just being a

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.610 
weapons as opposed to just being a
linear<00:02:38.970> progression<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.540> power<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.440> we<00:02:40.530> think

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
linear progression of power and we think

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.229 
linear progression of power and we think
that's<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:40.890> really<00:02:41.100> cool<00:02:41.310> way<00:02:41.430> than<00:02:41.730> at<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.120> end

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
that's a really cool way than at the end

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.610 
that's a really cool way than at the end
of<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.390> game<00:02:42.420> my<00:02:42.840> weapons<00:02:43.230> are<00:02:43.290> going<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.500> be<00:02:43.590> a

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
of the game my weapons are going to be a

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.840 
of the game my weapons are going to be a
little<00:02:43.739> different<00:02:44.040> than<00:02:44.310> my<00:02:44.400> friends<00:02:44.700> weapons

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
little different than my friends weapons

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.160 
little different than my friends weapons
to<00:02:45.120> also<00:02:45.390> play<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.570> game
