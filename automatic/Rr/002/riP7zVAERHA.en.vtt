or 12 dollars you're not going to

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.359 
or 12 dollars you're not going to
probably<00:00:24.000> be<00:00:24.269> expecting<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.170> much<00:00:25.470> but<00:00:26.160> in

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
probably be expecting that much but in

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.330 
probably be expecting that much but in
fact<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.789> design<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.300> actually<00:00:27.449> pretty<00:00:27.869> good

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
are very lightweight because of that and

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.209
