00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
fired on the channel or something and we

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.270 
fired on the channel or something and we
just<00:01:57.060> decided<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.630> combine<00:01:57.840> them<00:01:58.320> which<00:01:59.070> was

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280

just decided to combine them which was
also<00:01:59.430> kind<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.850> my<00:01:59.969> idea<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.869> maybe<00:02:01.140> my<00:02:01.500> sense

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
also kind of my idea so maybe my sense

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.050 
also kind of my idea so maybe my sense
of<00:02:01.799> humor<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.100> weird<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.490> no<00:02:02.610> one<00:02:02.700> gets<00:02:02.850> it

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
of humor is weird and no one gets it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.090 
of humor is weird and no one gets it
which<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.360> fine<00:02:03.509> too<00:02:03.780> but<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.680> decided<00:02:05.009> to
