00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.129
 hello on this occasion he taught them how 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.050
 make an ideal pop-up envelope for this 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.779
 valentine or any date in 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.290
 special with your friends or with your boyfriend or 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.290
 your girlfriend 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.770
 on a card or on a white sheet 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.410
 draw a rectangle 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:34.230
 along the rectangle we are going to do 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:38.400
 marks at 9 18 and 27 centimeters from 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.430
 both sides then let's join with a 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.220
 straight line each of the brands that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.400
 we just made across the width of 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.250
 rectangle let's make marks at 5 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.610
 5 centimeters points and 13 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.970
 centimeters of both sides of equal 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.980
 way we unite with a straight line in the 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.190
 rectangle from the top that 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.700
 is in the middle we are going to make a mark to 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.320
 the 4.5 centimeters and we will go joining 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.320
 towards the extremes 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.360
 then these ends are going to 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.360
 bring down in this way 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.280
 ready now I'm going to underline the parties 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.939
 what you are going to cut is not necessary 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:39.340
 you mark them because this piece 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.340
 you can use for another craft 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.109
 Now we begin to cut 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.350
 with a plegger or with a punch 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.080
 to mark the lines that we just 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.979
 do get on a cutting surface 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.140
 now with the draft we are going to eliminate 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.299
 all the lines that we have just done 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.900
 so that our work is very 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.900
 cleansed 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.960
 since you finished erasing now doubles 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.070
 with your hands all our folds 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.070
 what we just did 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.069
 now we are going to place glue in this 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.069
 part 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.580
 and in this other part of the tab 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.689
 now if you can decorate your envelope I 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:59.540
 I really wanted him to look like his 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:01.250
 normal mail carrier envelopes but 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.519
 you can decorate it as you like 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.569
 you can use the crap wood or a paper 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:10.629
 decorative made by yourself 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.269
 now let's draw three hearts yo 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:16.090
 I give you the heart option but you 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.890
 you can use a cloud a star not 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.680
 I know what you like most 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.190
 we stick our heart inside of 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.190
 on 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.030
 and then on the remaining paper that 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.700
 we were left we are going to draw a rectangle 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.010
 of 10 centimeters by 2 centimeters and 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.040
 let's go making marks every 2 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.769
 centimeters it is not necessary that some with 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.520
 pencil you can do it with the punch and 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.480
 directly 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.870
 since you finished marking the folds 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.780
 cut out his rectangle 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.110
 and with an eraser or with a rubber removes 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.180
 all brands we just 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.540
 then we are going to fold in the form of 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.540
 accordion 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.860
 check that your accordion is good 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.320
 right and now if you write your message 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.830
 with more you like you can write a 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.040
 surprise you can not write what 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:25.280
 more you want that little person now yes 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:29.170
 let's stick the ends of the accordion 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.170
 towards one of the hearts 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:36.759
 and the other end we're going to stick it on 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.759
 heart that we have inside the envelope 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.670
 and finally finally put a stamp or a 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.040
 heart to cover the poop in the envelope or 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:50.220
 to close the envelope the truth is that 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.800
 it's very easy and this craft for 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:56.310
 I am like very tender very pretty or very 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.130

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.630
 and super tender the truth I hope that you
