this<00:00:04.729> is<00:00:04.880> a<00:00:04.910> 2000<00:00:05.660> Suzi<00:00:06.050> Hayabusa<00:00:07.149> it<00:00:08.149> has<00:00:08.330> a

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 
this is a 2000 Suzi Hayabusa it has a

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.900 
this is a 2000 Suzi Hayabusa it has a
plug-and-play<00:00:08.870> box<00:00:09.410> that<00:00:09.830> I've<00:00:09.980> made<00:00:10.309> that

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
plug-and-play box that I've made that

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.020 
plug-and-play box that I've made that
it's<00:00:11.450> based<00:00:11.660> on<00:00:11.839> the<00:00:11.959> microscope<00:00:12.379> module<00:00:13.030> has

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
it's based on the microscope module has

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.750

into<00:00:16.910> the<00:00:17.030> stock<00:00:17.240> harness<00:00:17.510> so<00:00:18.140> you<00:00:18.200> don't<00:00:18.320> have

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
into the stock harness so you don't have

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.740 
into the stock harness so you don't have

studio<00:01:08.720> setup<00:01:09.229> on<00:01:09.530> it<00:01:09.850> we'll<00:01:10.850> go<00:01:10.970> ahead<00:01:11.060> and

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
studio setup on it we'll go ahead and

00:01:11.150 --> 00:02:16.750 
studio setup on it we'll go ahead and
start<00:01:11.450> it

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:32.800 

we'll<00:02:17.760> try<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.000> again<00:02:18.120> here

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.350 

now<00:02:33.810> that's<00:02:34.140> up<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.860> wrote<00:02:35.730> some<00:02:35.940> special

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
now that's up I wrote some special

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.920 
now that's up I wrote some special
firmware<00:02:37.190> actually<00:02:38.190> how<00:02:38.360> wrote<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.600> special

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
firmware actually how wrote a special

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.630 
firmware actually how wrote a special
add-on<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.740> some<00:02:40.890> farm<00:02:41.130> where<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.490> was

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
add-on to some farm where that was

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.960 
add-on to some farm where that was
already<00:02:41.910> out<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:44.400> firmware<00:02:44.610> on<00:02:44.760> this

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
already out the firmware on this

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.420 
already out the firmware on this
controller<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.750> sequential<00:02:46.430> firmware

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
controller is the sequential firmware

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.800 
controller is the sequential firmware
which<00:02:48.330> will<00:02:48.510> do<00:02:49.250> four-cylinder<00:02:50.250> fuel

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
which will do four-cylinder fuel

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.940 
which will do four-cylinder fuel
sequential<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.290> ignition<00:02:52.470> course<00:02:52.830> of

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
sequential and the ignition course of

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.950 
sequential and the ignition course of
the<00:02:53.100> regular<00:02:53.250> co2<00:02:53.610> do<00:02:53.820> ignition<00:02:54.270> regular

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
the regular co2 do ignition regular

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.670 
the regular co2 do ignition regular
extra<00:02:55.260> code<00:02:55.470> will<00:02:56.030> but<00:02:57.030> this<00:02:57.180> also<00:02:57.420> has<00:02:57.750> trip

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
extra code will but this also has trip

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.670 
extra code will but this also has trip
tables<00:02:59.130> for<00:02:59.370> each<00:02:59.580> injector<00:03:00.240> for<00:03:00.720> if<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.500> want

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
tables for each injector for if you want

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.320 
tables for each injector for if you want
to<00:03:01.740> do<00:03:01.860> sequential<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:02.700> control<00:03:03.120> right<00:03:03.270> now

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
to do sequential this control right now

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.130 
to do sequential this control right now
is<00:03:03.570> running<00:03:03.750> just<00:03:04.350> match<00:03:04.590> fire<00:03:05.840> but<00:03:06.840> I<00:03:06.870> also

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
is running just match fire but I also

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.890 
is running just match fire but I also
added<00:03:08.870> gear<00:03:09.870> sets<00:03:10.140> are<00:03:10.260> set<00:03:10.470> up<00:03:11.030> so<00:03:12.030> if<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.780> can

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
added gear sets are set up so if you can

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.040 
added gear sets are set up so if you can
see<00:03:13.080> us<00:03:13.200> this<00:03:13.350> camera<00:03:13.770> doesn't<00:03:14.130> do<00:03:14.220> real<00:03:14.460> good

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
see us this camera doesn't do real good

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.400 
see us this camera doesn't do real good
but<00:03:16.050> you<00:03:16.470> can<00:03:16.620> see<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:17.570> ADC<00:03:18.570> voltage<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:19.110> for

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
but you can see the ADC voltage is for

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.680 
but you can see the ADC voltage is for
each<00:03:19.950> gear<00:03:20.250> well<00:03:20.400> this<00:03:20.520> takes<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:21.000> stock

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
each gear well this takes the stock

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.810 
each gear well this takes the stock
Suzuki<00:03:22.470> GPS<00:03:23.160> sensor<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:24.150> will<00:03:25.140> read<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.530> and

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
Suzuki GPS sensor and will read it and

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.100 
Suzuki GPS sensor and will read it and
then<00:03:26.820> we've<00:03:26.970> got<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.150> gear<00:03:27.390> gauge<00:03:27.630> set<00:03:27.870> up<00:03:27.960> over

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
then we've got a gear gauge set up over

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.710 
then we've got a gear gauge set up over
here<00:03:28.320> so<00:03:28.470> we<00:03:28.560> can<00:03:28.710> tell<00:03:28.860> what<00:03:29.010> gear<00:03:29.250> it's<00:03:29.430> in<00:03:29.720> I

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
here so we can tell what gear it's in I

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.600 
here so we can tell what gear it's in I
also<00:03:31.230> added<00:03:32.570> shift<00:03:33.570> kill<00:03:33.810> for<00:03:34.800> air<00:03:35.160> shifter

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
also added shift kill for air shifter

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.190
