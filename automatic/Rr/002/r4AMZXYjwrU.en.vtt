00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.389 
the play
I<00:01:29.929> think<00:01:30.470> that's<00:01:30.649> one<00:01:30.800> of<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:30.950> things<00:01:31.189> that

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
I think that's one of the things that

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.190 
I think that's one of the things that
really<00:01:31.430> separates<00:01:32.180> her<00:01:32.390> you<00:01:32.840> know<00:01:32.930> from<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.170> lot

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
really separates her you know from a lot

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.929 
really separates her you know from a lot
