00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
narrower strap so back behind our neck

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.529 
narrower strap so back behind our neck
we<00:00:54.899> don't<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.199> big<00:00:55.440> huge<00:00:55.739> bulky<00:00:56.250> thing

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539

post and this is the post this up here
is<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.689> loop<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.110> that's<00:01:13.260> where<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.590> would

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
is the loop and that's where we would

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.230 
is the loop and that's where we would
place<00:01:14.010> our<00:01:14.189> sits<00:01:14.430> if<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:14.640> were<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:14.909> gonna<00:01:15.030> do

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
a half double crochet we would go in the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.810 
a half double crochet we would go in the
spot<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.390> need<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.840> go<00:01:19.020> down<00:01:19.320> around<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
spot but I need to go down around the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.340 
spot but I need to go down around the
post<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:21.720> going<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.900> go<00:01:21.990> clear<00:01:22.320> down

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
post and so I'm going to go clear down

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.770 
post and so I'm going to go clear down
here<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.799> some<00:01:22.890> people<00:01:23.189> get<00:01:24.060> really<00:01:24.240> confused

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
here and some people get really confused

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.330 
here and some people get really confused
about<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.590> did<00:01:25.860> too<00:01:26.040> when<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.250> first

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
about that and I did too when I first

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.289 
about that and I did too when I first
started<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.750> look<00:01:27.960> really<00:01:28.229> close<00:01:29.299> I'm

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
started so if you look really close I'm

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.030 
started so if you look really close I'm
going<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.600> not<00:01:30.780> go<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.259> loop<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:31.890> that's

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
going to not go in this loop see that's

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.679 
going to not go in this loop see that's
where<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.189> did<00:01:32.340> my<00:01:32.369> single<00:01:32.820> crochets<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.540> those

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
where I did my single crochets in those

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.660 
where I did my single crochets in those
loops<00:01:33.930> I'm<00:01:34.079> going<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.290> go<00:01:34.380> down<00:01:34.770> around<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
loops I'm going to go down around the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.120

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.539 
band I just wanted some texture and so
