that<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:18.000> find<00:00:18.330> five<00:00:18.930> seven<00:00:19.289> one<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
that you find five seven one on the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.689 
that you find five seven one on the
conventional<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.949> I<00:00:22.949> had<00:00:23.279> done<00:00:23.460> some

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.589 

Association<00:00:26.699> changes<00:00:28.760> some<00:00:29.760> by<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.029> same<00:00:30.330> is

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
Association changes some by the same is

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.840 
Association changes some by the same is
the<00:00:30.869> interest<00:00:31.320> better<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:32.660> think<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:35.280> scale<00:00:35.579> of

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
the interest better I think the scale of

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.229 
the interest better I think the scale of
it<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.030> better<00:00:36.360> because<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:37.050> one's<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:38.239> bit

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
it is better because this one's a bit

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.819 
it is better because this one's a bit
bigger<00:00:41.510> but<00:00:42.510> yeah<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.690> know<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.050> say<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.410> from

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
bigger but yeah I know I say this from

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.770 
bigger but yeah I know I say this from
there<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.309> kind<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.090> big

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
there is kind of big
