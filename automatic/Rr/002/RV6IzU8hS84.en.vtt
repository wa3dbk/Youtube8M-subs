00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.290
 Ines in the Polytechnic of Madrid 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.800
 conclusions of this championship maría 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:19.660
 the new code and new gymnastics very 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.340
 changed I think it 's much improved 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.710
 so let's see let's see one of 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.960
 the veterans the two veterans have been 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.840
 silvia miteva from bulgaria and caroline 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.849
 austria wheeler and starts with silvia 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.120
 it takes me that in the European was fifth 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:37.350
 two years ago and fourth in the world 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.350
 also two years ago in this device 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.619
 at certain moments pigeon reminded me 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:15.420
 the exercise of maria petro over there 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.069
 year 92 with the Carmina Burana this new 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.550
 code has reduced the number of 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.769
 difficulties to 9 forces to include a 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.050
 combination of steps of spears that 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.690
 limits to three the dynamic elements of 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.420
 rotation the launch and good does not put 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.430
 limit to the masters with device gives 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.250
 more time to care gymnasts 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.470
 the links the choreography the character 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.200
 of music because also this code 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.569
 is rewarding especially for the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.730
 aspects related to the expression 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.970
 body and good with what is the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.900
 traditional essence of rhythm is that 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.579
 symbiosis between mobile music movement 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.819
 and connecting with the public with the 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.950
 people that we are seeing this 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.930
