this tray sitting on top of those tabs

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:39.730 
this tray sitting on top of those tabs
right<00:03:31.380> through<00:03:31.620> here<00:03:33.320> like<00:03:34.320> this<00:03:35.240> slide<00:03:36.240> it<00:03:36.390> in

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
then what that does is creates an angle

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.840 
then what that does is creates an angle
for<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.870> eggs<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.410> roll<00:03:46.560> down<00:03:47.060> into<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.270> tray

next<00:03:52.820> install<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:53.850> perch<00:03:54.620> these<00:03:55.620> purchase

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
next install the perch these purchase

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.990 
next install the perch these purchase
perches<00:03:56.940> have<00:03:57.120> three<00:03:58.070> tabs<00:03:59.070> on<00:03:59.340> them<00:03:59.550> on<00:03:59.700> each

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
perches have three tabs on them on each

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.190 
perches have three tabs on them on each
side<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:01.950> also<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.310> locking<00:04:02.820> mechanism<00:04:03.200> when

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
side and also a locking mechanism when

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.520 
side and also a locking mechanism when
you<00:04:04.290> slide<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.710> this<00:04:04.830> way<00:04:06.020> it<00:04:07.020> pulls<00:04:07.320> these

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
you slide it this way it pulls these

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.760 
you slide it this way it pulls these
back<00:04:07.800> in<00:04:08.070> so<00:04:08.700> what<00:04:08.850> you'll<00:04:09.030> do<00:04:09.210> is<00:04:09.510> on<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.530> top

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
back in so what you'll do is on the top

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.230 
back in so what you'll do is on the top
three<00:04:11.280> holes<00:04:12.470> insert<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:13.620> pull<00:04:14.190> that<00:04:14.430> locking

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
three holes insert it pull that locking

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.349 
three holes insert it pull that locking
mechanism<00:04:15.840> back<00:04:19.670> put<00:04:20.670> it<00:04:20.760> in<00:04:20.880> here<00:04:21.030> until<00:04:21.180> it

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
mechanism back put it in here until it

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.450 
mechanism back put it in here until it
snaps<00:04:22.430> and

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
snaps and

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.840 
snaps and
it<00:04:25.240> is<00:04:25.389> installed
