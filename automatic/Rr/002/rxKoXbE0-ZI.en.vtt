00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300

pretty<00:02:18.660> hot<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.080> touch<00:02:19.200> that's<00:02:19.680> when<00:02:19.890> I

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
pretty hot to the touch that's when I

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.780 
pretty hot to the touch that's when I
let<00:02:20.310> go<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.540> move<00:02:21.720> on

let go of it and I move on

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.520 
let go of it and I move on
so<00:02:24.209> we're<00:02:24.330> just<00:02:24.390> gonna<00:02:24.569> do<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.959> same<00:02:24.989> thing<00:02:25.409> on

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
so we're just gonna do the same thing on

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.970 
so we're just gonna do the same thing on
this<00:02:25.680> other<00:02:25.830> side

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.110 

start<00:02:30.980> at<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.099> top<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.519> roll<00:02:31.610> all<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:31.849> way<00:02:32.060> to

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
start at the top and roll all the way to

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.300 
start at the top and roll all the way to
the<00:02:32.330> bottom<00:02:32.480> that's<00:02:33.470> pretty<00:02:33.739> much<00:02:33.890> all<00:02:34.069> it<00:02:34.099> is

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
the bottom that's pretty much all it is

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:48.240 
the bottom that's pretty much all it is
over<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.760> over<00:02:34.909> and<00:02:35.000> over<00:02:35.090> again

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.770 

then<00:02:49.250> I'm<00:02:49.370> going<00:02:49.549> to<00:02:49.610> bring<00:02:49.790> down<00:02:49.849> the<00:02:50.150> second

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
then I'm going to bring down the second

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.780 
then I'm going to bring down the second
section<00:02:51.200> of<00:02:51.470> hair<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:51.920> do<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.340> all<00:02:52.459> over<00:02:52.489> again

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
section of hair and do it all over again

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.780 
section of hair and do it all over again
and<00:02:53.239> I<00:02:53.659> curling<00:02:54.290> everything<00:02:55.040> away<00:02:55.220> from<00:02:55.430> my

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.570 
face
I<00:02:56.330> don't<00:02:57.319> usually<00:02:57.470> alternate<00:02:58.129> this<00:02:58.310> because

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
I don't usually alternate this because

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.979 
I don't usually alternate this because
it<00:02:58.730> just<00:02:58.819> doesn't<00:02:59.209> work<00:02:59.269> out<00:02:59.450> for<00:02:59.720> me<00:02:59.750> some

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
it just doesn't work out for me some

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.170 
it just doesn't work out for me some
people<00:03:00.140> do<00:03:00.379> but<00:03:01.190> I<00:03:01.549> just<00:03:01.580> like<00:03:01.909> to<00:03:02.030> keep

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
people do but I just like to keep

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.180 
people do but I just like to keep
everything<00:03:02.450> going<00:03:02.629> in<00:03:02.959> one<00:03:03.140> direction<00:03:03.190> kinda

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
everything going in one direction kinda

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:47.240 
everything going in one direction kinda
gives<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.549> an<00:03:04.760> all-over<00:03:05.319> pretty<00:03:06.319> deep

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.010 

and<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.370> also<00:03:48.580> like<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.090> take<00:03:49.270> my<00:03:49.420> sections<00:03:49.930> a

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
and I also like to take my sections a

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.540 
and I also like to take my sections a
little<00:03:50.290> bit<00:03:50.410> smaller<00:03:50.739> in<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.099> back

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
little bit smaller in the back

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.610 
little bit smaller in the back
cuz<00:03:51.700> I<00:03:51.819> feel<00:03:52.000> like<00:03:52.180> that's<00:03:52.420> where<00:03:52.630> my<00:03:52.810> curls

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
cuz I feel like that's where my curls

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.870 
cuz I feel like that's where my curls
fall<00:03:53.890> out<00:03:54.069> the<00:03:54.250> fastest

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
fall out the fastest

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.850 
fall out the fastest
so<00:03:55.599> I<00:03:55.630> mean<00:03:55.780> take<00:03:55.959> smaller<00:03:56.200> sections<00:03:56.410> and

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
so I mean take smaller sections and

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.030 
so I mean take smaller sections and
notice<00:03:57.310> how<00:03:57.489> I'm<00:03:57.730> still<00:03:58.090> leaving<00:03:58.360> out

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
notice how I'm still leaving out

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.220 
notice how I'm still leaving out
different<00:04:00.040> little<00:04:00.569> lengths<00:04:01.569> of<00:04:01.720> hair<00:04:01.750> at<00:04:02.110> the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
different little lengths of hair at the

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
different little lengths of hair at the
bottom<00:04:02.530> leaving<00:04:02.680> them<00:04:02.920> straight

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.980 

and<00:04:27.250> I<00:04:27.370> actually<00:04:27.610> kind<00:04:28.120> of<00:04:28.180> feel<00:04:28.330> like<00:04:28.390> I<00:04:28.690> love

layer<00:05:35.590> and<00:05:35.919> curling<00:05:36.310> it<00:05:36.400> away<00:05:36.550> from<00:05:36.729> my<00:05:36.879> face

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
layer and curling it away from my face

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.029 
layer and curling it away from my face
using<00:05:37.360> the<00:05:37.659> same<00:05:37.870> technique<00:05:38.229> starting<00:05:38.800> at<00:05:38.919> the

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
using the same technique starting at the

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.629 
using the same technique starting at the
top<00:05:39.220> and<00:05:39.280> working<00:05:39.789> my<00:05:39.940> way<00:05:39.970> down<00:05:41.159> all<00:05:42.159> the<00:05:42.520> way

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
top and working my way down all the way

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.279 
top and working my way down all the way
around<00:05:43.000> because<00:05:43.300> this<00:05:43.569> is<00:05:43.690> my<00:05:43.840> real<00:05:44.050> hair<00:05:44.229> and

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
around because this is my real hair and

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.170 
around because this is my real hair and
like<00:05:44.500> I<00:05:44.650> said<00:05:44.889> it<00:05:45.009> just<00:05:45.159> doesn't<00:05:45.580> curl<00:05:45.819> as<00:05:46.000> well

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
like I said it just doesn't curl as well

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.330 
like I said it just doesn't curl as well
as<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.419> extensions<00:05:46.960> do<00:05:47.169> that's<00:05:47.830> why<00:05:48.009> I<00:05:48.039> use

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
as the extensions do that's why I use

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.700 
as the extensions do that's why I use
the<00:05:48.580> smaller<00:05:48.819> curling<00:05:49.240> iron<00:05:49.419> and<00:05:50.050> especially

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
the smaller curling iron and especially

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.830 
the smaller curling iron and especially
those<00:05:51.250> little<00:05:51.520> sections<00:05:51.940> are<00:05:52.060> only<00:05:52.300> face<00:05:52.569> I

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
those little sections are only face I

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.350 
those little sections are only face I
like<00:05:53.020> them<00:05:53.259> to<00:05:53.500> be<00:05:53.620> a<00:05:53.650> little<00:05:53.860> tighter<00:05:54.190> and<00:05:55.150> so

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
like them to be a little tighter and so

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.700 
like them to be a little tighter and so
that's<00:05:55.569> another<00:05:55.810> reason<00:05:56.020> why<00:05:56.289> I<00:05:56.319> use<00:05:56.560> the

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
that's another reason why I use the

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:27.780 
that's another reason why I use the
smaller<00:05:56.949> failure

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.620 

you

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.150 

now<00:06:33.630> that<00:06:33.810> I've<00:06:33.930> got<00:06:34.140> everything<00:06:34.290> all<00:06:34.740> curled

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
now that I've got everything all curled

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.350 
now that I've got everything all curled
I'll<00:06:35.370> just<00:06:35.580> kind<00:06:35.820> of<00:06:35.880> go<00:06:36.030> through<00:06:36.210> and

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
I'll just kind of go through and

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.120 
I'll just kind of go through and
separate<00:06:36.840> all<00:06:36.870> the<00:06:37.080> curls<00:06:37.380> and<00:06:37.650> comb<00:06:37.860> them<00:06:38.010> out

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
separate all the curls and comb them out

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.100 
separate all the curls and comb them out
a<00:06:38.160> little<00:06:38.370> with<00:06:38.580> my<00:06:38.700> fingers<00:06:39.120> I<00:06:39.390> don't<00:06:39.690> like

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
a little with my fingers I don't like

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.230 
a little with my fingers I don't like
taking<00:06:40.410> a<00:06:40.500> brush<00:06:40.740> to<00:06:40.950> it<00:06:41.100> bickering<00:06:41.460> kills<00:06:41.940> all

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
taking a brush to it bickering kills all

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.600 
taking a brush to it bickering kills all
of<00:06:42.270> my<00:06:42.480> curls<00:06:42.780> then<00:06:43.680> I'll<00:06:43.920> pick<00:06:44.130> up<00:06:44.280> little

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
of my curls then I'll pick up little

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.420 
of my curls then I'll pick up little
pieces<00:06:44.760> here<00:06:45.150> in<00:06:45.330> there<00:06:45.540> that<00:06:46.230> are<00:06:46.530> less<00:06:47.190> than

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
pieces here in there that are less than

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.880 
pieces here in there that are less than
desirable<00:06:47.820> a<00:06:48.180> curly<00:06:48.630> and<00:06:48.870> I'll<00:06:49.290> just<00:06:49.470> use<00:06:49.710> the

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890 
desirable a curly and I'll just use the

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.700 
desirable a curly and I'll just use the
smaller<00:06:50.130> curling<00:06:50.550> iron<00:06:51.050> just<00:06:52.050> hair<00:06:52.380> in<00:06:52.500> there

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
smaller curling iron just hair in there

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:57.170 
smaller curling iron just hair in there
not<00:06:52.980> all<00:06:53.280> over<00:06:53.670> the<00:06:53.760> place<00:06:55.670> to<00:06:56.670> kind<00:06:56.910> of<00:06:56.940> piece

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180
