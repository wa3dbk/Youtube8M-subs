want me to be a charmeleon straight up

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.180 
want me to be a charmeleon straight up
don't<00:03:09.360> you

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.730 

did<00:03:15.190> I<00:03:15.280> haven't<00:03:15.520> Machop<00:03:15.820> yes<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:16.930> did<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:20.170> how

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
did I haven't Machop yes I did and how

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.900 
did I haven't Machop yes I did and how
does<00:03:20.800> Charmeleon<00:03:21.640> work<00:03:21.820> again<00:03:23.220> 30

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
does Charmeleon work again 30

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.030 
does Charmeleon work again 30
this<00:03:26.540> would<00:03:26.690> work<00:03:26.810> really<00:03:27.050> well<00:03:27.200> in<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.530> DSO

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
this would work really well in the DSO

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.300 
this would work really well in the DSO
you<00:03:28.130> could<00:03:28.280> actually<00:03:28.460> look<00:03:28.850> at<00:03:29.000> your<00:03:29.150> hand<00:03:30.310> and

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
you could actually look at your hand and

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.670 
you could actually look at your hand and
touch<00:03:32.060> screen<00:03:32.420> functionality<00:03:32.690> so<00:03:33.500> you<00:03:33.590> can

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
touch screen functionality so you can

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.600 
touch screen functionality so you can
just<00:03:33.820> tap<00:03:34.820> like<00:03:35.180> you're<00:03:35.330> trying<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:36.490> lick<00:03:37.490> your

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
just tap like you're trying to lick your

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.650 
just tap like you're trying to lick your
hand<00:03:38.950> can<00:03:39.950> miss<00:03:40.220> all<00:03:40.490> that<00:03:43.210> was<00:03:44.210> a<00:03:44.240> good

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
hand can miss all that was a good

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.129

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
drain punch should be real thing you

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.590 
drain punch should be real thing you
punch<00:04:20.410> someone<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:21.070> then<00:04:21.270> steal<00:04:22.270> all<00:04:22.479> the

life energy hopefully i get another

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.550 
life energy hopefully i get another

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
clean energy

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.490 
clean energy
just<00:04:27.710> gonna<00:04:27.919> I'm<00:04:28.580> sacrificing<00:04:28.940> this

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.490

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
okay I'm barely alive energy search well

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.520 
okay I'm barely alive energy search well
that's<00:04:35.680> almost<00:04:36.040> as<00:04:36.250> good<00:04:36.280> as<00:04:36.430> an<00:04:36.610> energy<00:04:36.730> card

it over anything else should just

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.520 
it over anything else should just
