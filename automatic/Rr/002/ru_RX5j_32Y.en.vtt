00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
down the road so very confusing when you

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.580 
down the road so very confusing when you
start<00:01:57.570> trying<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.810> think<00:01:58.049> about<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.409> stuff

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
start trying to think about this stuff

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.039 
start trying to think about this stuff
because<00:01:58.799> I've<00:01:59.549> had<00:01:59.820> my<00:02:00.030> Furies<00:02:00.509> enhance<00:02:00.869> and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
because I've had my Furies enhance and

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.300 
because I've had my Furies enhance and
seeing<00:02:01.229> other<00:02:01.380> cheifetz<00:02:01.740> talk<00:02:01.950> about<00:02:02.189> it

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
seeing other cheifetz talk about it

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.060 
seeing other cheifetz talk about it
seems<00:02:02.579> like<00:02:02.729> maybe<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.719> white<00:02:04.229> teacher<00:02:04.590> might

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
seems like maybe the white teacher might

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.649 
seems like maybe the white teacher might
be<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> one<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.790> killed<00:02:06.030> kurta<00:02:06.450> halls

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
path that really starts keeping to this

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.199 
path that really starts keeping to this
like<00:04:13.109> one<00:04:13.379> key<00:04:13.590> theme<00:04:14.010> because<00:04:14.459> with<00:04:15.090> this
