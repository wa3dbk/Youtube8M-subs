when you're jumping here there is a gap
between<00:00:42.090> those<00:00:42.510> two<00:00:42.809> platforms<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.770> have

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
between those two platforms and you have

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.310 
between those two platforms and you have
to<00:00:44.430> try<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.670> avoid<00:00:44.879> those<00:00:45.210> red<00:00:45.539> circles<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
to try to avoid those red circles on the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.150 
to try to avoid those red circles on the
ground<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.829> best<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:48.860> because<00:00:49.860> if<00:00:50.070> you

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
ground the best you can because if you

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.200

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
run across them then spike to pop up and

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.369 
run across them then spike to pop up and
get<00:00:54.210> really<00:00:54.420> hurt
