00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.660
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.580
 this new video 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.630
 today we are on yugioh pro because i am 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.850
 testing a new saying is the sweet but the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.600
 the first game I made was 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.600
 against a dashboard 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.750
 the hand with which I started was a 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.330
 just a great deal, however, I looked for 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.450
 immediately to put pressure on him 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:40.320
 the mixture of the trans and unlocking 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.090
 immediately and athos also because being the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.080
 but sweet a fairly slow deck not 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.239
 I wanted to have too much disadvantage right away 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.300
 fortunately in the first rounds 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.540
 thanks strong recovery the machine that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:06.180
 absolutely essential in the ma 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:08.430
 sweet miss to do him some damage instead 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.250
 he obviously with the second call call 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.890
 trans that I can't get stuck anyway 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.259
 without doing some small as me 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.649
 free my monsters' land 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.850
 the torrential that soon after 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.899
 I'm wrong to use it because I would 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.899
 had to use it 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.910
 here I use here instead I should have 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.680
 use it 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.420
 now because I had forgotten that I didn't 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.300
 had still made normal vocations 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.770
 then placed me a gra ago and makes me 2007 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.660
 fortunately go direct quietly with 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.620
 images to recovery the cat then 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:48.260
 palooza morning to take Mezan ice cream 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.450
 ticket active ticket and here begins the 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.100
 apulia continues its active tiramisu 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.490
 said therefore put in ice cream and that between 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.490
 etc 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.250
 in the end attack for over 4.100 that 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.610
 he does with this first duel I 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.610
 won 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.900
 second replay instead and a duel that 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.060
 I did with troncon star that 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.640
 unfortunately I don't know so well 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.550
 the initial hand however is full of 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:24.200
 exhibitions with the paluso in addition to the athos 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.769
 but I start a little calmer game 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.569
 image nils is recover 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.280
 so I can make the ice cream 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.819
 bottom up with my wife 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.950
 here recovery the second set is excused 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:44.450
 with him he pushed a little too much perhaps a 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.569
 double cat error and fair I am 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.700
 sorry again but of course I come 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.870
 finished for this the case has strength 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.659
 reflected 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.790
 I try to make the banks look a little closer 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:03:04.480
 I'm not wrong to have set one 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:04.480
 magic nola had thrown the 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:10.849
 palud game i try to do it again as per 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:14.109
 carve out some exhibitions for me 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:18.859
 also using the perfect of 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:21.519
 tiramisu and then attack for more damage 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.519
 possible 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:30.530
 in the faceman leaves returns in the def that 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:32.329
 is being played with an initial fair game 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.060
 he making his bomb with star 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:39.040
 which I could not block therefore I am 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.040
 been watching death from above ceo 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.300
 this point evoked a site invites 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.540
 all the themes to return to the pod 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.280
 which I put as blair destroys magic 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:02.280
 also I take back in hand thanks to the 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:05.069
 castle at this point I can not do 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.260
 nothing here is so bad that it is 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.800
 happened I should have played the first 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:17.609
 pole because it is in fact peach the black hole 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:20.840
 but I can do nothing but 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:24.810
 activate it to free the land yes 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:28.290
 he was holding the monster over 1200 mi 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.200
 attacks ferno and this was all for the 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.419
 first test with the deck but sweet the dec
