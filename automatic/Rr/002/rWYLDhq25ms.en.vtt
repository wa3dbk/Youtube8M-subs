00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
oh it's kind of in the middle as far as

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.220 
oh it's kind of in the middle as far as
sizes<00:00:17.850> go<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.240> that's<00:00:18.359> typically<00:00:18.720> while<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:18.960> say

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
sizes go so that's typically while I say

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.130 
sizes go so that's typically while I say
me<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> medium<00:00:20.130> card<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:21.000> have<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> standard<00:00:21.840> card

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
me a medium card we have a standard card

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.410 
me a medium card we have a standard card
right<00:00:22.380> here<00:00:22.410> obviously<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.460> more<00:00:24.269> than

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
right here obviously this is more than

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.870 
right here obviously this is more than
twice<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.779> size<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.890> standard<00:00:25.949> card<00:00:26.670> and

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
twice the size of a standard card and

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.589 
twice the size of a standard card and
then<00:00:27.840> we<00:00:28.050> have<00:00:28.289> what<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.130> typical<00:00:29.460> jumbo<00:00:30.240> card

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
then we have what a typical jumbo card

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.350 
then we have what a typical jumbo card
is<00:00:30.869> right<00:00:31.650> here<00:00:31.859> obviously<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.610> can<00:00:32.850> see<00:00:33.059> that

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
is right here obviously you can see that

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.020 
is right here obviously you can see that
this<00:00:33.780> card<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.440> less<00:00:34.890> than<00:00:35.130> half<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.399> size<00:00:35.640> of

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
this card is less than half the size of

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.500 
this card is less than half the size of
this<00:00:36.360> one<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:38.000> that's<00:00:39.000> why<00:00:39.149> i<00:00:39.180> call<00:00:39.360> this

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
this one so that's why i call this

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.780 
this one so that's why i call this

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
if there are any heroes in there but

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.020 
if there are any heroes in there but
basically<00:01:39.990> legendary<00:01:40.740> collection<00:01:40.979> was<00:01:41.430> a

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
basically legendary collection was a

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.010 
basically legendary collection was a
reprint<00:01:42.630> set<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.079> many<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> older<00:01:44.340> sets

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
reprint set of many of the older sets

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.899 
reprint set of many of the older sets
but<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.140> did<00:01:46.290> include<00:01:46.470> one<00:01:47.009> promo<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.610> that

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
but it did include one promo and that

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.969 
but it did include one promo and that
was<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.210> Mewtwo<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.380> kind<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.590> makes<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
was this Mewtwo so it kind of makes it a

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.850 
was this Mewtwo so it kind of makes it a
little<00:01:50.100> bit<00:01:50.250> special<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:51.960> thought<00:01:52.590> very

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
little bit special and I thought very

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.280 
little bit special and I thought very
deserving<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.490> its<00:01:54.060> own<00:01:54.329> box<00:01:54.570> topper<00:01:54.990> as<00:01:55.110> well

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
deserving of its own box topper as well

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.410 
deserving of its own box topper as well
and<00:01:55.530> that's<00:01:56.040> basically<00:01:56.310> what<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:56.969> these

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
and that's basically what this is these

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.170 
and that's basically what this is these
