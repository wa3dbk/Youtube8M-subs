gabriel's<00:01:25.630> is<00:01:25.810> that<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.560> new<00:01:26.799> technology

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
gabriel's is that is the new technology

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.489 
gabriel's is that is the new technology
it's<00:01:28.119> just<00:01:28.240> black<00:01:28.569> piece<00:01:28.840> that<00:01:29.079> you<00:01:29.140> can<00:01:29.289> see

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:29.499 
it's just black piece that you can see

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:31.289 
it's just black piece that you can see
running<00:01:29.920> around<00:01:30.039> the<00:01:30.340> edge<00:01:30.789> of<00:01:30.969> the<00:01:31.030> shoe<00:01:31.179> so

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
running around the edge of the shoe so

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.989 
running around the edge of the shoe so
this<00:01:31.420> frames<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.990> foot<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.490> what<00:01:33.609> this<00:01:33.729> does

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:33.999 
this frames the foot and what this does

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:36.120 
this frames the foot and what this does
is<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.450> guides<00:01:34.689> you<00:01:34.869> on<00:01:34.899> to<00:01:35.139> your<00:01:35.289> path<00:01:35.950> of

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
is it guides you on to your path of

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.760 
is it guides you on to your path of
least<00:01:36.280> resistance<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.990> standardly<00:01:38.590> on<00:01:38.710> the

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
least resistance so standardly on the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.620 
least resistance so standardly on the
shoe<00:01:38.950> you<00:01:39.130> would<00:01:39.249> have<00:01:39.399> a<00:01:39.429> medial<00:01:40.030> post<00:01:40.299> here

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
shoe you would have a medial post here

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.899 
shoe you would have a medial post here
so<00:01:41.439> these<00:01:41.560> new<00:01:41.770> guide<00:01:42.039> rails<00:01:42.340> they<00:01:42.609> allow<00:01:42.850> you

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
so these new guide rails they allow you

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.020 
so these new guide rails they allow you
to<00:01:43.060> run<00:01:43.299> as<00:01:43.389> naturally<00:01:43.810> as<00:01:43.869> possible<00:01:44.009> without

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
to run as naturally as possible without

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.830 
to run as naturally as possible without
without<00:01:46.030> stopping<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:47.109> from<00:01:47.289> over<00:01:48.009> pronating

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
without stopping you from over pronating

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.989 
without stopping you from over pronating
so<00:01:49.840> what<00:01:49.990> they<00:01:50.109> have<00:01:50.289> is<00:01:50.829> this<00:01:51.399> carbon

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:51.999 
so what they have is this carbon

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:53.100 
so what they have is this carbon
compound

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
compound

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.010 
compound
this<00:01:53.740> does<00:01:54.010> it<00:01:54.340> frames<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.910> shoe<00:01:55.150> is<00:01:55.420> slightly

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
this does it frames the shoe is slightly

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.810 
this does it frames the shoe is slightly
immediately<00:01:56.620> biased<00:01:57.010> in<00:01:57.250> underneath<00:01:57.670> the

arch<00:01:59.100> and<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.250> works<00:02:00.490> on<00:02:00.640> what<00:02:00.880> we<00:02:00.970> call<00:02:01.150> it

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
arch and it works on what we call it

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.750 
arch and it works on what we call it
natural<00:02:01.840> habitual<00:02:02.290> joint<00:02:02.620> motion<00:02:03.040> which<00:02:03.610> is

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
natural habitual joint motion which is

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.450 
natural habitual joint motion which is
your<00:02:03.910> body's<00:02:04.330> unique<00:02:05.110> signature<00:02:05.920> of<00:02:06.100> how<00:02:06.340> it

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
your body's unique signature of how it

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.820 
your body's unique signature of how it
moves<00:02:06.700> through<00:02:06.850> its<00:02:07.030> joints<00:02:07.480> to<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.410> joints

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
moves through its joints to the joints

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.410 
moves through its joints to the joints
move<00:02:09.009> uniquely<00:02:09.580> initially<00:02:09.970> unique<00:02:10.210> to<00:02:10.390> each

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
move uniquely initially unique to each

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.110 
move uniquely initially unique to each
individual<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:12.400> it's<00:02:12.550> also<00:02:12.730> highly

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
individual and it's also highly

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.910 
individual and it's also highly
repeatable<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:13.960> every<00:02:14.140> time<00:02:14.320> you<00:02:14.470> run<00:02:14.650> your

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
repeatable so every time you run your

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.890 
repeatable so every time you run your
joints<00:02:15.250> will<00:02:15.370> feel<00:02:15.520> exactly<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:16.000> same<00:02:16.330> in

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
joints will feel exactly the same in

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.580 
joints will feel exactly the same in
motion<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.540> is<00:02:19.660> designed<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:20.020> work<00:02:20.080> and

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
motion and this is designed to work and

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.500 
motion and this is designed to work and
harmonize<00:02:21.040> with<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:22.000> provide<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:22.420> with

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
harmonize with that to provide you with

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.350 
harmonize with that to provide you with
the<00:02:22.600> most<00:02:22.750> cushioned<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:24.430> softest<00:02:24.970> one<00:02:25.090> that

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
the most cushioned and softest one that

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.860 
the most cushioned and softest one that
you'll<00:02:25.480> find<00:02:26.430> then<00:02:27.430> we<00:02:27.520> have<00:02:27.700> ideal<00:02:28.510> pressures

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
you'll find then we have ideal pressures

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.420 
you'll find then we have ideal pressures
down<00:02:29.020> so<00:02:29.140> this<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.290> unique<00:02:29.680> footprint<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
down so this is unique footprint to the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.890 
down so this is unique footprint to the
shoe<00:02:30.640> as<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:30.850> can<00:02:30.970> see<00:02:31.120> it's<00:02:31.270> narrow<00:02:31.570> in<00:02:31.810> the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
shoe as you can see it's narrow in the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.350 
shoe as you can see it's narrow in the
heel<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.680> it's<00:02:32.890> slightly<00:02:33.430> only<00:02:33.850> gets<00:02:34.030> more

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
heel and it's slightly only gets more

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.979 
heel and it's slightly only gets more
wide<00:02:34.630> as<00:02:34.870> we<00:02:34.989> move<00:02:35.350> up<00:02:35.500> into<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.830> toe<00:02:36.010> area<00:02:36.989> so

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
wide as we move up into the toe area so

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.050 
wide as we move up into the toe area so
this<00:02:38.140> works<00:02:38.380> by<00:02:38.620> giving<00:02:38.800> ideal<00:02:39.340> pressure<00:02:39.670> and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
this works by giving ideal pressure and

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.570 
this works by giving ideal pressure and
even<00:02:40.360> pressure<00:02:41.170> distribution<00:02:41.620> all<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.459> way

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
even pressure distribution all the way

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.090 
even pressure distribution all the way
through<00:02:42.910> from<00:02:43.180> heel<00:02:43.450> into<00:02:43.750> toe<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.560> minimizes

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
through from heel into toe and minimizes

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.570 
through from heel into toe and minimizes
localized<00:02:45.700> pressure<00:02:46.630> points<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:48.220> that's<00:02:48.400> the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
localized pressure points so that's the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:03:01.370 
localized pressure points so that's the
new<00:02:48.730> transcend<00:02:49.239> available<00:02:50.170> March<00:02:50.440> 14
