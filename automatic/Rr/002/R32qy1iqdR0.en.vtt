00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.800
 do not 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.680
 in this video I'm going to share 5 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.900
 hairstyles with ponytail for this 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.689
 summer or they can also be used to 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.609
 any other occasion to 10 that I want 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.400
 have my hair picked and in this 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:24.250
 video I share my 5 hairstyles 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.170
 favorites for ponytails what 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.930
 first thing we're going to do is we're going to 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.390
 make a tail high on the highest 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.949
 that you can and that's an optional step not 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.870
 you have to do it so high if you do not 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.730
 like that but this is the way that 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.920
 I like it if you use you can wear 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.750
 a little gel is my planner 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.809
 hair is a little wet with water 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.809
 and it made it easier for me to make this queue 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.210
 horse then you are going to put one and use 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.700
 one that tightens very well so that it 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.649
 hold all your hair well and do not miss 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.600
 go down to the front 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.460
 I wanted to make a French braid and I 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.050
 gave a little bit of volume that's one step 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.760
 optional if you want to do a hairstyle 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.890
 in front because what are we going to do 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.689
 they are the horsetails for this 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.880
 first hairstyle is very easy you're going to 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.659
 put a group you are going to divide your 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.850
 hair in two parts 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.219
 since you have put the liguita to your 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.950
 hair to both parties what are you going to 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:19.100
 to do is the hair above you're going to 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.459
 put down you're going to put your fingers 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.740
 and you're going to pull the hair down and 

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:27.740
 always to the hair below you will go 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.569
 adding one removes it and you are going to repeat 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.569
 all this until you get down 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.329
 and here it has come to the part of 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.759
 down you do not have to put more league is 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.380
 because the guides you put him were 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.630
 enough and that's how this is 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.399
 hairstyle that looks like a braid but 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.250
 it's a different style that looks very 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.259
 cute for the next hairstyle that is 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.750
 the hairstyle number 2 is a very hairstyle 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.969
 cute that I tell you this hairstyle tail 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.250
 horse with bubbles I like 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.409
 very much and also that it is very easy to 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.899
 do only you are going to put some 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.450
 and then you're going to get it out like that 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.810
 hair to give you a little bit of 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.910
 volume 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.340
 every time you put a new list 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.349
 what you're going to do is you're going to pull 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.120
 the hair on top and 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.830
 you're just going to pull it a little 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.830
 out to give you some 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.050
 volume these hairstyles are my favorites 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.239
 I love them especially for this 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.980
 summer because sometimes I do not want to bring 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.410
 my hair down I feel like it gives me 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.940
 a lot of heat and these hairstyles are 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.940

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.739
 and you will pull the rest of the hair towards 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.620
 in and then you will keep repeating 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.620
