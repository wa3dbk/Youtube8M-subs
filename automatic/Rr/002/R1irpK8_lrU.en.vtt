spinach that's because one technique
that<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:30.060> like<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.449> utilize<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:31.109> more<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.859> a

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
that I like to utilize is more of a

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.729 
that I like to utilize is more of a
polyculture<00:00:32.730> planting<00:00:33.360> method<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:34.170> Great

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
polyculture planting method in Great

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.889 
polyculture planting method in Great
Falls<00:00:34.950> were<00:00:35.130> very<00:00:35.399> very<00:00:35.579> dry<00:00:35.820> only<00:00:36.210> about<00:00:36.450> 13

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
Falls were very very dry only about 13

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.200 
Falls were very very dry only about 13
inches<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.230> precipitation<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:38.160> year<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.550> so

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
inches of precipitation a year and so

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.920 
inches of precipitation a year and so
retaining<00:00:39.870> moisture<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.879> critical<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.120> to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
retaining moisture is critical and to

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.930 
retaining moisture is critical and to
top<00:00:43.110> off<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.469> low<00:00:43.620> precipitation<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.520> often

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
top off the low precipitation we often

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.479 
top off the low precipitation we often
have<00:00:45.230> 90<00:00:46.230> 100<00:00:46.559> degree<00:00:46.800> temperatures<00:00:47.309> during

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
have 90 100 degree temperatures during

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.209 
have 90 100 degree temperatures during
the<00:00:47.640> summer<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.840> lot<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.170> wind<00:00:49.530> today<00:00:50.100> is

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
the summer and a lot of wind today is

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.490 
the summer and a lot of wind today is
really<00:00:50.489> rare<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.239> not<00:00:51.420> blowing<00:00:51.600> 30<00:00:52.079> 40

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
really rare that it's not blowing 30 40

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.799 
really rare that it's not blowing 30 40
50<00:00:52.800> miles<00:00:52.949> an<00:00:53.129> hour<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.090> wind<00:00:54.270> absolutely

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
50 miles an hour so the wind absolutely

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.869 
50 miles an hour so the wind absolutely
desiccates<00:00:55.289> everything<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.250> one<00:00:56.460> thing<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.820> do

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
desiccates everything so one thing I do

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.660 
desiccates everything so one thing I do
is<00:00:57.420> plant<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.260> lot<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.620> my<00:00:58.710> crops<00:00:59.039> double<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.520> on

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
is plant a lot of my crops double up on

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.510 
is plant a lot of my crops double up on
my<00:00:59.760> crops<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.500> bed<00:01:01.710> behind<00:01:02.010> me<00:01:02.280> is

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
my crops so in this bed behind me is

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.020 
my crops so in this bed behind me is
actually<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> primary<00:01:03.780> our<00:01:04.439> onions<00:01:05.400> my<00:01:05.640> copra

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
actually the primary our onions my copra

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.510 
actually the primary our onions my copra
onions<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:07.110> when<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.290> planted<00:01:07.740> these<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.010> also

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
onions but when I planted these I also

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.460 
onions but when I planted these I also
seeded<00:01:09.210> spinach<00:01:09.720> because<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.200> knew<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
seeded spinach because I knew the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.350 
seeded spinach because I knew the
spinach<00:01:10.860> would<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.220> done<00:01:11.460> early<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.909> would<00:01:12.119> be

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
spinach would be done early I would be

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.880 
spinach would be done early I would be
pulling<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.869> getting<00:01:13.470> rid<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
pulling it getting rid of it and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.920 
pulling it getting rid of it and
allowing<00:01:14.400> more<00:01:14.790> room<00:01:15.090> for<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.420> onions<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
allowing more room for the onions to

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.870 
allowing more room for the onions to
grow<00:01:16.110> well<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.159> happened<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
grow well it just so happened that the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.420 
grow well it just so happened that the
camera<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.509> grew<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.470> since<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.950> love<00:01:20.100> camera

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
camera I grew to and since I love camera

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.370 
camera I grew to and since I love camera
mile<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.790> can't<00:01:21.060> flew<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.360> out<00:01:21.479> yet<00:01:21.750> until<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> get

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
mile I can't flew it out yet until I get

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.170 
mile I can't flew it out yet until I get
a<00:01:22.409> good<00:01:22.590> harvest<00:01:22.830> off<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:24.060> I'll

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
a good harvest off of it and then I'll

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.390 
a good harvest off of it and then I'll
pull<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.450> out<00:01:24.810> too<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.409> by<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.950> time<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
pull that out too so by the time the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.550 
pull that out too so by the time the
spinach<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.090> camera<00:01:27.390> mile<00:01:27.600> are<00:01:27.780> out<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
spinach and the camera mile are out the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.380 
spinach and the camera mile are out the
onions<00:01:28.979> are<00:01:29.100> getting<00:01:29.220> bigger<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.820> taking<00:01:30.270> up

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
onions are getting bigger and taking up

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.840 
onions are getting bigger and taking up
that<00:01:30.570> space<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.650> at<00:01:31.799> least<00:01:32.070> for<00:01:32.340> now<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.790> is

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
that space but at least for now this is

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.300 
that space but at least for now this is
keeping<00:01:33.360> soil<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.840> place<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.409> keeping<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
keeping soil in place and keeping the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.910 
keeping soil in place and keeping the
soil<00:01:35.490> from<00:01:35.790> heating<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.270> too<00:01:36.479> much<00:01:36.650> but<00:01:37.650> back

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
soil from heating up too much but back

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.149 
soil from heating up too much but back
to<00:01:38.100> my<00:01:38.220> green<00:01:38.460> talk<00:01:38.869> in<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.650> said<00:01:40.920> is

garden<00:03:21.950> too<00:03:22.160> but<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.209> one<00:03:23.389> drawback<00:03:23.660> with<00:03:24.349> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
garden too but the one drawback with the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.710 
garden too but the one drawback with the
strawberry<00:03:25.010> spinach<00:03:25.310> is<00:03:25.700> it<00:03:26.060> can<00:03:26.299> be<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.510> little

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
strawberry spinach is it can be a little

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.740 
strawberry spinach is it can be a little
bit<00:03:26.900> weedy<00:03:27.609> once<00:03:28.609> you<00:03:28.940> get<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.150> plant<00:03:29.450> going

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
bit weedy once you get a plant going

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.960 
bit weedy once you get a plant going
each<00:03:30.560> one<00:03:30.829> of<00:03:30.919> these<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.340> has<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:31.459> whole<00:03:31.730> bunch

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
each one of these it has a whole bunch

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.000 
each one of these it has a whole bunch
of<00:03:32.180> little<00:03:32.389> seeds<00:03:32.599> in<00:03:32.780> it<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:33.620> tends<00:03:33.859> to

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
of little seeds in it and so it tends to

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.339 
of little seeds in it and so it tends to
spread<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.730> reseed<00:03:35.150> all<00:03:35.299> over<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.630> place<00:03:35.810> but

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
spread and reseed all over the place but

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.809 
spread and reseed all over the place but
it's<00:03:36.530> really<00:03:36.709> easy<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.220> take<00:03:37.430> out<00:03:37.579> in<00:03:37.700> the

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
it's really easy to take out in the

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.520 
it's really easy to take out in the
spring<00:03:38.180> or<00:03:38.329> whenever<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.720> decide<00:03:39.109> you've<00:03:39.349> had

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
spring or whenever you decide you've had

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.250 
spring or whenever you decide you've had
enough<00:03:39.829> you<00:03:40.370> need<00:03:40.940> to<00:03:41.120> contain<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:41.720> in<00:03:41.810> an<00:03:41.959> area

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
enough you need to contain it in an area

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.069 
enough you need to contain it in an area
just<00:03:42.709> weed<00:03:42.919> it<00:03:43.040> out<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:43.430> it's<00:03:43.579> fine<00:03:43.849> so<00:03:44.569> highly

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
just weed it out and it's fine so highly

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.839 
just weed it out and it's fine so highly

lettuces go to seed if you're growing an

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.039 
lettuces go to seed if you're growing an
open<00:03:55.609> pollinated<00:03:56.209> variety<00:03:56.630> which<00:03:56.840> is<00:03:56.870> a

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
open pollinated variety which is a

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.890 
open pollinated variety which is a
hybrid<00:03:57.519> once<00:03:58.519> that<00:03:58.819> heat<00:03:59.090> starts<00:03:59.450> coming<00:03:59.780> on

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
hybrid once that heat starts coming on

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.229 
hybrid once that heat starts coming on
and<00:04:00.230> they<00:04:00.290> tend<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.620> bolt<00:04:00.919> a<00:04:01.220> lot<00:04:01.910> of<00:04:02.030> us<00:04:02.090> look

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
and they tend to bolt a lot of us look

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:03.759 
and they tend to bolt a lot of us look
at<00:04:02.389> bolting<00:04:02.750> is<00:04:02.900> a<00:04:02.930> bad<00:04:03.139> thing<00:04:03.380> because<00:04:03.500> the

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
at bolting is a bad thing because the

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.979 
at bolting is a bad thing because the
less<00:04:03.919> gets<00:04:04.190> bitter<00:04:04.459> but<00:04:05.090> if<00:04:05.209> you<00:04:05.359> let<00:04:05.599> it<00:04:05.629> bolt

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
less gets bitter but if you let it bolt

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.930 
less gets bitter but if you let it bolt
which<00:04:06.200> means<00:04:06.440> go<00:04:06.650> to<00:04:06.709> seed<00:04:07.040> you're<00:04:07.579> gonna<00:04:07.700> have

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
which means go to seed you're gonna have

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.670 
which means go to seed you're gonna have
a<00:04:07.970> whole<00:04:08.299> lot<00:04:08.480> of<00:04:08.629> lettuce<00:04:08.810> coming<00:04:09.200> up<00:04:09.319> next

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
a whole lot of lettuce coming up next

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.770 
a whole lot of lettuce coming up next
spring<00:04:09.799> without<00:04:10.430> any<00:04:10.669> effort<00:04:11.150> from<00:04:11.329> your<00:04:11.510> part

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
delighted with a lot of early season

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.309 
delighted with a lot of early season
that<00:04:21.409> you<00:04:21.889> never<00:04:22.039> even<00:04:22.250> had<00:04:22.520> to<00:04:22.610> plan<00:04:22.930> so<00:04:23.930> hope

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:24.319 
that you never even had to plan so hope

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:26.080 
that you never even had to plan so hope
I<00:04:24.440> gave<00:04:24.590> you<00:04:24.620> a<00:04:24.770> few<00:04:24.979> good<00:04:25.310> ideas<00:04:25.520> on<00:04:26.060> different

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
I gave you a few good ideas on different

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.510 
I gave you a few good ideas on different
greens<00:04:26.780> and<00:04:27.110> how<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.680> grow<00:04:27.979> them<00:04:28.190> that's<00:04:28.430> a

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
greens and how to grow them that's a

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.589 
greens and how to grow them that's a
little<00:04:28.699> bit<00:04:28.879> different<00:04:29.240> than<00:04:29.389> conventional

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
little bit different than conventional

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.710 
little bit different than conventional
methods<00:04:30.409> but<00:04:31.129> by<00:04:31.550> incorporating<00:04:31.849> this<00:04:32.419> you

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
methods but by incorporating this you

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.689 
methods but by incorporating this you
really<00:04:32.960> have<00:04:33.080> a<00:04:33.199> really<00:04:33.409> good<00:04:33.590> selection<00:04:33.800> from

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
really have a really good selection from

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.059 
really have a really good selection from
very<00:04:35.180> very<00:04:35.419> early<00:04:35.780> into<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.050> year<00:04:36.379> that<00:04:36.949> can

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:37.069 
very very early into the year that can

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.580 
very very early into the year that can
continue<00:04:37.430> throughout<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.270> season<00:04:38.629> so<00:04:39.289> go<00:04:39.470> out

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
continue throughout the season so go out

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.490 
continue throughout the season so go out
and<00:04:39.620> enjoy<00:04:39.800> those<00:04:40.190> greens
