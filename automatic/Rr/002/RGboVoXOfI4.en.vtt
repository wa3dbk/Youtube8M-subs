we'd be able to play with a ton of
scorestreaks<00:01:32.970> all<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> perks<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.810> stuff

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
scorestreaks all the perks and stuff

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.630 
scorestreaks all the perks and stuff
like<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.200> i'm<00:01:34.799> not<00:01:35.009> sure<00:01:35.070> if<00:01:35.369> we'd<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.610> able

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
like that i'm not sure if we'd be able

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.340 
like that i'm not sure if we'd be able
to<00:01:35.790> play<00:01:35.850> with<00:01:36.060> every<00:01:36.450> single<00:01:36.659> weapon<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.290> i

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
to play with every single weapon but i

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.749 
to play with every single weapon but i
guess<00:01:37.590> we'll<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.070> wait<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.460> for

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
guess we'll have to wait and see for

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.230 
guess we'll have to wait and see for
that<00:01:39.619> we<00:01:40.619> will<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:40.860> seven<00:01:41.670> multiplayer

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
that we will have seven multiplayer

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.990 
that we will have seven multiplayer
modes<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.710> play<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.790> for<00:01:44.970> example

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
modes that we can play in so for example

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.120 
modes that we can play in so for example
team<00:01:45.600> deathmatch<00:01:46.020> free-for-all<00:01:46.890> Kill

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
team deathmatch free-for-all Kill

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.429 
team deathmatch free-for-all Kill
Confirmed<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.909> stuff<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.259> can

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
Confirmed and stuff like that so we can

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.499 
Confirmed and stuff like that so we can
expect<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.040> play<00:01:50.340> only<00:01:50.579> seven<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
expect to play only seven of the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.850 
expect to play only seven of the
multiplayer<00:01:51.930> modes<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:52.409> I'm<00:01:52.500> not<00:01:52.619> entirely

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
multiplayer modes but I'm not entirely

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.380 
multiplayer modes but I'm not entirely
sure<00:01:52.979> how<00:01:53.280> many<00:01:53.340> multiplayer<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.119> modes

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
sure how many multiplayer that modes

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.480 
sure how many multiplayer that modes
that<00:01:54.509> are<00:01:54.630> all<00:01:54.990> together<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.189> can

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that are all together but we can

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.730 
that are all together but we can
actually<00:01:56.790> play<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.509> only<00:01:57.899> three<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
actually play on only three of the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.410 
actually play on only three of the
multiplayer<00:01:59.130> maps<00:01:59.369> which<00:01:59.579> kind<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.880> does<00:02:00.060> suck

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
multiplayer maps which kind of does suck

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.810 
multiplayer maps which kind of does suck
but<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:01.439> have<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.770> bear<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.040> mind<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.759> is

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
but we have to bear in mind that this is

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.730 
but we have to bear in mind that this is
only<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.270> beta<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.780> completely<00:02:04.259> free<00:02:04.590> we

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
only the beta this is completely free we

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.139 
only the beta this is completely free we
don't<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.189> buy<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.369> game<00:02:05.610> or<00:02:05.820> anything

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
don't have to buy the game or anything

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.330 
don't have to buy the game or anything
like<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.560> course<00:02:07.590> we<00:02:07.890> are<00:02:08.039> gonna<00:02:08.250> be

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
like that and of course we are gonna be

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.770 
like that and of course we are gonna be
able<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.520> play<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> game<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> bit<00:02:09.239> earlier<00:02:09.629> than

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
able to play the game a bit earlier than

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.780 
able to play the game a bit earlier than
usual<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:10.979> can

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
usual so we can

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.580
