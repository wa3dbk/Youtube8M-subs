00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
something decent I know what I'll do

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:07.200 
something decent I know what I'll do
where<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.120> it

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:24.270 

gripping<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.140> grain

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.330 

he<00:02:24.880> lit<00:02:25.060> clicking<00:02:25.450> noise<00:02:26.069> you'll<00:02:27.069> hear<00:02:27.280> it

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
he lit clicking noise you'll hear it

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.970 
he lit clicking noise you'll hear it
better<00:02:27.490> in<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:27.970> moment<00:02:29.850> there<00:02:30.850> I<00:02:31.590> can<00:02:32.590> kind<00:02:32.860> of

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
better in a moment there I can kind of

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:50.050 
better in a moment there I can kind of
stop<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.250> by<00:02:33.550> doing<00:02:33.610> multiple<00:02:34.240> things

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:59.979 

it's<00:02:51.060> not<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.420> coil<00:02:54.140> touching<00:02:55.140> anything<00:02:55.380> I

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.510 

think<00:03:00.989> it's<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.290> combination<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:04.220> can<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.280> sit

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
think it's a combination of can you sit

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.059 
think it's a combination of can you sit
the<00:03:05.670> pencils<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.790> surround

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.910 

I<00:03:12.959> don't<00:03:13.959> want<00:03:14.079> to<00:03:14.140> crank<00:03:14.379> it<00:03:14.499> too<00:03:14.709> much

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
I don't want to crank it too much

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.039 
I don't want to crank it too much
because<00:03:15.189> the<00:03:15.579> good<00:03:15.999> and<00:03:16.299> completely<00:03:16.719> dry

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
because the good and completely dry

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.379 
because the good and completely dry
dermis<00:03:17.230> around<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.519> yesterday<00:03:18.999> when<00:03:19.180> I<00:03:19.269> was

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
dermis around and yesterday when I was

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.149 
dermis around and yesterday when I was
testing<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:20.019> to<00:03:20.290> make<00:03:20.499> sure<00:03:20.530> I<00:03:20.680> hit<00:03:20.799> up<00:03:20.859> lined

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
testing it to make sure I hit up lined

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.259 
testing it to make sure I hit up lined
up<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:22.209> shot<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:23.409> whole<00:03:23.790> assembly<00:03:24.790> out<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.180> the

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
up it shot the whole assembly out of the

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.240 
up it shot the whole assembly out of the
coil<00:03:25.569> gap<00:03:26.189> so<00:03:27.189> it<00:03:27.280> was<00:03:27.400> kind<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.939> problem<00:03:28.719> if

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
coil gap so it was kind of a problem if

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:38.670 
coil gap so it was kind of a problem if
don't<00:03:30.250> want<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:30.579> happen<00:03:30.730> again<00:03:37.530> have<00:03:38.530> you

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
don't want it to happen again have you

00:03:38.680 --> 00:04:06.449 
don't want it to happen again have you

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
how it kind of stops it and if I do the

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.469 
how it kind of stops it and if I do the
same<00:04:52.110> on<00:04:52.349> the<00:04:52.619> other<00:04:52.649> side<00:04:52.889> I<00:04:53.339> wish<00:04:53.939> my<00:04:54.119> finger

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
same on the other side I wish my finger

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:01.760

in there stops it as well yes sir the
box<00:05:02.009> would<00:05:02.129> be<00:05:02.279> down<00:05:02.490> firing<00:05:02.879> so<00:05:03.240> the<00:05:03.419> magnet

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:03.749 
box would be down firing so the magnet

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:29.209 
box would be down firing so the magnet
doesn't<00:05:03.990> drop<00:05:04.199> off<00:05:05.119> in<00:05:06.119> any<00:05:06.330> way<00:05:28.099> once<00:05:29.099> it
