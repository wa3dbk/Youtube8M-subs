00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
wrong he's working the hardest he'd ever

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.710 
wrong he's working the hardest he'd ever
worked<00:00:48.680> for<00:00:49.010> sure<00:00:49.460> I<00:00:49.700> mean<00:00:49.850> when<00:00:50.300> he<00:00:50.420> worked<00:00:50.630> in

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
worked for sure I mean when he worked in

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.930 
worked for sure I mean when he worked in
in<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:50.930> past<00:00:51.079> it<00:00:51.380> was<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:52.190> know<00:00:52.309> he<00:00:52.489> worked<00:00:52.700> it

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
in the past it was you know he worked it

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.910 
in the past it was you know he worked it
out<00:00:53.000> if<00:00:53.120> he<00:00:53.270> is<00:00:53.360> given<00:00:53.719> you<00:00:54.410> know<00:00:54.469> the<00:00:54.590> full

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
out if he is given you know the full

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.889 
out if he is given you know the full
effort<00:00:55.309> I<00:00:55.430> think<00:00:55.460> now<00:00:55.790> he's<00:00:56.210> working<00:00:56.480> harder

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
effort I think now he's working harder

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.660 
effort I think now he's working harder
than<00:00:56.930> ever<00:00:57.140> like<00:00:57.410> I<00:00:57.530> said<00:00:57.680> you<00:00:57.770> know<00:00:57.890> with<00:00:58.579> the

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
than ever like I said you know with the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.819 
than ever like I said you know with the
cycling<00:00:59.180> with<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.510> gym

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
cycling with the gym

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.799 
cycling with the gym
you<00:01:00.980> know<00:01:01.100> I've<00:01:01.640> seen<00:01:01.790> a<00:01:01.940> big<00:01:02.149> change<00:01:02.510> in<00:01:02.660> them

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
you know I've seen a big change in them

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.719 
you know I've seen a big change in them
so<00:01:03.050> hopefully<00:01:03.890> you<00:01:03.950> can<00:01:03.980> keep<00:01:04.280> that<00:01:04.489> going

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
so hopefully you can keep that going

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.060 
so hopefully you can keep that going
through<00:01:05.180> the<00:01:05.360> year<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:06.770> should<00:01:06.920> have<00:01:06.979> a

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
through the year and you should have a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.010 
through the year and you should have a
good<00:01:07.220> yet<00:01:07.490> shuttle<00:01:08.119> with<00:01:08.210> all<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:08.840> bits

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
good yet shuttle with all the bits

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.000 
good yet shuttle with all the bits
together<00:01:09.170> so<00:01:09.500> I<00:01:09.530> think<00:01:09.590> we'll<00:01:09.860> be<00:01:09.979> good

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
together so I think we'll be good

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:17.969 
together so I think we'll be good
