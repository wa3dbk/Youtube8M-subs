going to test continuity across the
switches<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.250> make<00:00:14.370> sure<00:00:14.519> they're<00:00:14.670> turning<00:00:14.940> on

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
switches to make sure they're turning on

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.210 
switches to make sure they're turning on
and<00:00:15.210> off<00:00:15.269> we're<00:00:16.139> going<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.410> use<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.770> twenty

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
and off we're going to use the twenty

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.450 
and off we're going to use the twenty
thousand<00:00:17.730> ohm<00:00:18.570> setting<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:20.010> can<00:00:20.189> use<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
thousand ohm setting you can use the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.920 
thousand ohm setting you can use the
continuity<00:00:20.730> setting<00:00:21.359> or<00:00:21.480> any<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.810> these

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
continuity setting or any of these

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.050 
continuity setting or any of these
settings<00:00:22.320> but<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.039> easiest<00:00:23.400> one<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.730> read<00:00:23.910> is

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
settings but the easiest one to read is

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.519 
settings but the easiest one to read is
twenty<00:00:24.330> thousand<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.840> up<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.199> fact<00:00:25.439> we're

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
twenty thousand and up in fact we're

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.349 
twenty thousand and up in fact we're
going<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.710> go<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.859> two<00:00:26.070> hundred<00:00:26.369> thousand<00:00:26.730> that

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
going to go to two hundred thousand that

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.120 
going to go to two hundred thousand that
way<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:27.599> get<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.750> nice<00:00:27.900> clean<00:00:28.140> zero<00:00:28.560> for<00:00:28.920> on

on<00:00:45.390> position<00:00:45.860> you'll<00:00:46.860> get<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.340> set<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.820> zeros

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
on position you'll get a set of zeros

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.279 
on position you'll get a set of zeros
across<00:00:48.420> there<00:00:51.739> this<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.879> connect<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> red

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
across there this is you connect the red

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.240 
across there this is you connect the red
lead<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.070> where<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.399> says<00:00:57.530> it<00:00:58.530> gives<00:00:58.739> volts

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
lead to where it says it gives volts

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.479 
lead to where it says it gives volts
ohms<00:01:00.109> milliamps<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.289> then<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.920> connect<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
ohms milliamps and then you connect the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.260 
ohms milliamps and then you connect the
black<00:01:02.670> one<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> common<00:01:03.660> port<00:01:04.610> this<00:01:05.610> red

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.789 
black one to the common port this red
one<00:01:06.420> would<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.689> switched<00:01:06.960> up<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.350> here<00:01:07.530> if<00:01:07.680> you

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
one would be switched up to here if you

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.530 
one would be switched up to here if you
were<00:01:07.890> doing<00:01:08.010> DC<00:01:08.490> amps<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.090> one<00:01:09.240> measures

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
were doing DC amps and this one measures

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.230 
were doing DC amps and this one measures
up<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.810> 10<00:01:10.290> amps<00:01:10.619> DC<00:01:12.200> now<00:01:13.369> these<00:01:14.369> are<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.939> this

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
up to 10 amps DC now these are this this

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.620 
up to 10 amps DC now these are this this
is<00:01:15.390> an<00:01:15.509> on-off<00:01:16.100> on<00:01:17.100> switch<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.210> off<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
is an on-off on switch it's off in the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.010 
is an on-off on switch it's off in the
middle<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.220> these<00:01:20.220> two<00:01:20.580> terminals<00:01:21.420> are<00:01:21.810> on

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
middle and these two terminals are on

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.830 
middle and these two terminals are on
when<00:01:22.650> it's<00:01:22.799> switched<00:01:23.549> away<00:01:23.909> from<00:01:24.299> these<00:01:24.630> two

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
when it's switched away from these two

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.840 
when it's switched away from these two
these<00:01:25.290> two<00:01:25.530> terminals<00:01:25.799> turn<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.400> when<00:01:26.729> you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
these two terminals turn on when you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.929 
these two terminals turn on when you
switch<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.630> other<00:01:27.750> direction

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
switch it the other direction

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.490 
switch it the other direction
these<00:01:29.939> three<00:01:30.299> are<00:01:30.450> repeated<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.259> side<00:01:31.470> of

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
these three are repeated on this side of

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.280 
these three are repeated on this side of
the<00:01:31.650> divider<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.119> actually<00:01:33.540> like<00:01:34.049> two

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
the divider so this is actually like two

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.399 
the divider so this is actually like two
switches<00:01:34.619> side-by-side<00:01:36.229> we're<00:01:37.229> going<00:01:37.350> to

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
switches side-by-side we're going to

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.319 
switches side-by-side we're going to
test<00:01:37.650> these<00:01:37.920> two<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> turn<00:01:41.610> these<00:01:41.820> two<00:01:42.119> on

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
test these two so to turn these two on

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.990 
test these two so to turn these two on
and<00:01:42.659> get<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> zero<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.560> meter<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:44.759> should

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
and get a zero on the meter we should

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.980 
and get a zero on the meter we should
have<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.299> turn<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.229> switch<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.750> away<00:01:48.750> from

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
have to turn the switch to the away from

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.850 
have to turn the switch to the away from
those<00:01:49.170> two<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.740> way<00:01:49.950> there<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.860> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
those two this way there it is on the

those two this way there it is on the
rest<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.369> would<00:01:53.460> be<00:01:53.520> off<00:01:53.899> now<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:55.110> these<00:01:55.320> two

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
rest of it would be off now on these two

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.990 
rest of it would be off now on these two
it's<00:01:55.770> going<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.979> be<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.159> opposite<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.880> have

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
it's going to be the opposite you have

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.910 
it's going to be the opposite you have

to go the other set rocket the rocker
away<00:01:59.310> from<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> two<00:01:59.880> terminals<00:02:00.240> there's<00:02:00.420> on

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
away from the two terminals there's on

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.859 
away from the two terminals there's on
there's<00:02:01.619> off<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.219> it's<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.360> same<00:02:03.600> thing<00:02:03.840> over

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
there's off and it's the same thing over

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.960 
there's off and it's the same thing over
here<00:02:04.110> on

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
here on

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.790 
here on
and<00:02:06.970> these<00:02:07.570> two<00:02:07.810> would<00:02:07.900> be<00:02:08.050> on<00:02:08.229> this<00:02:08.530> direction

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
and these two would be on this direction

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.350 
and these two would be on this direction
and<00:02:09.640> off<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:11.200> on<00:02:11.350> a<00:02:11.700> simple<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.940> position

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
and off and on a simple to position

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.100 
and off and on a simple to position
switch<00:02:13.480> it's<00:02:13.840> just<00:02:14.050> either<00:02:14.230> on<00:02:14.530> or<00:02:14.860> off<00:02:15.460> and

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
switch it's just either on or off and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.990 
switch it's just either on or off and
these<00:02:17.110> two<00:02:17.440> are<00:02:17.710> one<00:02:18.160> switch<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.700> this<00:02:18.850> is

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
these two are one switch and this is

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.370 
these two are one switch and this is
like<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.180> second<00:02:19.630> switch<00:02:19.810> over<00:02:20.050> here<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:20.350> you

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
like a second switch over here so you

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.080 
like a second switch over here so you
can<00:02:20.590> switch<00:02:20.830> two<00:02:21.100> things<00:02:21.430> or<00:02:21.700> you<00:02:21.940> could

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
can switch two things or you could

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.360 
can switch two things or you could
switch<00:02:22.300> both<00:02:22.540> wires<00:02:22.870> on<00:02:23.170> one<00:02:23.380> motor<00:02:24.190> or<00:02:24.840> item

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
switch both wires on one motor or item

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.530 
switch both wires on one motor or item
it's<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.490> little<00:02:27.730> hard<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:27.970> do<00:02:28.120> with<00:02:28.300> one<00:02:28.510> hand

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
it's a little hard to do with one hand

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.210 
it's a little hard to do with one hand
but<00:02:28.990> bears<00:02:29.920> on<00:02:30.250> theirs<00:02:31.150> off<00:02:31.560> just<00:02:32.560> omit<00:02:32.800> verify

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
but bears on theirs off just omit verify

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.680 
but bears on theirs off just omit verify
that<00:02:33.400> both<00:02:33.520> sides<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:33.970> switch<00:02:34.210> work<00:02:34.450> you

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
that both sides of the switch work you

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.410 
that both sides of the switch work you
try<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:34.960> on<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.170> other<00:02:35.200> side<00:02:35.320> there's<00:02:35.800> on

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
try it on the other side there's on

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.370 
try it on the other side there's on
there's<00:02:37.420> off<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:40.120> can<00:02:40.270> use<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.660> continuity

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
there's off you can use the continuity

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.660 
there's off you can use the continuity
setting<00:02:42.990> which<00:02:43.990> is<00:02:44.020> measuring<00:02:44.620> just<00:02:45.190> off<00:02:45.430> and

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
setting which is measuring just off and

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.970 
setting which is measuring just off and
on<00:02:45.840> sometimes<00:02:46.840> you're<00:02:47.050> still<00:02:47.320> registering<00:02:47.800> or

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
on sometimes you're still registering or

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.160 
on sometimes you're still registering or
one<00:02:48.190> in<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.490> on<00:02:48.610> position<00:02:48.750> because<00:02:49.750> there's<00:02:50.110> a

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
one in the on position because there's a

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.070 
one in the on position because there's a
little<00:02:50.470> bit<00:02:50.590> of<00:02:50.710> resistance<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:52.780> should<00:02:52.930> be

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
little bit of resistance that should be

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.810 
little bit of resistance that should be
indicating<00:02:53.590> one<00:02:53.800> ohm<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.310> sometimes<00:02:54.610> that's

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
indicating one ohm and sometimes that's

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.370 
indicating one ohm and sometimes that's
just<00:02:54.880> from<00:02:55.210> the<00:02:55.300> resistance<00:02:55.780> as<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:55.960> connection

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
just from the resistance as a connection

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.840 
just from the resistance as a connection
you're<00:02:56.650> making<00:02:56.950> when<00:02:57.070> you're<00:02:57.220> touching<00:02:57.520> those

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
you're making when you're touching those

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.760 
you're making when you're touching those
or<00:02:58.450> sometimes<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:58.990> just<00:02:59.140> takes<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.500> minute<00:02:59.740> to

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
or sometimes it just takes a minute to

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.580 
or sometimes it just takes a minute to
zero<00:02:59.920> out<00:03:00.340> so<00:03:00.910> even<00:03:01.570> if<00:03:01.690> you're<00:03:01.840> showing<00:03:02.350> one

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
zero out so even if you're showing one

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.160
