00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.650
 in order to limit power 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.170

 drift 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.629
 woman 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.240
 for one street legal 2010 third year 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.240
 round in suzuki

 today among the judges of this stage 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.180
 there is a famous racer of the d1 series 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.250
 professional series dt and phoebe on 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.900
 total competition serve 4 judging by 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.930
 see what the track is 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.960
 from the chest to the prefecture having different 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.600
 so that the boys go here in another 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.540
 direction doesn't start as usual 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.820
 stage 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:58.740
 how that car appears over the hill judge 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.580
 begin to judge the race is the initial 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.430
 points for the track 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.840
 if speed and acceleration are lower require 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.820
 required then rider points are removed 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.310
 drift because of you need to start praeni 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.900
 fire and to which you see and if here 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.100
 racer changes direction 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.810
 gets bonus points 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.640
 Points are not removed Axis racer passed 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.520
 not far apollo waste meters from the rim 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.520
 selection and so now shows us 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.620
 passing the road by turning let's 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.870
 now look at the mat again 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.810
 the example from the battery will show the perfect 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.730
 passage note in the first 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.070
 turning requires rear wheels 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.930
 were not blocked in the second turn 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.130
 wheels can be locked here is important 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.700
 stay in the middle given 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.680
 trajectories 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.480
 before this turn the tips change 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.190
 direction of movement this maneuver also 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.450
 estimated 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.160
 I must say that they come to rub 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.590
 gear skidding 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:55.799
 handcuffs and gas again gas right now he 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.660
 comments here he is jerking the handbrake further 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:05.400
 add gas full gas that's changing 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:09.330
 direction and now remain 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.390
 single runs 1 equals so on the track 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.730
 black leather jackets we racer fireplace 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.709
 starting drift is pretty easy not bad 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.800
 put and a great angle uranium shot 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.800
 . 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.330
 stone often compete in the rain and 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.740
 well mastered management skills 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.780
 cars on slippery roads 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.990
 Well, well worth a ride 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.770
 neatly and we have shinji sea on the screens 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:37.220
 Carefully enters the first turn though 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.610
 him a good drift angle is quite adult 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.000
 street legal 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.140
 also good to keep the car very give 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.660
 all the rain pours very carefully 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.489
 calm not risking of course not like that 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.739
 gives an interesting both on a dry track and then 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.290
 so much smoke there are no such angles but all 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.910
 Equally funny enough and we have to land 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.910
 the sea and this is the older brother of Shinji
