00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.560
 hi hi my dear viewers with you 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.290
 because and today I have for you 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.940
 just great news on the game armored 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.170
 warfare 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.360
 information received and foreign 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.550
 servers where a certain journalist played in 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.750
 commented on the game and expressed his 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.990
 impressions of the game 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.730
 the first fact that there will be tanks not only with 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.630
 hyper speed and maneuverability 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.340
 as well as slow and clumsy cars 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.410
 the second fact will be happy people who 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.110
 preferred to play world of tanks on 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.780
 artillery barbarian dwarf r will 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.489
 artillery is good or bad I to 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.469
 Sorry I can not say because 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.500
 most people don't like art and 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.750
 call them 1 button interesting fact 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.469
 in that they will also see the whole 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.480
 map and be able to shoot on the spot 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.670
 quoting playing for artillery for example you 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.379
 see the whole map from the satellite and you can 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.660
 apply massive damage to 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.329
 distance unnecessarily too 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.160
 move away from your starting point 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.010
 better for you because april 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.200
 moves pretty so slow in 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.570
 Generally speaking, I think there will be a lot 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.210
 shed tears can be your own and 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.830
 his sayings are not pleasing 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.650
 they will be and it is too early to say anything 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.970
 since the game has not come out yet and we do not know 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.250
 how it will be implemented 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.119
 but now we know for sure that there will be art 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.680
 and artillery lovers can rejoice 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.270
 it also became known that they will 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.770
 intelligence vehicles such as 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.040
 strayker and scales 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.320
 I quote their management is more like 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.049
 cars than tanks you will be easier 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.090
 hide from enemy eyes also they 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.640
 important for marking purpose tanks and 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.890
 artillery but if you get at least one 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.710
 hitting something until next risk 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.380
 just not live in the game will play 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.060
 important factor is a team game like 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.790
 world of tanks every class technology 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.560
 will be responsible for their duties then 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.409
 have if you have a lot of artillery and 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.049
 the firefly decided to get up to score 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.149
 and you just have to merge 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.719
 some leopard second shine 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.420
 of enemies 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.009
 good or bad decide yourself write 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.590
 in the comments what are you actually in this 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.590
 think by the way and leopard 2 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.080
 in the game he will be one of the best 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.239
 machines in the world he has pretty 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.580
 good armor and great gun 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.519
 let's see how it will be implemented in 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.560
 the game as for the controls behavior 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.599
 Tanks reading the article, I realized that 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.760
 most likely the management of the tank will be 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.829
 implemented exactly as mur up of tanks 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.290
 they are like war thunder, that is, should not 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.989
 be such hard drifts and controls 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.910
 be simplified to the maximum also 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.640
 the behavior of the tank as in the game war thunder 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.110
 most likely it will not be good or 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.060
 ill look already in the game 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.340
 and you write what you actually about it 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.680
 generally think the same in the game will be 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.599
 Soviet T-80 tanks implemented 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.370
 it's pretty powerful cars with 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.079
 great sloping armor and good 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.310
 punching gun quote developers 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.200
 experimenting with a way to return to 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.769
 game in case of death during b and e 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.049
 match 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.569
 but they were not implemented in that version 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.359
 that i played so i dropped out of combat 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.609
 action as for me it would be stupid 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:13.680
 so how do you know if he 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.260
 will go to shine in the center and it will merge 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.359
 may reappear in battle I think this 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.280
 it would be very stupid and not even interesting 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.780
 when playing with bots and what exactly 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.319
 think about it you 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.489
 whether to realize rebirth and 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.910
 finally the most important news 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.650
 quoting as the game is free real 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.989
 money will simply and quickly 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.510
 buy what you could earn 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.790
 Normal mode, that is, the game will be 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.190
 Donat present it means that you 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.680
 you can buy everything you need for real 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.829
 money as for me is utter nonsense 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.419
 maybe it will be implemented correctly 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.790
 moderately though I am very strong on this 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:53.190
 I doubt friends, that's all 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.250
 news for today is possible that there is 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.530
 and bad news and good but it only 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.310
 in theory how will be implemented in the game 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.660
 we 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.610
 with you know in private 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.440
 beta testing thanks so much 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.510
