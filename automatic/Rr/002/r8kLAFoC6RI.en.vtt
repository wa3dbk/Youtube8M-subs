00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
can't quite hit that note start with any

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.600 
can't quite hit that note start with any
note<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:20.930> sing<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.470> slide<00:02:21.920> into<00:02:22.459> the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
note that you sing and slide into the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.520 
note that you sing and slide into the
note<00:02:22.819> until<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.660> hear<00:02:24.019> that<00:02:24.230> you're<00:02:24.319> matching

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
note until you hear that you're matching

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:35.199 
note until you hear that you're matching
it<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.400> for<00:02:25.579> example<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.030> can<00:02:26.150> go<00:02:33.610> alright<00:02:34.610> if

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
it so for example you can go alright if

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.759 
it so for example you can go alright if
you're<00:02:35.390> still<00:02:35.540> having<00:02:35.660> difficulty<00:02:36.440> stick

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
you're still having difficulty stick

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.509 
you're still having difficulty stick
with<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.329> it'll<00:02:38.329> come<00:02:38.599> eventually<00:02:39.310> alright<00:02:40.310> so

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
with it it'll come eventually alright so

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.710 
with it it'll come eventually alright so
now<00:02:40.670> we're<00:02:40.790> going<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:40.940> move<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.329> second

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
now we're going to move to the second

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.670 
now we're going to move to the second
chord<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.349> four<00:02:42.620> chord<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:44.680> looks

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
chord the four chord and the looks

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.360 
chord the four chord and the looks
progression<00:02:46.190> which<00:02:46.340> in<00:02:46.639> our<00:02:46.760> case<00:02:46.819> is<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.239> d7

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
progression which in our case is a d7

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.920 
progression which in our case is a d7
now<00:02:49.370> we<00:02:49.430> want<00:02:49.639> to<00:02:49.730> sing<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.450> root<00:02:50.630> of<00:02:50.780> that

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
now we want to sing the root of that

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.000 
now we want to sing the root of that
which<00:02:51.109> is<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.319> D

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:05.050 

and<00:02:58.010> back<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.430> one<00:02:58.550> chord<00:02:58.580> and<00:03:03.970> lastly<00:03:04.970> we

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
and back to the one chord and lastly we

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.949 
and back to the one chord and lastly we
have<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.240> five<00:03:05.480> chord<00:03:05.780> which<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:05.959> e<00:03:06.200> seven

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
have the five chord which is e seven

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:17.740 
have the five chord which is e seven
pressing<00:03:08.959> that<00:03:09.140> root<00:03:16.270> so<00:03:17.270> now<00:03:17.420> that<00:03:17.480> we've

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
pressing that root so now that we've

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.260 
pressing that root so now that we've
sung<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.560> identified<00:03:19.720> all<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:21.020> roots<00:03:21.489> in<00:03:22.489> the

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
sung and identified all the roots in the

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.210 
sung and identified all the roots in the
12-bar<00:03:23.600> blues<00:03:23.780> progression<00:03:24.040> we're<00:03:25.040> going<00:03:25.160> to

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
12-bar blues progression we're going to

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.510

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
the court and by doing that you're

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.730 
the court and by doing that you're
actually<00:04:38.370> relying<00:04:39.360> on<00:04:39.630> yourself<00:04:40.140> to<00:04:40.440> provide

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
actually relying on yourself to provide

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.790 
actually relying on yourself to provide
the<00:04:40.950> root<00:04:41.750> instead<00:04:42.750> of<00:04:42.870> getting<00:04:43.320> it<00:04:43.440> from<00:04:43.470> the

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
the root instead of getting it from the

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.210 
the root instead of getting it from the
guitar<00:04:44.840> so<00:04:45.840> so<00:04:46.290> on<00:04:46.410> each<00:04:46.620> of<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.830> chords<00:04:47.160> you

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
guitar so so on each of the chords you

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.980 
guitar so so on each of the chords you
only<00:04:47.430> want<00:04:47.670> to<00:04:47.700> play<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:48.060> upper<00:04:48.360> portion<00:04:48.750> of

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
only want to play the upper portion of

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.760 
only want to play the upper portion of
the<00:04:49.560> chord<00:04:49.830> so<00:04:50.250> on<00:04:50.670> the<00:04:50.790> a7<00:04:51.270> it's<00:04:52.200> like<00:04:52.320> that<00:04:52.500> on

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
the chord so on the a7 it's like that on

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.939 
the chord so on the a7 it's like that on
the<00:04:52.890> d7<00:04:54.110> on<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.290> e7

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949
