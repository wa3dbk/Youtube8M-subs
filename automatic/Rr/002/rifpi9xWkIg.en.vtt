yo<00:00:00.120> why<00:00:00.480> don't<00:00:00.539> you<00:00:00.810> is<00:00:01.050> two<00:00:01.319> finishes<00:00:01.709> top<00:00:02.129> and

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
yo why don't you is two finishes top and

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.980 
yo why don't you is two finishes top and
I'll<00:00:02.820> also<00:00:03.030> show<00:00:03.449> you<00:00:03.480> how<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:03.810> extend<00:00:04.879> these

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:05.990 
I'll also show you how to extend these

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.960 
I'll also show you how to extend these
planes<00:00:06.990> that<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.290> will<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:08.280> because<00:00:08.790> right

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
planes that you will and because right

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.790 
planes that you will and because right
now<00:00:09.000> it's<00:00:09.360> just<00:00:09.540> it's<00:00:09.900> there's<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.500> sense<00:00:10.679> of

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
now it's just it's there's a sense of

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.860 
now it's just it's there's a sense of
spaces<00:00:11.340> there's<00:00:11.880> already<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.330> sense<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.750> a

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
spaces there's already a sense of a

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.629 
spaces there's already a sense of a
groom<00:00:13.110> we're<00:00:13.530> looking<00:00:13.860> into<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.099> room<00:00:14.400> and

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
groom we're looking into a room and

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.090 
groom we're looking into a room and
there's<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.540> corner<00:00:15.990> back<00:00:16.230> corner<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.859> back

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
there's a corner back corner this back

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.620 
there's a corner back corner this back
corner<00:00:17.130> right<00:00:17.640> here<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.910> back<00:00:18.150> wall<00:00:18.420> right

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
corner right here this back wall right

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.269 
corner right here this back wall right
here<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.930> furthest<00:00:19.410> point<00:00:19.680> away<00:00:19.949> from<00:00:19.980> us

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
here is the furthest point away from us

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.980 
here is the furthest point away from us
and<00:00:20.490> it's<00:00:20.640> standing<00:00:21.090> out<00:00:21.270> Whitley<00:00:21.600> like<00:00:21.810> this

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
and it's standing out Whitley like this

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.740 
and it's standing out Whitley like this
now<00:00:22.560> but<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:23.460> really<00:00:23.699> just<00:00:23.850> five<00:00:24.180> units<00:00:24.600> on

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
now but it's really just five units on

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.330 
now but it's really just five units on
both<00:00:25.170> side<00:00:25.410> but<00:00:25.560> what<00:00:25.680> if<00:00:25.769> we<00:00:25.800> want<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.160> extend

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
both side but what if we want to extend

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.939 
both side but what if we want to extend
it<00:00:26.609> it's<00:00:26.910> actually<00:00:27.060> quite<00:00:27.300> simple<00:00:27.390> thus<00:00:28.199> take

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
it it's actually quite simple thus take

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.820 
it it's actually quite simple thus take
care<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.220> top<00:00:29.429> first<00:00:29.640> now<00:00:30.560> really<00:00:31.560> already

care of the top first now really already
have<00:00:32.070> all<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.579> markings<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.149> will<00:00:33.390> need<00:00:33.860> to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
have all the markings that will need to

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.880 
have all the markings that will need to
complete<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.340> top<00:00:35.579> quite<00:00:36.120> easily<00:00:36.559> now<00:00:37.559> first

complete the top quite easily now first
we'll<00:00:38.070> examine<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.579> bottom<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.480> bottom<00:00:39.660> of

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
we'll examine the bottom the bottom of

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.380 
we'll examine the bottom the bottom of
the<00:00:40.200> flow<00:00:40.410> rate<00:00:40.469> here<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:41.219> how<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.640> each<00:00:41.969> of

will<00:00:52.949> go<00:00:53.100> here<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.640> these<00:00:54.300> lines<00:00:54.600> are<00:00:54.860> meeting

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
will go here and these lines are meeting

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.380 
will go here and these lines are meeting
up<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.070> one<00:00:56.250> another<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.730> create<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.030> space

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
up with one another to create a space

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.439 
up with one another to create a space
for<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.260> look<00:00:58.440> at<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:59.070> reverse<00:00:59.430> each<00:01:00.149> of

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
for if you look at it in reverse each of

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.840 
for if you look at it in reverse each of
these<00:01:00.629> tires<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.320> each<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.649> these<00:01:01.770> shapes<00:01:02.280> will

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
these tires of each of these shapes will

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.270 
these tires of each of these shapes will
have<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.149> answer<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.750> both<00:01:04.379> vanishing<00:01:04.979> points

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
have to answer to both vanishing points

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.340 
have to answer to both vanishing points
so<00:01:05.760> now<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.030> already<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.900> markings

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
so now we already have the markings

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.350 
so now we already have the markings
along<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.250> two<00:01:08.400> walls<00:01:08.640> right<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.240> we

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
along the two walls right here so we

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.060 
along the two walls right here so we
already<00:01:09.510> know<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.049> dimensions<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.890> will

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
already know that dimensions if you will

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.820 
already know that dimensions if you will
of<00:01:11.220> his<00:01:11.520> tires<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.110> now<00:01:13.290> make

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
of his tires so we just have to now make

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.730 
of his tires so we just have to now make
sure<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.310> answer<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:15.150> both<00:01:15.420> fashion<00:01:16.290> point<00:01:16.560> so

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
sure to answer to both fashion point so

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.149 
sure to answer to both fashion point so
we'll<00:01:16.920> take<00:01:17.159> from<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:19.259> left<00:01:19.500> hand<00:01:19.650> side<00:01:19.680> now

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
we'll take from the left hand side now

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.480 
we'll take from the left hand side now
as<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.790> see<00:01:20.850> these<00:01:21.509> marking<00:01:22.490> these

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
as you can see these marking these

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.710 
as you can see these marking these
markings<00:01:23.970> right<00:01:24.150> here<00:01:24.299> they're<00:01:24.420> already

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
markings right here they're already

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.570 
markings right here they're already
running<00:01:25.049> along<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.619> line<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.430> is

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
running along this line that that is

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.460 
running along this line that that is
converging<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> vanishing<00:01:27.990> point<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
converging to the vanishing point to the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.530 
converging to the vanishing point to the
right<00:01:28.590> there's<00:01:28.799> no<00:01:28.979> need<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.340> us<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.670> further

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
right there's no need for us to further

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.539 
right there's no need for us to further
conjures<00:01:31.079> em<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> vanishing<00:01:31.890> point<00:01:32.009> to

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
conjures em to the vanishing point to

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.359 
conjures em to the vanishing point to
the<00:01:32.640> right<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.119> instead<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:34.290> need<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.189> make

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the right so instead we need to make

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.920 
the right so instead we need to make
sure<00:01:35.400> they<00:01:35.729> now<00:01:35.909> answer<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> opposing

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
sure they now answer to the opposing

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.620 
sure they now answer to the opposing
vanishing<00:01:37.500> points

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.120 

and<00:02:06.290> this<00:02:06.530> last<00:02:06.740> mental<00:02:07.100> here

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.110 

ok<00:02:11.790> now<00:02:12.390> we'll<00:02:13.140> go<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.410> these<00:02:14.370> markings<00:02:14.940> that

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
ok now we'll go to these markings that

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.440 
ok now we'll go to these markings that
are<00:02:15.210> on

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
are on

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.330 
are on
the<00:02:16.930> wool<00:02:17.110> on<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.319> right<00:02:17.500> hand<00:02:17.650> side<00:02:17.739> they're

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
the wool on the right hand side they're

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.040 
the wool on the right hand side they're
already<00:02:18.700> running<00:02:19.000> along<00:02:19.450> this<00:02:19.629> line<00:02:19.870> is

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
already running along this line is

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.690 
already running along this line is
converging<00:02:20.739> to<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.980> vanishing<00:02:21.190> point<00:02:21.519> to<00:02:21.610> the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
converging to the vanishing point to the

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.000 
converging to the vanishing point to the
left<00:02:21.879> so<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.540> means<00:02:22.930> they<00:02:23.470> now<00:02:23.650> need<00:02:23.950> to

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
left so that means they now need to

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:59.320 
left so that means they now need to
answer<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.599> one<00:02:25.780> on<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.290> right<00:02:26.319> hand<00:02:26.560> side

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.000 

okay<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.590> we<00:03:00.830> have<00:03:00.860> just<00:03:01.400> finished<00:03:03.010> this

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
okay so we have just finished this

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.500 
okay so we have just finished this
shower<00:03:04.820> room<00:03:05.180> if<00:03:05.360> you

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.149 

doesn't<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.379> know<00:03:10.409> haven't<00:03:10.739> caught<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:10.890> shower

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
doesn't you know haven't caught a shower

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.649 
doesn't you know haven't caught a shower
you<00:03:11.489> can<00:03:11.640> call<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:11.970> whatever<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.299> want<00:03:12.360> but

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
you can call it whatever you want but

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.589 
you can call it whatever you want but
it's<00:03:13.290> just<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.739> sense<00:03:14.189> of<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.400> two<00:03:14.549> point<00:03:14.879> it's

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
it's just a sense of a two point it's

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.170 
it's just a sense of a two point it's
basically<00:03:16.110> taking<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.280> one<00:03:17.519> point<00:03:17.819> of<00:03:17.939> space

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
basically taking the one point of space

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.839 
basically taking the one point of space
the<00:03:18.750> one<00:03:18.900> point<00:03:19.170> grid<00:03:19.409> and<00:03:19.709> turning<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.489> on<00:03:20.640> an

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
the one point grid and turning it on an

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.270 
the one point grid and turning it on an
angle<00:03:21.230> missed<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.530> flying<00:03:22.799> right<00:03:23.040> here

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
angle missed that flying right here

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.380 
angle missed that flying right here
sending<00:03:23.579> to<00:03:23.730> clean<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.209> up<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:24.959> now<00:03:25.110> we<00:03:25.170> have<00:03:26.390> to

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
sending to clean it up so now we have to

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:36.069 
sending to clean it up so now we have to
the<00:03:27.510> floor<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:30.720> silly<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:34.290> war<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.650> left

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
the floor the silly the war to the left

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.360 
the floor the silly the war to the left
and<00:03:37.079> then<00:03:37.409> walk<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.549> right<00:03:39.290> now<00:03:40.290> as<00:03:41.040> i<00:03:41.159> said

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
and then walk to the right now as i said

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.800 
and then walk to the right now as i said
earlier<00:03:41.400> i'm<00:03:42.180> going<00:03:42.299> to<00:03:42.359> show<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.510> how<00:03:42.750> to

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
earlier i'm going to show you how to

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.199 
earlier i'm going to show you how to
extend<00:03:43.319> this<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.739> little<00:03:44.220> you<00:03:44.310> know<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.700> all<00:03:45.060> of

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
extend this a little you know and all of

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.490 
extend this a little you know and all of
the<00:03:45.390> surfaces<00:03:45.569> straight<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.049> little<00:03:46.260> bit<00:03:46.349> more

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
the surfaces straight a little bit more

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.990 
the surfaces straight a little bit more
because<00:03:46.650> right<00:03:46.920> now<00:03:46.980> is<00:03:47.159> just<00:03:47.220> it's<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:47.819> really

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
because right now is just it's a really

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.809 
because right now is just it's a really
small<00:03:48.269> space<00:03:48.659> so<00:03:49.470> if<00:03:50.069> i<00:03:50.250> wanted<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.579> extend

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
small space so if i wanted to extend

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.410 
small space so if i wanted to extend
this<00:03:51.170> more<00:03:52.170> totally<00:03:52.889> hear<00:03:53.220> what<00:03:54.000> we<00:03:54.180> need<00:03:54.329> to

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
this more totally hear what we need to

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.960 
this more totally hear what we need to
do<00:03:54.510> is<00:03:54.950> really<00:03:55.950> simpler

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
do is really simpler

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.150 
do is really simpler
remember<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.930> crossing<00:03:59.440> of<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.560> diagonals

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
remember the crossing of the diagonals

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.000 
remember the crossing of the diagonals
what<00:04:01.060> if<00:04:01.180> we<00:04:01.300> take<00:04:01.510> this<00:04:01.720> right<00:04:01.990> here<00:04:02.230> and

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
what if we take this right here and

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.370 
what if we take this right here and
we'll<00:04:03.250> cross<00:04:03.490> the<00:04:03.520> diagnosed<00:04:04.120> in<00:04:04.960> one<00:04:05.200> of<00:04:05.230> the

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
we'll cross the diagnosed in one of the

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.230 
we'll cross the diagnosed in one of the
previous<00:04:06.040> videos<00:04:06.580> I've<00:04:06.760> mentioned<00:04:07.030> that

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
previous videos I've mentioned that

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.980 
previous videos I've mentioned that
there's<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.540> quicker<00:04:07.810> way<00:04:07.960> to<00:04:09.240> to<00:04:10.240> do<00:04:10.360> this<00:04:10.510> and

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
there's a quicker way to to do this and

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.050 
there's a quicker way to to do this and
I'll<00:04:11.770> show<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.070> a<00:04:12.250> promise<00:04:12.640> you<00:04:12.730> that<00:04:12.880> show

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
I'll show you a promise you that show

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.490 
I'll show you a promise you that show
you<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.300> future<00:04:13.600> but<00:04:13.720> right<00:04:13.780> now<00:04:14.020> I<00:04:14.050> really

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
want you guys to to get used to just

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.170 
want you guys to to get used to just
method<00:04:17.769> of<00:04:17.859> crossing<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.340> diagonals<00:04:18.820> and<00:04:18.940> it

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
method of crossing the diagonals and it

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.449 
method of crossing the diagonals and it
will<00:04:19.329> allow<00:04:19.510> for<00:04:19.750> YouTube<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.590> create<00:04:21.010> replica

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
will allow for YouTube to create replica

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.870 
will allow for YouTube to create replica
in<00:04:22.120> perspective<00:04:22.690> so<00:04:23.230> now<00:04:23.460> have<00:04:24.460> cross<00:04:24.760> the

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
in perspective so now have cross the

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.010 
in perspective so now have cross the
diagonals<00:04:25.360> so<00:04:25.840> now<00:04:25.990> all<00:04:26.050> I<00:04:26.260> need<00:04:26.410> you<00:04:26.620> is<00:04:26.860> just

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
diagonals so now all I need you is just

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:37.600 
diagonals so now all I need you is just
sit<00:04:29.020> with<00:04:29.110> your<00:04:29.290> short<00:04:29.590> game<00:04:29.920> along

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.249 

at<00:04:38.000> this<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:40.610> top<00:04:40.849> and<00:04:41.030> bottom<00:04:41.180> of<00:04:41.780> this<00:04:41.960> one

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
at this the top and bottom of this one

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.719 
at this the top and bottom of this one
unit<00:04:42.620> already<00:04:43.069> noted

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.640 

is<00:04:46.180> here

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.350 

and<00:04:51.100> here

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
and here

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.719 
and here
they<00:04:53.139> woke<00:04:53.379> they<00:04:53.830> will<00:04:54.069> be<00:04:54.189> you<00:04:54.460> know<00:04:54.550> that

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
they woke they will be you know that

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.300 
they woke they will be you know that
these<00:04:54.969> two<00:04:55.000> lines<00:04:55.360> will<00:04:55.569> widen<00:04:56.169> away<00:04:56.979> from<00:04:57.159> one

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
these two lines will widen away from one

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.679 
these two lines will widen away from one
another<00:04:57.340> because<00:04:57.819> it's<00:04:58.120> moving<00:04:58.389> away<00:04:58.479> from

00:04:58.679 --> 00:04:58.689 
another because it's moving away from

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:00.869 
another because it's moving away from
the<00:04:59.199> vanishing<00:04:59.770> point<00:04:59.830> now<00:05:00.129> conversely<00:05:00.580> if

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:00.879 
the vanishing point now conversely if

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:02.490 
the vanishing point now conversely if
they're<00:05:01.030> going<00:05:01.240> this<00:05:01.479> way<00:05:01.719> they<00:05:01.840> will<00:05:01.870> taper

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
they're going this way they will taper

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.899 
they're going this way they will taper
and<00:05:02.830> get<00:05:02.949> closest<00:05:03.340> closer<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.759> one<00:05:03.879> another

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
and get closest closer to one another

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.270 
and get closest closer to one another
now<00:05:04.719> so<00:05:04.930> we<00:05:05.080> have<00:05:05.259> this<00:05:05.439> so<00:05:05.919> if<00:05:06.009> you<00:05:06.069> want<00:05:06.250> to

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
now so we have this so if you want to

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.459 
now so we have this so if you want to
let's<00:05:06.490> say<00:05:06.669> push<00:05:06.939> this<00:05:07.180> net<00:05:07.750> site<00:05:07.990> toward<00:05:08.379> this

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:08.469 
let's say push this net site toward this

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:10.469 
let's say push this net site toward this
direction<00:05:08.830> couple<00:05:09.280> more<00:05:09.460> times<00:05:09.610> we<00:05:10.240> already

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
direction couple more times we already

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.119 
direction couple more times we already
have<00:05:10.659> this<00:05:10.840> we<00:05:11.139> know<00:05:11.289> that<00:05:11.319> is<00:05:11.530> going<00:05:11.800> toward

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:12.129 
have this we know that is going toward

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:14.309 
have this we know that is going toward
this<00:05:12.340> direction<00:05:12.729> so<00:05:13.419> now<00:05:13.599> these<00:05:13.810> are<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.139> back

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319 
this direction so now these are the back

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.790 
this direction so now these are the back
corners<00:05:14.710> so<00:05:15.009> pick<00:05:15.490> one<00:05:15.520> one<00:05:16.300> of<00:05:16.419> them<00:05:16.569> and<00:05:16.800> the

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
corners so pick one one of them and the

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.409 
corners so pick one one of them and the
halfway<00:05:18.009> point<00:05:18.159> that<00:05:18.789> we<00:05:18.909> have<00:05:19.060> discovered

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
halfway point that we have discovered

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.559 
halfway point that we have discovered
earlier<00:05:19.840> so<00:05:20.439> from<00:05:20.830> using<00:05:21.699> by<00:05:22.180> using<00:05:22.360> this

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
earlier so from using by using this

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:27.450 
earlier so from using by using this
method<00:05:22.930> we<00:05:23.650> can<00:05:23.680> create<00:05:24.099> a<00:05:24.550> point<00:05:25.389> here<00:05:26.310> so<00:05:27.310> now

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
method we can create a point here so now

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.920 
method we can create a point here so now
we<00:05:27.520> know<00:05:27.759> that<00:05:27.960> if<00:05:28.960> we<00:05:28.990> were<00:05:29.409> to<00:05:29.590> extend<00:05:29.889> this

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
we know that if we were to extend this

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.309 
we know that if we were to extend this
surface<00:05:32.819> going<00:05:33.819> this<00:05:33.969> way<00:05:34.150> this<00:05:34.779> will<00:05:34.990> be<00:05:35.139> out

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
surface going this way this will be out

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:38.999 
surface going this way this will be out
one<00:05:36.039> additional<00:05:36.490> unit<00:05:36.819> if<00:05:37.270> I<00:05:37.479> want<00:05:37.719> to<00:05:37.979> put<00:05:38.979> a

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
one additional unit if I want to put a

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.159 
one additional unit if I want to put a
couple<00:05:39.250> more<00:05:39.430> times<00:05:39.639> now<00:05:40.509> since<00:05:40.750> we're<00:05:40.930> going

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
couple more times now since we're going

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.730 
couple more times now since we're going
away<00:05:41.289> from<00:05:41.740> from<00:05:42.099> the<00:05:42.219> vanishing<00:05:42.550> point<00:05:42.789> so

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
away from from the vanishing point so

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.679 
away from from the vanishing point so
precise<00:05:44.740> optical<00:05:45.219> size<00:05:45.759> of<00:05:45.969> your<00:05:46.180> of<00:05:46.539> your

precise optical size of your of your

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:48.480 
precise optical size of your of your
individual<00:05:47.110> units<00:05:47.439> will<00:05:47.650> actually<00:05:48.340> get

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
individual units will actually get

00:05:48.490 --> 00:06:06.380 
individual units will actually get
bigger<00:05:48.789> not<00:05:49.029> smaller

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390
