00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
in the PSA is the fact that the plug

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.899 
in the PSA is the fact that the plug
hole<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.359> deep<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.500> well<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.129> rocketbox

a little head off which is a major job
anyway<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.200> can't<00:01:25.439> would<00:01:25.590> think<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.280> thing

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
anyway so I can't would think the thing

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.920 
anyway so I can't would think the thing
to<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.420> might<00:01:27.540> get<00:01:27.720> away

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
to do is to do that you might get away

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.999 
to do is to do that you might get away
with<00:01:28.140> if<00:01:28.259> not<00:01:28.439> where<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.619> got<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.799> take<00:01:28.890> care

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
with if not where you got to take care

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.609 
with if not where you got to take care
of<00:01:29.070> anyway<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.520> what<00:01:29.939> have<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.119> lost<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.720> would

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
of anyway so what have you lost I would

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.620 
of anyway so what have you lost I would
imagine<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.100> worst<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.490> might<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.150> perhaps

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
imagine the worst it might do is perhaps

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.230 
imagine the worst it might do is perhaps
you<00:01:34.619> could<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:34.979> pose<00:01:35.220> damaged<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.700> piston<00:01:36.119> or

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
you could just pose damaged a piston or

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.999 
you could just pose damaged a piston or
you<00:01:36.420> could<00:01:36.600> perhaps<00:01:36.780> um<00:01:37.170> damage<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
you could perhaps um damage the the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.850 
you could perhaps um damage the the
valve<00:01:38.220> seat<00:01:38.579> or<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.790> valve<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.710> anyway<00:01:40.710> that

valve seat or the valve but anyway that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.140
