"Temple and mosque, both are here."

00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:58.173
Till we don't be
compassionate with someone...

00:00:58.452 --> 00:01:02.395
...till then neither can we separate from
pain, nor pain can separate from us.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.193
Aisha!

00:01:08.273 --> 00:01:12.765
"Your lanes... your lanes..."

00:01:12.845 --> 00:01:16.728
He's some animal,
who is beating women...

00:01:16.808 --> 00:01:19.109
...with different things
like a rod, stones.

00:01:20.923 --> 00:01:22.256
"Your lanes..."

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.221
Your crimes have returned in the
form of a stranger, to punish you.

00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:26.448
Hey Villain.

00:01:26.528 --> 00:01:27.563
Hey Villain.

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:34.468
Everything leaves with life...

00:01:34.548 --> 00:01:37.811
...every worry of mine,
all my stress all leaves.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.925
I will not let you die...

00:01:48.452 --> 00:01:50.438
...but I will kill you every day.

00:01:50.518 --> 00:01:53.084
Not once,
I will kill you a thousand times.

00:01:54.304 --> 00:01:58.850
"Your lanes... Your lanes..."

00:01:59.976 --> 00:02:04.952
"I like your lanes, your lanes."

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:10.035
""Your lanes...
Your lanes... - Shoot me.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.900
"They trouble me your lanes."

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:19.888
Kill me...

00:02:21.453 --> 00:02:21.858
Kill...

Kill me... Kill...
