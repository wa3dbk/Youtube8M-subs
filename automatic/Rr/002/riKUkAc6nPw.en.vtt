00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.660
 means state of a true presentations 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.120
 state-of-the-art presentations and our 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.309
 proposal is to make our customers 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.750
 shine in their decisive moments and 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.609
 presentations 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.880
 our universe is that of communication 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.039
 corporate and we do this for 12 years 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.710
 within that universe the word 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.949
 presentation is much larger than a 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.869
 simple tool is an opportunity 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.180
 for the presenter to have a high 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.190
 performance from a material with 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.410
 high quality and how do we 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.070
 achieves this from four steps 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.379
 based on the definition of the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.200
 creation of history with its content 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.039
 creation of visual support and testing of 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.379
 presenter 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.250
 the first step in defining the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.559
 strategy 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.530
 we help our customers to 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.260
 better define its objectives to 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.149
 from your target audience and moreover 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.370
 we take into account aspects such as 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.250

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.920
 the presentation happens and the time I have 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.439
 the next step is the creation of the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.110
 history and history needs to ensure 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.150
 not only a national connection but also 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.520

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.430
 the public on the basis of a good 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.799
 script to bring information 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.909

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.579
 In general, he understands that the history of 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.799
 the next step is the 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.820
 creation of the clear visual support 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.560

 done well the final step and the main 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.369
 which is the presenter's essay within the
