00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.290
 Hello 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.209
 today I would like to show you how to close and 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.680
 sites hide the pigtails for then 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.920
 wear the neck we have 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.660
 realized together we started with 80 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.440
 jerseys we did the first round has 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.480
 right 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.520
 especially for those who are beginners 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.800
 faces for the first time in a job 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.320
 in the round with the circular irons and the 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.420
 continental technique is simpler then 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.250
 work the reverse and then we have 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.400
 created this checkerboard job 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.340
 alternating 8 straight and 8 mesh shirt a 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.010
 backhand for seven rounds and then reversing 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.040
 8 links and reverse 8 straight sweater for 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.920
 four laps repeating this pattern for 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.489
 three times and finishing the last ones 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.079
 last turns with 8 straight stitch again 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.079
 and 8 purl links 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.399
 now I have to do the last downside 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.059
 they came to the end of my last 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:07.030
 around and I'm ready to close my place 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.969
 mark start point to turn and to close 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.600
 work all the straight and le 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:17.409
 I close by crossing over in my work 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.220
 one more I take the second is the 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.220
 horse 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.420
 we continue close our jerseys 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.799
 until we reach the last hairspray 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.320
 we are worth and pull we enlarge the shirt 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:37.080
 we take our scissors and we cut 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.070
 we make it our task 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.310
 when we're here 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:49.390
 we take our needle and thread the 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:52.270
 thread because here when we close in 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.909
 this sometimes remains circular 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.189
 opening then we are going to look for the 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.409
 first jersey here 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:05.250
 we pass the thread and go to close the 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:08.769
 our job and pull we pass here 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.980
 here we are and then we turn on the back of the 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:15.459
 I work and we go and hide ours 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:20.590
 thread in what is the mesh a 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:22.020
 backhand working and rebuilding the 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.040
 mesh movement 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.540
 the thread from bottom to top and from 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.540
 low from top to bottom 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.290
 I do this for about 2 or 3 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.720
 centimeters and then cut to my tail 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.830
 this way the neck is finished and it is 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.510
 ready to wear see you 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.360
 at the next times with new projects 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.110
 to do good training together 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.110
 Meanwhile
