were<00:04:08.310> on<00:04:08.489> time<00:04:08.669> but<00:04:08.970> on<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.299> wrong<00:04:09.769> Pokemon<00:04:10.769> so

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
were on time but on the wrong Pokemon so

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.240 
were on time but on the wrong Pokemon so
now<00:04:12.419> I'm<00:04:12.599> down<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.840> just<00:04:13.139> one<00:04:13.530> Pokemon<00:04:14.040> which

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
now I'm down to just one Pokemon which

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.199 
now I'm down to just one Pokemon which
was<00:04:14.519> rather<00:04:15.709> infuriating<00:04:17.930> because<00:04:18.930> obviously

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
was rather infuriating because obviously

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.360 
was rather infuriating because obviously
this<00:04:21.209> Giratina<00:04:21.750> has<00:04:21.959> a<00:04:21.989> power<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.800> earthquake

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
this Giratina has a power and earthquake

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.339 
this Giratina has a power and earthquake
as<00:04:23.520> well<00:04:23.669> but<00:04:24.300> thankfully<00:04:24.719> again<00:04:24.960> uses<00:04:25.200> earth

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
as well but thankfully again uses earth

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:25.879 
as well but thankfully again uses earth

the<00:04:28.439> alga<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:29.099> love<00:04:29.580> people<00:04:29.849> that<00:04:30.150> don't<00:04:30.300> really

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
the alga I love people that don't really

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:31.700 
the alga I love people that don't really
know<00:04:30.659> what<00:04:30.900> they're<00:04:30.960> doing<00:04:31.289> because<00:04:31.379> that

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
know what they're doing because that

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.830 
know what they're doing because that
that<00:04:32.129> was<00:04:32.310> so<00:04:32.610> useful<00:04:32.849> I<00:04:33.180> would<00:04:33.210> not<00:04:33.539> have<00:04:33.569> one

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
that was so useful I would not have one

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.689 
that was so useful I would not have one
ad<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.560> not<00:04:34.889> used<00:04:35.189> as<00:04:36.060> quake<00:04:36.830> but<00:04:37.830> this<00:04:38.249> turn

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
ad and not used as quake but this turn

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.129 
ad and not used as quake but this turn
was<00:04:39.090> actually<00:04:39.419> I<00:04:39.479> was<00:04:39.659> actually<00:04:39.810> a<00:04:39.960> pretty

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
was actually I was actually a pretty

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.929 
was actually I was actually a pretty
great<00:04:40.319> stead<00:04:41.060> then<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.900> alga<00:04:43.319> was<00:04:43.939> like

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:44.939 
great stead then the alga was like

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:47.179 
great stead then the alga was like
recharging<00:04:45.749> some<00:04:46.409> reason<00:04:46.650> that<00:04:46.740> Giratina

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:47.189 
recharging some reason that Giratina

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:50.570 
recharging some reason that Giratina
used<00:04:47.460> fly<00:04:48.740> an<00:04:49.740> earthquake<00:04:50.249> might<00:04:50.520> have

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
used fly an earthquake might have

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.730 
used fly an earthquake might have
actually<00:04:50.879> come<00:04:51.270> very<00:04:51.689> close<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.050> k<00:04:52.379> owing

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
actually come very close to k owing

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.550 
actually come very close to k owing
lantern<00:04:53.729> but<00:04:54.569> i<00:04:54.599> guess<00:04:54.930> they<00:04:55.139> learned<00:04:55.409> their

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
lantern but i guess they learned their

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.499 
lantern but i guess they learned their
lessons<00:04:55.979> and<00:04:56.219> not<00:04:56.400> actually<00:04:56.819> end<00:04:56.999> up<00:04:57.090> killing

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
lessons and not actually end up killing

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:59.450 
lessons and not actually end up killing
their<00:04:57.689> the<00:04:57.810> alga<00:04:58.110> themselves<00:04:58.710> but<00:04:59.279> yeah<00:04:59.430> I

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
their the alga themselves but yeah I

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.080 
their the alga themselves but yeah I
have<00:05:00.000> no<00:05:00.180> honest<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.110> god<00:05:01.949> no<00:05:02.219> clue<00:05:02.639> why<00:05:02.879> they

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
have no honest to god no clue why they

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.909 
have no honest to god no clue why they
would<00:05:03.270> use<00:05:03.449> fly<00:05:03.750> but<00:05:04.139> then<00:05:04.259> again<00:05:04.379> that's<00:05:04.529> the

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
would use fly but then again that's the

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.519 
would use fly but then again that's the
on<00:05:05.569> Lantern<00:05:06.569> they<00:05:06.779> probably<00:05:06.990> just<00:05:07.139> don't<00:05:07.409> know

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:07.529 
on Lantern they probably just don't know

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:09.580 
on Lantern they probably just don't know
it's<00:05:07.680> typing<00:05:08.099> but<00:05:08.310> it's<00:05:08.460> just<00:05:08.639> like<00:05:08.909> yeah

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
it's typing but it's just like yeah

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.170 
it's typing but it's just like yeah
beginner<00:05:10.590> players<00:05:10.919> really<00:05:11.550> don't<00:05:11.849> know<00:05:12.000> what

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
beginner players really don't know what

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.450 
beginner players really don't know what
they're<00:05:12.300> doing<00:05:12.599> at<00:05:12.750> all<00:05:12.779> I<00:05:13.710> probably<00:05:14.189> could

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
they're doing at all I probably could

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.730 
they're doing at all I probably could
have<00:05:14.490> just<00:05:14.759> not<00:05:15.029> used<00:05:15.659> protect<00:05:16.050> this<00:05:16.169> turn<00:05:16.409> it

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
have just not used protect this turn it

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.689 
have just not used protect this turn it
probably<00:05:16.979> would<00:05:17.069> have<00:05:17.099> been<00:05:17.189> quite<00:05:17.400> funny

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
probably would have been quite funny

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.300 
probably would have been quite funny
just<00:05:18.060> to<00:05:18.120> see<00:05:18.300> helpful<00:05:19.169> i<00:05:19.229> still<00:05:19.860> wouldn't<00:05:20.159> of

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
just to see helpful i still wouldn't of

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.490 
just to see helpful i still wouldn't of
cared<00:05:20.490> lantern<00:05:21.150> but<00:05:21.750> I<00:05:21.779> decide<00:05:22.110> to<00:05:22.139> protect

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
cared lantern but I decide to protect

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.129 
cared lantern but I decide to protect
anyway<00:05:22.919> I<00:05:23.389> figured<00:05:24.389> it'd<00:05:24.479> be<00:05:24.509> funnier<00:05:24.870> just

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
anyway I figured it'd be funnier just

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.540 
anyway I figured it'd be funnier just
look<00:05:25.289> like<00:05:25.529> the<00:05:25.710> you<00:05:25.860> know<00:05:25.979> fail<00:05:26.249> horrendous

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
look like the you know fail horrendous

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.390 
look like the you know fail horrendous
Lee<00:05:26.939> and<00:05:27.210> then<00:05:28.110> for<00:05:28.379> Guerra<00:05:28.770> teens<00:05:28.949> just<00:05:29.249> died

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
Lee and then for Guerra teens just died

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.929 
Lee and then for Guerra teens just died
from<00:05:29.669> the<00:05:29.789> poison<00:05:30.240> so<00:05:30.960> yeah<00:05:31.169> I'm<00:05:31.919> sure<00:05:32.430> or<00:05:32.580> so

00:05:32.929 --> 00:05:32.939

hoping<00:05:33.330> I<00:05:33.479> actually<00:05:33.900> come<00:05:34.289> across<00:05:34.680> some

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
hoping I actually come across some

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.740 
hoping I actually come across some
interesting<00:05:35.189> opponents<00:05:35.819> again<00:05:36.060> that<00:05:36.569> sure

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
interesting opponents again that sure

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.279 
interesting opponents again that sure
