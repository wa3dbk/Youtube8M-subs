00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
begin with the nets were staggered so

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.750 
begin with the nets were staggered so
you<00:00:45.840> would<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.079> one<00:00:46.440> Nate<00:00:46.680> here<00:00:46.950> one<00:00:47.520> net

you would have one Nate here one net

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.840 
you would have one Nate here one net
there<00:00:48.000> one<00:00:48.510> there<00:00:48.539> one<00:00:49.020> there<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:50.129> as<00:00:50.280> sharks

there one there one there so as sharks
are<00:00:51.030> approaching<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> beach<00:00:52.020> they<00:00:52.260> get

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
are approaching the beach they get

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.950 
are approaching the beach they get
entangled<00:00:53.090> oftentimes<00:00:54.090> one<00:00:54.390> would<00:00:54.570> see<00:00:54.750> that

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
entangled oftentimes one would see that

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.180 
entangled oftentimes one would see that
the<00:00:55.050> Sharks<00:00:55.350> actually<00:00:55.530> got<00:00:55.860> entangled

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
the Sharks actually got entangled

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.630 
the Sharks actually got entangled
leaving<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.510> beach<00:00:57.690> area<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.800> you're<00:00:59.430> not

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
leaving the beach area so you're not

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.970 
leaving the beach area so you're not
actually<00:00:59.930> protecting<00:01:00.930> bathers<00:01:01.410> you're<00:01:01.710> just

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
actually protecting bathers you're just

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.090 
actually protecting bathers you're just
creating<00:01:02.250> an<00:01:03.149> impact<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.140> ecosystem<00:01:04.949> and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
creating an impact on that ecosystem and

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.030 
creating an impact on that ecosystem and
taking<00:01:05.460> away<00:01:05.600> sharks<00:01:06.600> when<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.619> shark<00:01:07.830> nets

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
taking away sharks when the shark nets

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.670 
taking away sharks when the shark nets
were<00:01:08.189> put<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.640> Kaiser<00:01:08.850> din<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:10.080> was<00:01:10.350> during

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
were put in and Kaiser din it was during

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.230 
were put in and Kaiser din it was during
a<00:01:10.830> time<00:01:11.070> when<00:01:11.100> we<00:01:11.400> still<00:01:11.610> had<00:01:11.640> wailing<00:01:12.119> in

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
a time when we still had wailing in

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.179 
a time when we still had wailing in
South<00:01:12.420> Africa<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> prevalence<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.860> sharks

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
South Africa so the prevalence of sharks

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.010 
South Africa so the prevalence of sharks
coming<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.640> short<00:01:14.909> was<00:01:15.060> very<00:01:15.299> high<00:01:15.570> because<00:01:15.869> of

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
coming in short was very high because of

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.870 
coming in short was very high because of
actual<00:01:16.439> whale<00:01:16.590> carcasses<00:01:17.220> getting<00:01:17.520> pulled<00:01:17.759> up

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
actual whale carcasses getting pulled up

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.330 
actual whale carcasses getting pulled up
the<00:01:18.000> beaches<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.869> don't<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.409> anymore<00:01:19.650> we

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the beaches we don't do that anymore we

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.039 
the beaches we don't do that anymore we
know<00:01:20.580> about<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.180> decimation<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.780> shark

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
know about the decimation of shark

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.070 
know about the decimation of shark
numbers<00:01:22.229> internationally<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.369> time<00:01:23.610> to

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
numbers internationally it's a time to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.080 
numbers internationally it's a time to
think<00:01:25.080> differently<00:01:25.530> around<00:01:25.770> that

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
think differently around that

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.710 
think differently around that
unfortunately<00:01:27.090> one<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> things<00:01:27.659> that

recently was adopted in Kaiser den with
the<00:01:30.600> shark<00:01:30.869> culling<00:01:31.710> as<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.549> now<00:01:32.700> know<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:33.119> is

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
the shark culling as we now know it is

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.780 
the shark culling as we now know it is
is<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.590> shark<00:01:34.890> nets<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.369> drum

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
is that we have shark nets and drum

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.780 
fighting for its life on a hook which
brings<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.409> bigger<00:01:52.649> shock<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.369> suddenly<00:01:53.729> you

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
brings in a bigger shock so suddenly you

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.249 
brings in a bigger shock so suddenly you
have<00:01:54.000> tiger<00:01:54.240> sharks<00:01:54.630> for<00:01:54.780> example<00:01:55.170> that

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
have tiger sharks for example that

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.499 
have tiger sharks for example that
wouldn't<00:01:55.680> come<00:01:55.890> into<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.280> region<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.939> now

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
wouldn't come into that region and now

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.880 
wouldn't come into that region and now
they're<00:01:57.689> coming<00:01:57.899> into<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.350> region<00:01:58.500> and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
they're coming into that region and

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.429 
they're coming into that region and
getting<00:01:59.460> caught<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.180> hooks<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.659> these<00:02:01.259> are

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
getting caught on hooks and these are

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.649 
getting caught on hooks and these are
all<00:02:01.590> sharks<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:01.979> are<00:02:02.070> on<00:02:02.310> unprotected<00:02:03.210> lists

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
all sharks that are on unprotected lists

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.240 
all sharks that are on unprotected lists
so<00:02:04.049> we<00:02:04.680> really<00:02:05.360> can<00:02:06.380> step<00:02:07.380> up<00:02:07.500> our<00:02:07.680> efforts<00:02:07.740> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
so we really can step up our efforts to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.130 
so we really can step up our efforts to
protect<00:02:08.429> our<00:02:08.879> sharks<00:02:09.390> by<00:02:09.569> for<00:02:10.020> example

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
protect our sharks by for example

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.830 
protect our sharks by for example
looking<00:02:10.619> at

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
looking at

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.339 
looking at
ways<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.670> replace<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:13.209> nets<00:02:13.450> in<00:02:13.780> case<00:02:14.019> it<00:02:14.200> and

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
ways to replace the nets in case it and

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.100 
ways to replace the nets in case it and
with<00:02:14.500> something<00:02:14.709> less<00:02:15.310> harmful<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.480> know<00:02:16.930> that

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
with something less harmful I know that

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.690 
with something less harmful I know that
case<00:02:17.470> I'd<00:02:17.650> had<00:02:17.769> announced<00:02:17.980> last<00:02:18.310> year<00:02:18.489> they

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
case I'd had announced last year they

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.220 
case I'd had announced last year they
were<00:02:18.760> installed<00:02:19.269> they<00:02:19.450> were<00:02:19.540> going<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.900> try

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
were installed they were going to try

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.680 
were installed they were going to try
and<00:02:20.260> install<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.860> electronic<00:02:21.489> cable<00:02:22.480> I

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
and install that electronic cable I

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.780 
and install that electronic cable I
haven't<00:02:23.410> heard<00:02:23.500> any<00:02:23.680> updates<00:02:23.860> on<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.519> do<00:02:24.730> you

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
haven't heard any updates on that do you

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.309 
haven't heard any updates on that do you
know<00:02:25.060> what's<00:02:25.300> happened<00:02:25.629> yeah<00:02:25.900> they've

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
know what's happened yeah they've

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.710 
know what's happened yeah they've
they've<00:02:26.920> been<00:02:27.129> looking<00:02:27.459> at<00:02:27.580> alternatives<00:02:28.330> now

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
they've been looking at alternatives now

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.150 
they've been looking at alternatives now
for<00:02:28.959> a<00:02:28.989> couple<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.319> years<00:02:29.379> and<00:02:29.799> for<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.099> I

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
for a couple of years and for that I

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.030 
for a couple of years and for that I
really<00:02:30.610> really<00:02:31.299> respect<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:32.140> decision<00:02:32.410> and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
really really respect that decision and

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.430 
really really respect that decision and
I<00:02:33.099> know<00:02:33.160> that<00:02:33.430> there<00:02:33.580> are<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:34.000> lot<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.870> leaders

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
I know that there are a lot of leaders

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.380 
I know that there are a lot of leaders
within<00:02:35.650> natal<00:02:36.430> sharks<00:02:36.640> but<00:02:36.910> who<00:02:37.030> are<00:02:37.120> looking

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
within natal sharks but who are looking

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.710 
within natal sharks but who are looking
at<00:02:37.510> ways<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:38.080> change<00:02:38.799> the<00:02:39.129> system<00:02:39.459> they<00:02:39.580> have

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
at ways to change the system they have

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.350 
at ways to change the system they have
again<00:02:40.720> public<00:02:41.319> perception<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.250> huge<00:02:42.970> driver

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
again public perception is a huge driver

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.449 
again public perception is a huge driver
for<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.810> nets<00:02:44.019> to<00:02:44.230> stay<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.769> water<00:02:44.950> you

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
for the nets to stay in the water you

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.210 
for the nets to stay in the water you
know<00:02:45.610> even<00:02:46.060> though<00:02:46.590> natal<00:02:47.590> sharks<00:02:47.769> what<00:02:48.040> could

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
know even though natal sharks what could

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.380 
know even though natal sharks what could
know<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.400> it's<00:02:48.700> time<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:49.000> get<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.209> Nets

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
know that it's time to get the Nets

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.210 
know that it's time to get the Nets
after<00:02:49.630> what<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.780> public<00:02:50.140> perception<00:02:50.590> says<00:02:50.769> what

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
after what a public perception says what

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.440 
after what a public perception says what
you're<00:02:51.579> going<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.760> take<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.000> nets<00:02:52.180> are<00:02:52.299> all

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
you're going to take the nets are all

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.120 
you're going to take the nets are all
going<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.720> die<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.380> they've<00:02:53.560> been<00:02:53.709> looking<00:02:54.010> at

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
going to die so they've been looking at

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.650 
going to die so they've been looking at
these<00:02:54.250> non-invasive<00:02:54.730> ways<00:02:55.090> like<00:02:55.299> for<00:02:55.540> example

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
these non-invasive ways like for example

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.890 
these non-invasive ways like for example
the<00:02:56.230> electric<00:02:57.069> barrier<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:58.360> know<00:02:58.750> that

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
the electric barrier I know that

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.449 
the electric barrier I know that
somebody<00:02:59.379> from<00:02:59.500> sharks<00:02:59.829> board<00:03:00.010> was<00:03:00.129> done<00:03:00.280> here

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
somebody from sharks board was done here

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.190 
somebody from sharks board was done here
in<00:03:00.549> Cape<00:03:00.730> Town<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.480> last<00:03:01.690> couple<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:02.019> months

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
in Cape Town the last couple of months

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.339 
in Cape Town the last couple of months
to<00:03:02.470> test<00:03:02.709> it<00:03:03.209> unfortunately<00:03:04.209> our<00:03:04.420> sharks

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
to test it unfortunately our sharks

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.809 
to test it unfortunately our sharks
didn't<00:03:05.590> really<00:03:05.799> play<00:03:06.010> ball<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.489> they<00:03:06.579> weren't

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
didn't really play ball and they weren't

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.009 
didn't really play ball and they weren't
in<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.030> region<00:03:07.360> so<00:03:07.510> they<00:03:07.629> couldn't<00:03:07.840> actually

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
in the region so they couldn't actually

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.839 
in the region so they couldn't actually
taste<00:03:08.500> yeah<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.129> interaction<00:03:09.670> with<00:03:09.700> the

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
taste yeah the interaction with the

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.350 
taste yeah the interaction with the
sharks<00:03:10.390> so<00:03:11.230> it's<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.370> very<00:03:12.400> slow<00:03:13.150> process

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
sharks so it's a very slow process

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.569 
sharks so it's a very slow process
partly<00:03:14.349> because<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.680> public<00:03:15.100> perception

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
partly because of public perception

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:16.680 
partly because of public perception
which<00:03:15.730> is<00:03:15.880> why<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.030> think<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.450> awareness

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
which is why I think the awareness

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.449 
which is why I think the awareness
raising<00:03:16.959> is<00:03:17.260> so<00:03:17.380> important<00:03:17.859> that<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.130> public

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
raising is so important that the public

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.430 
raising is so important that the public
can<00:03:18.549> understand<00:03:19.120> that<00:03:19.239> there's<00:03:19.930> more<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.410> it

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
can understand that there's more to it

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.500 
can understand that there's more to it
than<00:03:20.680> just<00:03:20.739> bay<00:03:21.459> their<00:03:21.639> safety<00:03:22.090> there's<00:03:22.329> also

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
than just bay their safety there's also

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.440 
than just bay their safety there's also
the<00:03:22.900> importance<00:03:23.680> of<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:23.950> ecosystem<00:03:24.269> now<00:03:25.269> what

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
the importance of the ecosystem now what

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.089 
the importance of the ecosystem now what
are<00:03:25.540> your<00:03:25.690> opinions<00:03:25.780> on<00:03:26.260> shark<00:03:26.560> cage<00:03:26.769> diving

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
are your opinions on shark cage diving

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.629 
are your opinions on shark cage diving
oh<00:03:28.319> well<00:03:29.319> that's<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.739> kind<00:03:29.920> of<00:03:30.040> worms<00:03:31.319> haha

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
oh well that's a kind of worms haha

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.150 
oh well that's a kind of worms haha

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
really interesting research on the

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.510 
really interesting research on the
behavior<00:05:05.290> of<00:05:05.560> great<00:05:05.770> whites<00:05:06.010> in<00:05:06.190> false<00:05:06.400> Bay

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
behavior of great whites in false Bay

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.400 
behavior of great whites in false Bay
and<00:05:06.820> whether<00:05:07.000> or<00:05:07.090> not<00:05:07.210> baiting<00:05:08.050> actually

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
and whether or not baiting actually

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.650 
and whether or not baiting actually
affects<00:05:08.650> their<00:05:08.860> behavior<00:05:09.250> and<00:05:09.280> her

affects their behavior and her

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.820 
affects their behavior and her
conclusions<00:05:10.660> are<00:05:10.870> that<00:05:10.900> these<00:05:11.200> animals<00:05:11.680> are

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
conclusions are that these animals are

conclusions are that these animals are
so<00:05:12.100> much<00:05:12.250> more<00:05:12.400> intelligent<00:05:12.640> than<00:05:13.000> we<00:05:13.060> give

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
so much more intelligent than we give

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.310 
so much more intelligent than we give
them<00:05:13.300> credit<00:05:13.450> for<00:05:13.780> having<00:05:15.360> Chum<00:05:16.360> in<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:16.690> water

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
them credit for having Chum in the water

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.460

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
the cage the Sharks are much more

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.170 
the cage the Sharks are much more
intelligent<00:05:22.960> than<00:05:23.410> that<00:05:23.620> diver<00:05:24.280> cage<00:05:24.730> champ

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
intelligent than that diver cage champ

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
enhanced by all along our coastline when

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.370 
enhanced by all along our coastline when
the<00:05:39.790> fishing<00:05:40.030> boats<00:05:40.360> coming<00:05:40.780> to<00:05:40.990> Cork<00:05:41.200> bay

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
the fishing boats coming to Cork bay

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.470 
the fishing boats coming to Cork bay
harbor<00:05:41.800> from<00:05:42.010> a<00:05:42.100> successful<00:05:42.640> day<00:05:42.790> out<00:05:43.000> fishing

harbor from a successful day out fishing

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.050 
harbor from a successful day out fishing
them<00:05:44.260> cleaning<00:05:44.740> their<00:05:45.070> fish<00:05:45.340> you<00:05:45.730> see<00:05:45.940> you

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
them cleaning their fish you see you

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.970 
them cleaning their fish you see you
always<00:05:46.360> see<00:05:46.510> like<00:05:46.540> loads<00:05:47.080> of<00:05:47.230> birds<00:05:47.500> above<00:05:47.740> the

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:47.980 
always see like loads of birds above the

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.130 
always see like loads of birds above the
boats<00:05:48.190> as<00:05:48.370> they<00:05:48.490> come<00:05:48.700> in<00:05:48.880> they're<00:05:49.660> putting

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
boats as they come in they're putting

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.410 
boats as they come in they're putting
more<00:05:50.380> in<00:05:50.680> the<00:05:50.920> water<00:05:51.130> then<00:05:51.730> the<00:05:51.910> shark<00:05:52.150> boats

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
more in the water then the shark boats

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.570 
more in the water then the shark boats
do<00:05:52.660> form<00:05:52.900> in<00:05:53.080> months<00:05:53.470> so<00:05:53.620> I<00:05:53.800> mean<00:05:53.980> we<00:05:54.370> are

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
do form in months so I mean we are

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.580 
do form in months so I mean we are
putting<00:05:54.970> Chum<00:05:55.570> in<00:05:55.720> the<00:05:55.750> water<00:05:55.840> even<00:05:56.470> by

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
putting Chum in the water even by

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.980 
putting Chum in the water even by
fishing<00:05:56.890> that<00:05:57.610> doesn't<00:05:58.000> mean<00:05:58.180> that<00:05:58.210> affecting

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
fishing that doesn't mean that affecting

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.290 
fishing that doesn't mean that affecting
attacks<00:05:59.320> so<00:05:59.740> there's<00:06:00.340> a<00:06:00.430> lot<00:06:00.730> more<00:06:00.760> going<00:06:01.090> on

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
attacks so there's a lot more going on

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.870 
attacks so there's a lot more going on
in<00:06:01.360> the<00:06:01.510> ecosystem<00:06:01.750> than<00:06:02.650> just<00:06:02.980> the<00:06:03.430> timing<00:06:03.700> of

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
in the ecosystem than just the timing of

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.510 
in the ecosystem than just the timing of
the<00:06:04.030> water<00:06:04.210> so<00:06:04.630> I<00:06:04.660> think<00:06:05.170> again<00:06:05.980> it's<00:06:06.250> one<00:06:06.370> of

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
the water so I think again it's one of

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.680 
the water so I think again it's one of
those<00:06:06.640> things<00:06:06.700> that<00:06:07.090> i<00:06:07.390> would<00:06:07.570> encourage

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
those things that i would encourage

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.900 
those things that i would encourage
people<00:06:08.230> to<00:06:08.260> get<00:06:08.500> educated<00:06:09.280> about<00:06:09.370> on<00:06:09.640> shark

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
people to get educated about on shark
