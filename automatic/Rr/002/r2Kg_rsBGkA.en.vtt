packs but usually my bundle luck is not
that<00:01:52.649> good<00:01:53.060> if<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.180> guys<00:01:54.299> have<00:01:54.450> watched<00:01:54.659> my

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that good if you guys have watched my

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.020 
that good if you guys have watched my
previous<00:01:54.930> videos<00:01:55.470> look<00:01:55.770> at<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.009> speed<00:01:56.369> 99

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
previous videos look at that speed 99

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.600 
previous videos look at that speed 99
speed<00:01:57.420> that's<00:01:57.689> crazy<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.409> think<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.070> console<00:01:59.520> he

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
speed that's crazy I think on console he

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.749 
speed that's crazy I think on console he
has<00:01:59.729> around<00:02:00.000> 100<00:02:00.450> speed<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.369> that's<00:02:02.369> that's

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
has around 100 speed and that's that's

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.370 
has around 100 speed and that's that's
pretty<00:02:02.909> crazy<00:02:03.270> i<00:02:03.479> think<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.780> only<00:02:03.840> person

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
pretty crazy i think the only person

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.980 
pretty crazy i think the only person
with<00:02:04.469> 99<00:02:04.890> speed<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.280> Bo<00:02:05.430> Jackson<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.750> think

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
with 99 speed is Bo Jackson and I think

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.290 
with 99 speed is Bo Jackson and I think
Deion<00:02:07.229> Sanders<00:02:07.469> has<00:02:07.979> around<00:02:08.340> like<00:02:08.550> 90

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
Deion Sanders has around like 90

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.420 
Deion Sanders has around like 90
