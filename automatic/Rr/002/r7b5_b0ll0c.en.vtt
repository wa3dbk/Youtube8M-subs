only been confirmed for japanese markets
so<00:00:27.450> that's<00:00:27.960> really<00:00:28.260> important<00:00:28.770> to<00:00:28.800> remember

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
so that's really important to remember

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.910 
so that's really important to remember
it's<00:00:29.730> likely<00:00:30.270> that<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.840> februari<00:00:31.380> 5th<00:00:31.650> will

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
it's likely that the februari 5th will

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.150 
it's likely that the februari 5th will
not<00:00:32.190> be<00:00:32.629> exact<00:00:33.629> release<00:00:34.020> date<00:00:34.080> for<00:00:34.290> Western

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
not be exact release date for Western

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.119 
not be exact release date for Western
mark<00:00:35.370> markets<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.330> is<00:00:36.600> anyone<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.710> Europe

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
mark markets that is anyone in Europe

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.000 
mark markets that is anyone in Europe
and<00:00:38.309> America<00:00:38.970> especially<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.739> i<00:00:40.770> would

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
and America especially so i would

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.500 
and America especially so i would
actually<00:00:41.160> think<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.790> release<00:00:42.149> date<00:00:42.360> would

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
actually think the release date would

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.069 
actually think the release date would
fall<00:00:42.780> around<00:00:43.110> februari<00:00:43.710> third<00:00:44.130> or<00:00:45.079> februari

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
fall around februari third or februari

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.950 
fall around februari third or februari
10th<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:47.040> us<00:00:47.520> markets<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.300> would<00:00:48.780> definitely

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
10th for us markets I would definitely

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.049 
10th for us markets I would definitely
think<00:00:49.350> third<00:00:49.620> would<00:00:50.040> be<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.430> date<00:00:50.640> for

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
think third would be the date for

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.670 
think third would be the date for
blood-borne<00:00:51.540> but<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:51.809> will<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.200> finding<00:00:52.440> out

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
blood-borne but we will be finding out

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.190 
blood-borne but we will be finding out
soon<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.370> i<00:00:53.399> would<00:00:53.640> expect<00:00:54.200> blood-borne

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
soon that but i would expect blood-borne

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.110 
soon that but i would expect blood-borne
in<00:00:55.469> February<00:00:56.370> unless<00:00:56.700> they're<00:00:56.940> doing

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
in February unless they're doing

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.420 
in February unless they're doing
something<00:00:57.450> really<00:00:57.719> weird<00:00:58.050> by<00:00:58.770> releasing<00:00:59.160> it

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
something really weird by releasing it

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.580 
something really weird by releasing it
first<00:00:59.790> to<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.329> Japanese<00:01:01.020> market<00:01:01.260> what's

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000
