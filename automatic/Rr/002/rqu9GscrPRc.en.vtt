opposing<00:00:57.870> teams<00:00:58.320> are<00:00:58.469> going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.739> that

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
opposing teams are going to be that

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.470 
opposing teams are going to be that
fortunate<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.550> year<00:00:59.609> well<00:01:00.239> they're<00:01:00.359> going

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
fortunate this year well they're going

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.670 
fortunate this year well they're going
to<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.629> mentally<00:01:00.840> tough<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.469> that

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
to be mentally tough you know that

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.930 
to be mentally tough you know that
that's<00:01:01.920> why<00:01:02.039> they<00:01:02.160> don't<00:01:02.309> give<00:01:02.430> away<00:01:02.550> too<00:01:02.730> many

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
that's why they don't give away too many

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.000 
that's why they don't give away too many
games<00:01:03.300> but<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.570> think<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.140> be<00:01:04.290> hard

as<00:01:18.720> good<00:01:18.900> as<00:01:18.960> we've<00:01:19.170> seen<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.409> some<00:01:19.680> time<00:01:19.710> with

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009

here<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.280> season<00:01:32.670> Ron<00:01:32.820> Johnson<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.479> second

here this season Ron Johnson in a second

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.230 
here this season Ron Johnson in a second
year<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.200> think<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.159> see<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.850> biggest

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
year I think that you see the biggest

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.240 
year I think that you see the biggest
improvement<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.049> new<00:01:37.229> regime<00:01:37.710> from<00:01:37.950> year

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
improvement in a new regime from year

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.370 
improvement in a new regime from year
one<00:01:38.460> year<00:01:38.490> too<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.180> that's<00:01:39.720> what<00:01:39.930> McKinley<00:01:40.320> is

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
one year too and that's what McKinley is

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.480 
one year too and that's what McKinley is
going<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> be<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> benefit<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
going to be the benefit the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.980 
going to be the benefit the
beneficiaries<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.479> year<00:01:42.689> well<00:01:42.840> they'll

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
beneficiaries of this year well they'll

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.090 
beneficiaries of this year well they'll
know<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.259> offense<00:01:43.619> better<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.040> that's

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
know the offense better and that's

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.230 
know the offense better and that's
something<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.460> Johnson's<00:01:44.880> really<00:01:45.119> been

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
something that Johnson's really been

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.179 
something that Johnson's really been
stressing<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.780> they've<00:01:46.710> really<00:01:47.009> worked

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
stressing that they've really worked

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.889 
stressing that they've really worked
hard<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> offseason<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.180> get<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.630> step

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
hard in the offseason to get that step

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.569 
hard in the offseason to get that step
forward<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.740> said<00:01:49.799> their<00:01:50.070> defense<00:01:50.460> is

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
forward and like I said their defense is

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.550 
forward and like I said their defense is
going<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.759> be<00:01:50.880> outstanding<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:52.110> know<00:01:52.290> that

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
going to be outstanding so you know that

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.109 
going to be outstanding so you know that
they<00:01:52.680> are<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.040> be<00:01:53.220> stronger<00:01:53.759> than<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
they are going to be stronger than the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.700 
they are going to be stronger than the
six<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.479> four<00:01:54.689> team<00:01:54.930> they<00:01:55.079> were<00:01:55.229> last<00:01:55.470> year<00:01:55.649> in

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
six and four team they were last year in

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.230 
six and four team they were last year in
the<00:01:55.740> regular<00:01:55.860> season<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.460> then<00:01:56.850> Glenna<00:01:57.090> have

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the regular season and then Glenna have

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.580 
the regular season and then Glenna have
lost<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.600> lot<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.750> people<00:01:58.140> but<00:01:58.229> they<00:01:58.350> seem<00:01:58.380> to

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
lost a lot of people but they seem to

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.679 
lost a lot of people but they seem to
have<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.770> lot<00:01:58.799> back<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.640> team<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.479> think

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
have a lot back to a team that I think

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.179 
have a lot back to a team that I think
it's<00:02:00.810> kind<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.049> going<00:02:01.200> under<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.680> radar<00:02:01.860> this

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
it's kind of going under the radar this

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.920 
it's kind of going under the radar this
year<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.490> Stark<00:02:02.729> County<00:02:02.759> just<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.509> little<00:02:03.750> bit

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
in his second year the same goes for

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.740 
in his second year the same goes for
massillon<00:02:08.729> from<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.030> year<00:02:09.179> one<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.450> year<00:02:09.569> two

going to be interesting to see what

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.680 
going to be interesting to see what
South<00:03:09.459> has<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.879> think<00:03:09.909> they<00:03:10.150> have<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.269> lot<00:03:10.450> back

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
South has I think they have a lot back

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.899 
South has I think they have a lot back
but<00:03:10.930> they<00:03:11.019> lost<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.500> huge<00:03:12.099> leader<00:03:12.430> on<00:03:12.579> each<00:03:12.700> side

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
but they lost a huge leader on each side

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.520 
but they lost a huge leader on each side
of<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.060> ball<00:03:13.209> with<00:03:13.359> crystal<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:13.870> McKinney

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
of the ball with crystal and McKinney

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.020 
of the ball with crystal and McKinney
graduating<00:03:15.129> those<00:03:15.250> are<00:03:15.400> two<00:03:15.549> great<00:03:15.760> high

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
graduating those are two great high

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.729 
graduating those are two great high
school<00:03:16.090> football<00:03:16.450> players<00:03:16.870> but<00:03:17.139> I<00:03:17.290> think

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
school football players but I think

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.229 
school football players but I think
South<00:03:17.950> as<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.459> team<00:03:18.730> that's<00:03:18.910> going<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.090> make<00:03:19.180> a

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
South as a team that's going to make a

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.879 
South as a team that's going to make a
run<00:03:19.450> for<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.660> playoffs<00:03:19.900> so<00:03:20.290> that<00:03:20.470> should<00:03:20.799> be<00:03:20.829> a

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
run for the playoffs so that should be a

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.650 
run for the playoffs so that should be a
great<00:03:21.069> game<00:03:21.190> on<00:03:21.459> Thursday<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.120> then<00:03:22.180> there's
