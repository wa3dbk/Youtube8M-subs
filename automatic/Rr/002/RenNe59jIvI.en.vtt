00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.900
 What is now here with receptors this one is who stays in the chamber has the 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.319
 base here to eat 

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:13.069
 and to the exit p2 we take that hair p2 xlr against camera 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.779
 and to open it is the same thing and are very similar 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.589
 read in the same place in the north 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.869
 As you can see, it's not stealing anything here because the 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.359
 itaqui frequency 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.119
 It's different from the frequency who put you 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.989
 microphone died from another station that 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.350
 bethlem the celtic has changed no way 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.120
 because I'm there to let go 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.140
 in the frequency that the journals almost seventy-five 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.140
 eunice torta and others recognizes that the 36 and such 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.070
 go regular and if we tighten 7 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.510
 hand blades 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.620
 back there cautious number 1 that was hot harvested earlier 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.770
 Are you going to take me out? 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.240
 chose knowledge chose which ideas 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.480
 150 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.700
 if it is correct near 7 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.810
 around the tunnel team 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.070
 which is the but when the frequency 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.710
 press 7 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.890
 and looks for the frequency that the 23 475 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.330
 one what tight set he spiked 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.240
 always exiting that tighten to pass is smaller 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.620
 will it be that we changed the diet modulating shehata we received finalissima 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.050
 What's up and full? 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.270
 Is it getting signal? 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.760
 complete and low volume 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.720
 let's go back with the younger 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.420
 the menu still has currently been 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.080
 this I rest the barter the function that only has a kidney sector 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.729
 this function is jammed as you are in the place that a lot of people are using 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.140
 wireless microphones 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.140
 in the event thing that press all the 1 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.320
 one thing I have several people in the microphone 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.580
 this function becomes very useful 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.580
 because they ram this way in search 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.410
 the available on-site channels 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.760
 if they have 10 microphones equal to that it will pick up channels that do not 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.390
 are currently being used 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.390
 this you boot 7 he will ask this art 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.689
 clinton then you I be here with you pape start start 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.439
 to search for the available frequencies 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.290
 if you have searched the frequency and are not satisfied with this you will 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.569
 Kenya after 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.979
 and cacela like we will not use what goes 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:19.479
 the students 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:21.729
 to escape the menu here 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:23.719
 I'm going back to another function here. 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:24.889
 scale 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:28.129
 af altec and that I think is what is worse than the 'volume 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.429
 This is going to send you to the camera, you press 7 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:34.599
 You see here that he misses 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.329
 30 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:37.549
 the land 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.129
 more 12 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.799
 so the evaluation is high if you can play there is regular right with the 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:43.689
 Your camera 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:45.849
 how to properly regulate 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.999
 connect your camera 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.999
 begins modulation that your candidate giving audio 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.139
 I put it in my style if it regulates anything put the input name 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:59.729
 in his perfect campaign in manuel fernandes the automatic work 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:03.999
 we put input to eat a little less than half or half 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:07.619
 The entry variation ranges from 0 to 10 when 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.849
 more or less 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.279
 And then you start regular here. 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:15.429
 sure as experiment here first zero 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:16.719
 da ct 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:19.839
 and see how he's beating his shirt by beating a new name 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:21.689
 adequate and safe 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.969
 remember not if you scream you can not name torralvo 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:27.579
 your pen or TÃ¡ modulating there 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.640
 I was in a safe van, you're fine. 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.929
 if it's too low 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:34.709
 You increase a little more I've been a lot that you decrease 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.349
 Sincerely 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.419
 any attack we connected with the microphone 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.229
 in this chamber 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.630
 we are revealing to the patient put there 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.899
 in the manual 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:48.139
 put one of them in 30% 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.049
 and placed f routine in less than 20 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.299
 4 see confirm what 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.299
 I got to see here 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:00.829
 o is at minus 24 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.209
 Rita calls as you go up and that 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.209
 you see that the manager in the old T-shirt she is studying already 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.589
 this is not applauded here 

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:12.280
 room where it's worth 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.019
 It's crap for sure. 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.749
 finished the recording part is going down here 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:19.729
 It's worth pointing out again in the 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.469
 only in the worst sector 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.129
 boto line - 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:25.610
 24 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.580
 There is food knocking and less 20 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.440
 and 10 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.029
 10 

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:33.559
 this is the volume of alcohol and note tobacco 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:36.559
 in tremembe between the 20 and 10 a day 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.199
 is ideal because if you need a little more you see here 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.629
 on the camera 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.189
 a little more volume 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:45.979
 go pro next 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.740
 this here is the ex which muddy 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.219
 you eat process correctly 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:53.110
 What are the mattresses 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.510
 When you read it, it has or 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.550
 media 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.349
 err is high 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:04:59.490
 medium 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.169
 is low 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.139
 I always worked on bass 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.189
 usually work on bass when you're in a place 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.110
 There are many microphones on your side, too. 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.370
 It's good for you to grow up there. 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.120
 Why does this mean? 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.620
 that decreases 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.659
 the frequencies the president means only the frequency accuracy 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:21.089
 what is he going to look for 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:25.460
 remembers that who is in that frequency that the 523 almost 75 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.300
 If we boot crazy 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.580
 he will be but everything will be more 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.789
 malleable 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.860
 that is, if the frequency changes a bit higher because 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.659
 low 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:37.969
 he will continue to receive this frequency and send it to his camera 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.979
 if you vote in the middle 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.400
 net avaÃ­ 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.569
 decreases a little 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:46.989
 or the cell number variation on who you put there 

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:50.439
 This will know how often you do not go. 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:54.139
 I received no variation so if the guy gets too far away he starts to change one 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:55.180
 little said 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.909
 frequency is foot 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.419
 if I'm going to have a wedding interview me, a place that does not have a lot of people 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:01.520
 microphone 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.319
 Boot board has always lived 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:08.710
 they wanted to see only cover everything I climbed same thing tightens 7 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.930
 if you can put the frequency monitor the channel that you had the name I always 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.569
 I left frequency 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:16.930
 because it's easier for you to look both 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.629
 the two together 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:21.770
 and sixth on the same frequency 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.270
 and a name if you want to put a man 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.749
 the industry also 

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:29.749
 recently that it is a tightening 7 that in certain 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:33.990
 the factory settings 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.219
 I already told you 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:39.429
 superliga or tell him to turn it off 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:42.379
 the pilot that you 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:45.639
 He fought and he does not do anything to stop him. 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:47.580
 have said this to you miss 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.580
 release the menu again 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:55.529
 and here to sue and from the minor I hope you have understood everything 

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:59.229
 me mei thing is always available here fernanda romba focus films point 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:00.419
 with br br 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:03.569
 I'm going to post a link on March 1st. 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:05.949
 and that's until the next a hug
