that the AI is actually improved over
the<00:00:30.840> previous<00:00:31.170> games<00:00:31.590> because<00:00:31.769> they<00:00:31.890> are

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the previous games because they are

them like the living out of them so
I'm<00:01:06.590> yeah<00:01:07.590> like<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.790> Dean<00:01:09.180> feature<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.479> you

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
I'm yeah like the Dean feature that you

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.270 
I'm yeah like the Dean feature that you
see<00:01:09.630> at<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.049> front<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.010> probably<00:01:11.220> not

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
see at the front and the probably not

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.530 
see at the front and the probably not
gonna<00:01:11.430> hold<00:01:11.670> off<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.909> too<00:01:12.000> much<00:01:12.119> longer<00:01:12.330> a

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
gonna hold off it too much longer a

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
gonna hold off it too much longer a
longer<00:01:13.260> because<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.740> American<00:01:14.369> infantry<00:01:14.820> is

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
longer because the American infantry is

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.929 
longer because the American infantry is
that's<00:01:16.560> straight<00:01:17.100> down<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.490> middle<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.880> I

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
that's straight down the middle and I

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.310 
that's straight down the middle and I
really<00:01:18.150> don't<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.420> any<00:01:18.659> support<00:01:19.049> there<00:01:19.170> yet

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
really don't have any support there yet

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.440 
really don't have any support there yet
so<00:01:19.560> I'm<00:01:20.130> gonna<00:01:20.220> try<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.460> hold<00:01:20.640> them<00:01:20.790> off<00:01:21.000> right

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
so I'm gonna try to hold them off right

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.990 
so I'm gonna try to hold them off right
there<00:01:21.689> for<00:01:21.869> as<00:01:21.960> long<00:01:22.020> as<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.259> can<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.680> bring<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.939> my

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.350 

see<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.220> infantry<00:01:58.610> I<00:01:58.640> have<00:01:58.850> in<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.090> middle

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
see the infantry I have in the middle

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.940 
see the infantry I have in the middle
isn't<00:01:59.540> gonna<00:01:59.900> hold<00:02:00.110> out<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:00.320> much<00:02:00.619> longer

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
isn't gonna hold out that much longer

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.830 
isn't gonna hold out that much longer
and<00:02:03.190> it's<00:02:04.190> trout<00:02:04.460> that<00:02:04.640> my<00:02:04.850> novel<00:02:04.970> reader<00:02:05.330> so

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
and it's trout that my novel reader so

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.390

adorbs

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.250 

so<00:02:14.000> it's<00:02:14.120> not<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.239> real<00:02:14.450> hammer<00:02:14.690> devil<00:02:15.140> because

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
so it's not a real hammer devil because

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.190 
so it's not a real hammer devil because
they<00:02:15.560> are<00:02:15.680> spread<00:02:15.980> out<00:02:16.069> but<00:02:16.810> I'm<00:02:17.810> still

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
they are spread out but I'm still

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.289 
they are spread out but I'm still
flaking<00:02:18.590> them<00:02:18.890> taking<00:02:19.430> out<00:02:19.610> their<00:02:19.849> army<00:02:20.060> from

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
flaking them taking out their army from

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:38.530 
flaking them taking out their army from
your<00:02:20.450> ear

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.330 

the<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.110> seems<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.620> be<00:02:39.739> working<00:02:40.069> because<00:02:40.159> their

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
the a seems to be working because their

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.100 
the a seems to be working because their
firepower<00:02:40.790> has<00:02:41.090> been<00:02:41.239> diminished<00:02:41.840> like

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
firepower has been diminished like

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.149 
firepower has been diminished like
two-thirds<00:02:42.950> three-quarters<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.819> Army's

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
two-thirds three-quarters of the Army's

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.580 
two-thirds three-quarters of the Army's
routed<00:02:46.159> so<00:02:46.450> they<00:02:47.450> saw<00:02:47.629> two<00:02:47.870> squads<00:02:48.230> who<00:02:48.470> are

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
routed so they saw two squads who are

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.100 
routed so they saw two squads who are
charging<00:02:49.189> my<00:02:49.370> lines<00:02:49.730> at<00:02:50.060> once<00:02:50.090> questo<00:02:50.750> firing

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
charging my lines at once questo firing

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.110 
charging my lines at once questo firing
but<00:02:51.560> by<00:02:51.860> heavy<00:02:52.099> infantry<00:02:52.340> is<00:02:52.519> not<00:02:52.670> in<00:02:52.760> play<00:02:52.939> so

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
but by heavy infantry is not in play so

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.160 
but by heavy infantry is not in play so
they<00:02:53.299> should<00:02:53.450> take<00:02:53.599> care<00:02:53.750> of<00:02:53.810> them<00:02:53.989> pretty

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
they should take care of them pretty

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:06.890 
they should take care of them pretty
easily

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.860 

and<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:08.349> is<00:03:08.590> by<00:03:08.890> general<00:03:09.459> but<00:03:10.299> really

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
and that is by general but really

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.630 
and that is by general but really
doesn't<00:03:11.230> matter<00:03:11.290> at<00:03:11.500> this<00:03:11.530> point

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.800 

I<00:03:17.110> just<00:03:18.110> secured<00:03:18.440> their<00:03:18.620> general<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:20.000> yeah
