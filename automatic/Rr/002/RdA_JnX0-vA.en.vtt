stronger<00:01:27.180> over<00:01:27.570> time<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.170> then<00:01:28.259> he<00:01:28.470> will

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
stronger over time and then he will

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.200 
stronger over time and then he will
remember<00:01:29.009> everything<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.700> did<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.060> him

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
remember everything that you did to him

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.359 
remember everything that you did to him
and<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:30.930> if<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.140> kill<00:01:31.350> him<00:01:31.470> he's<00:01:31.829> not<00:01:32.130> really

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
and then if you kill him he's not really

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.010 
and then if you kill him he's not really
irrelevant<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:33.150> maybe<00:01:33.570> somebody<00:01:33.960> else

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
irrelevant but maybe somebody else

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.960

believe his powers are starting to

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.980 
believe his powers are starting to
influence<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.310> around

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
influence that around

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
for the xbox and ps2 era where it was

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.200 
for the xbox and ps2 era where it was
like<00:03:34.310> an<00:03:34.460> action<00:03:34.820> RPG<00:03:34.910> you<00:03:35.390> got<00:03:35.570> X<00:03:35.950> square

triangle as your basic attire your
attacks<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.310> then<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:41.060> got<00:03:41.240> like<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.840> don't

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
attacks and then you got like I don't

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.590 
attacks and then you got like I don't
know<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.280> ability<00:03:43.640> to<00:03:43.760> run<00:03:43.910> around<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.510> pick

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
know the ability to run around and pick

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.060 
know the ability to run around and pick
up<00:03:44.720> health<00:03:44.900> items<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:45.440> stuff<00:03:45.500> like<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:45.740> if

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
up health items and stuff like that if

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.100 
up health items and stuff like that if
they<00:03:46.400> keep<00:03:46.580> that<00:03:46.790> kept<00:03:47.210> it<00:03:47.360> more<00:03:47.540> as<00:03:47.660> an<00:03:47.780> action

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
they keep that kept it more as an action

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.260 
they keep that kept it more as an action
RPG<00:03:48.230> like<00:03:48.710> a<00:03:48.740> third-person<00:03:49.130> action<00:03:49.670> RPG<00:03:50.060> like

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
RPG like a third-person action RPG like

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.820 
RPG like a third-person action RPG like
with<00:03:50.480> those<00:03:50.600> elements<00:03:50.930> i<00:03:51.200> think<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.650> game

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
with those elements i think the game

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.950 
with those elements i think the game
would<00:03:51.980> do<00:03:52.190> really<00:03:52.670> really<00:03:52.820> well<00:03:52.940> just<00:03:53.690> because

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
would do really really well just because

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.780 
would do really really well just because
that's<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.500> kind<00:03:54.530> of<00:03:54.890> game<00:03:55.220> Lord<00:03:55.640> of<00:03:55.730> the

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
that's the kind of game Lord of the

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.780 
that's the kind of game Lord of the
Rings<00:03:55.910> is<00:03:56.090> it's<00:03:56.300> meant<00:03:56.540> to<00:03:56.690> be<00:03:56.720> an<00:03:56.900> action<00:03:57.230> RPG

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
Rings is it's meant to be an action RPG

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.950 
Rings is it's meant to be an action RPG
if<00:03:58.790> they<00:03:58.940> make<00:03:59.120> it<00:03:59.150> too<00:03:59.480> much<00:03:59.660> like<00:03:59.930> a

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
if they make it too much like a

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.240 
if they make it too much like a
third-person<00:04:00.590> shooter<00:04:01.750> like<00:04:02.750> that<00:04:03.020> Cara<00:04:03.710> lord

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
third-person shooter like that Cara lord

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.310 
third-person shooter like that Cara lord
of<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.340> rings<00:04:04.490> conquest<00:04:04.730> was<00:04:05.210> I<00:04:05.480> think<00:04:06.020> we

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
of the rings conquest was I think we

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.870 
of the rings conquest was I think we
might<00:04:06.530> be<00:04:06.590> in<00:04:06.830> trouble<00:04:06.860> just<00:04:07.310> because<00:04:07.610> lord<00:04:07.820> of

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
might be in trouble just because lord of

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.970 
might be in trouble just because lord of
the<00:04:07.910> rings<00:04:08.060> conquest<00:04:08.530> just<00:04:09.530> wasn't<00:04:09.800> that<00:04:09.890> good

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
the rings conquest just wasn't that good

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.010 
the rings conquest just wasn't that good
of<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.160> game<00:04:10.340> like<00:04:11.270> Lord<00:04:11.600> of<00:04:11.630> the<00:04:11.720> Rings<00:04:11.870> is<00:04:11.990> a

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
of a game like Lord of the Rings is a

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.050 
of a game like Lord of the Rings is a
hard<00:04:12.350> series<00:04:12.770> to<00:04:13.040> make<00:04:13.160> a<00:04:13.190> good<00:04:13.459> game<00:04:13.670> because

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
hard series to make a good game because

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.640 
hard series to make a good game because
people<00:04:14.450> try<00:04:14.600> to<00:04:14.630> go<00:04:14.810> way<00:04:14.990> to<00:04:15.020> out<00:04:15.320> of<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.470> box

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
people try to go way to out of the box

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.770 
people try to go way to out of the box
and<00:04:15.950> then<00:04:16.370> it<00:04:16.489> doesn't<00:04:16.670> work<00:04:16.790> or<00:04:17.239> they<00:04:17.570> try<00:04:17.720> to

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
and then it doesn't work or they try to

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.570 
and then it doesn't work or they try to
stay<00:04:17.900> way<00:04:18.230> to<00:04:18.260> in<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.709> box<00:04:18.920> and<00:04:19.130> then<00:04:19.280> it<00:04:19.400> still

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
stay way to in the box and then it still

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.640 
stay way to in the box and then it still
doesn't<00:04:19.850> work<00:04:19.970> but<00:04:20.510> with<00:04:20.660> this<00:04:20.900> concept<00:04:21.200> I

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
doesn't work but with this concept I

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.050 
doesn't work but with this concept I
think<00:04:21.890> it<00:04:21.979> will<00:04:22.070> actually<00:04:22.280> do<00:04:22.610> really<00:04:22.640> well<00:04:23.150> if

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
think it will actually do really well if

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.300 
think it will actually do really well if
who<00:04:24.120> are<00:04:24.570> curious<00:04:25.290> about<00:04:25.500> any<00:04:25.740> of<00:04:25.889> this<00:04:25.980> just

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780 
why they're not giving it to me but they

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.510 
why they're not giving it to me but they
just<00:06:50.020> told<00:06:50.199> me<00:06:50.320> that<00:06:50.440> they<00:06:50.740> they<00:06:51.040> just<00:06:51.340> have
