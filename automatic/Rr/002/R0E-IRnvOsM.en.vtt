00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.320 

now<00:00:01.350> one<00:00:01.890> of<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.100> hard<00:00:02.340> parts<00:00:02.669> about<00:00:02.760> making

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
now one of the hard parts about making

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.020 
now one of the hard parts about making
an<00:00:03.510> egg<00:00:04.040> is<00:00:06.140> putting<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.200> butter<00:00:07.379> in<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.620> pan

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.030 
an egg is putting the butter in the pan

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.049 
an egg is putting the butter in the pan
and<00:00:09.030> it's<00:00:09.269> not<00:00:09.590> what's<00:00:10.590> hard<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:11.190> how<00:00:11.880> much

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
and it's not what's hard is how much

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.620 
and it's not what's hard is how much
butter<00:00:12.450> should<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.870> put<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:14.089> now<00:00:15.089> this<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.480> a

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
butter should you put in now this is a

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.380 
butter should you put in now this is a
small<00:00:16.020> pan<00:00:16.910> so<00:00:17.910> don't<00:00:18.060> need<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.240> much<00:00:18.390> butter

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
small pan so don't need that much butter

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.510 
small pan so don't need that much butter
but<00:00:21.390> um<00:00:23.180> I'll<00:00:24.180> cut<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.420> where

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
but um I'll cut it where

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.060 
but um I'll cut it where
that's<00:00:26.240> too<00:00:26.510> much

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
that's too much

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.760 
that's too much
it's<00:00:28.490> too<00:00:28.730> much<00:00:28.940> I<00:00:29.300> want<00:00:30.020> to<00:00:30.080> put<00:00:30.199> but<00:00:30.529> see<00:00:30.680> the

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
it's too much I want to put but see the

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.740 
it's too much I want to put but see the
thing<00:00:30.800> is<00:00:31.010> it's<00:00:31.550> hard<00:00:31.760> to<00:00:31.880> cut<00:00:32.119> a<00:00:32.150> small<00:00:32.480> slice

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
thing is it's hard to cut a small slice

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.190 
thing is it's hard to cut a small slice
so<00:00:32.930> what<00:00:33.079> when<00:00:33.380> I<00:00:33.410> do<00:00:33.559> I<00:00:34.480> cut<00:00:35.480> a<00:00:35.510> fairly<00:00:35.930> large

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
so what when I do I cut a fairly large

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.400 
so what when I do I cut a fairly large
less<00:00:37.010> that's<00:00:37.250> really<00:00:37.900> that's<00:00:38.900> really<00:00:39.050> too

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
less that's really that's really too

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.860 
less that's really that's really too
small<00:00:39.620> actually<00:00:40.129> but<00:00:40.280> anyway<00:00:40.550> gotta<00:00:41.480> smell

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
small actually but anyway gotta smell

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.229 
small actually but anyway gotta smell
fairly<00:00:42.440> large<00:00:42.680> slice<00:00:43.570> and<00:00:44.570> I<00:00:44.629> cut<00:00:44.930> it<00:00:45.050> in<00:00:45.140> half

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
fairly large slice and I cut it in half

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.890 
fairly large slice and I cut it in half
let<00:00:47.239> him<00:00:47.390> technically<00:00:47.809> to<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.050> band<00:00:49.690> got<00:00:50.690> turn

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
let him technically to the band got turn

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.680 
let him technically to the band got turn
on<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.199> heat<00:00:51.670> that's<00:00:52.670> really<00:00:52.940> too<00:00:53.120> small<00:00:53.300> I

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
on the heat that's really too small I

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.990 
on the heat that's really too small I
really<00:00:54.559> I<00:00:54.800> cut<00:00:55.489> a<00:00:55.519> slice<00:00:55.790> it<00:00:56.030> was<00:00:56.150> right<00:00:58.000> should

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
really I cut a slice it was right should

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.020 
really I cut a slice it was right should
have<00:00:59.089> got<00:00:59.180> a<00:00:59.239> bigger<00:00:59.510> slice

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.539 

now<00:01:03.600> I've<00:01:03.660> gotta<00:01:03.870> pay<00:01:04.830> has<00:01:05.040> been<00:01:05.250> at<00:01:05.369> room

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
now I've gotta pay has been at room

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.950 
now I've gotta pay has been at room
temperature<00:01:06.119> for<00:01:06.409> mmm<00:01:07.409> all<00:01:08.190> day<00:01:11.600> time<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.780> it

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
temperature for mmm all day time is it

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:33.220 
temperature for mmm all day time is it
or<00:01:13.350> something

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:49.070

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
my butter for next time yeah I should

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.720 
my butter for next time yeah I should
have<00:02:03.330> cut<00:02:03.510> a<00:02:03.540> sticker<00:02:04.050> slice<00:02:04.430> we<00:02:05.430> get<00:02:05.610> away

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
have cut a sticker slice we get away

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:13.730 
have cut a sticker slice we get away
then<00:02:05.970> cut<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:10.520> that<00:02:11.520> yoga<00:02:12.380> can<00:02:13.380> take<00:02:13.590> a

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
then cut that that yoga can take a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.650 
then cut that that yoga can take a
little<00:02:13.950> longer<00:02:14.160> than<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:15.210> time<00:02:15.390> on<00:02:15.570> this

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
little longer than the time on this

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:23.720 
little longer than the time on this
video<00:02:16.020> get<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.240> done<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:22.340> could<00:02:23.340> probably<00:02:23.460> use

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
video get that done I could probably use

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.420 
video get that done I could probably use

don't know how to make them look at

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.030 
don't know how to make them look at
temperature<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:43.020> here<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:44.150> close<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.330> 90

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
temperature and here is a close to 90

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.809 
temperature and here is a close to 90
the<00:02:47.040> butter<00:02:47.280> is<00:02:47.340> that
