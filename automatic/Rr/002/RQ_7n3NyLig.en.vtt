00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
this is the DualShock for I believe not

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.050 
this is the DualShock for I believe not
a<00:01:50.360> bad-looking<00:01:50.600> controller<00:01:51.670> feels<00:01:52.670> a<00:01:52.910> lot

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
a bad-looking controller feels a lot

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.940 
a bad-looking controller feels a lot
different<00:01:53.120> from<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.990> DualShock<00:01:54.890> free<00:01:59.950> it's

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
different from the DualShock free it's

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.320 
different from the DualShock free it's
got<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.220> LED<00:02:01.520> light<00:02:02.000> on<00:02:02.540> it<00:02:02.750> here<00:02:04.150> so<00:02:05.150> yeah<00:02:05.300> I

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
got the LED light on it here so yeah I

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.880 
got the LED light on it here so yeah I
mean<00:02:05.570> this<00:02:05.720> is<00:02:05.780> going<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.080> take<00:02:06.290> a<00:02:06.320> while<00:02:06.620> to

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
mean this is going to take a while to

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.490 
mean this is going to take a while to
get<00:02:07.040> used<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.460> but<00:02:07.670> from<00:02:08.479> what<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:08.750> can<00:02:08.869> feel<00:02:09.260> it

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
get used to but from what I can feel it

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.460 
get used to but from what I can feel it
feels<00:02:09.770> a<00:02:10.300> lot<00:02:11.300> more<00:02:11.360> nicer<00:02:11.840> than<00:02:12.320> the

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
feels a lot more nicer than the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.449 
feels a lot more nicer than the
DualShock<00:02:12.920> free

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
DualShock free

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.370 
DualShock free
I'm<00:02:14.330> guessing<00:02:14.720> it's<00:02:14.840> going<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.020> be<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.140> lot<00:02:15.350> more

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
I'm guessing it's going to be a lot more

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.040 
I'm guessing it's going to be a lot more
better<00:02:15.709> for<00:02:15.830> gaming<00:02:16.160> as<00:02:16.550> well<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:17.540> anyway

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
better for gaming as well so anyway
