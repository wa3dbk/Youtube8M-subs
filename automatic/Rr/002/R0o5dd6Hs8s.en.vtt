00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.330
 v 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:12.389
 today we are celebrating today it is a great day 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.900
 since I got in shape because the eu the postman was very nice and funny 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.949
 and that 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.880
 in the mailbox 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.880
 without going through square one if you know what I mean 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.560
 and it happens directly at home in a nice little package 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.640
 so that 5 807 m paulette 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.640
 because this little video must also serve for him neophytes 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.740
 we have to start one day and start to understand things 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.210
 to 28 years was of those who in addition so it's a relay 800 cfm so it's 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.760
 a little big it's clear 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.000
 but not built there parties were followed of mechanical type 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.470
 in this case we have the first two bodies see there level of the dough 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.080
 anyway it's my left foot as on mac it's true 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.020
 at the level of the dough the first two bodies that opens 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.360
 and unlike those who functioned depression that is to say 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.120
 kyaw the next two bodies of with the biker depression some humor 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.380
 some demand for m from the accelerator 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.910
 here in fact is mechanical type it's clear that there when I continue they 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.750
 will play more than half true 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.120
 from we will stand up 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.730
 dudule of the open half of the first tier of the others begins to 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.130
 smile 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.250
 so here I close 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.800
 a little bit first 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.070
 and you will see the secondary that starts to swing 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.360
 so that's a carburetor that matches at least 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.470
 completely for my compressor 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.370
 since all the time a compressor to parma together 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.350
 appreciate this kind of carburetor compared to kibaki depression to a 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.930
 carburetor at pressures would not work on my back 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.390
 but for 100 euros per month I think it still requires big 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.950
 big settings 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.390
 the laces may be 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.740
 clean 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.010
 of my domain so see with that in any case resumed normally 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.930
 but we're going to bring enough coco the bug so she can 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.990
 turn 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.990
 we are shown a little bit also the adapter part 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.410
 we have the head elsewhere as in Europe our opinion we do not go on the forum 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.549
 in a caravan on the 17th 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.879
 actually on the ball to the head when appropriate this course after 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.939
 with the cobblestones the butterflies which is the goal is directly this is bound to 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.989
 it will not work 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.309
 that's the light 20h10 - 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:24.099
 here in a corner of the head elsewhere 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.339
 for 100 th it's called an hour adapter 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:29.639
 to a split in the tournament 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.649
 this could bounce back 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:34.929
 I think it's like that, at least this world is not correct 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:36.960
 its particularity is that original 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.769
 on this car 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.779
 with a compressor we have a shape 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:44.389
 which corresponds to the carburettor 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.389
 necessarily all that I could weave the vices 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.229
 - Florentine who correspond to large processions of small quran 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.899
 we go out our tour had already shown 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:58.539
 so there we saw big body down upward sling of the engine towards 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:00.419
 rear side windshield 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.680
 obviously here no but 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.349
 with small bodies 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.150
 more in fact it's a carburetor at the base this dough raises it 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.099
 all 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.860
 it actually opens up to his father's side his sense of 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:13.939
 the ear 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.500
 on the body of the composter 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.500
 but at the same time it also allows to see a perfect seal 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.069
 percent and a form 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.179
 3d adaptation format 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:27.689
 so with all this is going to work we will get all this 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:28.709
 quietly 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.679
 we must now let appear a small film 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:35.019
 once it starts in October 6 by noting the particular music 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:37.869
 normally it appears so not true 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:40.869
 see you later 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:45.789
 chic
