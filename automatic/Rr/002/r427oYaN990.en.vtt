 hello today we will introduce you 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.389
 graphics card and gigabyte geforce gtx 960 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.070
 windforce aussi 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.080
 which possesses the original system 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.769
 cooling quality components base 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.769
 and factory overclocking 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.020
 no wonder the company is gigabyte 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.490
 one of the largest partners and nvidia not 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.610
 stayed away from the announcement of the new 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.529
 nvidia geforce gtx 960 video card she 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.210
 developed three own versions at once 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.829
 who got modified 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.750
 cooling systems factory overclocking 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.280
 quality element base and range 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.720
 other very useful improvements 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.720
 recall that with key features 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.670
 nvidia geforce gtx 960 models and 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.920
 microarchitecture and nvidia maxwell you 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.920
 can find find portal 10 com 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.540
 complete with gigabyte geforce gtx 960 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.100
 besides windforce aussi 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.380
 user manuals are supplied 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.940
 two power adapters altogether similar 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.470
 the set can be safely characterized as 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.120
 sufficient since it will help 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.620
 correctly organize the power of the video card 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.850
 in the absence of power supplies 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.850
 necessary connectors 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.950
 for the production of new items 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:13.960
 original circuit board used 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.520
 black with standard guidelines 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.140
 typesetting arrangements 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.759
 applied element base 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.890
 Complies with ultra durable concept 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.110
 VJ that is, it is typed exclusively 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.490
 from high-quality components 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.009
 nutrition is made on enhanced 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.020
 eight phase circuit 6 near the circuit and 2 for 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.240
 memory chips while reference 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.100
 version includes only five phases 4 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.799
 for jikia and one for video memory 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.329
 In addition to the slot, write express 30 x 16 for 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.250

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.759
 connectors although reference options 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.829
 assumes only one they are on 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.780
 the side of the PCB thanks 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.909
 their good location cooler at all 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.950
 not difficult to disconnect cables pisya and 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.209
 to display the image on the test 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.829
 new items provided for a bit 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:57.520
 set different from the reference 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.679
 interfaces 9 9 hdmi 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.569
 as well as three displayport the difference lies 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.399
 only in the presence of an additional port 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.780
 Velde that greatly simplify 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.340
 connecting multiple monitors 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.869
 at the same time as not all 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.829
 users will be available 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.829
 multiple displayport cable 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.360
 proprietary cooling system windforce 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.250
 2x besides very restrained design 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.989
 different quite reasonable size 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.819
 that allow you to easily install 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.560
 novelty in medium-sized enclosures 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.060
 video card with installed system 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.040
 cooling takes up two expansion slots 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.900
 has a total length of two hundred and fifty 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.060
 eight millimeters according to our 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.280
 measurements directly to the cooler itself and 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.989
 consists of a radiator recruited from 36 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.700
 longitudinally arranged aluminum 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.080
 nickel-plated plates as well as two 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.489
 fans with a blade diameter 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.019
 eighty eight millimeters 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.970
 mounted on a plastic casing 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.160
 which covers the entire structure from above 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.319
 as the turntables are used 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.180
 power logic propellers that are built 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.860
 on slide bearings that promises 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.720
 low noise during operation 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.400
 to increase heat transfer efficiency 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.799
 three copper heat pipes are used 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.299
 diameter of 6 millimeters unfortunately they 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.799
 not coated with a layer of nickel which 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.569
 interferes with copper oxidation 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.340
 that in the future may have a negative impact 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.810
 on cooling efficiency while 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.819
 kontak heat pipes with copper 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.230
 radiator base and fins improved 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.599
 solder is present support 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.950
 heat pipe touch technology 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.959
 according to which heat pipes 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.670
 contact the graphics core directly 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.780
 through a small layer of thermal paste 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.090
 with automatic regulation 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.130
 fan blade speeds in 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.709
 maximum load graphic 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.510
 the core is heated to 67 degrees and the cooler 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.459
 judging by the testimony of monitoring worked 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.290
 with only 34 percent of its 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.670
 maximum power noise level 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.260
 characterize as quiet 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.579
 with no load frequency 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.829
 graphics core and memory automatically 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.079
 decreases leading to less of them 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.310
 power consumption and heat dissipation cooler 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.870
 in this mode it works absolutely 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.579
 silent as the fans 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.620
 stop and cooling system 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.690
 translated into passive mode as we see 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.069
 windforce 2x cooling system could 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.329
 no problem to cope with cooling 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.590
 overclocked in the factory 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.030
 graphics core 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.230
 besides, it provides low 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.260
 everyday noise level 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.260
 operation 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.560
 version and nvidia geforce gtx 780 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.480
 ahead of the new product by an average of 41 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.310
 percentage however if you fold the test for 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.780
 4k ultra hd resolution 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.940
 that advantage no longer looks so 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.940
 only 23 percent impressive 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.950
 advantages and nvidia geforce gtx 970 in 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.450
 overall was an impressive 66 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.070
 percent if not to take into account 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.810
 4k ultra hd 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.419
 the backlog of new items is already estimated at 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.270
 level 44 percent as we can see nvidia 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.889
 geforce gtx 970 is much more suitable 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.600
 for high resolutions it makes sense 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.100
 considering the memory bus width 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.620
 and the total computing power is more 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.290
 expensive model as for md radeon 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.240
 hd 7970 then on average she was 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.400
 ahead by 16 percent if not 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.870
 consider benchmarks with 4k resolution 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.700
 ultra hd and where they appear 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.440
 the advantages of the model from md then on average 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.480
 the difference in performance between them 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.250
 almost none as we see if you are not 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.890
 plan to play at no higher resolution 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.970
 full hd the 128 bit memory bus is not 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.410
 will become a barrier 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.150
 About the performance of the novelty will be 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.520
 enough for high settings 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.380
 graphics with the utility meters and colleagues and 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.240
 Bernard was raised voltage scum 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.610
 at 43 millivolts relative 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.110
 nominal 1200 millivolts thanks 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.860
 it managed to overclock the graphic 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:13.190
 processor from 1216 to 1420 6 megahertz 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.050
 growth of 17.3 percent if you compare 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.870
 achieved final standard 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.669
 1126 megahertz their own growth was 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.640
 26 point six percent 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.760
 it was possible to accelerate the video memory with 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:27.380
 1750 3 to 1920 and 8 MHz increment 10 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.570
 percent which is also very 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.400
 a good indicator ultimately us 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.080
 managed to achieve an average of almost 13 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.729
 percentage increment shift frequency 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.110
 frames in gaming applications that 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.850
 is a great result and 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.830
 allows the graphics card to cut a little 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.300
 backlog from more expensive and nvidia 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.300
 geforce gtx 970 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.960

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.450
 everyday noise 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.010
 besides, he now got so 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.660
 popular and in demand now 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.530
 technology passive work at low 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.270

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.060
 which allowed to get almost 13 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.980
 percentage increase in frame rates 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.750
 in gaming applications as for 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.950
 features it is worth highlighting except 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.630
 increased noise 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.430
 after a forced increase in frequency 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.460
