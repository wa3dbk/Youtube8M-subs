00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
spinach Sol egginess is the problem

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.870 
spinach Sol egginess is the problem
that's<00:00:13.230> usually<00:00:13.620> caused<00:00:13.860> by<00:00:14.190> either<00:00:14.340> higher

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
that's usually caused by either higher

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.150 
that's usually caused by either higher
low<00:00:15.179> extreme<00:00:15.660> temperatures<00:00:16.230> not<00:00:16.680> efficient

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
low extreme temperatures not efficient

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.410 
low extreme temperatures not efficient
water<00:00:17.400> or<00:00:18.109> just<00:00:19.109> dryness<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:19.770> general<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.580> what

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
you want to do before you transplant

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.750 
you want to do before you transplant
them<00:00:23.820> if<00:00:23.970> they're<00:00:24.150> leggy<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.710> try<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.760> make

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
them if they're leggy is try to make

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.339 
them if they're leggy is try to make
sure<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.090> they<00:00:27.210> get<00:00:27.330> even<00:00:27.689> sunlight<00:00:27.960> so

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
sure that they get even sunlight so

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.779 
sure that they get even sunlight so
you're<00:00:28.470> gonna<00:00:28.590> place<00:00:28.859> them<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> Sun<00:00:29.519> and

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
you're gonna place them in the Sun and

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.630 
you're gonna place them in the Sun and
make<00:00:30.480> sure<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.560> have<00:00:31.949> them<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.309> this

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
make sure that you have them on this

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.610 
make sure that you have them on this
side<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.090> then<00:00:33.239> rotate<00:00:33.690> them<00:00:33.899> half<00:00:34.440> way

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
side and then rotate them half way

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.049 
side and then rotate them half way
through<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.010> half<00:00:35.160> them<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.610> side<00:00:35.820> that

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
through and half them on this side that

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.299 
through and half them on this side that
way<00:00:36.239> they<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:36.570> start<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.290> try<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.559> gather

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
way they can start to try to gather

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.160 
way they can start to try to gather
themselves<00:00:38.640> get<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.629> sufficient<00:00:40.020> sunlight

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
themselves get that sufficient sunlight

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.750 
themselves get that sufficient sunlight
because<00:00:40.469> when<00:00:40.680> they're<00:00:40.860> trying<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.309> get<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
because when they're trying to get the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.700 
because when they're trying to get the
Sun<00:00:42.000> they're<00:00:42.390> stretching<00:00:42.809> towards<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.530> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
Sun they're stretching towards it and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.110 
Sun they're stretching towards it and
putting<00:00:44.190> their<00:00:44.370> energy<00:00:44.640> towards<00:00:44.820> that

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
putting their energy towards that

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.229 
putting their energy towards that
instead<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.420> producing<00:00:45.840> proper<00:00:46.230> foliage<00:00:47.239> so

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
instead of producing proper foliage so

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.220 
instead of producing proper foliage so
that's<00:00:48.420> one<00:00:48.750> thing

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
that's one thing

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.380 
that's one thing
another<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.129> harden<00:00:50.579> off<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.850> transplant

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
another is to harden off the transplant

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.790 
another is to harden off the transplant
if<00:00:51.480> they've<00:00:51.629> been<00:00:51.809> inside<00:00:52.140> your<00:00:52.379> house<00:00:52.559> or

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
if they've been inside your house or

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.850 
if they've been inside your house or
your<00:00:53.309> garage<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.780> hardening<00:00:55.320> off<00:00:55.500> what<00:00:55.770> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
your garage and hardening off what it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.040 
your garage and hardening off what it
does<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.370> kind<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.670> prepares<00:00:57.090> them<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
does is it kind of prepares them for the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.830 
does is it kind of prepares them for the
temperatures<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> outside<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.359> spinach

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
temperatures of the outside so spinach

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.170 
temperatures of the outside so spinach
is<00:01:01.050> more<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.500> fall<00:01:01.770> crop<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.910> want<00:01:03.090> to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
is more of a fall crop you want to

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.759 
is more of a fall crop you want to
harden<00:01:03.539> them<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.930> they're<00:01:04.080> gonna<00:01:04.199> get<00:01:04.439> used<00:01:04.619> to

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
harden them so they're gonna get used to

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.039 
harden them so they're gonna get used to
that<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.549> how<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.790> harden<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.600> place<00:01:06.840> them

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
that so how you harden is you place them

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.320 
that so how you harden is you place them
outside<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.280> cooler<00:01:08.490> temperatures<00:01:08.880> then

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
outside in the cooler temperatures then

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.270 
outside in the cooler temperatures then
they're<00:01:09.510> used<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:10.470> about<00:01:10.650> two<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.159> four

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
they're used to for about two to four

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.640 
they're used to for about two to four
hours<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> day<00:01:11.790> for<00:01:12.299> two<00:01:12.450> weeks<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.560> way

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
hours a day for two weeks and that way

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.899 
hours a day for two weeks and that way
they<00:01:13.799> can<00:01:13.830> get<00:01:14.040> used<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.610> then<00:01:14.729> they're

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
they can get used to it and then they're

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.969 
they can get used to it and then they're
ready<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.150> transplant<00:01:15.750> into<00:01:15.840> your<00:01:15.990> garden<00:01:16.320> so
