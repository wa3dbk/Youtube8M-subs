00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
so as you see I face him towards the gap

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.900 
so as you see I face him towards the gap
every<00:00:37.620> time<00:00:38.010> if<00:00:38.190> he<00:00:38.280> hits<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.790> these

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
every time if he hits one of these

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.060 
every time if he hits one of these
purple<00:00:39.750> rectangles<00:00:40.379> you're<00:00:40.590> gonna<00:00:40.680> be<00:00:40.890> hit

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
purple rectangles you're gonna be hit

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.450 
purple rectangles you're gonna be hit
for<00:00:41.190> 650<00:00:42.120> K<00:00:42.300> which<00:00:42.840> will<00:00:43.050> kill<00:00:43.290> most<00:00:43.559> people<00:00:43.920> so

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
for 650 K which will kill most people so

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.529 
for 650 K which will kill most people so
you<00:00:44.520> definitely<00:00:44.670> don't<00:00:44.940> want<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.149> do<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.420> you

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
you definitely don't want to do that you

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.540 
you definitely don't want to do that you
don't<00:00:45.660> want<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> be<00:00:45.899> hit<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.170> 650<00:00:46.890> K<00:00:47.039> now

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
don't want to be hit for 650 K now

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.190 
don't want to be hit for 650 K now
there's<00:00:47.700> about<00:00:47.820> 4<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.360> differ<00:00:48.539> 5<00:00:48.930> different

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
there's about 4 to differ 5 different

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.810 
there's about 4 to differ 5 different
patterns<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.219> do<00:00:50.460> they're<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.789> a

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
patterns that you can do they're in a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.400 
patterns that you can do they're in a
random<00:00:51.239> order<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.690> can't<00:00:51.960> learn<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
random order so you can't learn the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.290 
random order so you can't learn the
rotation<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.699> kind<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.090> learn<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
rotation but you can kind of learn the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.090 
rotation but you can kind of learn the
pattern<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:54.960> know<00:00:55.110> which<00:00:55.230> way<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> turn<00:00:55.739> on

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
pattern so you know which way to turn on

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.610 
pattern so you know which way to turn on
different<00:00:56.670> sort<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.210> patterns<00:00:57.719> or<00:00:58.079> upcoming

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
different sort of patterns or upcoming

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.380 
different sort of patterns or upcoming
the<00:00:58.800> other<00:00:59.730> thing<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.000> makes<00:01:00.239> this

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the other thing that makes this

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.849 
the other thing that makes this
difficult<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.020> you've<00:01:01.170> gotta<00:01:01.320> kill<00:01:01.530> 12

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
difficult is you've gotta kill 12

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.549 
difficult is you've gotta kill 12
million<00:01:02.280> HP<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.969> two<00:01:03.180> minutes<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.780> that's

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
million HP in two minutes and that's

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.289 
million HP in two minutes and that's
while<00:01:04.949> trying<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.519> know<00:01:05.640> focus<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:06.119> not

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
while trying to you know focus on not

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.630 
while trying to you know focus on not
being<00:01:06.510> one-shot<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.920> difficult<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
being one-shot so it is difficult in the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.219 
being one-shot so it is difficult in the
sense<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.970> being<00:01:09.150> able<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.420> multitask<00:01:09.720> very

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
sense of being able to multitask very

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.020 
sense of being able to multitask very
well<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.979> see<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.130> point<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> camera<00:01:11.700> above

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
well as you see I point the camera above

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.490 
well as you see I point the camera above
me<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.479> give<00:01:12.600> me<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.780> aerial<00:01:13.170> point<00:01:13.350> of

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
me just to give me that aerial point of

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.080 
me just to give me that aerial point of
view<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> find<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.100> makes<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.400> much<00:01:14.580> easier<00:01:14.820> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
view I find it makes it much easier and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.090 
view I find it makes it much easier and
you<00:01:15.600> can't<00:01:15.869> move<00:01:16.140> from<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.560> spot<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.890> have

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
you can't move from that spot you have

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.920 
you can't move from that spot you have
the<00:01:17.340> only<00:01:17.490> way<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.880> turn<00:01:18.450> him<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.780> by

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the only way you can turn him is by

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.420 
the only way you can turn him is by
turning<00:01:19.380> your<00:01:19.470> character<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.979> can't<00:01:20.189> like

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
turning your character you can't like

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.010 
turning your character you can't like
move<00:01:20.670> forward<00:01:20.729> backwards<00:01:21.509> or<00:01:21.630> left<00:01:21.780> or<00:01:21.869> right

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
move forward backwards or left or right

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.289 
move forward backwards or left or right
you<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.650> turn<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.610> keyboard<00:01:24.000> Turner's

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
you have to turn so keyboard Turner's
