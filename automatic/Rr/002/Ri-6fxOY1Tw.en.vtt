00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.410 
single at this point there is definitely
a<00:01:47.100> vibration<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.240> send<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:51.149> you

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
around and I really got clear that this

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.100
