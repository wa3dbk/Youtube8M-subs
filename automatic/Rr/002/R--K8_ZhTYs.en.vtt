00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
the fall I realized that my channel had

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.069 
the fall I realized that my channel had
been<00:02:45.530> deleted<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:47.110> um<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:50.630> know<00:02:50.660> I<00:02:50.750> only

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
been deleted and um you know I only

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.770 
been deleted and um you know I only
looked<00:02:51.410> in<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:51.920> looked<00:02:52.489> into<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:53.450> much

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
looked in it and looked into it so much

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.300 
looked in it and looked into it so much
because<00:02:54.139> there<00:02:54.590> were<00:02:54.739> a<00:02:54.769> lot<00:02:54.950> of<00:02:54.980> other<00:02:55.220> things

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
because there were a lot of other things

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.039 
because there were a lot of other things
going<00:02:55.940> on<00:02:56.980> but<00:02:57.980> then<00:02:58.720> towards<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.750> end<00:02:59.810> of

2011<00:03:00.769> beginning<00:03:01.069> of<00:03:01.130> 2012<00:03:01.880> when<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.180> did<00:03:02.450> try<00:03:02.750> to

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
2011 beginning of 2012 when I did try to

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.930 
2011 beginning of 2012 when I did try to
restore<00:03:03.380> my<00:03:03.440> channel<00:03:04.100> and<00:03:04.130> figure<00:03:04.459> out<00:03:04.519> where

all<00:03:05.150> my<00:03:05.359> videos<00:03:05.540> were<00:03:05.959> they<00:03:06.590> were<00:03:06.650> completely

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
all my videos were they were completely

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:17.190 
all my videos were they were completely
gone<00:03:07.430> by<00:03:07.670> then<00:03:08.260> so<00:03:10.000> 2012<00:03:11.109> I<00:03:13.510> thought<00:03:14.510> I<00:03:15.349> I<00:03:16.120> did

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
gone by then so 2012 I thought I I did

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.180 
gone by then so 2012 I thought I I did
research<00:03:18.200> on<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:19.370> different<00:03:19.790> types<00:03:20.120> of

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
research on the different types of

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.770 
research on the different types of
lacking<00:03:22.190> methods<00:03:22.670> as<00:03:22.880> I've<00:03:23.060> been<00:03:23.090> doing

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
lacking methods as I've been doing

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.250 
lacking methods as I've been doing
previously<00:03:25.389> but<00:03:26.389> then<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.660> whole<00:03:27.019> bunch<00:03:27.200> of

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
previously but then a whole bunch of

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.430 
previously but then a whole bunch of
other<00:03:27.440> stuff<00:03:27.530> came<00:03:28.459> up<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:29.120> I<00:03:29.870> took<00:03:30.019> a<00:03:30.200> break

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
other stuff came up and I took a break

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.319 
other stuff came up and I took a break
from<00:03:30.560> that<00:03:30.980> and<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.370> just<00:03:31.549> kept<00:03:31.819> my<00:03:31.970> natural

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
from that and I just kept my natural

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.640 
from that and I just kept my natural
hair<00:03:32.510> out<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:32.959> was<00:03:33.109> doing<00:03:33.380> my<00:03:33.500> own<00:03:33.530> thing

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
hair out and was doing my own thing

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.270

obviously<00:04:00.160> a<00:04:00.250> two<00:04:00.490> strand<00:04:00.790> twist<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.420> I

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
obviously a two strand twist and I

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:09.590 
obviously a two strand twist and I
started<00:04:01.959> them<00:04:03.390> November<00:04:04.650> 21st<00:04:05.650> 22nd<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:08.250> 2012
