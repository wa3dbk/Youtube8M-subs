below so I'm going to have to use a

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.390 
below so I'm going to have to use a
third-party<00:00:21.480> partitioning<00:00:22.410> software<00:00:22.980> if<00:00:23.160> you

want to partition your hard drive if

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.939 
want to partition your hard drive if
you're<00:00:24.750> stuck<00:00:25.050> with<00:00:25.140> Windows<00:00:25.410> XP<00:00:25.529> or<00:00:25.769> below

you're stuck with Windows XP or below

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.890 
you're stuck with Windows XP or below
but<00:00:26.160> if<00:00:26.670> you're<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:26.880> Windows<00:00:27.180> 7<00:00:27.300> or<00:00:27.630> Windows

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
but if you're on Windows 7 or Windows

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.150 
but if you're on Windows 7 or Windows
Vista<00:00:27.960> you're<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.410> luck<00:00:28.619> there's<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.920> built-in

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
Vista you're in luck there's a built-in

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.970 
Vista you're in luck there's a built-in
partitioning<00:00:29.670> program<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:31.439> process<00:00:31.769> is

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
partitioning program and the process is

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.700 
partitioning program and the process is
the<00:00:32.009> same<00:00:32.099> for<00:00:32.640> both<00:00:33.210> operating<00:00:33.690> systems<00:00:33.840> so

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
the same for both operating systems so

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.440 
the same for both operating systems so
I'm<00:00:34.980> running<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.340> Windows<00:00:35.399> 7<00:00:35.940> machine<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.360> if

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
I'm running on a Windows 7 machine so if

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.850 
I'm running on a Windows 7 machine so if
you're<00:00:36.570> running<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:36.899> Windows<00:00:37.200> Vista<00:00:37.260> that's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
you're running on Windows Vista that's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.270 
you're running on Windows Vista that's
fine

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
fine

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.740 
fine
you<00:00:38.700> can<00:00:38.820> follow<00:00:38.969> along<00:00:39.149> because<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
you can follow along because the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.910 
you can follow along because the
directions<00:00:40.500> are<00:00:40.770> 100%<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.969> same<00:00:42.350> so<00:00:43.350> I'm<00:00:43.739> not

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
directions are 100% the same so I'm not

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.139 
directions are 100% the same so I'm not
going<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.160> even<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.520> explaining<00:00:45.030> what

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
going to even be explaining what

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.190 
going to even be explaining what
partitions<00:00:45.629> I'm<00:00:45.780> not<00:00:45.930> going<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.110> be

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
partitions I'm not going to be

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.590 
partitions I'm not going to be
explaining<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.070> do<00:00:47.940> with<00:00:48.120> partitions

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
explaining what to do with partitions

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.930 
explaining what to do with partitions
because<00:00:48.899> if<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.200> reach<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.559> video<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:50.070> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
because if you reach this video then you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.880 
because if you reach this video then you
already<00:00:51.090> know<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:51.629> partitions<00:00:52.620> are<00:00:52.800> you

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
already know what partitions are you

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.139 
already know what partitions are you
already<00:00:53.100> know<00:00:53.340> what<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.640> want<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.910> do<00:00:54.000> with

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
already know what you want to do with

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.090 
already know what you want to do with
them<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.750> let's<00:00:54.930> just<00:00:55.079> get<00:00:55.199> straight<00:00:55.770> to

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
them so let's just get straight to

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.459 
them so let's just get straight to
partitioning<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.449> fairly<00:00:57.660> simple<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.379> go

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
partitioning it's fairly simple just go

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.860 
partitioning it's fairly simple just go
to<00:00:58.530> start<00:00:58.920> or<00:00:59.730> computer<00:01:00.239> right-click<00:01:00.480> it

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
to start or computer right-click it

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.109

Drive and click on shrink volume this

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.820 
Drive and click on shrink volume this
window<00:01:14.610> will<00:01:14.729> pop<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.470> this<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.590> where<00:01:16.740> you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
window will pop up and this is where you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.590 
window will pop up and this is where you
enter<00:01:16.979> how<00:01:17.250> many<00:01:17.280> megabytes<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.330> want<00:01:18.509> your

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
enter how many megabytes you want your

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.390 
enter how many megabytes you want your
partition<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.950> where<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.250> get

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
partition to be this is where we get

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.730 
partition to be this is where we get
into<00:01:20.520> conversions<00:01:21.180> one<00:01:21.900> gigabyte<00:01:22.350> equals

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
into conversions one gigabyte equals

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.300 
into conversions one gigabyte equals
1024<00:01:23.610> megabytes<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.710> want<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.979> 10

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
1024 megabytes and so if you want a 10

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.510 
1024 megabytes and so if you want a 10
gigabyte<00:01:27.270> partition<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.100> use<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
gigabyte partition we have to use the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.080 
gigabyte partition we have to use the
windows<00:01:29.820> calculator<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.990> let's<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.350> 10<00:01:32.090> times

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
windows calculator so let's do 10 times

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.609 
windows calculator so let's do 10 times
a<00:01:33.509> thousand<00:01:34.610> 24<00:01:35.900> that's<00:01:36.900> pretty<00:01:37.140> simple<00:01:37.380> it's

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
a thousand 24 that's pretty simple it's

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.940 
a thousand 24 that's pretty simple it's
a<00:01:37.680> 10,000<00:01:38.579> 240<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.720> use<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.290> calculator<00:01:40.770> if

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
a 10,000 240 but use the calculator if

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.260 
a 10,000 240 but use the calculator if
you're<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.280> do<00:01:41.400> something<00:01:41.729> wacky<00:01:41.970> like

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
you're going to do something wacky like

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.859 
you're going to do something wacky like
17<00:01:42.840> gigabytes<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.500> 17<00:01:44.310> times<00:01:44.340> 1,024<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.780> we're

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
17 gigabytes so 17 times 1,024 so we're

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.060 
17 gigabytes so 17 times 1,024 so we're
going<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.049> partition<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.560> into<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> 10

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
going to partition this into a 10

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.210 
going to partition this into a 10
gigabyte<00:01:47.490> partition<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.560> that's<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.740> thousand

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
gigabyte partition and that's a thousand

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.429 
gigabyte partition and that's a thousand
ten<00:01:50.399> thousand<00:01:50.850> two<00:01:50.939> hundred<00:01:51.180> forty<00:01:51.439> megabytes

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
ten thousand two hundred forty megabytes

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.889 
ten thousand two hundred forty megabytes
so<00:01:52.920> let's<00:01:53.220> add<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.549> 10<00:01:54.149> thousand<00:01:54.780> two

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
so let's add that 10 thousand two

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.709 
so let's add that 10 thousand two
hundred<00:01:54.930> forty<00:01:55.500> megabytes<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:57.180> that's<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.450> 10

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
hundred forty megabytes so that's a 10

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.090 
hundred forty megabytes so that's a 10
