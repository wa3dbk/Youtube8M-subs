size<00:00:39.000> but<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.360> prefer<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.989> 1/8<00:00:40.379> inch<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
size but I prefer the 1/8 inch it's a

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.030 
size but I prefer the 1/8 inch it's a
little<00:00:41.460> bit<00:00:41.640> thinner<00:00:42.020> it's<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.379> little<00:00:43.890> bit

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
little bit thinner it's a little bit

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.910 
little bit thinner it's a little bit
lighter<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.840> it<00:00:45.840> creates<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.410> very<00:00:46.590> good

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
lighter and it creates a very good

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.340 
lighter and it creates a very good
surface<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.670> fits<00:00:48.000> well<00:00:48.270> into<00:00:48.600> an<00:00:48.930> easel

stack<00:00:53.820> easy<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.449> store<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:56.360> this<00:00:57.360> comes<00:00:57.690> in

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
stack easy to store so this comes in

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
and what you want to do is you don't

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.760 
and what you want to do is you don't
have<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.790> thin<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.090> at<00:01:54.360> all<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.899> will<00:01:55.530> give<00:01:55.740> a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
have to thin it at all this will give a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.600 
have to thin it at all this will give a
very<00:01:55.890> opaque<00:01:56.610> finish<00:01:57.570> with<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> matte<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:59.430> is

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
very opaque finish with a matte this is

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.370 
very opaque finish with a matte this is
indicated<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.479> back<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.079> matte

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
indicated on the back that it's matte

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.950 
indicated on the back that it's matte
and<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:02.460> somewhere<00:02:02.939> between<00:02:03.000> fluid<00:02:03.630> and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
and it's somewhere between fluid and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.719 
and it's somewhere between fluid and
thick<00:02:04.200> now<00:02:04.469> if<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.740> have<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.280> can<00:02:05.490> thin

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
thick now if you have to you can thin

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.469 
thick now if you have to you can thin
this<00:02:05.969> water<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.789> never<00:02:08.789> thin<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.420> just

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
this water but I never thin it I just

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.660 
this water but I never thin it I just
use<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.959> straight<00:02:10.289> out<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.590> bottle<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.640> I

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
use it straight out of the bottle so I

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.150 
use it straight out of the bottle so I
give<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.510> little<00:02:12.540> bit<00:02:12.780> of

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
give it a little bit of

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.140 
give it a little bit of
so<00:02:13.490> that<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:13.970> gesso<00:02:14.750> goes<00:02:14.960> down<00:02:15.550> into<00:02:16.550> the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
so that the the gesso goes down into the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.150 
so that the the gesso goes down into the
bottom<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:17.870> will<00:02:18.110> run<00:02:18.260> at<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.500> top<00:02:18.710> so<00:02:19.070> I<00:02:19.130> can

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
bottom and will run at the top so I can

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.580 
bottom and will run at the top so I can
squeeze<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:19.760> out<00:02:20.090> because<00:02:20.930> it's<00:02:21.110> very<00:02:21.140> very

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
squeeze it out because it's very very

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.520 
squeeze it out because it's very very
thick<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:23.120> I'll<00:02:23.240> squeeze<00:02:23.570> a<00:02:23.600> little<00:02:23.900> bit<00:02:24.020> onto

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
thick so I'll squeeze a little bit onto

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.160 
thick so I'll squeeze a little bit onto
the<00:02:24.650> surface<00:02:25.100> here<00:02:25.480> that's<00:02:26.480> probably<00:02:26.990> about

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
the surface here that's probably about

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.760 
the surface here that's probably about
all<00:02:27.320> I'll<00:02:27.680> need<00:02:27.710> just<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.370> cover<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.770> now

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
surface I tend to just once I've got it

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.960 
surface I tend to just once I've got it
covered<00:05:30.200> I<00:05:30.560> just<00:05:31.010> leave<00:05:31.220> it<00:05:31.340> alone<00:05:31.370> so<00:05:31.760> there's

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
covered I just leave it alone so there's

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.890 
covered I just leave it alone so there's
my<00:05:32.180> surface<00:05:32.690> right<00:05:32.900> there<00:05:34.270> there's<00:05:35.270> a<00:05:35.360> back<00:05:35.660> to

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
my surface right there there's a back to

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.990 
my surface right there there's a back to
this<00:05:36.050> also<00:05:36.320> it's<00:05:36.830> a<00:05:36.950> little<00:05:37.100> bit<00:05:37.370> rougher<00:05:37.790> and

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
this also it's a little bit rougher and

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.750 
this also it's a little bit rougher and
what<00:05:38.900> I<00:05:38.930> like<00:05:39.230> to<00:05:39.440> do<00:05:39.620> is<00:05:39.890> make<00:05:40.160> sure<00:05:40.400> that<00:05:40.610> the

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
what I like to do is make sure that the

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.310 
what I like to do is make sure that the
back<00:05:41.000> is<00:05:41.650> covered<00:05:42.650> as<00:05:42.890> well<00:05:43.160> that<00:05:43.880> way<00:05:44.320> no

back is covered as well that way no

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.700 
back is covered as well that way no
moisture<00:05:45.950> and<00:05:46.190> this<00:05:46.820> is<00:05:47.000> one<00:05:47.450> thing<00:05:47.720> that<00:05:48.560> the

moisture and this is one thing that the
gesso<00:05:49.130> does<00:05:49.370> in<00:05:49.669> addition<00:05:49.880> to<00:05:50.270> providing<00:05:50.600> a
