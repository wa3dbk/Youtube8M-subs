00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.469
 hello good morning and welcome in 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.599
 talk if you want to give something away 

00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:11.880
 original and without paying a penny 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.980
 for the day of the lovers I have what 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.859
 that you look for a heart next to 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.750
 origami paper to do it there's no 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.060
 nothing simpler are required 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.829
 only one sheet of paper a4 a 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.199
 red highlighter and a minimum of 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.449
 knowledge then to start the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.999
 great game, you have to know that as 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.730
 almost all of them hate me you need a 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:35.290
 square sheet perform this square is 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.820
 very easy 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.750
 you just have to preach the sheet in 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.750
 triangle like that 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.890
 and then fold this part of the paper 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.650
 we always do very well with the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:58.110
 fingers to get a good click on 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.110
 then we turn the blade and perform 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.740
 we asked for this operation several times 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.550
 to be able to cut correctly this 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.550
 part of the paper 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.220
 so we get a square base now 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.400
 we can close this and we're going to start the 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.740
 realization of our heart 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.350
 first you have to fold over the side of 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.210
 this way the tips should be about 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.210
 the other together and we enlist 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.990
 and then we do the same thing below the 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.990
 tips on the other tips and we warn 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:51.360
 in fact we do this in a way to get 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.730
 1 2 3 4 squares 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.550
 then we grab the rectangle here 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.460
 we paste like this on the middle line and 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:04.310
 let's get ready then we do the same in the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.310
 part of down we made and we flipped it 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.220
 and then we do the same thing in the part 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.080
 from below 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.080
 we make and flip 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.340
 so here we have a beautiful 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.520
 clean surface and now we have to 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.100
 make a triangle to do it 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.960
 let's take this part and fold it here 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.960
 to get a part of the triangle 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.790
 we grab the other smaller fold and 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.090
 we fold it up from it 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.090
 way 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.380
 we warn and flip here 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.230
 and then we keep this rectangle well 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.960
 and we bend it to form the 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.570
 equivalent of one third of the rectangle 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.240
 so here we have a third two 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.310
 thirds and three thirds so I'm going to 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.760
 apply more or less around here and I'm going to 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.760
 flip 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.880
 and with this part we are going to try 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.280
 make a bow tie 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.770
 then we squeeze right here on 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.090
 these two parts so get a 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.090
 pretty bow tie like that 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.140
 now his heart is almost finished 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.570
 let's fold this fold here to 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.200
 make a triangle and thus form a 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.200
 to 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.069
 and let's fold the other fold to 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.069
 form another triangle 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.800
 then we need to flip the paper 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.650
 to finish and to look like a 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.050
 heart you just have to flatten a 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.050
 little here forming a small triangle 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.300
 and do the same with the other side now 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.940
 we get a heart but a heart 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.940
 white on the background a white is not 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:23.670
 very nice that's why we're going to use the 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.670
 marker to color the heart like this 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.550
 Well I have spent a little but my girlfriend 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.370
 will not pay attention to this as it may 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.620
 arrange a nice gift and we know that 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.979
 comes from the heart until soon enters 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.979
 tics
