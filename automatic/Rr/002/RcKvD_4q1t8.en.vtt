a glide to kind of small flocking birds
that<00:01:56.130> will<00:01:56.340> see<00:01:56.940> it<00:01:57.360> might<00:01:57.600> make<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.350> will

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
that will see it might make that will

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.670 
that will see it might make that will
hear<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.850> maybe<00:02:00.060> see<00:02:00.450> if<00:02:00.630> we're<00:02:00.750> lucky<00:02:01.050> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
chest effect chickadees often hang out

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.490 
chest effect chickadees often hang out
in<00:02:03.270> small<00:02:03.479> groups<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.140> pygmy

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
in small groups and so the pygmy

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:13.250 
in small groups and so the pygmy
nuthatch<00:02:04.530> --is<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:11.930> they'll<00:02:12.930> also<00:02:13.110> use

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
nuthatch --is and they'll also use

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260 
nuthatch --is and they'll also use
Douglas<00:02:13.860> fir<00:02:14.070> or<00:02:14.340> any<00:02:14.520> kind<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:15.030> large

coniferous tree that has thick bark

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.820 
coniferous tree that has thick bark
because<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.150> real<00:02:18.480> soft<00:02:18.959> wood<00:02:19.530> and

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
because that is a real soft wood and

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.190 
because that is a real soft wood and
it's<00:02:19.920> easy<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.310> make<00:02:20.430> holes<00:02:20.820> in<00:02:21.000> there<00:02:21.200> they'll

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
it's easy to make holes in there they'll

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.650 
it's easy to make holes in there they'll
also<00:02:22.410> use<00:02:22.560> dead<00:02:23.100> trees<00:02:23.580> sometimes<00:02:24.209> so<00:02:24.510> they'll

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
also use dead trees sometimes so they'll

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.840 
also use dead trees sometimes so they'll
you<00:02:25.080> know<00:02:25.170> they<00:02:25.380> might<00:02:25.530> excavate<00:02:26.370> ACORN

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
you know they might excavate ACORN

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
excavate the cavities themselves they

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.539 
excavate the cavities themselves they
just<00:02:57.989> live<00:02:58.290> in<00:02:58.410> them<00:02:58.500> they<00:02:58.620> nest<00:02:58.829> in<00:02:58.980> them<00:02:59.070> so

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
just live in them they nest in them so

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.370 
just live in them they nest in them so
up<00:02:59.940> in<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.239> canopy<00:03:00.630> up<00:03:00.750> higher<00:03:00.989> where<00:03:01.230> the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
up in the canopy up higher where the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.190 
up in the canopy up higher where the
sun's<00:03:01.620> hitting<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:01.980> tops<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.400> trees

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
sun's hitting the tops of the trees

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.720 
sun's hitting the tops of the trees
there's<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.410> little<00:03:04.680> more<00:03:04.799> insect<00:03:05.190> activity<00:03:05.310> up

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
there's a little more insect activity up

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.100 
there's a little more insect activity up
there<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.239> birds<00:03:06.480> will<00:03:06.660> tend<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.930> be

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
there so the birds will tend to be

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.910 
there so the birds will tend to be
feeding<00:03:07.350> up<00:03:07.560> there

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920

but<00:03:08.790> another<00:03:09.000> interesting<00:03:09.510> phenomenon<00:03:10.019> about

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
but another interesting phenomenon about

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.390 
but another interesting phenomenon about
a<00:03:10.410> redwood<00:03:10.829> forest<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:12.209> Redwood<00:03:12.959> is<00:03:13.400> the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
a redwood forest is the Redwood is the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.590 
a redwood forest is the Redwood is the
bark<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:15.079> highly<00:03:16.079> tannic<00:03:16.820> so<00:03:17.820> that's<00:03:17.970> filled

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
bark is highly tannic so that's filled

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.020 
bark is highly tannic so that's filled
with<00:03:18.690> tannic<00:03:19.110> acid<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:20.100> there<00:03:20.760> aren't<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.000> lot

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
with tannic acid and there aren't a lot

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.289 
with tannic acid and there aren't a lot
of<00:03:21.299> insects<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.019> liked<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.950> real<00:03:23.430> strongly

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
of insects that liked it real strongly

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.420 
of insects that liked it real strongly
acidic<00:03:24.959> bark<00:03:25.410> like<00:03:25.620> this

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
acidic bark like this

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.929 
acidic bark like this
so<00:03:26.640> it<00:03:26.939> again<00:03:27.950> creates<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:29.040> situation<00:03:29.189> where<00:03:29.760> we

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
so it again creates a situation where we

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.479 
so it again creates a situation where we

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.510 
here maybe these here are bark beetle
exit<00:05:05.099> holes<00:05:05.419> okay<00:05:06.419> so<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.139> beetles<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:08.159> adult

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
exit holes okay so the beetles the adult

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.890 
exit holes okay so the beetles the adult
beetles<00:05:08.909> come<00:05:09.120> and<00:05:09.300> lay<00:05:09.389> their<00:05:09.539> eggs<00:05:09.720> in<00:05:09.840> the

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
beetles come and lay their eggs in the

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.399 
beetles come and lay their eggs in the
bark<00:05:10.139> the<00:05:10.979> the<00:05:11.430> larvae<00:05:12.300> borer<00:05:12.630> either<00:05:12.990> into

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:13.409 
bark the the larvae borer either into

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:14.839 
bark the the larvae borer either into
the<00:05:13.500> canyon<00:05:13.889> of<00:05:13.979> the<00:05:14.039> tree<00:05:14.280> if<00:05:14.400> it's<00:05:14.520> a<00:05:14.610> wood

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
the canyon of the tree if it's a wood

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.629 
the canyon of the tree if it's a wood
boring<00:05:15.120> beetle<00:05:15.300> or<00:05:15.510> behind<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:15.960> bark<00:05:16.169> they<00:05:16.860> go

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
boring beetle or behind the bark they go

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.159 
boring beetle or behind the bark they go
through<00:05:17.880> their<00:05:18.000> life<00:05:18.150> cycle<00:05:18.599> and<00:05:18.720> pupate

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
through their life cycle and pupate

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.290 
through their life cycle and pupate
inside<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:20.010> tree<00:05:20.220> and<00:05:20.490> then<00:05:20.699> the<00:05:20.880> adults

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
inside the tree and then the adults

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.570 
inside the tree and then the adults
emerge<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:22.650> so<00:05:23.280> when<00:05:23.460> you<00:05:23.580> see<00:05:23.849> a<00:05:23.880> nice<00:05:24.240> clean

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.270 
emerge and so when you see a nice clean
round<00:05:26.580> hole<00:05:27.120> or<00:05:27.449> an<00:05:27.599> oval<00:05:28.020> hole<00:05:28.289> with<00:05:28.830> a<00:05:28.860> sharp
