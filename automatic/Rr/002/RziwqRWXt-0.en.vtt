going to do a little twist tight and you

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.370 
going to do a little twist tight and you
will<00:01:49.500> secure<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.220> did<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.520> with<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:51.380> small

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
will secure it I did it with a small

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.170 
will secure it I did it with a small
butterfly<00:01:52.649> flip<00:01:53.159> or<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> medium<00:01:53.790> butterfly

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
butterfly flip or a medium butterfly

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.069 
butterfly flip or a medium butterfly
clip<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:55.460> guess<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:57.060> depends<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.689> how<00:01:57.840> thick

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
clip I guess it it depends on how thick

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.139 
clip I guess it it depends on how thick
your<00:01:58.200> hair<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.399> really<00:01:59.880> thick<00:02:00.119> and

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
your hair is if it's really thick and

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.170 
your hair is if it's really thick and
long<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:01.229> could<00:02:01.380> secure<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.890> first<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:02.640> a

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
long you could secure it first with a

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.469 
long you could secure it first with a
pony<00:02:03.509> tail<00:02:03.600> holder<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.290> then<00:02:05.180> twist<00:02:06.180> from

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
pony tail holder and then twist from

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.940 
pony tail holder and then twist from

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.530 

because<00:02:14.099> some<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.550> fat<00:02:14.910> coming<00:02:15.180> comes
