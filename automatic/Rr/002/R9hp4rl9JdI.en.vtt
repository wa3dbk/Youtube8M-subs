00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
and practice this is the quarter easy

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.479 
and practice this is the quarter easy
stick<00:01:48.599> is<00:01:49.050> to<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.289> 20<00:01:49.619> mil<00:01:49.770> one<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:49.950> believe<00:01:50.130> yet

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:50.489 
stick is to the 20 mil one I believe yet

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:52.249 
stick is to the 20 mil one I believe yet
I<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.940> 25<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.599> all<00:01:51.690> for<00:01:51.840> bigger<00:01:51.989> bites

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
I do 25 is all for bigger bites

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.460 
I do 25 is all for bigger bites
basically<00:01:53.190> all<00:01:53.280> you're<00:01:53.429> doing<00:01:54.080> put<00:01:55.080> biting

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
basically all you're doing put biting

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.830 
basically all you're doing put biting
you<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:55.890> loan<00:01:56.489> up<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.360> flicking<00:01:57.750> your

you in there loan up and flicking your

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.109 
you in there loan up and flicking your
wrist<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.860> where<00:01:59.099> they<00:01:59.220> go<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.459> more<00:01:59.580> you<00:01:59.940> put

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119

wrist and where they go the more you put
into<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.720> further<00:02:01.229> leg<00:02:01.410> and<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.709> can<00:02:01.830> also

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
into it the further leg and you can also

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.040 
into it the further leg and you can also
have<00:02:02.069> double<00:02:02.310> hand<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.670> as<00:02:02.759> well<00:02:03.050> literally

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
have double hand it as well literally

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.350 
have double hand it as well literally
above<00:02:04.470> your<00:02:04.619> head<00:02:04.800> and<00:02:05.550> basically<00:02:05.970> it's<00:02:06.270> like

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
a cast was slightly different you have

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.760 
a cast was slightly different you have
to<00:02:08.729> play<00:02:08.940> at<00:02:09.209> first<00:02:09.509> find<00:02:10.440> out<00:02:10.560> what<00:02:10.649> you're

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
to play at first find out what you're

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.260 
to play at first find out what you're
doing<00:02:10.950> with<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.400> there's<00:02:11.880> a<00:02:11.970> body's

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
doing with it and there's a body's

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.089 
doing with it and there's a body's
fitting<00:02:12.480> there<00:02:12.569> nice<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.720> easily<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:14.010> they

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
fitting there nice and easily and they

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.119 
fitting there nice and easily and they
go<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.280> long<00:02:14.489> way<00:02:14.640> up<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.500> 90<00:02:16.500> hundred<00:02:16.860> yards

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
go a long way up to 90 hundred yards

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.470 
go a long way up to 90 hundred yards
maybe<00:02:17.280> if<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:17.549> could<00:02:17.700> look<00:02:17.819> at<00:02:17.939> item<00:02:18.329> will

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
maybe if you could look at item will

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.780 
maybe if you could look at item will
boil<00:02:18.659> go<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.200> good<00:02:19.379> distance

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
boil go a good distance

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.700 
boil go a good distance

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
other ways of introducing bait you've

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.010 
other ways of introducing bait you've
got<00:02:22.830> sports<00:02:23.130> as<00:02:23.400> well<00:02:23.720> according<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.870> great

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
got sports as well according to a great

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.000 
got sports as well according to a great
range<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.350> sports<00:02:25.530> you've<00:02:25.680> got<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.860> large

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
range of sports you've got the large

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.830 
range of sports you've got the large
skyline<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> spot<00:02:27.000> which<00:02:27.690> ideal<00:02:28.020> for<00:02:28.200> particles

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
skyline a spot which ideal for particles

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.410 
skyline a spot which ideal for particles
medium<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.960> long<00:02:31.110> range<00:02:31.940> they<00:02:32.940> also<00:02:33.120> did<00:02:33.360> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
medium to long range they also did the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.850 
medium to long range they also did the
sky<00:02:33.660> radio<00:02:34.020> which<00:02:34.170> is<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.320> slightly<00:02:34.770> more

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
sky radio which is a slightly more

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.790 
sky radio which is a slightly more
tapered<00:02:35.370> design<00:02:35.870> again<00:02:36.870> nice<00:02:37.020> nice<00:02:37.260> nose<00:02:37.560> cone

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
tapered design again nice nice nose cone

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.290 
tapered design again nice nice nose cone
on<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.010> front<00:02:38.250> there<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.000> goes<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.150> little

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
on the front there and it goes a little

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.060 
on the front there and it goes a little
bit<00:02:39.420> further<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:39.930> one<00:02:40.080> it's<00:02:40.350> tapered<00:02:40.950> at<00:02:41.040> the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
bit further that one it's tapered at the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.290 
bit further that one it's tapered at the
back<00:02:41.250> there<00:02:41.460> so<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.670> does<00:02:41.820> fly<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.090> lot

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
back there so it does fly a lot

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.390 
back there so it does fly a lot
straighter<00:02:42.630> in<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.930> air<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.770> closing<00:02:44.220> work

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
straighter in the air the closing work

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.390 
straighter in the air the closing work
or<00:02:44.790> really<00:02:45.390> banging<00:02:45.810> out<00:02:45.980> with<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.010> few<00:02:47.220> boards

or really banging out with a few boards
and<00:02:47.580> as<00:02:47.700> well<00:02:47.820> they<00:02:47.910> did<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.120> mini<00:02:48.330> spod<00:02:48.660> that's

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
and as well they did a mini spod that's

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.140 
and as well they did a mini spod that's
ideal<00:02:49.620> for<00:02:49.650> just<00:02:49.950> little<00:02:50.220> closing<00:02:50.610> work<00:02:50.790> will

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150
