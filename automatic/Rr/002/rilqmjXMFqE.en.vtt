 the first great expansion of assassin's 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.330
 creed 4 white which widens the 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.110
 game experience offering us a 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.110
 new campaign 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.789
 for an ear starting with the plot 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.470
 of this dlc the main novelty is that 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.120
 history puts us on this occasion in 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.949
 the role of atemporal who like 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.260
 you will remember the ones that you have played until 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.120
 104 is a colored character that 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.949
 he found freedom as a pirate in the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.339
 boat already inhabited where was our 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:46.000
 second on board we will focus on the 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.670
 storm 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.250
 we will not take those pieces it would still be 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.739
 worse than the Templars and want to 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.330
 This option now stand 15 years 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.010
 after the event in the congo 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.690
 original in a period in which you have to 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.760
 the same has become a right-handed 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.530
 assassin of the brotherhood and captaincy to his 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.510
 own boat to that after having 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.640
 suffered an unexpected shipwreck in 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.470
 costs of living your priorities generate 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.180
 being from this moment its greatest 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.780
 motivation fight against slavery 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.780
 8 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.050
 for this the game maintains a 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.420
 development similar to that seen in 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.800
 main campaign locating us again 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.840
 in an open world that we can 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.850
 explore with total freedom although the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.470
 The size of the map is not as large as 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.470
 the one with 64 black flag 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.770
 covers only about one 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.990
 dozen locations in the Indian 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.940
 Westerners that we could visit like this 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.450
 as a city to the full port 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.450
 the prince 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.300
 in this sense when advance 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.070
 history we will have to overcome the 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.350
 missions that are indicated to us 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.520
 with most of them focused on 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.520
 the liberation of slaves 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.310
 I owe you the mine 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.720
 it is generally one more plot 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.460
 adult in which something less than 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.590
 importance to the world of piracy and 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.540
 the pillage to show us now a 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.580
 vision of the sufferings that were seen 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.770
 in a time that was also very 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.690
 marked by slavery how is that 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.690
 the templars allow all this 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.240
 I'm just the messenger 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.060
 but before judging me 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.250
 remember that templar gold also 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.320
 buy the freedom of men like you 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.850
 although of course as this saga we 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.770
 have accustomed will be the player 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.330
 who decides when to carry out each 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.130
 one of the missions being able 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.260
 entertain us with many other tasks 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.630
 Optional secondary how to find 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.610
 treasure chests help people hunt 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.800
 animals search among the remains of a 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.020
 shipwreck using a TV camera or 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.420
 even free slave plantations 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.780
 being this last a novelty of this 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.780
 dlc 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.600
 meanwhile passing the gameplay the 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.700
 mechanics does not present hardly any 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.890
 change keeping the same system of 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.810
 combat already known both when we go to 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.850
 10 as in naval battles the 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.680
 which also still have enough 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.810
 role in itself right now we are 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.520
 propose above all to address ships that 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.770
 they transport slaves in order to 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.450
 release them 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.450
 it's not a trick you can go 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.730
 in the same way as it happened with edward 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.560
 Quinn our new protagonist has 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.540
 the possibility of improving your boat and 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.430
 also go acquiring improvements for 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.350
 weapons and other objects being a 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.850
 peculiarity that many of them do not 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.650
 they are bought with money but they 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.490
 will depend on the number of slaves that 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.490
 we have released 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.129
 neither 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.450
 nothing happens 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.000
 also like it has two weapons 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.040
 main different from edward 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.660
 having a machete which will be our 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.000
 best ally in the melee and 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.830
 this little bit being treated in this case of 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.540
 a powerful firearm with which 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.800
 we can kill at close range to 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.800
 several enemies at once 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.670
 otherwise we tell you about this 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.260
 expansion keeps the same super 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.750
 dubbing the Spanish of all the voices 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.120
 that already had the original game being 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.330
 the duration of the adventure of about 5 or 7 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.330
 hours 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.010
 although this time varies depending on 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.080
 how much we want to devote ourselves to explore 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.950
 the scenarios and iu in search of all 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.750
 the secrets 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.920
 Maybe our goals coincide 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.850
 now 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.800
 what do you want slave recruits in short 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.600
 and freedom is a dlc that we 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.790
 will allow to continue expanding the activation 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.860
 of 'assassin's creed' 4 offering us 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.540
 a new campaign that expands is much 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.760
 smaller than the original in its 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.650
 duration and possibilities and impresses 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.660
 a quite different story and very 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.640
 emotional as well as the attractiveness that 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.650
 supposes being able to take control of one of 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.650
 the characters in the game with more charisma 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.169
 To all this we must add that 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.479
 went on sale for a price of only 9 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.430
 with 99 euros while those who have 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:39.190
 acquired the season pass may be 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.440
 download for free 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.270
 however on the negative side we believe 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.280
 that maybe it has been released too 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.560
 soon since they have not even happened 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.840
 two months since assassin's creed 4 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.640
 black hat in stores and even less 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.790
 even in the case of new consoles 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.790
 generation 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.630
 this can leave some players with 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.250
 the feeling of being paying for a 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.080
 additional content that you have developed 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.210
 well in advance that 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.290
 perfectly could have been included in 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.290
 series in the game itself
