long time of hard work yeah and i hope i

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.460 
long time of hard work yeah and i hope i
really<00:04:36.280> wanted<00:04:36.880> them<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.240> add<00:04:37.389> like<00:04:37.690> I<00:04:37.900> I

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
really wanted them to add like I I

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.860 
really wanted them to add like I I
features<00:04:39.310> like<00:04:39.699> wrinkles<00:04:40.120> and<00:04:40.300> all<00:04:40.389> that<00:04:40.630> but

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
features like wrinkles and all that but

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.170 
features like wrinkles and all that but
they<00:04:41.020> don't<00:04:41.229> have<00:04:41.319> that<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:41.889> in<00:04:42.580> season<00:04:43.000> two

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
they don't have that and in season two

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.920 
they don't have that and in season two
Bonnie<00:04:43.660> actually<00:04:44.410> has<00:04:45.160> less<00:04:45.789> wrinkles<00:04:46.479> than

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
Bonnie actually has less wrinkles than

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.379 
Bonnie actually has less wrinkles than
jihad<00:04:47.500> in<00:04:47.680> 400<00:04:48.190> days<00:04:48.340> which<00:04:48.610> is<00:04:48.729> so<00:04:48.910> weird<00:04:48.940> but

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
jihad in 400 days which is so weird but

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.730 
jihad in 400 days which is so weird but
I<00:04:49.419> guess<00:04:49.660> they<00:04:49.780> wanted<00:04:50.020> to<00:04:50.110> make<00:04:50.229> her<00:04:50.380> younger

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
I guess they wanted to make her younger

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.320 
I guess they wanted to make her younger
because<00:04:51.069> of<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:51.310> fact<00:04:51.490> that<00:04:51.639> you<00:04:51.940> know<00:04:51.970> it's

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
because of the fact that you know it's

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.650 
because of the fact that you know it's
Bonnie<00:04:52.539> um<00:04:53.310> it<00:04:54.310> she's<00:04:54.729> a<00:04:54.759> character<00:04:55.030> she<00:04:55.449> needs

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
Bonnie um it she's a character she needs

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.350
