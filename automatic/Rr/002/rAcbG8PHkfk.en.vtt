00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.460 
flogging camera so or I have this one
that<00:04:53.910> I'm<00:04:54.030> filming<00:04:54.389> with<00:04:54.419> now<00:04:54.810> but<00:04:55.139> it<00:04:55.260> doesn't

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
that I'm filming with now but it doesn't

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.129 
that I'm filming with now but it doesn't
out<00:04:55.830> of<00:04:56.040> focus<00:04:56.250> so<00:04:56.729> it's<00:04:57.000> a<00:04:57.360> bit<00:04:57.780> frustrating

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
out of focus so it's a bit frustrating

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.100 
out of focus so it's a bit frustrating
but<00:04:59.130> I<00:04:59.190> figure<00:04:59.639> it<00:04:59.790> out<00:04:59.880> somehow<00:05:00.210> I<00:05:00.510> think<00:05:00.960> I

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
but I figure it out somehow I think I

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.200 
but I figure it out somehow I think I
covered<00:05:01.380> everything<00:05:01.680> now<00:05:02.190> that's<00:05:02.850> hope<00:05:03.030> so
