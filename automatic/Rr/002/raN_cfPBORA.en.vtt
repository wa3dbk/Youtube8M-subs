00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.550 
this but I've tied the same pound test
so<00:02:03.090> many<00:02:03.270> different<00:02:03.630> makers<00:02:03.930> on<00:02:04.110> fluorocarbon

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
so many different makers on fluorocarbon

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.230 
so many different makers on fluorocarbon
line<00:02:04.890> versus<00:02:05.369> monofilament<00:02:05.820> and

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:46.169 
to play the fish around as easy

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:48.470 
to play the fish around as easy
so<00:02:46.620> keep<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.219> pressure<00:02:47.489> on<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.909> fish<00:02:48.060> keep

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
so keep the pressure on the fish keep

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.839 
so keep the pressure on the fish keep
the<00:02:48.689> bend<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.049> that<00:02:49.079> rod<00:02:49.439> and<00:02:49.709> you'll<00:02:50.519> never

line is a choice now the cons with
braided<00:04:20.190> line<00:04:20.370> is<00:04:20.609> that<00:04:21.239> there<00:04:21.479> is<00:04:21.719> no<00:04:22.320> stretch

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
braided line is that there is no stretch

braided line is that there is no stretch
okay<00:04:23.490> even<00:04:23.969> though<00:04:24.029> I<00:04:24.090> said<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.389> can<00:04:24.570> be<00:04:24.690> a<00:04:24.719> good

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
okay even though I said it can be a good

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.520 
okay even though I said it can be a good
thing

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
thing

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.200 
thing
you're<00:04:25.620> playing<00:04:25.889> the<00:04:26.100> fish<00:04:26.310> you<00:04:26.580> have<00:04:26.820> to<00:04:26.850> keep

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
you're playing the fish you have to keep

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.300 
you're playing the fish you have to keep
the<00:04:27.450> pressure<00:04:27.720> on<00:04:27.870> them<00:04:28.230> non-stop

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
the pressure on them non-stop

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.540 
the pressure on them non-stop
if<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.820> bend<00:04:30.060> comes<00:04:30.330> out<00:04:30.510> of<00:04:30.630> that<00:04:30.660> rod<00:04:31.550> just

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
if the bend comes out of that rod just

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.909 
if the bend comes out of that rod just
in<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.790> split<00:04:33.480> second<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.260> can<00:04:34.440> lose<00:04:34.680> that

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
in the split second you can lose that

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.850 
in the split second you can lose that
fish<00:04:35.190> because<00:04:35.669> uh<00:04:36.020> there's<00:04:37.020> no<00:04:37.230> stretch<00:04:37.560> and

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
fish because uh there's no stretch and

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.620 
fish because uh there's no stretch and
the<00:04:38.040> stretch<00:04:38.070> really<00:04:38.760> helps<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:39.270> play<00:04:39.450> the

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
the stretch really helps you play the

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.200 
the stretch really helps you play the
fish<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.169> when<00:04:41.010> you<00:04:41.100> use<00:04:41.340> in<00:04:41.520> braided<00:04:41.850> line<00:04:42.000> and

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
fish so when you use in braided line and

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.510 
fish so when you use in braided line and
you<00:04:42.270> do<00:04:42.450> hook<00:04:42.660> up<00:04:42.840> with<00:04:43.020> one<00:04:43.230> Bulldog<00:04:44.130> them<00:04:44.340> in

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
you do hook up with one Bulldog them in

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.820 
you do hook up with one Bulldog them in
your<00:04:45.150> tackle<00:04:45.900> should<00:04:46.050> be<00:04:46.139> strong<00:04:46.440> enough<00:04:46.470> your

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
your tackle should be strong enough your

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.260 
your tackle should be strong enough your
line<00:04:47.070> is<00:04:47.220> definitely<00:04:47.370> going<00:04:47.790> to<00:04:47.850> be<00:04:47.910> strong

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
line is definitely going to be strong

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.690 
line is definitely going to be strong
enough<00:04:48.300> so<00:04:49.080> don't<00:04:49.740> try<00:04:49.980> to<00:04:50.010> play<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.370> fish<00:04:50.550> out

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
enough so don't try to play the fish out

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.610 
enough so don't try to play the fish out
too<00:04:50.910> much<00:04:51.090> when<00:04:51.300> using<00:04:51.480> braided<00:04:51.930> line<00:04:52.110> that's

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
too much when using braided line that's

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.770 
too much when using braided line that's
it's<00:04:53.040> not<00:04:53.130> very<00:04:53.430> sporting<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:54.120> use<00:04:54.389> braided

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
it's not very sporting to use braided

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.780 
it's not very sporting to use braided
line<00:04:54.930> in<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.139> first<00:04:55.350> place<00:04:55.650> but<00:04:55.919> it's<00:04:56.130> more<00:04:56.730> of

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
line in the first place but it's more of

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.010 
line in the first place but it's more of
a<00:04:56.910> tournament<00:04:57.210> line<00:04:57.540> and<00:04:57.810> when<00:04:57.900> you're

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
a tournament line and when you're

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.140 
a tournament line and when you're
yanking<00:04:58.230> fish<00:04:58.560> out<00:04:58.770> of<00:04:58.800> hard<00:04:59.460> structure<00:04:59.970> so

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
yanking fish out of hard structure so

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.970 
yanking fish out of hard structure so
Bulldog<00:05:00.540> am<00:05:00.690> in<00:05:00.780> anyways<00:05:01.169> reel<00:05:01.410> is<00:05:01.560> faster<00:05:01.890> you

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
Bulldog am in anyways reel is faster you

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.900 
Bulldog am in anyways reel is faster you
can<00:05:02.160> bring<00:05:02.820> that<00:05:02.880> fish<00:05:03.240> in<00:05:04.340> another<00:05:05.340> flaw<00:05:05.850> is

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
can bring that fish in another flaw is

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.390 
can bring that fish in another flaw is
it's<00:05:06.180> highly<00:05:06.570> visible<00:05:07.169> so<00:05:07.860> if<00:05:08.070> you're<00:05:08.220> just

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400

use it again but I would say switch it

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.089 
use it again but I would say switch it
out<00:06:48.430> after<00:06:48.819> two<00:06:48.970> seasons<00:06:49.210> of<00:06:49.479> not<00:06:49.659> use<00:06:50.099> lying

out every season so for beginners

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:56.580 
out every season so for beginners
monofilament<00:06:55.270> is<00:06:55.569> probably<00:06:55.900> the<00:06:56.050> best<00:06:56.289> line
