talk a little bit about a problem that
I've<00:00:13.630> had<00:00:13.660> since<00:00:14.080> day<00:00:14.320> one<00:00:14.559> with<00:00:14.769> both<00:00:15.040> my

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
I've had since day one with both my

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.920 
I've had since day one with both my
Tomos<00:00:15.969> bikes<00:00:16.240> here<00:00:16.540> and<00:00:16.710> that's<00:00:17.710> the<00:00:17.830> issue<00:00:18.279> of

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
Tomos bikes here and that's the issue of

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.880 
Tomos bikes here and that's the issue of
burned<00:00:19.930> light<00:00:20.470> bulbs<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:22.720> is<00:00:22.930> the<00:00:23.109> the<00:00:23.650> tone

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
burned light bulbs this is the the tone

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.519 
burned light bulbs this is the the tone
most<00:00:24.100> OEM<00:00:24.940> light<00:00:25.300> bulb<00:00:25.570> for<00:00:25.779> the<00:00:25.810> headlamp<00:00:26.260> I

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
most OEM light bulb for the headlamp I

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.450 
most OEM light bulb for the headlamp I
think<00:00:27.430> it's<00:00:27.580> a<00:00:27.670> VA<00:00:28.539> 20<00:00:29.199> D<00:00:29.439> I<00:00:29.680> think<00:00:29.800> it's<00:00:30.130> I

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
think it's a VA 20 D I think it's I

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.920 
think it's a VA 20 D I think it's I
don't<00:00:30.670> know<00:00:30.850> if<00:00:30.939> that's<00:00:31.090> a<00:00:31.150> catalog<00:00:31.539> number<00:00:31.810> or

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
don't know if that's a catalog number or

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.720 
don't know if that's a catalog number or
a<00:00:31.960> part<00:00:32.230> number<00:00:32.260> or<00:00:32.500> a<00:00:32.650> style<00:00:33.070> of<00:00:33.280> bulb<00:00:33.519> I'm

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
a part number or a style of bulb I'm

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.860 
a part number or a style of bulb I'm
sure<00:00:33.910> it's<00:00:34.059> the<00:00:34.150> style<00:00:34.390> be<00:00:34.660> a<00:00:34.690> 20<00:00:35.379> D<00:00:36.059> 12<00:00:37.059> volt<00:00:37.300> 35

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
sure it's the style be a 20 D 12 volt 35

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.710 
sure it's the style be a 20 D 12 volt 35
watt<00:00:40.409> yeah<00:00:41.409> these<00:00:42.220> aren't<00:00:42.460> easy<00:00:42.640> to<00:00:42.790> find<00:00:42.879> you

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
watt yeah these aren't easy to find you

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.210 
watt yeah these aren't easy to find you
can't<00:00:43.960> I<00:00:44.049> mean<00:00:44.199> you<00:00:44.290> can<00:00:44.440> get<00:00:44.559> them<00:00:44.680> online<00:00:44.860> if

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
can't I mean you can get them online if

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.500 
can't I mean you can get them online if
you<00:00:45.309> want<00:00:45.339> to<00:00:45.580> but<00:00:45.699> you<00:00:45.760> can't<00:00:45.940> walk<00:00:46.059> into<00:00:46.330> your

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
you want to but you can't walk into your

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.969 
you want to but you can't walk into your
local<00:00:46.690> retailer<00:00:47.260> and<00:00:47.530> find<00:00:47.769> these<00:00:47.920> things

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:47.979 
local retailer and find these things

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:51.600 
local retailer and find these things
they're<00:00:48.370> just<00:00:48.549> not<00:00:48.640> available<00:00:48.790> and<00:00:50.370> both<00:00:51.370> my

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
they're just not available and both my

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.240 
they're just not available and both my
rides<00:00:51.879> burn<00:00:52.269> them<00:00:52.510> pretty<00:00:52.839> frequently<00:00:53.530> I<00:00:53.890> have

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
rides burn them pretty frequently I have

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.920 
rides burn them pretty frequently I have
a<00:00:54.280> feeling<00:00:54.610> it's<00:00:55.030> due<00:00:55.239> to<00:00:55.449> a<00:00:55.479> couple<00:00:55.780> of

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
a feeling it's due to a couple of

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.630 
a feeling it's due to a couple of
factors<00:00:56.290> one<00:00:56.559> being<00:00:56.589> a<00:00:56.949> large<00:00:57.280> amounts<00:00:57.580> of

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
factors one being a large amounts of

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.840 
factors one being a large amounts of
vibration<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.989> yeah<00:00:59.140> my<00:00:59.409> Street<00:00:59.979> mate<00:01:00.129> a<00:01:00.369> 55

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
vibration the yeah my Street mate a 55

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.549 
vibration the yeah my Street mate a 55
clutch<00:01:01.119> is<00:01:01.299> pretty<00:01:01.479> much<00:01:01.600> finished<00:01:01.989> so<00:01:02.199> the

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
clutch is pretty much finished so the

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.320 
clutch is pretty much finished so the
engine<00:01:02.830> vibrates<00:01:03.159> a<00:01:03.250> lot<00:01:03.430> and<00:01:03.820> that

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
engine vibrates a lot and that

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.349 
engine vibrates a lot and that
ultimately<00:01:04.930> vibrates<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.799> headlamp<00:01:06.190> and<00:01:07.030> it

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:07.359 
ultimately vibrates the headlamp and it

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:10.020 
ultimately vibrates the headlamp and it
fails<00:01:07.600> I'd<00:01:07.960> say<00:01:08.229> I<00:01:08.259> go<00:01:08.560> through<00:01:08.799> one<00:01:09.070> a<00:01:09.490> month

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
fails I'd say I go through one a month

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.749 
fails I'd say I go through one a month
maybe<00:01:10.420> one<00:01:10.719> get<00:01:11.560> six<00:01:11.979> weeks<00:01:12.039> out<00:01:12.369> of<00:01:12.399> the<00:01:12.520> bulb

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
maybe one get six weeks out of the bulb

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.209 
maybe one get six weeks out of the bulb
and<00:01:13.170> because<00:01:14.170> it<00:01:14.229> has<00:01:14.320> two<00:01:14.500> filaments<00:01:14.979> I<00:01:15.039> can

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
and because it has two filaments I can

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:16.529 
and because it has two filaments I can
flip<00:01:15.399> from<00:01:15.579> high<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:15.880> low<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.270> then<00:01:16.329> just

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
flip from high to low and then just

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.270 
flip from high to low and then just
reposition<00:01:17.140> and<00:01:17.320> just<00:01:17.469> always<00:01:17.619> I<00:01:17.829> always<00:01:18.009> run

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
reposition and just always I always run

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.590 
reposition and just always I always run
it<00:01:18.399> with<00:01:18.520> in<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.759> same<00:01:18.909> position<00:01:19.270> anyway<00:01:19.539> so

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
it with in the same position anyway so

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.279 
it with in the same position anyway so
it's<00:01:19.869> like<00:01:19.990> you<00:01:20.049> have<00:01:20.079> two<00:01:20.259> bulbs<00:01:20.469> on<00:01:20.679> one<00:01:20.909> now

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
it's like you have two bulbs on one now

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.300 
it's like you have two bulbs on one now
changing<00:01:23.289> light<00:01:23.439> bulbs<00:01:23.560> isn't<00:01:23.979> you<00:01:24.219> know

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
changing light bulbs isn't you know

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.099 
changing light bulbs isn't you know
terribly<00:01:24.820> difficult<00:01:25.030> it's<00:01:25.659> just<00:01:25.719> a<00:01:25.929> nuisance

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
terribly difficult it's just a nuisance

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:28.620 
terribly difficult it's just a nuisance
to<00:01:26.380> have<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:26.619> do<00:01:26.740> so<00:01:26.979> often<00:01:27.429> part<00:01:28.390> of<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.509> other

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
to have to do so often part of the other

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.779 
to have to do so often part of the other
reason<00:01:28.899> why<00:01:29.020> my<00:01:29.229> Street<00:01:29.530> mate<00:01:29.710> burns<00:01:30.280> bulbs<00:01:30.670> is

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
reason why my Street mate burns bulbs is

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.080 
reason why my Street mate burns bulbs is
that<00:01:30.969> my<00:01:31.590> battery<00:01:32.590> is<00:01:32.679> completely<00:01:33.249> dead<00:01:33.490> it's

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
that my battery is completely dead it's

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.590 
that my battery is completely dead it's
the<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:35.759> dealer<00:01:36.759> put<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.179> battery<00:01:37.450> and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
the the the dealer put the battery and

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.209 
the the the dealer put the battery and
wrong<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.079> caps<00:01:38.289> were<00:01:38.530> loose<00:01:38.829> and<00:01:39.039> then

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
wrong and the caps were loose and then

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.179 
wrong and the caps were loose and then
the<00:01:39.700> acid<00:01:40.090> evaporated<00:01:41.020> or<00:01:41.109> whatever<00:01:41.350> battery

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
the acid evaporated or whatever battery

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.489 
the acid evaporated or whatever battery
went<00:01:42.369> dry<00:01:42.609> so<00:01:43.509> I'm<00:01:43.630> running<00:01:43.749> my<00:01:44.020> street<00:01:44.320> mate

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:44.499 
went dry so I'm running my street mate

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:45.779 
went dry so I'm running my street mate
electrical<00:01:45.009> system<00:01:45.340> right<00:01:45.429> now<00:01:45.490> with<00:01:45.759> no

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
battery and the battery acts like a

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.059 
battery and the battery acts like a
damper<00:01:49.659> or<00:01:49.689> like<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.049> suspension<00:01:50.530> for<00:01:50.979> your

alternator<00:01:55.509> and<00:01:56.729> ultimately<00:01:57.729> that<00:01:57.939> helps<00:01:58.240> to

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
alternator and ultimately that helps to

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.090 
alternator and ultimately that helps to
protect<00:01:58.479> your<00:01:58.689> bulbs<00:01:59.049> so<00:01:59.259> that's<00:01:59.619> part<00:01:59.979> of<00:02:00.009> the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
protect your bulbs so that's part of the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.739 
protect your bulbs so that's part of the
reason<00:02:00.249> why<00:02:00.369> that<00:02:00.579> is<00:02:00.850> not<00:02:01.149> working<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:01.600> much

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
reason why that is not working so much

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:04.830 
reason why that is not working so much
on<00:02:01.960> my<00:02:02.429> my<00:02:03.429> Street<00:02:03.700> mate<00:02:03.880> but<00:02:04.420> I'm<00:02:04.539> also

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
on my my Street mate but I'm also

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
on my my Street mate but I'm also
burning<00:02:05.049> bulbs<00:02:05.409> on<00:02:05.560> my<00:02:05.679> LX<00:02:06.039> now

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
burning bulbs on my LX now

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.720 
burning bulbs on my LX now
that's<00:02:08.040> probably<00:02:08.460> dude<00:02:08.970> mostly<00:02:09.540> to<00:02:10.730> extended

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
that's probably dude mostly to extended

down long hills at full throttle you're

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.280 
down long hills at full throttle you're

gonna get more current being produced by

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.440 
gonna get more current being produced by
your<00:02:19.440> alternator<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.270> you<00:02:21.270> know<00:02:21.360> if

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
your alternator and that you know if

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.150 
your alternator and that you know if
your<00:02:21.600> bulbs<00:02:21.870> can't<00:02:22.110> take<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.500> they're<00:02:22.980> just

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
your bulbs can't take it they're just

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.780 
your bulbs can't take it they're just
gonna<00:02:23.280> they're<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.700> gonna<00:02:23.850> go<00:02:24.470> these<00:02:25.470> are

gonna they're just gonna go these are

gonna they're just gonna go these are
11:57<00:02:26.820> long<00:02:27.600> life<00:02:27.900> by<00:02:28.260> GE<00:02:29.360> these<00:02:30.360> are<00:02:30.600> what<00:02:30.720> I'm

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
11:57 long life by GE these are what I'm

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.440 
11:57 long life by GE these are what I'm
using<00:02:30.990> in<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.320> tail<00:02:31.620> lamp<00:02:31.890> right<00:02:32.130> now<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.610> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
using in the tail lamp right now and the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.090 
using in the tail lamp right now and the
problem<00:02:33.720> is<00:02:33.810> my<00:02:33.960> running<00:02:34.350> light<00:02:34.530> always<00:02:34.740> burns

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
problem is my running light always burns

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.590 
problem is my running light always burns
my<00:02:35.340> stop<00:02:35.580> light<00:02:35.790> never<00:02:36.000> burns<00:02:36.270> because<00:02:36.450> I

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
my stop light never burns because I

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.770 
my stop light never burns because I
hardly<00:02:36.840> ever<00:02:36.960> use<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.620> know<00:02:37.710> stop<00:02:37.980> light<00:02:38.780> but

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
hardly ever use you know stop light but

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.360 
hardly ever use you know stop light but
the<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.500> long<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:42.350> running<00:02:43.350> light<00:02:43.530> goes<00:02:44.130> all

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
the the long the running light goes all

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.110 
the the long the running light goes all
the<00:02:44.400> time<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:46.110> go<00:02:46.410> through<00:02:46.440> these<00:02:47.000> once<00:02:48.000> a

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
the time so I go through these once a

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.350 
the time so I go through these once a
week<00:02:48.300> roughly<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.350> say<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.160> it's<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:51.000> real<00:02:51.150> pain

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
week roughly I say and it's a real pain

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.420 
week roughly I say and it's a real pain
in<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.600> ass<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.560> there's<00:02:52.740> not<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.920> lot<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.310> can

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
in the ass and there's not a lot you can

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.150 
in the ass and there's not a lot you can
do<00:02:53.610> about<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:54.060> but<00:02:54.720> what<00:02:55.050> I<00:02:55.080> plan<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.470> do<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:56.130> to

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
upgrade both the headlamp and tail lamp

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.710 
upgrade both the headlamp and tail lamp
assemblies<00:02:59.160> in<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.850> near<00:03:00.000> future<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.540> just

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
assemblies in the near future and I just

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.910 
assemblies in the near future and I just

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
in a future video because this is a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.259 
in a future video because this is a
problem<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.100> I<00:03:11.160> know<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.370> lot<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:11.610> other<00:03:11.820> Tomos

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
problem that I know a lot of other Tomos

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.110
