00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.839
 at the end of the season was super active with europol 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:26.210
 so that's good super positive and then% now% and ballack this start of 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.109
 season 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.829
 so that my goal to pass the bac 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.039
 the safer% to a month of games and almost not played 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.010
 so here I start a little bit played percent and the first cemac 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.270
 week of training completes his course 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.610
 not the bac it's not great, but mourinho hoping to see it 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.480
 and at least catch up what 6% 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.460
 if it went wrong 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.680
 after the bac I decided to stop until then years for November 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.970
 December how much to prepare for the world championships 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.970
 I will quote 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.540
 this is the first time in the world I want to be 100% in the country 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.700
 100% 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.010
 in e without having for 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.940
 the evil and run this loss 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.220
 a little time 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.930
 I'm here to be replaced by a physical celi either training or 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.930
 recovery 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.980
 % it's a bit scary my 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.210
 yes we have some kind 6% we are never safe from a big injury 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.240
 contracted the country 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.590
 but percent 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.830
 it is 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.830
 I'm sitting there one day I'm hurt 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.070
 well I will start studying them again I will be like a student some 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.070
 standard damage 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.750
 such the beginning of the season with six trains benji not played the first two games 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.380
 on bobo and ensures romagne chen 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.380
 behind it is very hard at 100% with a talented child 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.319
 so we lost 3 007 lebrun who played 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:16.310
 So here is 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.230
 it's a logical defeat on them then on romagna 20% knows that 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.059
 it's a really very homogeneous team with them their Chinese 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.249
 and percent health abdel teens 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:27.549
 so it's a very good team 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.609
 we only lost two 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.399
 finally we knew we had no right to the mistake if we wanted to win then 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.579
 europe 1 small know what they did with us we counted the 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:36.699
 defeat 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:40.179
 elana the show the masses were on an idea received by m 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:41.599
 at istres 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.949
 so for the moment we are we have not gone so far from 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:49.540
 to create a surprise since chains matignon shot killing sign 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:50.559
 input 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:54.779
 I lost 3 surfer girl in the third match to lead two years so that's it 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.989
 it's a little disappointment but 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.840
 not pass our main goal of being champion what is consequent 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.339
 not me 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:04.969
 it's impossible to get out of hens so to focus on the 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.969
 championship 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:12.679
 first year senior bof it's been a long time since I threw myself into 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:15.099
 the future seniors 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.189
 the offer is very few junior competitions was champion of europe and 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:19.769
 World Champion 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.819
 so it does not change much and apartments on the past and its 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.899
 junior competitions to give me consistency of victories 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:29.249
 so I looked for all seniors 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:32.239
 I am not at all worried about franÃ§ois 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.249
 the Lord 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:37.249
 really very impressive that here 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:45.549
 goodbye without this Tuesday at 5,500 euros in sailing 17 gold 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.819
 so what place the best suite offered with the suede protour 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:55.900
 and per cent has apologized since various games of three 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.700
 and the list is long what is said 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.810
 and we finally have a goal to see to qualify 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.289
 the escape of the day the barings 

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:05.069
 junior world cup% 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.979
 when we will play percent 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:10.669
 a little not in themselves to the last of the chicken pond and last of 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.729
 produce anything said his last last world champion 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:16.729
 junior world competition I have less finish 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.900
 so his website has left a lot of positive feedbacks only 

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:27.800
 it's really fun all the trouble I get 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.240
 who is this time everyone but it's not obvious that he likes a lot 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.520
 of 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.599
 7 2% 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.439
 after others 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:38.090
 60 and 80 visits per day 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.280
 so to have on my account to call laurent my grandmother 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.699
 those who take care of me it was really very present 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.860
 so in the room it's him for us 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.250
 only glow of his two trades 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.920
 so football that's really nice I get to know and learn 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.590
 that we are for many 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.199
 % and the tgv that came out soon after how you train - with which 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.900
 material especially 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.449
 % 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.499
 how does it go to unicef 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:09.739
 we see all these questions for 100th c repetitive born right always 

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:10.809
 very interesting 

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:15.129
 how is analysis first because we are a group of the player 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.370
 and about a dozen seniors 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:24.119
 colas the meaning where we often served with the lord 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.949
 here we often start with service sewers with less than 2 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.360
 at 3 sessions a day 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.809
 it is stated that three times a week 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:35.219
 a good material 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:39.029
 I play fast ended up pigs made yesterday j 05 for 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:42.270
 runners to cuba is strong 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.729
 but in addition to projects often young girls 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.129
 I will ask how it happened 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:52.129
 % and more details 

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:57.559
 Why 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.550
 I would like to be massaged spie company 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:34.800
 to apologize my first personal sponsor that's the cuff my 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.330
 Father 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.990
 who negotiated his 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.169
 in e for mosson would be easy for us to us funds to be able to continue my 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.580
 progression at the international level and at the French level
