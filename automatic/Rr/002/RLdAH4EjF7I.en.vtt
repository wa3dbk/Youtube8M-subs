00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:09.059
 not just the hdblog group news 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:12.269
 of the main smartphone crimes spy j 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.400
 let's see the esperia tablet 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.300
 tablet s the name is pretty much it 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.760
 same to do it last year with more or 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.850
 less the same line but a hardware 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.740
 new a lower thickness is a line 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.760
 certainly original and very pleasant 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.390
 left side we find the connector for 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.690
 Headphones A detail is almost a 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.270
 hitch connector for the micro sd for 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.530
 the for the sd excuses normal then 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.039
 truly rare classic on a tablet 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.750
 on the other side ignition and volume 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:52.739
 compared to last year's it 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.420
 thickness is lower than the fold at 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.820
 folding is different and does not take up space 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.199
 useless like last year 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.220
 ice cream sandwich and of course we are 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.270
 grateful live front camera and tegra 3 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.799
 and with a processor 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.460
 at the rear the camera that is 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.960
 covered by the ancient that it takes 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.549
 at the software level we find practically 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.729
 the same customizations that 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.119
 we found on the xperia range who you 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.190
 we saw in the previous video with 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.200
 lots of options and applications for the 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.299
 multimedia management and management of 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.490
 all the programs as we see the 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.560
 system moves very well we don't have 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.330
 big problems in saying that 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.970
 We really started functions 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.350
 ravenna and all empty in the part 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.729
 lower we find the possibility of 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.740
 manage sony tv through 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.530
 remote control application e 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.380
 integrated and that is the atlas pop up fruit 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.650
 within the interface rose 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.530
 also you can manage 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.560
 through this key in the fair ur and all 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.840
 a series of floating applications that 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.130
 allow us to manage write notes 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.130
 a whole series of 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.620
 calculations is a whole series of operations 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.479
 easy and intuitive always within reach 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.550
 hand because this option is present in 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.670
 in fact all applications remain 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.460
 in the lower part very pretty 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.520
 ability to manage images 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.310
 through a very gallery 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.140
 performing as we really are 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.110
 lots of hundreds of photos that come 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.370
 loaded extremely fast but 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.760
 it's very pleasant 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:36.560
 the fact that with a slight pinch 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.210
 we manage to have more management 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.410
 less big than all the up thumbnails 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.540
 to arrive 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.940
 the only photo and go to dubai is that 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.890
 that the photo was not very little 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.840
 particularly in high definition though 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.250
 we can safely manage the 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.680
 our friends 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.370
 the possibility remains of managing the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.799
 images already paid on the maps with 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.489
 in the map and all the photos we have 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:04.909
 the world should also be able to manage 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.519
 it's very pretty because the clouds one 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:10.760
 once the zoom is greater they disappear 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.020
 with this look very funny 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.190
 because scene 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.560
 album 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.010
 I saw shoot music albums then 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.250
 the music part is also managed this is 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.590
 a very good way different from the 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.380
 last year's model with the 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.750
 ability to listen to music through 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.140
 the back boxes with a great one 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.020
 level sound level so the 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.340
 audio power is not exaggerated but the 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.340
 quality is very this 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 in the options and then possible to go to 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.650
 see a whole series of 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.690
 settings that allow us to 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:02.720
 share music to others 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.910
 dlna tv speakers all sorts of 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.260
 settings regarding the 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:12.350
 legalization of three selected or from 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.510
 customize and the same thing for how much 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.430
 regards the management of video films 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.470
 which can be managed through 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.340
 the integrated application we go to 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.340
 see a video 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.960
 display is a full hd hd but anyway 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.630
 very resolute and it definitely shows 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.030
 good with regards to the widget part 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.130
 there are various more custom widgets 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.650
 all the classic experience widgets 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.080
 I will go to the text in the simple at the level of 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.190
 system memory we have seen how it is 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:01.450
 present the normal sd but lived on 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:04.420
 16 gigabyte tablet of which about ten 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.620
 about available recreated are more or 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.050
 less occupied by the system 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.950
 in short, it turned out to be the store 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.380
 point 0.3 will still be arriving with the 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:17.100
 40.4 upgradeable to the right a simple 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:22.980
 last thing we go to see a game 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:25.660
 that we have in the menus 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.310
 obviously thd games in part simon 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.530
 tegra 3 allows you to take advantage of the 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.710
 potential and everyday both a 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:35.590
 earth that not on the tablet in a manner 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:39.180
 definitely appreciate this is a 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:43.410
 a title that we don't know much about 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:47.090
 we have been using it for a few minutes in the 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.090
 charge I make 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:06:00.229
 the surround is very good because it has 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:02.629
 a stereo sound effect here we go 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:05.929
 to see our environment we can 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:11.749
 try to get out 

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:15.110
 Bersani gather their own hands 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:17.589
 very simple but let's see what we can 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.589
 do 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.640
 leave the game performance gaming 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.660
 none is maximum for us but also sees 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.280
 the browser 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:35.800
 the connection should be active 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.800
 nice custom keyboard 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:43.710
 obviously the game performance does not 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.229
 maximum san because we don't know how to play 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.240
 very good but thanks for sure is definitely 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:52.430
 a crowd of platforms for what 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.430
 concerns the chemical web browsing 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.889
 you find it pleasant even in the 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.600
 display rotations we have no 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:03.960
 kind of problem reading is a lot 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.699
 good zoom works without problems 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.530
 even the prince 

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:08.699
 we see has no kind of 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.820
 slowdown 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:14.690
 we can go and see all the 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.690
 news of fa 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.419
 yes I would say quite well in hand is a 10 

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:21.889
 inches is not among the heaviest in 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:24.499
 another lighter though 

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:26.599
 to be a 10 inch it has no weight 

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:29.409
 excessive that weighs down precisely the 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:29.409
 utilization 

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:35.350
 obviously the support with 

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:38.040
 base sony has also provided for 

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:40.480
 enclosures with integrated keyboard 

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.780
 the keys are practically very fine 

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.940
 because I'm under pressure and I 'm not 

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:48.040
 singles that can be exploited 

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.510
 to manage me the tablet and all the 

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:53.490
 functions not only by the director of 

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.490
 hdblog with the premier al
