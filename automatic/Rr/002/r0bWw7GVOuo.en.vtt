00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:10.389
 We are going to need a sea bass two potatoes 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:14.350
 that we have cut them into thin slices 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:17.260
 a green pepper a green onion 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:22.200
 chopped garlic a glass of white wine 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:25.870
 salt black pepper and olive oil 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.820
 with the spine of the sea bass and the head 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.050
 I'm making a caldito for later 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.210
 incorporate over the fish when 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.490
 put in the oven is simply the 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.650
 thorn on the head some parsley leaves 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.290
 of a little bit of salt the first thing that 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.420
 let's do is take a tad of 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.420
 oil in a baking dish 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.330
 we incorporate the vegetables 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.350
 we mix everything 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.909
 Y 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.650
 we put 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.650
 the potato slices 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.840
 let's pour another stream of olive oil 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.840
 this is a bit older 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.670
 and the glass of wine 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.780
 with all this we're going to go to the oven 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.630
 preheated to 200 degrees and we're going to 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.850
 let it go by 15 minutes 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.330
 well look how the potatoes have been 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.240
 that we've had 20 minutes like you 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.400
 I said before a little less 15 18 we 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.360
 we had to soften a 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.479
 little bit here we have 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.210
 the glass of broth that we have made with 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.610
 fish bones and with the head and 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.569
 Now what we are going to do is 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.569
 spice up life 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.680
 they are weapons 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.700
 we are going to guide 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.640
 to the source 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.170
 we take the mouse the olive oil 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.180
 and the glass of broth 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.550
 now we only have 15 minutes left 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.870
 oven and cleared 15 minutes later 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.600
 the sea bass is made to look what aspect 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.170
 magnificent has as ultimate cap what 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.849
 we are going to give 11 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.849
 a little bit of chopped parsley 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.890
