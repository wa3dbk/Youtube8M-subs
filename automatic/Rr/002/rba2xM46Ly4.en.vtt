F for them to see so if that's F on this

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.410 
F for them to see so if that's F on this
line<00:01:10.110> what's<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.070> note<00:01:11.250> right<00:01:11.490> above<00:01:11.790> F<00:01:12.090> and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
line what's the note right above F and

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.560 
line what's the note right above F and
they'll<00:01:13.049> say<00:01:13.260> G<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.890> that's<00:01:14.729> how<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:14.970> write<00:01:15.270> G

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
and then you can just write in a G on on

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.300 
and then you can just write in a G on on
space<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.390> show<00:01:18.570> them<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.799> amazing

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
space for to show them this is amazing

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.460 
space for to show them this is amazing
you'll<00:01:20.549> be<00:01:20.700> you'll<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.180> amazed<00:01:21.479> how<00:01:21.990> quickly

you'll be you'll be amazed how quickly

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.760 
you'll be you'll be amazed how quickly
the<00:01:23.130> kids<00:01:23.369> will<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.729> oh<00:01:23.939> yeah<00:01:24.689> if<00:01:25.439> that's

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
the kids will be like oh yeah if that's

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.520 
the kids will be like oh yeah if that's
F<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.549> next<00:01:26.939> thing<00:01:27.060> must<00:01:27.299> be<00:01:27.360> G<00:01:27.689> what<00:01:28.380> you're

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
F and next thing must be G what you're

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.990 
F and next thing must be G what you're
doing<00:01:28.829> for<00:01:29.009> them<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.280> breaking<00:01:29.670> down<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
doing for them is breaking down the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.120 
doing for them is breaking down the
logic<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.900> that's<00:01:31.140> why<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.409> makes<00:01:31.590> sense<00:01:31.890> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
logic but that's why it makes sense and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.859 
logic but that's why it makes sense and
if<00:01:32.520> they<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.790> understand<00:01:33.180> why<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.420> makes<00:01:33.630> them

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
if they can understand why it makes them

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.499 
if they can understand why it makes them
it<00:01:34.320> will<00:01:34.500> make<00:01:34.680> sense<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.979> them<00:01:35.189> every<00:01:35.490> time<00:01:35.640> so

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
it will make sense to them every time so

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.359 
it will make sense to them every time so
you've<00:01:36.630> got<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.200> F<00:01:37.350> guy<00:01:37.619> he's<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.220> love<00:01:38.340> with

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
you've got the F guy he's in love with

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.819 
you've got the F guy he's in love with
that<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.570> take<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.869> G<00:01:40.079> guy<00:01:40.259> he's<00:01:40.680> in

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that then you take the G guy he's in

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.469 
that then you take the G guy he's in
love<00:01:40.950> with<00:01:40.979> chief<00:01:41.310> he's<00:01:41.790> still<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.270> love<00:01:42.299> with

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
and that's right here on the keyboard so

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.860 
and that's right here on the keyboard so
again<00:02:10.500> if<00:02:10.800> that's<00:02:11.310> G<00:02:11.790> what's<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.540> note<00:02:12.720> right

above G

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.910

and<00:02:13.860> they'll<00:02:14.100> be<00:02:14.190> like<00:02:14.340> eh<00:02:15.650> exactly<00:02:16.650> that's

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
and they'll be like eh exactly that's

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.300 
and they'll be like eh exactly that's
how<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.160> write<00:02:17.460> a<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.420> staff<00:02:19.040> that's<00:02:20.040> the

how you write a on the staff that's the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.250 
how you write a on the staff that's the
basic<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.790> logic<00:02:21.150> if<00:02:21.360> they<00:02:21.720> can<00:02:21.930> get<00:02:22.050> that

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
basic of the logic if they can get that

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.410 
basic of the logic if they can get that
and<00:02:22.470> they'll<00:02:22.650> be<00:02:22.770> able<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.010> get<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.340> then<00:02:23.880> then

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
and they'll be able to get it then then

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.820 
and they'll be able to get it then then
you're<00:02:24.570> doing<00:02:24.720> well<00:02:24.960> you're<00:02:25.410> doing<00:02:25.440> really

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
you're doing well you're doing really

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
well and they'll be able to understand

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.030 
well and they'll be able to understand
where<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.930> notes<00:02:28.110> fit<00:02:28.320> on<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.530> staff<00:02:28.770> and
