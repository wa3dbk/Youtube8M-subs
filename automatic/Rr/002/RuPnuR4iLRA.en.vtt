00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.820

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.789
 today is Saturday you are seeing this the 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.720
 Monday I think and today is Saturday and I was 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.869
 before editing 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.400
 the blog that you saw on Sunday 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.859
 good and it turns out that I said block number 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.689
 33 and really the 33 in which I climbed 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.189
 Saturday then never clearer with the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.129
 blog numbers I'm pretty bad 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.230
 so nothing and Saturday and just 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:39.480
 present the new ferrari logo 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.300
 ferrari the f 14 t as ferrari 14 2 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.820
 close the 2014 turbo not be the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.350
 initials and the truth that has a 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.600
 tremendous pint on all the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.000
 presentation has been quite original 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.360
 because right and in format in format 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.370
 movie in trailer format 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.550
 and I plugged in the radio I was expecting a sale 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.130
 so more casual more traditional et cetera 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.699
 and no no no no is very well and nobody 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.830
 I'm here in explain why with this 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.010
 from formula one the formula one for me 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.810
 it's like a passion not like me 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.270
 The apple world is passionate too 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.270
 I am very passionate about formula 1 is my hobby 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.970
 I did not throw a lot of time playing 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.250
 playing formula 1 leagues with good 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.540
 friends of money for example the name 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.130
 of pes lightning de jesus de de as 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.229
 turbo in order people who were in it 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.360
 has hooked with them how good they are 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.890
 he misses and then also people from 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.260
 the other community where I was 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.250
 subsequently messi 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.890
 pablete si a la bocayna in the end there is a 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.380
 not macaque lot there are many people and 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.510
 the truth is that I miss those bites 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.100
 I'm going to see if I can save I can 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.800
 buy a back and this computer finally 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.440
 dedicate it to play and return again to 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.170
 have those bites with these people and nothing 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.270
 the truth that otherwise I do not know if it is 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.590
 this month this truth I do not know if it's me 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.300
 will be seeing very well with this light 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.310
 because I'm staying with ambient light 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.830
 If I understood, maybe the lamp would 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.150
 I would look better but good that said 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.280
 what am I thinking maybe resume 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.900
 the podcast that I had of formula perhaps 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.400
 Well, what happens is that my problem is 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.960
 the time it takes time to do 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.550
 all the things I want to do now 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.460
 I understand when people say wow is 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.720
 that I do not have time and such and that is 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.700
 true when you do not have time it does not give you 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.170
 time if I have to do so many videos 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.180
 for you five for one then manage 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.470
 everything that goes with why 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.890
 behind the videos you have to manage 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.080
 many things was not 5 x 1 point 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.819
 bring my formula 1 podcast and it's going to 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.160
 be very useful especially be regulated now 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.060
 that many things come but good I'm going to 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.569
 try it I will try it for those who 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.670
 you want or you are fans of the formula 1 os 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.550
 I will leave in the description of this 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.170
 video my link to my formula podcast 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.180
 cannes is worth where you can hear it in 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.360
 explain though if you look in haiti 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.130
 formula cast voucher formula cast as 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.800
 Solanas as a formula but instead of 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.459
 put the 1 put a cast the termination 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.020
 of podcast and you will find it is worth 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.550
 I say that I encourage you to listen to the 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.350
 first episodes are from the season 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.140
 past some face chronicles that I did 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.720
 and nothing to the best organ of this year like this 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.370
 Let's see how to at least try 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.110
 be more regular and another thing that also 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.580
 I have there in mind more than anything because 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.140
 yes it is true that I do not know many 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.600
 channels and if I do I would be of the 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.160
 first to do something similar and 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.490
 many times they say that the one who hits 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.430
 First 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.930
 ghana and I think it could be a good 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.730
 idea maybe to open a channel of 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.830
 formula 1 news formula 1 in 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.530
 Spanish there are many technology channels 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.150
 and why not venture into a channel 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.890
 formula yet so it's true no no with 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.870
 the same dedication that they put as 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.920
 by an audience for one is my life now 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.020
 not the same but the fact of being able to make a 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.240
 video a week or something for the channel 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.440
 of formula one that you would like 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.910
 know about all of you who are here 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.950
 because I could use the fact very well 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.560
 to start with a channel especially if 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.420
 can go to that channel also people who 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.380
 follow this not because it's like inertia 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.280
 not well baixa and you would like a channel like that 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.020
 logically that channel would not affect the 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.840
 content of these to which I already 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.850
 I'll manage to me as it was but but you 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.239
 formula 1 fits well, leaving the 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.100
 comments and nothing and today is Saturday today 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.480
 I see Irene finally wanted to see her 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.820
 he is writing to me besides 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.380
 and I said yesterday in yesterday's look I said that 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.610
 was going to go to the English court but it turns out 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.070
 that the English court does not have the 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.510
 promotion when you have the promotion 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.610
 of the 'day without VAT' but not in the 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.340
 apple products so in the end I'm not going 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.590
 to be able to buy the ipad before I 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.240
 they will give euro and I spent I spent the money 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.990
 also to see what happens to the birds 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.970
 and little birds are there in the 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.790
 cage and the suckers do not want to go out to 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.010
 see me only know how to send when I am 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.340
 recording and then when I go out to see them 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.930
 they get there in the nest and there's no more 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.650
 who bothers you 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.650
 little birds 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:04.020
 in my case there has its nest there they have 

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:06.900
 also your swing swings 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.889
 your palm leaves 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.800
 their food that by the way already have the 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:16.020
 they have good food and nothing 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.030
 said I was already saying that I do not know 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.710
 What am I going to buy from a monkey? 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.780
 nothing and saving I think that woman is what 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.419
 better so we 'll see nothing 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.190
 I tell afternoon as I bought and 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.690
 nothing on my part I will not do the blog 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.120
 not much longer either because I like them 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.500
 do these kinds of blogs maybe if you can 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.600
 doing blogs like that are much better 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.490
 because with an interesting subscriber but 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.020
 there are always times in the day when 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.639
 I want to talk to someone not about 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.770
 something in particular and I think I'm going to 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.479
 take advantage of blogs to vent on 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.400
 I do not know what you think about this 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.930
 format at least that way you see blogs like this 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.630
 I do not say goodbye, the camera is 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.220
 already in 'red numbers' with the battery like this 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.680
 and nobody to load the camera I hope that you 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.330
 I liked it again and you can not give anything 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.000
 I like that he is welcome and I 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.700
 dismissal and I hope you have a happy day 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.640
 and see you tomorrrow 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.320
 this blog I guess it will go up at 8 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.270
 so that it sticks of the we raise them tomorrow 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.780
 because it would not be the only video of the day 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.970
 today we see you tomorrow chau pincha 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.140
 in these windows to see our 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.140
 recommended videos
