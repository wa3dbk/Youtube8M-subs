taking the glass right to the very

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.660 
taking the glass right to the very
perimeter<00:00:59.390> it's<00:01:00.079> just<00:01:00.409> display<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.159> then<00:01:01.460> no

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
perimeter it's just display and then no

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.969 
perimeter it's just display and then no
display<00:01:02.089> that's<00:01:02.510> it<00:01:02.750> I<00:01:02.899> mean<00:01:02.930> you<00:01:03.769> are<00:01:03.949> just

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
display that's it I mean you are just

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.399 
display that's it I mean you are just
completely<00:01:05.440> consumed<00:01:06.440> by<00:01:06.799> by<00:01:07.520> that<00:01:07.759> image

of<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.260> new<00:03:09.380> iMac<00:03:10.570> when<00:03:11.570> you<00:03:11.690> first<00:03:12.080> see<00:03:12.320> the

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
of the new iMac when you first see the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.449 
of the new iMac when you first see the
mouse<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:13.040> could<00:03:13.670> not<00:03:13.700> be<00:03:14.120> any<00:03:14.300> simpler<00:03:15.340> but<00:03:16.340> I

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
mouse it could not be any simpler but I

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.160 
mouse it could not be any simpler but I
love<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.730> way<00:03:16.850> that<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:17.120> scales<00:03:17.600> from<00:03:17.930> being

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
love the way that it scales from being

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.330 
love the way that it scales from being
something<00:03:18.470> that<00:03:18.860> is<00:03:18.980> that<00:03:19.880> apparently<00:03:20.300> simple

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
something that is that apparently simple

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.640 
something that is that apparently simple
so<00:03:22.340> actually<00:03:22.640> being<00:03:23.110> really<00:03:24.110> remarkably

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
so actually being really remarkably

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.490 
so actually being really remarkably
sophisticated<00:03:24.890> I<00:03:25.670> mean<00:03:25.850> we<00:03:26.600> finally<00:03:27.290> figured

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
sophisticated I mean we finally figured

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.310 
sophisticated I mean we finally figured
out<00:03:27.739> how<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.280> take<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:29.600> multi-touch

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
out how to take the multi-touch

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.449 
out how to take the multi-touch
technology<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:31.660> implement<00:03:32.660> it<00:03:32.750> on<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.870> mouse

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
technology and implement it on a mouse

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.580 
technology and implement it on a mouse
it's<00:03:34.459> still<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:34.820> point<00:03:35.209> and<00:03:35.329> click<00:03:35.420> mouse<00:03:35.780> but

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
it's still a point and click mouse but

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.460 
it's still a point and click mouse but
now<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:37.370> entire<00:03:37.880> top<00:03:38.510> surface<00:03:39.019> of<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.260> mouse

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
now the entire top surface of the mouse

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.590 
now the entire top surface of the mouse
is<00:03:39.769> is<00:03:40.430> basically<00:03:40.700> it's<00:03:41.150> a<00:03:41.180> multi<00:03:41.480> touch

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
is is basically it's a multi touch

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.900 
is is basically it's a multi touch
sensor<00:03:42.170> this<00:03:42.860> is<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.130> smartest<00:03:43.489> Mouse<00:03:43.670> we've

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
sensor this is the smartest Mouse we've

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.030 
sensor this is the smartest Mouse we've
ever<00:03:44.060> made<00:03:44.239> there's<00:03:45.019> a<00:03:45.110> chip<00:03:45.440> inside<00:03:45.769> that

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
ever made there's a chip inside that

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.340 
ever made there's a chip inside that
acts<00:03:46.220> essentially<00:03:46.790> as<00:03:46.880> a<00:03:46.910> brain<00:03:47.209> as<00:03:47.510> you<00:03:48.170> put

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
acts essentially as a brain as you put

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.900 
acts essentially as a brain as you put
your<00:03:48.470> fingers<00:03:48.799> on<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.040> top<00:03:49.280> shelf<00:03:49.310> it<00:03:49.730> can

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
your fingers on the top shelf it can

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.569 
your fingers on the top shelf it can
determine<00:03:50.510> where<00:03:51.140> they're<00:03:51.380> located<00:03:51.590> how<00:03:52.310> many

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
determine where they're located how many

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.090 
determine where they're located how many
you<00:03:52.820> have<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.360> through<00:03:53.989> your<00:03:54.170> gesture<00:03:54.709> your

in<00:04:44.850> a<00:04:45.000> consumer<00:04:45.660> computer<00:04:48.350> we're<00:04:49.350> really

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
in a consumer computer we're really

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.830 
in a consumer computer we're really
proud<00:04:49.950> of<00:04:50.010> this<00:04:50.280> imac<00:04:50.729> especially<00:04:51.540> in<00:04:51.660> terms

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
environmental story is it's never over

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.060 
environmental story is it's never over
because<00:04:57.330> as<00:04:57.510> you<00:04:57.720> learn<00:04:57.960> how<00:04:58.560> to<00:04:58.590> remove

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
because as you learn how to remove

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.730 
because as you learn how to remove
toxins<00:04:59.940> you<00:05:00.450> change<00:05:00.750> your<00:05:00.900> focus<00:05:01.050> from<00:05:01.410> doing

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
toxins you change your focus from doing

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.040 
toxins you change your focus from doing
that<00:05:01.919> too<00:05:02.669> how<00:05:03.330> do<00:05:03.389> we<00:05:03.540> build<00:05:03.750> this<00:05:03.990> thing

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
that too how do we build this thing

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.830 
that too how do we build this thing
really<00:05:04.760> energy-efficient<00:05:05.760> and<00:05:05.850> not<00:05:06.479> just<00:05:06.690> to

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
really energy-efficient and not just to

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.290 
really energy-efficient and not just to
meet<00:05:07.020> energy<00:05:07.260> star<00:05:07.830> but<00:05:08.550> to<00:05:08.669> go<00:05:08.790> way<00:05:08.970> beyond

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
meet energy star but to go way beyond

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.580 
meet energy star but to go way beyond
that<00:05:10.700> we<00:05:11.700> take<00:05:11.910> a<00:05:11.940> life<00:05:12.300> cycle<00:05:12.600> view<00:05:13.080> of<00:05:13.320> the

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
that we take a life cycle view of the

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.190 
that we take a life cycle view of the
carbon<00:05:13.950> footprint<00:05:14.370> and<00:05:14.550> you<00:05:15.479> find<00:05:15.750> that<00:05:15.960> the

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
carbon footprint and you find that the

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.770 
carbon footprint and you find that the
customers<00:05:16.950> use<00:05:17.160> of<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.430> computer<00:05:17.639> has<00:05:18.510> the

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
customers use of the computer has the

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.170 
customers use of the computer has the
biggest<00:05:19.020> impact<00:05:19.410> on<00:05:20.100> its<00:05:20.310> carbon<00:05:20.580> footprint

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
biggest impact on its carbon footprint

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.080 
biggest impact on its carbon footprint
and<00:05:21.450> so<00:05:22.139> in<00:05:22.440> this<00:05:22.830> product<00:05:23.370> we<00:05:23.550> really<00:05:23.850> drove

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
and so in this product we really drove

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.360 
and so in this product we really drove
at<00:05:24.330> energy<00:05:24.750> efficiency<00:05:25.410> and<00:05:25.530> that's<00:05:26.070> where<00:05:26.280> we

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
at energy efficiency and that's where we

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.430 
at energy efficiency and that's where we
have<00:05:26.520> a<00:05:26.550> tremendous<00:05:26.880> advantage<00:05:27.570> because<00:05:28.110> we

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
have a tremendous advantage because we

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.920 
have a tremendous advantage because we
not<00:05:28.950> only<00:05:28.979> build<00:05:29.729> the<00:05:29.940> hardware<00:05:30.090> but<00:05:30.660> we<00:05:30.750> also

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
not only build the hardware but we also

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.800 
not only build the hardware but we also
create<00:05:31.500> the<00:05:31.650> software<00:05:32.100> so<00:05:32.820> we're<00:05:33.450> able<00:05:33.600> to

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
create the software so we're able to

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.719 
create the software so we're able to
really<00:05:34.350> manage<00:05:34.560> power<00:05:34.979> and<00:05:35.220> throughout<00:05:35.520> the

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
really manage power and throughout the

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.480 
really manage power and throughout the
system<00:05:35.960> extensively<00:05:36.960> we<00:05:37.800> even<00:05:38.010> power<00:05:38.220> down

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
system extensively we even power down

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.510 
system extensively we even power down
processors<00:05:39.150> between<00:05:39.600> keystrokes<00:05:40.320> and<00:05:40.560> I

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
processors between keystrokes and I

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.940 
processors between keystrokes and I
think<00:05:41.820> we're<00:05:42.030> really<00:05:42.240> unique<00:05:42.810> in<00:05:43.020> how<00:05:43.620> far

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
think we're really unique in how far

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.980 
think we're really unique in how far
we've<00:05:44.250> pushed<00:05:44.610> that<00:05:45.180> hardware<00:05:45.690> and<00:05:45.840> software

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
we've pushed that hardware and software

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.640 
we've pushed that hardware and software
technology<00:05:46.830> to<00:05:46.950> do<00:05:47.160> that

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.980 

with<00:05:51.250> this<00:05:51.370> imac<00:05:51.759> we<00:05:52.150> took<00:05:52.300> everything<00:05:52.600> so

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
with this imac we took everything so

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.620 
with this imac we took everything so

much further the displays are bigger the

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.020 
much further the displays are bigger the
