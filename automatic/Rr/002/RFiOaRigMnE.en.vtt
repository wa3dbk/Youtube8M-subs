00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.380

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.189
 That's why he's here today. 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.380
 if you have not seen or heard of lacazette 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.150
 down here in the video description has 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.369
 a playlist for you to access the video 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.769

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.210
 to vote who I should bring to the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.619
 our next level 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.690
 I have not defined yet if I will bring 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.670
 reviews fortnightly or weekly 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.950
 For now I will always bring 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.840
 I might try to test many 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.760
 players over five to fifteen is 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.440
 of course, counting on the support of 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.870
 you even if you have 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.969
 players to test me let us 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.860
 comments so I can put it in the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.469
 polls next we can get 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.399
 At 500 light it will be the maximum so I 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.680
 I'm counting on you 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.690
 it's quick and painless it costs nothing 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.190
 only you click the joinha positive button o 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.050
 because it helps the channel a lot 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.180
 grow and also to disseminate the video and 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.700
 Not only that, it does not show all your affection. 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.350
 The studio will also be on the channel. 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.390
 tested in these almost that I rode the league 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.400
 English you can go there all 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.380
 other players and now it's possible 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.080
 observe some studio data that it 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.860
 has 83 games and plays in the group is English 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.729
 has 89 beat of 82 finalization 69 of 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.520
 pass and dribble 81 to 29 defense and 70 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.770
 physique has two bad leg stars 4 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.470
 stars plus dribbling feints was 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.500
 bought by 57 thousand on playstation 4 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.890
 is costing between 55 and 60 homes in 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.950
 playstation and also between 40 and 45 cases 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.960
 in xbox already moving to bids 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.000
 Goller act I decided to changed the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.159
 style of doing saw me and no more 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.009
 bring you those more technical levels 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.960
 thus addressing which is the number of 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.200
 end fitting face impulse thing 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.210
 of the type but rather a more personal opinion 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.880
 what I feel about using the 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.469
 player beauty good a booth 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.780
 I have to say he's floor 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.820
 same people he plays too much 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.619
 until today he had only played against him 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.899
 had felt all the power of the karaÃ­ 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.050
 always in shock when I saw him 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.690
 on my opponent's team right there 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.060
 It's the old game and you have the opportunity. 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.440
 used and poor of opponents had 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.990
 in the first game I did rabbit 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.490
 I played three games emitting 7 goals in 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.890
 match that is what you see 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.440
 this thing and he catches the ball at the tip 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.620
 it takes in speed in the control of 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.780
 ball hits the goalkeeper's post and moves it 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.060
 I wanted to speak quickly about the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.580
 points of the attackers who are 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.040
 pace pass dribble and physical finishing 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.780
 I will not logically address the defense 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.460
 because he is an attacker then already 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.160
 starting with the rhythm 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.110
 the guy is just fantastic has 89 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.860
 pace of the players faster than 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.350
 already tried 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.970
 I really like babu but I have to 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.240
 tell you that I'm over and over 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.090
 taking the space of greater respect there 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.040
 by one of the biggest players there in fifa 15 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.750
 that I have tested so far the guy has 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.670
 a really good pace is really 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.640
 fantastic you put it in front with him 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.700
 It is difficult for the player to pick up 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.640
 after you gave the initial sprint in the 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.280
 Finishing the face is total killer of 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.860
 left leg does not have right leg only 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.080
 Use to get on the bus but left 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.930
 Old man, it's good that there's something. 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.970
 in him that he always tries to bring 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.060
 ball to the left to hit and avoid 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.340
 usually hit right at the palace and 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.709
 I really liked his pass. He has a 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.380
 decent pass for a player of the 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.720
 attack has almost 70 of pass achieved 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.100
 take a few steps to where sugary 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.050
 get in the face of the goal 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.209
 in no need to say anything dribble has a 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.340
 ball control and it is excellent 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.170
 welcomed with him you change direction 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.510
 very easy you're going to one side 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.610
 can go to the other very quickly 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.050
 the guy does not know what to do 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.630
 He has to be very clever in the 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.850
 marking not to take the goals and already in 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.670
 I did not find the strongest player 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.950
 I already tested lukaku type bt that the student 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.030
 Like I do not think it's too much. 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.340
 good head 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.680
 but he can handle the message he can 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.480
 to win some players in the physical 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.580
 is the strongest guy in the world but also 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.260
 He is not weak, he can not turn around. 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.970
 very well in the physical part 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.100
 lastly only by addressing the issue of 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.880
 ball stopped with him he has 83 of 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.350
 fault power 68 of curves 75 of 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.210
 feather 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.340
 He's not the right guy for the ball. 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.040
 stop but anyway you can see and 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.720
 I hit the penalty with him emitted go 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.420
 then just to finish as says to 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.610
 You sure do, he will. 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.710
 investment you can buy it and without 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.030
 fear is one of the best 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.730
 pa is one of the best if not the best 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.870
 player I've tested so far here 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.730
 in fifa 15 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.860
 I really enjoyed using this player 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.470
 even thinking about keeping him in the club though 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.330
 he is a little affection for you 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.980
 who is watching the video please 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.710
 you can leave feedback on what 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.660
 You think the style of vile is too much. 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.430
 important here since it will set there 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.110
 How will I bring the next ones? 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.380
 you like a more technical thing 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:08.290
 approaching point by point showing each 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.330
 kind of a straight play where I say there 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.520
 synchronized with them, let us 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.410
 feedback or if you 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.360
 They like something more messy like 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.710
 I did here I was putting the 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.050
 background I went well in my personal opinion 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.120
 about what he thought about the player 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.430
 You also leave it there so I know what 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.470
 It's better for you, it's good for you. 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.660
 start if you can let lilic 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.060
 It will be very welcome, the story. 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.460
 really with you we will reach the 500 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.080
 likes and if you're new here first time 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.790
 He also came there like what he saw 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.110
 you can click the subscribe button 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.310
 so as not to lose any of my 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.890
 Beauty videos 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.200
 then that's it and here is the review 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.360
 overflow big monster - this plays too 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.310
 boy can buy without fear together 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.620
 engineer there that you are sure 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.420
 will be very happy with this attacker and 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.180
 I'm going to stay here a big hug 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:58.180
 because I went 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:01.120
 and he even knocked over the ferry which is a 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.039
 player very very strong but 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.410
 after that another player there makes the goal 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.729
 but he's not a guy so it's a lot 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.410
 strong and will win from some defenders 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:10.410
 but not everyone
