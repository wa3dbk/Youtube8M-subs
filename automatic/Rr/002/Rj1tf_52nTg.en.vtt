00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.500
 hello everyone I find 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.550
 today for a new one 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.049
 new video on the theme of 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.170
 food and today we're going 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.520
 talk about cases that so I do not know if 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.529
 you know what it is I show you 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.810
 what does it look like anyway so a 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.660
 case who knows that so it's a fruit 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.670
 of autumn that we find from the month 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.570
 of dreams game at the end of September 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.699
 October 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.820
 finally in front of that that's pretty much 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.280
 the period October so I go expertly 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.780
 in khaki it's now only 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.600
 it's the only one it's the second year 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.640
 so I eat it in autumn before that 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.989
 I did not know the guys who I 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.219
 can not describe the taste you need 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.899
 that you eat one it's really a 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.700
 very very good fruit it is very sweet 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.590
 so to a lot of people who hate it 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.730
 and there are many people who love it 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.059
 I do not know why but it's like 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.649
 that's why there are several varieties of 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.870
 kaki we still do not stop the persimmons 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.899
 apple that are rounder and flatter and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.250
 then we have persimmons and khaki like that 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.170
 and then after there is also a variety 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.280
 which is called the cases that he passed to 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.299
 cases that can siemens 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.740
 it makes me laugh because they can 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.360
 simone that means to who is in 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.950
 English but there are blind people like that 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.130
 and these are cases that sell very ripe 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.439
 very soft so 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.909
 so I think that's roughly what it is 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.020
 there may be other varieties I get there 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.130
 do not know very well but all that 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.290
 I can tell you that I am 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.479
 have long wondered why 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.280
 there are cases who are we why and 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.200
 cases that are hard and beautiful 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.990
 leave an eternity to ripen 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.220
 it's still hard so that's what 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.450
 I have here these are what are called 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.280
 case that lasts 1 20 injured but not 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.829
 of state that lasts but here's two I'm going 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.630
 in the east but at the merchant's 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.070
 fruits and vegetables and every time we 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.780
 ask the question there are cases that 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.390
 sell that are all soft that are 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.740
 almost translucent and they sell them 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.119
 usually a bit more expensive because 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.009
 it's another variety 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.780
 they say that it stays hard and 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.229
 yet when I open them and I 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.380
 eat them 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.420
 they are very sweet and yet eva the ai 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.009
 solder so I'll show you what to 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.880
 it looks like when we cut them so that 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.630
 you see that it's actually hard 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.810
 so we're going to schedule it to send that the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.489
 knife he resists and here he is safe 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.780
 so he is juicy he is very sweet 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.430
 so it's not wasteful because 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.280
 I'll eat it but it is 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.110
 really hard so here I have not eaten 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.599
 like that and one day I had one of my 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.970
 subscribers who told me listen juliana the 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.760
 persimmon it's an autumn fruit is in 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.260
 made for them to become soft wall he 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.390
 must have a good shot of frost 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.010
 and then it is mature andrea masi must 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.750
 was patterned after that you put in the freezer 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.489
 and the next day they are super dies a 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.680
 once we got out of the leave so we 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.400
 going to do together experience it's gone 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.330
 so I went there that lasts all hard but 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:50.900
 sweetened anyway so the freezer 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:52.310
 and the magic there where it's hard like 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.329
 the stone so it's a big rock - 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.190
 frankly it's super hard 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:59.810
 so I take it out I let it defrost 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.549
 second magic of TV has deflated 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.959
 so we'll see what it looks like 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.569
 once it triggers g2 lamps 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.840
 someone who are now wall you 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.359
 see how they are all here we are and 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.560
 at the base he was like that so already 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.299
 they have a little dark at the level of the 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.430
 color and especially they became everything 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:21.609
 soft so I'm going to remove that hop was the 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.850
 gave 16 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:28.299
 and hop I open there it's all soft and 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.450
 look inside how is he 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.370
 here we have here akaki wall so 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:40.850
 I open the second to see that one 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:42.440
 this is also ripe has followed the 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.250
 encounter light so you see there he 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.170
 there are black spots 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.799
 I do not know why he was like 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.510
 that already when it was hard and it gets 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.889
 eat anyway it's not it's not that 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.930
