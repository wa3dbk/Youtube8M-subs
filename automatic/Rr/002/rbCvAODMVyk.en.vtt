00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 and very good other diamonds welcome 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.259
 this video was fourth video what 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.460
 good in this video what are we going to 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.200
 talk is a little bit of the situation 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.940
 current of the good team of the 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.790
 division of honor and the next tournament 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.529
 that are going to be the playoffs of the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.840
 second full here you will have the bracket 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.220
 manager talking a little bit about everything and good 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.300
 The first thing I want to comment on is this 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.650
 that I am very happy with the team 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.609
 we are right now we have been 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.900
 first sprint 2 of the lvbp 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.550
 you have here we have been we have won 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.810
 eight games and we have lost one the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.000
 party that we invest with periods 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.030
 against print gaming 2 stream in that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.890
 party was a somewhat regrettable match 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.960
 on our part we made an invade 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.969
 pretty bad they hunted us from 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.829
 level 1 and they started with 3 kilos after 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.450
 they did a lot is normal of the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.920
 departure we really did not get to do 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.420
 only one time at any time of the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.670
 We are grouped 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.079
 we made more than a three against three and 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.780
 Well, we ended up losing it but 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.000
 well , nothing happens 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.770
 I also think that as a team during 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.090
 what has been the sprint of we have 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.219
 I've been improving a lot since 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.260
 we started with our first 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.729
 victory so far I think we've 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.770
 advanced a lot as a team as 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.690
 team that we have improved a lot and good 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.759
 because tomorrow is the time to prove it 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.899
 go to the moment you are leaving 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:16.130
 to play the axis in the playoffs and those that 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.570
 then it becomes the eight 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.610
 first teams will qualify for 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.409
 the playoffs the first plays against the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.080
 last the second against the seventh the 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.490
 third against etc. etcetera and good 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.710
 Well here you have the bracket I'm going to leave 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.500
 to both lists in the description of 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.200
 video the classification and the bracket and 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.990
 Well, tomorrow we play at 9 o'clock 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.300
 night if I'm not wrong against w system 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.830
 and well it is a game that is going to be 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.390
 quite complicated because vd of 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.069
 system as well as at the beginning of the 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.259
 season they were not very strong that was 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.610
 when we beat them and that was the reason why 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.690
 which lost so many prices now I think 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.970
 that are much stronger have 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.800
 improved a lot and they're training like that 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.690
 that well let's see how we get and 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.880
 if we won then we would go against open 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.950
 gaming over gaming that my bet 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.329
 staff is going to win pain gaming 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.530
 berger because well I think now 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.260
 They are quite loose by 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.690
 that they had a top liner and an LED that 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.640
 they were guiris were foreigners they were very 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.810
 good both players and the two went out to 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.490
 an interseries chat team or 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.959
 doing I'm sure if one of the two 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.750
 He had left the Xavier series team 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.850
 or the two together or the thing is that no longer 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.290
 is not to see gaming so it 's going to 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.510
 suffer those losses I think that's going 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.280
 to notice quite the other part 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.520
 below we have we have against zuma 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.440
 atlantis against you in sauce 2 good the 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.480
 true that I believe that if we do to the 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.090
 final probably these four teams 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.470
 that will go to the final will be 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.019
 atlantis although good you will see 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.310
 can really win anyone and 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.110
 you can miss us at first 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.989
 round or we can get upstairs you'll see 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.910
 and well, what I also wanted 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.920
 comment is that this is what comes 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.450
 being is that sending points every 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.459
 sprint every match that is the division 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.800
 d'honor of season classification 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.870
 that this is the important thing between 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.250
 quotes the first eight teams 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.890
 teams of the season classification 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.870
 will be the eight teams that will go to gamers 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.140
 well for the moment we go seconds here with 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.830
 3000 points tied with over gaming 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.780
 mainly but it has so many 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.750
 points because they won the first sprint 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.890
 the first sprint was this this 2 players 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.900
 that we are going to count of annual interest that 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.850
 we beat them also after the 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.140
 elections with outs against pain gaming and 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.940
 It was when I was filled with the limbo of 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.200
 playoffs we see it now as we play the 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.640
 same tournament but it would be the 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.280
 sprint two things as the second sprint 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.230
 of the lgs and then the third sprint 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.970
 will be played after the playoffs and already 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.660
 Well who has the most points that 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.980
 will be for me basically this is all 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.360
 I wanted to report a little bit that I hope 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.310
 tomorrow in the game I hope that we 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.690
 you see play with double system stop and 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.860
 also remember that I hope that I have 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.330
 liked and that if you liked it 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.980
 hit like if you want more videos and 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.410
 you want more videos of this type and 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.150
 he also wants to make a small indent and 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.530
 is that 200 lately for being 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.450
 neglecting the youtube channel 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.000
 the truth is that I'm not working 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.530
 how was he working 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.150
 previously in the channel but yes that 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.650
 I say that this is only temporary that of 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.660
 soon I will return with many more 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.920
