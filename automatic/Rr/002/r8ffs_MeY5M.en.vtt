00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Translator: Abd Al-Rahman Al-Azhurry Checker: Anwar Dafa-Alla 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.685
 Around 1469, he was commissioned as a wealthy banker 

00:00:16.685 --> 00:00:18.547
 The young painter Sandro Botticelli 

00:00:18.547 --> 00:00:19.883
 Draw a painting on the altar. 

00:00:19.883 --> 00:00:21.515
 Botticelli became known 

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:23.626
 As one of the greatest painters of the High Renaissance 

00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:25.475
 Where he produced works such as "La Primavera" 

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:26.614
 And "The Birth of Venus". 

00:00:26.614 --> 00:00:30.393
 But in 1469 he had not earned that reputation yet. 

00:00:30.393 --> 00:00:32.986
 The scene that this young artist decided to paint was well known 

00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:34.822
 The three Wise Men, or Magi, 

00:00:34.822 --> 00:00:37.268
 They are coming to the birthplace of Jesus Christ. 

00:00:37.268 --> 00:00:39.482
 Botticelli was aspiring to take this well-known subject 

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:41.656
 Producing work in a whole new way, 

00:00:41.656 --> 00:00:42.578
 While proving himself 

00:00:42.578 --> 00:00:45.199
 Among the most prominent and prominent citizens of Florence. 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.518
 Many previous paintings were showing the Magi 

00:00:47.518 --> 00:00:49.412
 They come to the stable with a luxurious manger 

00:00:49.412 --> 00:00:50.945
 Worthy of the Son of God. 

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:52.752
 But Bocelli chose 

00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:55.669
 That makes the scene among the remnants of the rundown Romans. 

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:56.923
 In the middle of this temple 

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:58.925
 Bocelli placed a solid rock for Mary the Virgin and Jesus 

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:00.761
 To sit high on their visitors. 

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:02.903
 With this decision, Bocelli looks as if he is saying 

00:01:02.903 --> 00:01:05.794
 Christianity will be built on firmer foundations than Rome. 

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:07.761
 Then Bocelli filled the place 

00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:09.394
 With people and men of great importance in his city. 

00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:10.612
 On the right, the man draws 

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:12.917
 Who paid for this work, Gaspar Delama 

00:01:12.917 --> 00:01:14.035
 He looks at the viewer 

00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:15.560
 Pointing to himself with confidence 

00:01:15.056 --> 00:01:16.100
 Where there is no doubt 

00:01:16.604 --> 00:01:18.703
 For responsible for this masterpiece. 

00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:19.759
 So he became a barber 

00:01:20.263 --> 00:01:22.068
 Delamma, however, raised a good sum of money 

00:01:22.068 --> 00:01:24.327
 While working his currency exchange period of his life. 

00:01:24.327 --> 00:01:26.161
 He raised enough money to buy the burial church 

00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:28.203
 Decorated with beautiful paintings. 

00:01:28.203 --> 00:01:30.415
 The three wise men appear in the middle of this painting 

00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:31.917
 Raking up to Mary and Jesus. 

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:33.626
 And as a model for these important figures 

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:36.831
 Bocelli used members of a prominent family, the Di Medici family. 

00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:38.407
 Delama's career as a banker 

00:01:38.407 --> 00:01:39.509
 Were not possible 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.353
 Without the help of this powerful family 

00:01:41.353 --> 00:01:43.335
 Especially Cosimo de Medici, 

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:45.387
 Which appears clearly at the feet of Mrs. Mary. 

00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:47.009
 The two other wise men can be identified 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.143
 Bebeiro and Giovanni di Medici 

00:01:49.143 --> 00:01:50.646
 The sons of Cosimo. 

00:01:50.646 --> 00:01:51.675
 I had the money exchange business 

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:54.605
 Institutions that are morally and legally questionable 

00:01:54.605 --> 00:01:57.193
 So the friendship of this powerful family was necessary. 

00:01:57.193 --> 00:01:59.445
 Young heir to the influence of de Medici, Lorenzo 

00:01:59.445 --> 00:02:02.241
 Can not be excluded from this board configuration 

00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:04.303
 He is shown to the left of the manger. 

00:02:04.303 --> 00:02:05.981
 This painting seems to be saying 

00:02:05.981 --> 00:02:08.308
 That the legacy of Medici with the presence of many of his healthy heirs 

00:02:08.308 --> 00:02:10.976
 Will be built on stronger foundations than those in Rome. 

00:02:10.976 --> 00:02:12.648
 Bocelli then filled in the remaining space 

00:02:12.648 --> 00:02:15.149
 With other friends and strong personalities from Florence. 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:16.683
 And the elite of Florence 

00:02:16.683 --> 00:02:18.732
 The young and confident artist painted himself 

00:02:18.732 --> 00:02:20.527
 He looks directly at the viewer. 

00:02:20.527 --> 00:02:22.196
 Bocelli's appearance in this painting 

00:02:22.196 --> 00:02:24.031
 Demonstrates a radical shift of view 

00:02:24.031 --> 00:02:26.097
 The artists during this time period. 

00:02:26.097 --> 00:02:27.768
 Buccelli did not see himself 

00:02:27.768 --> 00:02:29.809
 As a regular craftsman hired to do simple work 

00:02:30.178 --> 00:02:31.416
 But saw her as a friend 

00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:33.697
 For families with authority in Florence. 

00:02:33.697 --> 00:02:35.629
 Paintings as "Glory of the Magi" 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.601
 Reveals much more than simple novels of the Gospel stories. 

00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:40.878
 It is possible to tell a story 

00:02:40.878 --> 00:02:42.633
 For a humble banker (birth) 

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:44.552
 Trying to exchange his hopes in a bad way 

00:02:44.552 --> 00:02:46.899
 By making the local church more beautiful 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:48.722
 Or to tell the story of a young and ambitious painter 

00:02:48.722 --> 00:02:50.349
 Raising the reputation of his profession 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.832
 To stand among the wealthy elite in his city.
