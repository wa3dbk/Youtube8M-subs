first<00:03:26.360> impression<00:03:26.950> this<00:03:27.950> is<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.610> bottom<00:03:29.150> here

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
first impression this is the bottom here

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.020 
first impression this is the bottom here
and<00:03:29.950> when<00:03:30.950> I<00:03:30.980> first<00:03:31.220> saw<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.520> pictures<00:03:31.910> of

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
and when I first saw the pictures of

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.970 
and when I first saw the pictures of
them<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:32.270> wasn't<00:03:32.630> impressed<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.770> thought<00:03:33.950> oh

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
them I wasn't impressed I thought oh

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.560 
them I wasn't impressed I thought oh
this<00:03:34.100> is<00:03:34.160> gonna<00:03:34.310> be<00:03:34.489> pretty<00:03:34.640> crappy<00:03:35.000> traction

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
this is gonna be pretty crappy traction

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.630 
this is gonna be pretty crappy traction
but<00:03:36.230> these<00:03:36.470> like<00:03:36.680> stick<00:03:36.980> out<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.430> they're

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
but these like stick out and they're

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.670 
but these like stick out and they're
really<00:03:37.850> really<00:03:38.180> soft<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:38.750> pliable<00:03:38.930> so<00:03:39.440> I

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
really really soft and pliable so I

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.280 
really really soft and pliable so I
think<00:03:40.160> on<00:03:40.390> certain<00:03:41.390> core<00:03:41.600> conditions<00:03:42.050> it

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
think on certain core conditions it

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.750 
think on certain core conditions it
could<00:03:42.470> play<00:03:42.680> really<00:03:42.920> well<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:43.459> could<00:03:43.640> play

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
could play really well it could play

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.430 
could play really well it could play
really<00:03:44.090> well<00:03:44.209> on<00:03:44.330> all<00:03:44.480> court<00:03:44.780> conditions<00:03:45.200> I'm

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
really well on all court conditions I'm

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.720 
really well on all court conditions I'm
not<00:03:45.590> really<00:03:45.739> sure<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.160> doesn't<00:03:46.430> look<00:03:46.580> like

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
not really sure it doesn't look like

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.280 
not really sure it doesn't look like
dust<00:03:47.000> so<00:03:47.090> I'll<00:03:47.150> be<00:03:47.239> able<00:03:47.330> to<00:03:47.420> get<00:03:47.570> trapped<00:03:47.870> in

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
dust so I'll be able to get trapped in

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.500 
dust so I'll be able to get trapped in
there<00:03:48.530> since<00:03:49.459> they're<00:03:49.640> so<00:03:49.820> widely<00:03:50.209> spaced

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
there since they're so widely spaced

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.229 
there since they're so widely spaced
some<00:03:51.020> of<00:03:51.110> these<00:03:51.200> areas<00:03:51.470> might<00:03:52.000> but<00:03:53.000> for<00:03:53.180> the

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
some of these areas might but for the

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.520 
some of these areas might but for the
most<00:03:53.420> part<00:03:53.690> I<00:03:53.810> think<00:03:54.050> that<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.290> traction

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
most part I think that the traction

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.280 
most part I think that the traction
might<00:03:54.860> be<00:03:55.040> okay<00:03:55.370> now<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.090> cushion<00:03:56.570> I<00:03:56.810> don't

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
might be okay now the cushion I don't

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.510 
might be okay now the cushion I don't
even<00:03:57.380> know<00:03:57.590> what<00:03:57.770> kind<00:03:57.950> of<00:03:58.040> foam<00:03:58.220> that<00:03:58.250> they

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
even know what kind of foam that they

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.810 
even know what kind of foam that they
use<00:03:58.820> but<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.390> is<00:03:59.570> really<00:04:00.170> comfortable<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:01.310> was

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
use but it is really comfortable I was

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.050 
use but it is really comfortable I was
surprised<00:04:02.270> I<00:04:03.130> just<00:04:04.130> don't<00:04:04.430> really<00:04:04.610> have<00:04:04.730> a

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
surprised I just don't really have a

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.449 
surprised I just don't really have a
complaint<00:04:05.390> as<00:04:05.600> far<00:04:05.810> as<00:04:06.050> like<00:04:06.320> a<00:04:06.440> try<00:04:06.709> on<00:04:06.890> of

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
complaint as far as like a try on of

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.220 
complaint as far as like a try on of
course<00:04:07.730> everything's<00:04:08.150> changed<00:04:08.600> everything

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
course everything's changed everything

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.570 
course everything's changed everything
could<00:04:09.440> change<00:04:09.650> once<00:04:09.890> you<00:04:09.950> start<00:04:10.190> playing<00:04:10.400> them

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
could change once you start playing them

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.970 
could change once you start playing them
but<00:04:11.090> as<00:04:11.239> far<00:04:11.450> as<00:04:11.480> the<00:04:11.930> initial<00:04:12.470> like<00:04:12.680> first

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
but as far as the initial like first

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.710 
but as far as the initial like first
impression<00:04:13.610> just<00:04:13.640> you<00:04:14.150> know<00:04:14.269> stepping

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
impression just you know stepping

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.570 
impression just you know stepping
comfort<00:04:15.320> and<00:04:15.470> bounce<00:04:15.650> around<00:04:15.860> stuff<00:04:16.310> these

comfort and bounce around stuff these

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.210 
comfort and bounce around stuff these
things<00:04:16.850> are<00:04:17.000> really<00:04:17.600> really<00:04:17.930> comfortable

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
things are really really comfortable

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.440 
things are really really comfortable
materials<00:04:19.220> like<00:04:19.340> I<00:04:19.460> was<00:04:19.580> saying<00:04:19.820> synthetics

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
materials like I was saying synthetics

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.629 
materials like I was saying synthetics
all<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.690> way<00:04:20.810> up<00:04:20.989> but<00:04:21.200> it

nice and thick they did not go the cheap

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:28.080 
nice and thick they did not go the cheap
route<00:04:24.509> and<00:04:26.280> these<00:04:27.280> things<00:04:27.520> are<00:04:27.699> like<00:04:27.849> little

rubber<00:04:28.270> rubber<00:04:29.259> pieces<00:04:29.849> I<00:04:30.849> don't<00:04:31.300> know<00:04:31.509> if

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:31.629 
rubber rubber pieces I don't know if

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:34.050 
rubber rubber pieces I don't know if
they<00:04:31.779> serve<00:04:32.169> a<00:04:32.199> function<00:04:32.680> or<00:04:32.770> not<00:04:32.860> but<00:04:33.159> they

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
they serve a function or not but they

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.959 
they serve a function or not but they
look<00:04:34.240> weird<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:35.830> yeah<00:04:36.520> I<00:04:36.550> don't<00:04:36.699> have<00:04:36.879> a

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
complaint with the the materials at all

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.019 
complaint with the the materials at all
I<00:04:38.889> think<00:04:39.009> it's<00:04:39.219> gonna<00:04:39.310> be<00:04:39.520> nice

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:40.029

it's<00:04:40.389> close<00:04:40.659> to<00:04:40.870> leather<00:04:41.080> without<00:04:41.379> being

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
it's close to leather without being

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.839 
it's close to leather without being
leather<00:04:41.889> it's<00:04:42.099> possible<00:04:42.580> when<00:04:42.699> I<00:04:42.819> I

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
leather it's possible when I I

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.909 
leather it's possible when I I
definitely<00:04:43.539> love<00:04:43.719> leather<00:04:43.990> so<00:04:44.259> that's<00:04:44.650> a<00:04:44.770> huge

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
definitely love leather so that's a huge

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.040 
definitely love leather so that's a huge
plus<00:04:45.009> as<00:04:45.729> far<00:04:45.909> as<00:04:45.999> their<00:04:46.150> fit<00:04:46.419> goes<00:04:46.599> they<00:04:46.810> fit

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
plus as far as their fit goes they fit

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.899 
plus as far as their fit goes they fit
through<00:04:47.319> the<00:04:47.439> size<00:04:47.650> they<00:04:48.129> run<00:04:48.520> a<00:04:48.550> little<00:04:48.729> bit

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
through the size they run a little bit

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.839 
through the size they run a little bit
snug<00:04:49.240> and<00:04:50.110> this<00:04:50.830> is<00:04:50.979> a<00:04:51.069> shoe<00:04:51.249> where<00:04:51.430> I'd<00:04:51.550> say

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
snug and this is a shoe where I'd say

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.459 
snug and this is a shoe where I'd say
like<00:04:52.120> it's<00:04:52.539> best<00:04:52.749> to<00:04:52.840> try<00:04:53.080> them<00:04:53.229> on<00:04:53.319> if

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:53.469 
like it's best to try them on if

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:55.260 
like it's best to try them on if
possible<00:04:53.919> unfortunately<00:04:54.729> I<00:04:55.000> don't<00:04:55.090> think

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
possible unfortunately I don't think

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.570 
possible unfortunately I don't think
these<00:04:55.569> even<00:04:55.870> are<00:04:56.110> at<00:04:56.289> retailers<00:04:56.830> so<00:04:57.129> I<00:04:57.159> don't

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
these even are at retailers so I don't

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.929 
these even are at retailers so I don't
know<00:04:57.669> how<00:04:57.849> possible<00:04:58.449> that's<00:04:58.569> going<00:04:58.779> to<00:04:58.840> be<00:04:59.939> but

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:00.939 
know how possible that's going to be but

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:02.820 
know how possible that's going to be but
they<00:05:01.090> run<00:05:01.479> a<00:05:01.539> little<00:05:01.659> snug<00:05:01.990> so<00:05:02.259> just<00:05:02.469> you<00:05:02.710> know

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
they run a little snug so just you know

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.459 
they run a little snug so just you know
keep<00:05:03.009> that<00:05:03.039> in<00:05:03.279> mind<00:05:03.490> but<00:05:04.000> it<00:05:04.120> is<00:05:04.270> sort<00:05:05.199> of<00:05:05.319> like

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:05.469 
keep that in mind but it is sort of like

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:06.899 
keep that in mind but it is sort of like
a<00:05:05.500> leather<00:05:05.800> so<00:05:06.069> it's<00:05:06.219> gonna<00:05:06.340> stretch<00:05:06.699> a<00:05:06.729> little

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
a leather so it's gonna stretch a little

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:08.820 
a leather so it's gonna stretch a little
bit<00:05:07.180> so<00:05:07.360> keep<00:05:07.689> that<00:05:07.810> in<00:05:07.870> mind<00:05:08.020> as<00:05:08.289> well

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
bit so keep that in mind as well

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.149 
bit so keep that in mind as well
lockdown<00:05:09.639> felt<00:05:09.909> great<00:05:10.180> and<00:05:10.740> you<00:05:11.740> know<00:05:11.770> because

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
lockdown felt great and you know because

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:13.769 
lockdown felt great and you know because
of<00:05:12.279> the<00:05:12.310> snug<00:05:12.610> you<00:05:12.939> know<00:05:13.060> secure<00:05:13.449> fit<00:05:13.689> and

00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:13.779 
of the snug you know secure fit and

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:15.059 
of the snug you know secure fit and
everything<00:05:13.839> so<00:05:14.319> we'll<00:05:14.439> just<00:05:14.589> kind<00:05:14.740> of<00:05:14.770> see<00:05:14.830> how

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:15.069 
everything so we'll just kind of see how

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:17.279 
everything so we'll just kind of see how
the<00:05:15.129> materials<00:05:15.610> hold<00:05:15.819> up<00:05:15.969> with<00:05:16.449> that<00:05:16.659> fit<00:05:16.930> over

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
the materials hold up with that fit over

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.290 
the materials hold up with that fit over
time<00:05:17.529> ventilation<00:05:18.370> there<00:05:18.639> really<00:05:18.879> isn't<00:05:19.089> any

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
time ventilation there really isn't any

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.269 
time ventilation there really isn't any
so<00:05:19.599> that's<00:05:20.229> pretty<00:05:20.710> much<00:05:20.830> it

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:21.279 
so that's pretty much it

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.489 
so that's pretty much it
it's<00:05:21.550> this<00:05:21.939> self-explanatory<00:05:22.930> you<00:05:23.319> know<00:05:23.469> I

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:23.499 
it's this self-explanatory you know I

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:25.019 
it's this self-explanatory you know I
mean<00:05:23.710> there's<00:05:23.919> no<00:05:24.039> perforations<00:05:24.490> or<00:05:24.819> anything

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:25.029 
mean there's no perforations or anything

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:27.510 
mean there's no perforations or anything
so<00:05:25.449> it's<00:05:26.409> gonna<00:05:26.529> be<00:05:26.680> a<00:05:26.710> little<00:05:26.830> hot<00:05:27.069> box<00:05:27.339> in

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
so it's gonna be a little hot box in

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.670 
so it's gonna be a little hot box in
there<00:05:27.810> support<00:05:28.810> most<00:05:29.080> that's<00:05:29.289> going<00:05:29.439> to<00:05:29.500> come

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
there support most that's going to come

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.769 
there support most that's going to come
from<00:05:29.710> that<00:05:29.919> fit<00:05:30.310> it's<00:05:30.550> a<00:05:30.639> nice<00:05:30.849> secure<00:05:31.300> fit<00:05:31.330> so

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:31.779 
from that fit it's a nice secure fit so

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:34.170 
from that fit it's a nice secure fit so
I<00:05:31.810> think<00:05:32.139> that's<00:05:32.289> gonna<00:05:32.439> be<00:05:32.529> a<00:05:32.680> huge<00:05:32.949> plus<00:05:33.339> they

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
I think that's gonna be a huge plus they

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.450 
I think that's gonna be a huge plus they
do<00:05:34.240> have<00:05:34.569> an<00:05:34.689> outrigger<00:05:35.050> as<00:05:35.500> you<00:05:35.680> can<00:05:35.830> see<00:05:36.069> here

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
do have an outrigger as you can see here

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.570 
do have an outrigger as you can see here
and<00:05:36.729> then<00:05:37.569> they<00:05:37.750> have<00:05:37.930> a<00:05:37.960> torsional<00:05:38.589> stink<00:05:38.889> as

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
and then they have a torsional stink as

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.459 
and then they have a torsional stink as
well<00:05:39.879> so<00:05:40.449> I<00:05:40.479> think<00:05:40.539> that<00:05:40.810> everything<00:05:41.199> is<00:05:41.289> gonna

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:41.469 
well so I think that everything is gonna

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:44.040 
well so I think that everything is gonna
be<00:05:41.560> pretty<00:05:41.949> pretty<00:05:42.339> good<00:05:42.610> you<00:05:43.539> know<00:05:43.569> overall
