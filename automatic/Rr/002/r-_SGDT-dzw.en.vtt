00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.140 

so<00:00:14.230> I've<00:00:14.320> been<00:00:14.440> getting<00:00:14.560> many<00:00:15.150> questions

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
so I've been getting many questions

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.250 
so I've been getting many questions
about<00:00:16.330> the<00:00:17.080> Intel<00:00:17.700> CPUs<00:00:18.700> compared<00:00:19.210> to<00:00:19.330> the<00:00:19.420> AMD

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.260 
about the Intel CPUs compared to the AMD

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
for the AMD 8350 so when you really shop

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.859

the hyper threading do I want to save

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.929 
the hyper threading do I want to save
myself<00:01:27.600> anywhere<00:01:28.600> from<00:01:29.040> 20<00:01:30.040> bucks<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.549> 50

bucks

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.160 
bucks
because<00:01:31.810> I<00:01:31.840> mean<00:01:32.079> right<00:01:32.229> now<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.520> AMD<00:01:34.170> 8350

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
because I mean right now the AMD 8350

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.289 
because I mean right now the AMD 8350
can<00:01:35.350> go<00:01:35.470> for<00:01:35.710> anywhere<00:01:35.920> from<00:01:36.220> a<00:01:36.490> hundred<00:01:36.939> and

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
can go for anywhere from a hundred and

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.399 
can go for anywhere from a hundred and
ninety<00:01:37.630> two<00:01:37.659> hundred<00:01:37.930> and<00:01:38.170> ninety<00:01:38.380> nine

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
ninety two hundred and ninety nine

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.999 
ninety two hundred and ninety nine
dollars<00:01:38.979> u.s.<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:40.030> intel<00:01:40.600> core<00:01:40.630> i5<00:01:40.920> costs<00:01:41.920> at

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
dollars u.s. the intel core i5 costs at

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.109 
dollars u.s. the intel core i5 costs at
least<00:01:42.040> maybe<00:01:42.430> $30<00:01:43.210> more<00:01:43.479> okay<00:01:44.140> now<00:01:45.119> another

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
least maybe $30 more okay now another

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.560 
least maybe $30 more okay now another
thing<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:46.719> think<00:01:46.750> about<00:01:47.020> is<00:01:47.350> performance

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
thing to think about is performance

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.420 
thing to think about is performance
versus<00:01:49.570> power<00:01:49.840> okay<00:01:50.619> because<00:01:50.799> when<00:01:51.340> you

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
versus power okay because when you

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.520 
versus power okay because when you
overclock<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:51.909> AMD<00:01:52.390> chip<00:01:52.689> it's<00:01:53.170> gonna<00:01:53.350> get

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
overclock the AMD chip it's gonna get

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.429 
overclock the AMD chip it's gonna get
hotter<00:01:53.829> than<00:01:54.340> if<00:01:54.610> you<00:01:54.729> overclocked<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.960> Intel

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
hotter than if you overclocked the Intel

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.120 
hotter than if you overclocked the Intel
chip<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:58.420> Intel<00:01:58.780> chip<00:01:58.810> runs<00:01:59.560> cooler<00:01:59.890> by

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
chip so the Intel chip runs cooler by

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.139 
chip so the Intel chip runs cooler by
default<00:02:00.579> we<00:02:00.759> know<00:02:00.939> that<00:02:01.149> but<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.530> get<00:02:02.710> more

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
default we know that but you get more

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.209 
default we know that but you get more
capacity<00:02:04.149> more<00:02:05.020> performance<00:02:05.649> for<00:02:05.829> the<00:02:05.920> price

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
capacity more performance for the price

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:11.040 
capacity more performance for the price
from<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.149> AMD<00:02:07.630> overall<00:02:08.530> okay<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:10.240> did<00:02:10.869> some

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050

machine has 16 gigs of memory and

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.060 
machine has 16 gigs of memory and
supposed<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.870> AMD<00:03:14.140> which<00:03:14.440> only<00:03:14.620> has<00:03:14.830> eight

supposed to the AMD which only has eight

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
gigs of memory so that's a little bit

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.280

unfair<00:03:17.260> but<00:03:17.890> still<00:03:18.250> look<00:03:19.120> how<00:03:19.300> well<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.870> AMD

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
unfair but still look how well the AMD

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.240 
unfair but still look how well the AMD
machine<00:03:20.680> did<00:03:21.070> in<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:22.240> scores<00:03:22.630> okay<00:03:23.440> so<00:03:23.500> it's

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
machine did in the scores okay so it's

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.610 
machine did in the scores okay so it's
basically<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.790> head-to-head<00:03:25.240> comparison<00:03:25.840> here

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
basically a head-to-head comparison here

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.520 
basically a head-to-head comparison here
it's<00:03:26.800> almost<00:03:27.130> identical<00:03:27.870> almost<00:03:28.870> identical

it's almost identical almost identical
and<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:30.959> can't<00:03:31.959> really<00:03:32.230> say<00:03:32.530> that<00:03:32.560> one<00:03:32.980> is

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
and I can't really say that one is

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.940 
and I can't really say that one is
better<00:03:33.519> than<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.790> other<00:03:34.030> in<00:03:34.330> this<00:03:34.570> case<00:03:34.900> okay

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
better than the other in this case okay

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.100

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
graphic cards then there's no point

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.090 
graphic cards then there's no point
looking<00:04:19.299> at<00:04:19.450> the<00:04:19.600> video<00:04:20.019> review<00:04:20.200> okay<00:04:20.890> there's

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
looking at the video review okay there's

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.120 
looking at the video review okay there's
no<00:04:21.190> point<00:04:21.459> because<00:04:22.350> you<00:04:23.350> know<00:04:23.470> you<00:04:23.830> got<00:04:24.010> to

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
no point because you know you got to

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.190 
no point because you know you got to
compare<00:04:24.490> systems<00:04:25.300> with<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:25.600> exact<00:04:25.930> same

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
compare systems with the exact same

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.440 
compare systems with the exact same
graphic<00:04:26.770> card<00:04:26.979> configuration<00:04:27.700> so<00:04:28.180> that<00:04:28.330> way

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
graphic card configuration so that way

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.000 
graphic card configuration so that way
it<00:04:28.540> eliminates<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.140> graphic<00:04:29.530> cards<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:29.950> it

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
it eliminates the graphic cards and it

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.760 
it eliminates the graphic cards and it
really<00:04:30.190> only<00:04:30.370> concentrates<00:04:31.150> on<00:04:31.419> how<00:04:31.870> well<00:04:32.169> the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
really only concentrates on how well the

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.520 
really only concentrates on how well the
CPU<00:04:33.280> works<00:04:33.700> with<00:04:34.030> those<00:04:34.270> graphic<00:04:34.780> cards<00:04:35.110> to

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
CPU works with those graphic cards to

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.070 
CPU works with those graphic cards to
complement<00:04:36.099> that<00:04:36.310> in<00:04:36.430> boost<00:04:36.700> and<00:04:36.940> performance

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
complement that in boost and performance

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.020 
complement that in boost and performance
now<00:04:38.139> I<00:04:38.409> know<00:04:38.830> I'm<00:04:39.069> only<00:04:39.310> reviewing<00:04:39.669> it<00:04:39.909> at

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
now I know I'm only reviewing it at

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.990 
now I know I'm only reviewing it at
1080p<00:04:40.479> obviously<00:04:41.139> you<00:04:42.069> know<00:04:42.189> running<00:04:42.759> things

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
1080p obviously you know running things

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.149 
1080p obviously you know running things
in<00:04:43.210> affinity<00:04:44.050> with<00:04:44.229> multiple<00:04:44.710> monitors

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:45.159 
in affinity with multiple monitors

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.240 
in affinity with multiple monitors
that's<00:04:46.060> where<00:04:46.330> we<00:04:46.419> see<00:04:46.659> some<00:04:47.250> performance

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
that's where we see some performance

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.490 
that's where we see some performance
changes<00:04:48.819> but<00:04:49.360> again<00:04:49.810> this<00:04:49.990> is<00:04:50.139> not<00:04:50.259> a<00:04:50.289> video

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
changes but again this is not a video

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.159 
changes but again this is not a video

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
review on graphic cards this is really

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.559 
review on graphic cards this is really
about<00:04:53.259> the<00:04:53.560> CPU<00:04:54.039> if<00:04:54.669> you<00:04:54.789> haven't<00:04:55.060> watched<00:04:55.270> my

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
about the CPU if you haven't watched my

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.869 
about the CPU if you haven't watched my
first<00:04:55.870> video<00:04:56.259> on<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:56.889> overclocking<00:04:57.430> I'll<00:04:57.699> add

00:04:57.869 --> 00:04:57.879 
first video on the overclocking I'll add

what you think about this gaming rig I
think<00:05:02.169> it's<00:05:02.319> terrific<00:05:02.560> machine<00:05:03.280> and<00:05:03.520> again

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
think it's terrific machine and again

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.680 
think it's terrific machine and again
thank<00:05:04.990> you<00:05:05.050> for<00:05:05.229> watching
