00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
your partner is going to fish he's got

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.330 
your partner is going to fish he's got
this<00:03:56.430> extra<00:03:57.000> wide<00:03:57.239> casting<00:03:58.230> platform<00:03:58.380> again

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
this extra wide casting platform again

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.610 
this extra wide casting platform again
it's<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.579> very<00:03:59.760> stable<00:04:00.060> position<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.840> be<00:04:00.989> in<00:04:01.019> but

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
it's a very stable position to be in but

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.530 
it's a very stable position to be in but
take<00:04:01.860> a<00:04:01.890> look<00:04:02.070> at<00:04:02.370> this<00:04:02.519> it's<00:04:02.790> divided<00:04:03.329> live

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
take a look at this it's divided live

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.690 
take a look at this it's divided live
well<00:04:03.870> there<00:04:04.380> are<00:04:04.530> two<00:04:04.560> pumps<00:04:05.070> to<00:04:05.190> fill<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.549> to

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
well there are two pumps to fill it to

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.060 
well there are two pumps to fill it to
constant<00:04:06.180> recirculated<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.079> it<00:04:07.590> pumps<00:04:07.799> out

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
constant recirculated and it pumps out

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.819 
constant recirculated and it pumps out
now<00:04:08.820> if<00:04:08.970> you<00:04:09.060> have<00:04:09.269> a<00:04:09.540> live<00:04:09.870> well<00:04:10.170> pump<00:04:10.470> go<00:04:10.650> out

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
now if you have a live well pump go out

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.009 
now if you have a live well pump go out
you've<00:04:11.100> got<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.430> redundancy<00:04:11.940> keep<00:04:12.630> your<00:04:12.810> fish

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
you've got the redundancy keep your fish

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.159 
you've got the redundancy keep your fish
alive<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.590> that's<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:14.070> really<00:04:14.310> nice<00:04:14.459> feature

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
alive and that's a really nice feature

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.659 
alive and that's a really nice feature
another<00:04:16.169> thing<00:04:16.410> that<00:04:16.530> we<00:04:16.560> like<00:04:16.829> on<00:04:17.039> board<00:04:17.340> is

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
another thing that we like on board is

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.909 
another thing that we like on board is
the<00:04:17.880> access<00:04:18.299> that<00:04:18.329> you<00:04:18.600> have<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.530> onboard

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
the access that you have to the onboard

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.099 
the access that you have to the onboard
battery<00:04:20.130> charger<00:04:20.760> your<00:04:20.940> batteries<00:04:21.419> and<00:04:21.600> you

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
battery charger your batteries and you

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.350 
battery charger your batteries and you
also<00:04:22.289> have<00:04:22.500> remote<00:04:23.070> fill<00:04:23.370> for<00:04:23.580> your<00:04:23.700> oil<00:04:23.910> tanks

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
also have remote fill for your oil tanks

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.060 
also have remote fill for your oil tanks
so<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:24.570> don't<00:04:24.720> have<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:25.050> get<00:04:25.289> down<00:04:25.500> below<00:04:25.890> and

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
so you don't have to get down below and

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.740 
so you don't have to get down below and
add<00:04:26.250> oil<00:04:26.490> you<00:04:27.030> could<00:04:27.150> do<00:04:27.270> it<00:04:27.360> from<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.570> top

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
add oil you could do it from the top

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.090 
add oil you could do it from the top
just<00:04:28.080> like<00:04:28.140> your<00:04:28.440> fuel

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
just like your fuel

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.640 
just like your fuel
now<00:04:31.100> the<00:04:31.160> Rangers<00:04:31.639> e521<00:04:32.539> is<00:04:33.110> one<00:04:33.350> of<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.530> most

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650
