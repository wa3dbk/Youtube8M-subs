00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 but we are grateful to raúl gutiérrez 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.870
 of the most recognized Atlantists 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.139
 because although he had a prosperous career 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.599
 of football there are colors that you 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.009
 they are impregnated and tattooed 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.190
 gutierrez how are you good afternoon 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.630
 good afternoon very well thank you very much 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.440
 you're sad about what happened with 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.960
 atlante raul 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.270
 Well yes I think they are one of those things 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.180
 what 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.240
 good thing you never want to 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.810
 no team especially because also 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.900
 I lived it right there in Atlante 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.140
 although it is true for the institution 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.000
 we got two promotions 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.520
 a first division championship 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.890
 we also went through a decline in 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.739
 89 and we know or at least I know what 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.140
 everything that impacts on players in 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.860
 institution and others and good are things 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.850
 what 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.460
 what hurts to remember if they asked you 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.910
 you played in america and lion in atlante if 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.850
 you have more identity as an Atlanticist than 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.340
 with another team 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.390
 well look is complicated is a question 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.390
 complicated because 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.680
 I'm recognized by the two if it's 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.840
 a certain nickname could say all this one 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.259
 but nevertheless 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.820
 the Americanist hobby the truth is that 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.700
 I appreciate it a lot too and 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.340
 obviously the institution of equal 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.950
 way for everything that I also 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.060
 they tried however good the team that 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.819
 they see you make the team that sees you 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.170
 takeoff is always going to be special 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.780
 travel good afternoon greets you to brand 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.659
 warrior we talked about how you can 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.579
 lose the identity of the hobby the 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.189
 interest also from the fondness for a 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.560
 team when it happens in this kind of 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.170
 things like a descent you did not live if 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.159
 is it is difficult after recovering 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.920
 this type of identity looks at the hobby 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:10.229
 Atlantis is complicated because I 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.229
 agreement then we were there in Mexico and 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.330
 when we were fighting for the promotion 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.330
 in 89 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.470
 people went to the stadium and even according to 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:27.299
 an overload in that end of the atlante 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.720
 atlante pachuca and in the stadium 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.879
 azulgrana and then the next year that 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.849
 we were already in the first division was one 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:39.510
 of the best years where atlante played 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:43.650
 football like that and so on and I was not going 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:47.790
 many people then it's complicated you 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:51.989
 I say that part I think the fans 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.590
 atlantist there is and obviously in 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.170
 greater or lesser extent 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.230
 is going to support your team I tell you I do not think 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.610
 that loses lose that identity of 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.849
 tradition team that has in mexico 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.120
 today you are greeted by leonardo villalpando 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.739
 after having this bad drink 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.410
 obviously you have to turn around 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.599
 to the page look for that promotion that 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.120
 possibility of returning to the maximum 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.709
 circuit that is what you have to 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.410
 demonstrate the player because there will be many 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.989
 that they stay of this equipment to be able 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.480
 face in the league of promotion if it is 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.459
 that this situation occurs today that has 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.280
 to do the directive today that you have to 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.750
 demonstrate how it was done in the past 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.580
 I do not believe what 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.960
 but you have to rethink everything 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.960
 everything that happened 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.569
 when there is a descent they are a lot of 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.849
 edges that must be analyzed is what 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.549
 administrative 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.379
 sportivo is the players and massa with 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.900
 how it has been handled or was not this 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.480
 half a year you understand me or they are all 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.730
 the previous seasons this one of 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.329
 how they handled then now 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.829
 I also think that you have to 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.829
 give a restructuring 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.660
 important for 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.959
 according to what what is going to be 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.150
 playing now that is an upgrade in those 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.440
 three years at some point you get 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:32.420
 they approached to offer you the equipment raúl 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:36.350
 yes clear since the year 2011 this 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:39.380
 they approached me to invite me to 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.150
 working there with them is not complicated 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.390
 also because of the topic you were living 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.610
 you on the subject of elections and on 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.700
 everything because of how this had come 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.570
 inertia of the atlantean 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.190
 yes, I say, right then, I say 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.210
 I am always one of those who believe in 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:01.300
 moments and that moment was complex because 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.690
 everything that I also wanted to handle 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.420
 who in minor selections and the 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.450
 good dessert the circumstance has been 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.390
 favorable unfortunately I say for the 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:16.360
 colts the conditions did not go away 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.630
 giving as I think I had 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.590
 idea 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.960
 and I tell you that is a situation that 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.270
 everyone that we were there then we 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.640
 it hurts we are talking about work with 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.250
 minor selections that are preparing 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.150
 and we saw that sub-18 was working 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.250
 what is there for these elections 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.860
 if we keep preparing we just finished 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:42.610
 play the 18 well mentions were played two 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:46.600
 matches in USA 1 against Canada and other 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:50.700
 against states and they won then 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:53.700
 I say it's part of the U-21 team that 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.700
 us 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:00.210
 short already for may we are preparing 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:03.690
 the toulon tournament that we're going to go to 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:06.540
 participate you are going to take that selection 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:09.320
 raul because they told us that you are going to 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.510
 take the process to no river 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.830
 yes that clear since December 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:19.200
 came out officially announced and if 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:22.010
 let's go to 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.010
 red 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.700
 we lose contact with raul again 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:30.320
 has gone through these tunnels already 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:33.230
 we will try to take up the call again there 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.180
 is not without sadness but talks about what 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.670
 also not that criticism of what was left 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.050
 to do what they already mentioned is not 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.880
 six-month question is not a matter of 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.930
 a tournament is a matter of many years 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.790
 back bad decisions I had a doubt 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:50.210
 of if he played in which he is when 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.920
 the band of raúl castro in the 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.970
 cuautla when it descends with vucetich 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:58.070
 when it was clear and if the weather 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:01.010
 they left us that team 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.990
 she is cut again as I already 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:06.470
 they found steep to which he was 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:09.380
 vucetich salvador raúl gutiérrez roberto 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.850
 Andrade for difficult to lift was a 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.370
 been outside the second ba la 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.260
 third division at that time is said 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.540
 someone because they also teach you the 

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.790
 descents you learn not since the had 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.100
 a descent with the atlantean returned a 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.620
 championship was lived all cycles not 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:27.050
 and then he knew how to overcome all that type 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.510
 of issues with other players that 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.070
 atlante team and they had one and 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.870
 surely also ascended with foals 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:37.330
 neza that came out of it is characterized 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.330
 go to the polls was the linear character
