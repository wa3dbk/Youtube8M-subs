00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
racket when it comes to serve so I can

a<00:02:28.210> lot<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.600> spin<00:02:28.810> but<00:02:29.350> this<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.620> just<00:02:29.800> a

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
a lot of spin but this is just a

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:42.020 
a lot of spin but this is just a
personal<00:02:30.070> preference

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.020 
part about this record plowed through
and<00:02:47.140> manoeuvrability<00:02:47.980> was<00:02:48.160> just<00:02:48.550> right<00:02:48.790> and

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
and manoeuvrability was just right and
