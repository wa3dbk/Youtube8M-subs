free<00:03:15.970> ones<00:03:16.180> now<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:16.480> then<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:16.780> mean<00:03:17.019> it's<00:03:17.560> not

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
free ones now and then I mean it's not

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.640 
free ones now and then I mean it's not
like<00:03:17.739> we're<00:03:18.040> completely<00:03:18.430> neglected<00:03:19.350> but<00:03:20.350> you

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
like we're completely neglected but you

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.740 
like we're completely neglected but you
really<00:03:20.860> can't<00:03:21.160> blame<00:03:21.459> them<00:03:21.790> for<00:03:21.850> charging<00:03:22.570> for

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
really can't blame them for charging for

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.960 
really can't blame them for charging for
map<00:03:22.900> packs<00:03:23.170> yes<00:03:23.799> I<00:03:23.980> know<00:03:24.040> I'm<00:03:24.220> kind<00:03:24.519> of<00:03:24.610> veering

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
map packs yes I know I'm kind of veering

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.600 
map packs yes I know I'm kind of veering
off<00:03:25.090> topic<00:03:25.540> here<00:03:25.570> but<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:26.769> guess<00:03:27.070> it's<00:03:27.250> related

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
off topic here but I guess it's related

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.250 
off topic here but I guess it's related
in<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.790> way<00:03:27.910> I'm<00:03:28.390> just<00:03:28.780> going<00:03:29.019> through<00:03:29.170> this

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
in a way I'm just going through this

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.770 
in a way I'm just going through this
because<00:03:29.620> I<00:03:29.860> see<00:03:30.100> people<00:03:30.390> comparing<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.570> oya

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
because I see people comparing the oya

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.390 
because I see people comparing the oya
to<00:03:32.170> game<00:03:32.410> consoles<00:03:32.799> that<00:03:32.829> we<00:03:32.980> use<00:03:33.100> it<00:03:33.220> today

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
to game consoles that we use it today

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.610 
to game consoles that we use it today
and<00:03:33.670> that<00:03:33.820> we<00:03:34.750> kind<00:03:34.900> of<00:03:35.019> pay<00:03:35.230> too<00:03:35.290> much<00:03:35.470> for

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
and that we kind of pay too much for

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.949 
and that we kind of pay too much for
games<00:03:35.950> it<00:03:36.250> can<00:03:36.430> be<00:03:36.519> argued<00:03:36.730> both<00:03:37.060> ways<00:03:37.360> but<00:03:37.780> in

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
games it can be argued both ways but in

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.940 
games it can be argued both ways but in
my<00:03:38.440> opinion<00:03:38.590> I'm<00:03:39.370> not<00:03:40.090> really<00:03:40.590> annoyed<00:03:41.590> by<00:03:41.890> the

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
my opinion I'm not really annoyed by the

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.199 
my opinion I'm not really annoyed by the
gaming<00:03:42.280> market<00:03:42.519> right<00:03:42.640> now<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:42.880> I'm<00:03:42.970> fine

every<00:03:58.239> single<00:03:58.390> night<00:03:58.690> I<00:03:58.900> know<00:03:59.650> that's<00:03:59.860> not<00:03:59.980> a

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
every single night I know that's not a

gaming console and it never will be at
least<00:04:02.530> as<00:04:02.980> of<00:04:03.040> this<00:04:03.310> recording<00:04:03.660> but<00:04:04.660> um<00:04:04.810> I'm

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
least as of this recording but um I'm

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.410 
least as of this recording but um I'm
just<00:04:05.470> comparing<00:04:05.890> because<00:04:06.130> same<00:04:06.790> price<00:04:07.000> points

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
just comparing because same price points

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.210 
just comparing because same price points
and<00:04:07.600> it's<00:04:07.810> in<00:04:07.930> my<00:04:07.989> living<00:04:08.230> room<00:04:08.290> so<00:04:08.590> it's

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
and it's in my living room so it's

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.220 
and it's in my living room so it's
something<00:04:09.489> I<00:04:09.700> should<00:04:09.970> use<00:04:10.180> pretty<00:04:10.510> often<00:04:10.720> so

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
something I should use pretty often so

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.720 
something I should use pretty often so
those<00:04:11.410> are<00:04:11.530> my<00:04:11.620> thoughts<00:04:11.799> with<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.040> oil<00:04:12.250> Tyler

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
those are my thoughts with the oil Tyler

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.569 
those are my thoughts with the oil Tyler
I<00:04:13.329> do<00:04:13.750> think<00:04:14.079> it's<00:04:14.170> an<00:04:14.260> interesting<00:04:14.500> product<00:04:15.190> I

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
I do think it's an interesting product I

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.729 
I do think it's an interesting product I
don't<00:04:16.209> think<00:04:16.510> it<00:04:16.600> has<00:04:16.750> huge<00:04:17.049> potential<00:04:17.560> for

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
don't think it has huge potential for

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.409 
don't think it has huge potential for
you<00:04:18.160> know<00:04:18.310> sales<00:04:18.880> numbers<00:04:19.269> and<00:04:19.359> everything

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
you know sales numbers and everything

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.900 
you know sales numbers and everything
but<00:04:20.260> I<00:04:20.320> do<00:04:20.470> think<00:04:20.739> it<00:04:20.890> is<00:04:21.039> huge<00:04:21.340> potential<00:04:21.700> in

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
but I do think it is huge potential in

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.420 
but I do think it is huge potential in
terms<00:04:21.970> of<00:04:22.390> the<00:04:22.630> concept<00:04:23.289> and<00:04:23.500> what<00:04:24.280> they're

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
terms of the concept and what they're

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.010 
terms of the concept and what they're
going<00:04:24.550> after<00:04:24.820> but<00:04:25.360> then<00:04:25.479> again<00:04:25.599> what<00:04:25.840> that

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
going after but then again what that

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.790 
going after but then again what that
said<00:04:26.289> it

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
said it

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.800 
said it
not<00:04:27.009> yet<00:04:27.220> at<00:04:27.430> least<00:04:27.460> in<00:04:27.849> you<00:04:28.330> know<00:04:28.389> the<00:04:28.509> public

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
not yet at least in you know the public

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.689 
not yet at least in you know the public
eye<00:04:28.930> I<00:04:29.319> mean<00:04:29.710> it<00:04:29.860> is<00:04:30.009> out<00:04:30.220> there<00:04:30.250> for
