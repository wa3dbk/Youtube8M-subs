best<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:32.009> one<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.119> actually<00:01:33.299> 21<00:01:33.840> feet

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
best this one here is actually 21 feet

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.510 
best this one here is actually 21 feet
across<00:01:35.150> regulations<00:01:36.150> 24<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:38.070> fits<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
across regulations 24 but it fits the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.499 
across regulations 24 but it fits the
field<00:01:38.820> much<00:01:39.210> better<00:01:39.619> having<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.850> size<00:01:41.850> and
