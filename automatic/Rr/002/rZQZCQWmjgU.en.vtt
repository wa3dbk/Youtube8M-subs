so I thought I'd just do a quick car to

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.700 
so I thought I'd just do a quick car to
try<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.900> answer<00:00:19.020> as<00:00:19.199> many<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.590> questions

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
try and answer as many of the questions

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.259 
try and answer as many of the questions
as<00:00:20.160> I've<00:00:20.279> had<00:00:20.539> like<00:00:22.100> to<00:00:23.100> have<00:00:23.189> any<00:00:23.369> more<00:00:23.580> keep

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
forwarding them through and I'll get a

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.650 
forwarding them through and I'll get a
chance<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:27.029> run<00:00:27.150> some<00:00:27.330> more<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.570> these

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
chance to to run some more of these

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.419 
chance to to run some more of these
maybe<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.260> bit<00:00:28.439> more<00:00:28.470> insight<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:29.039> how<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.250> use

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
maybe a bit more insight on how to use

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.040 
maybe a bit more insight on how to use
them

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
them

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.630 
them
so<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.320> most<00:00:31.859> common<00:00:32.130> questions<00:00:32.250> I

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
customized already you can see that that

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.030 
customized already you can see that that
panel<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.079> panel<00:00:40.320> are<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> same<00:00:40.739> size

to this one you can see is not
centralized<00:01:04.830> I've<00:01:05.070> adjusted<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.990> get<00:01:06.990> into

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
centralized I've adjusted it to get into

your<00:01:07.320> menu<00:01:07.650> menu<00:01:08.400> at<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.610> top<00:01:08.700> also<00:01:09.450> notice<00:01:09.840> a

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
your menu menu at the top also notice a

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.899 
your menu menu at the top also notice a
little<00:01:10.020> tab<00:01:10.290> up<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> top<00:01:10.740> there<00:01:10.850> can<00:01:11.850> actually

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
little tab up the top there can actually

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.120 
little tab up the top there can actually
drag<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.479> down<00:01:12.799> gives<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> few<00:01:14.070> more

drag that down gives you a few more

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.789 
drag that down gives you a few more
functions<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.840> split<00:01:16.020> click<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.650> that

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
functions so I just split click on that

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:25.130 
functions so I just split click on that
simple<00:01:17.790> little<00:01:20.270> drag<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.420> across<00:01:22.070> precise

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.620 

there<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:25.980> go<00:01:27.860> you<00:01:28.860> want<00:01:28.980> to<00:01:29.070> adjust<00:01:29.160> you<00:01:29.630> died

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
there you go you want to adjust you died

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.240 
there you go you want to adjust you died
arrival<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.050> you<00:01:31.110> want<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.410> seek<00:01:31.560> time

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
arrival a you want to seek time

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.820 
arrival a you want to seek time
let<00:01:32.580> me<00:01:32.640> see<00:01:32.790> water<00:01:33.000> temp<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:34.260> temperature

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
let me see water temp with temperature

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.300 
let me see water temp with temperature
structure<00:01:35.820> depth<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:39.350> little<00:01:40.350> numbers<00:01:41.040> around

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
structure depth a little numbers around

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.219 
structure depth a little numbers around
on<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.490> screen<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.540> what's<00:01:42.750> known<00:01:42.900> as<00:01:43.020> data

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
on the screen the what's known as data

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.219 
on the screen the what's known as data
overlay<00:01:43.830> so<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.520> time<00:01:44.820> temperature<00:01:45.810> depth

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
overlay so this time temperature depth

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.890 
overlay so this time temperature depth
depth<00:01:47.160> on<00:01:47.400> your<00:01:47.550> structure<00:01:48.330> screen<00:01:48.630> because

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
depth on your structure screen because

depth on your structure screen because
it<00:01:49.020> might<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.290> from<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.560> back<00:01:49.710> transducer<00:01:50.370> not

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
it might be from the back transducer not

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.530 
it might be from the back transducer not
your<00:01:50.640> front<00:01:50.850> one<00:01:51.650> you<00:01:52.650> guarantee<00:01:53.040> your<00:01:53.100> menu

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
your front one you guarantee your menu

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.200 
your front one you guarantee your menu
take<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.720> one<00:01:54.930> down<00:01:55.080> again<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.760> got<00:01:56.910> a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
take this one down again so you got a

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.630 
take this one down again so you got a
driver<00:01:57.479> light<00:01:57.690> and<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.020> turn<00:01:58.229> off<00:01:58.640> almost

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
driver light and you turn off almost

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.130 
driver light and you turn off almost
disappear<00:02:01.009> turn<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.100> back<00:02:02.220> on<00:02:02.840> actually<00:02:03.840> edit

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
disappear turn it back on actually edit

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.160 
disappear turn it back on actually edit
it<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:05.190> if<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.310> want<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.520> add<00:02:05.640> something
