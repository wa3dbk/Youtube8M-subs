and one of the cool features about them

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.850 
and one of the cool features about them
is<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:38.020> fact<00:00:38.170> that<00:00:38.290> they<00:00:38.440> got<00:00:38.590> this<00:00:38.710> little

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
is the fact that they got this little

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.799 
is the fact that they got this little
trigger<00:00:39.220> at<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.520> top<00:00:39.790> so<00:00:40.300> you<00:00:40.360> basically<00:00:40.720> just

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
trigger at the top so you basically just

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.870 
trigger at the top so you basically just
squeeze<00:00:41.290> the<00:00:41.470> little<00:00:41.650> trigger<00:00:41.860> and<00:00:42.160> it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
squeeze the little trigger and it

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.130 
squeeze the little trigger and it
releases<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:43.330> entire<00:00:43.720> pole<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.989> whole

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
releases the entire pole and the whole

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.380 
releases the entire pole and the whole
thing's<00:00:47.440> just<00:00:47.680> break<00:00:48.040> down<00:00:48.070> easy<00:00:48.670> easily<00:00:49.180> like

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
thing's just break down easy easily like

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.229

made out of this kind of hard plastic I

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.530 
made out of this kind of hard plastic I
found<00:02:04.930> that<00:02:05.200> when<00:02:05.439> it<00:02:05.590> was<00:02:05.680> snowing<00:02:06.009> or<00:02:06.540> under

that nature the handle would sometimes

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.690 
that nature the handle would sometimes
get<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:24.940> little<00:02:25.000> bit<00:02:25.239> slick<00:02:25.570> so<00:02:26.290> um<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:27.489> was<00:02:27.519> my

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
get a little bit slick so um that was my

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.930 
get a little bit slick so um that was my
only<00:02:27.880> caveat<00:02:28.150> really<00:02:28.660> on<00:02:28.750> these<00:02:28.900> poles<00:02:29.700> if<00:02:30.700> I

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
only caveat really on these poles if I

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.550 
only caveat really on these poles if I
was<00:02:31.090> going<00:02:31.329> to<00:02:31.390> add<00:02:31.630> anything<00:02:31.930> else<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.260> him<00:02:32.440> I

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
was going to add anything else to him I

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.539 
was going to add anything else to him I
would<00:02:32.709> have<00:02:32.739> added<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.160> little<00:02:33.400> piece

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
would have added a little piece

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.280 
would have added a little piece
underneath<00:02:33.880> here<00:02:34.269> like<00:02:34.810> maybe<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:35.110> little

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
underneath here like maybe a little

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.900 
underneath here like maybe a little
piece<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.590> foam<00:02:35.739> so<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.100> can<00:02:36.280> slide<00:02:36.489> my<00:02:36.519> hand

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
piece of foam so I can slide my hand

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.220 
piece of foam so I can slide my hand
down<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.120> little<00:02:37.360> bit<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.629> choke<00:02:37.810> up<00:02:38.020> when<00:02:38.140> I'm

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
down a little bit and choke up when I'm

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.260 
down a little bit and choke up when I'm
going<00:02:38.470> up<00:02:38.530> steeper<00:02:38.830> terrain<00:02:38.980> but<00:02:39.640> but<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.000> found

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
going up steeper terrain but but I found

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.850 
going up steeper terrain but but I found
that<00:02:40.540> that<00:02:40.810> work<00:02:40.989> probably<00:02:41.200> fine<00:02:41.530> just<00:02:41.739> like

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
that that work probably fine just like

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.750 
that that work probably fine just like
this

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
this

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.339 
this
I<00:02:42.819> slid<00:02:43.150> my<00:02:43.269> hand<00:02:43.480> down<00:02:43.629> across<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.110> shaft

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
I slid my hand down across the shaft

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.960 
I slid my hand down across the shaft
here<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.010> was<00:02:45.129> still<00:02:45.280> able<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.580> hang<00:02:45.790> on<00:02:45.909> to

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
here and was still able to hang on to

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.339 
here and was still able to hang on to
the<00:02:46.060> trekking<00:02:46.239> pole<00:02:46.360> perfectly<00:02:46.870> fine

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
the trekking pole perfectly fine

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.380 
the trekking pole perfectly fine
so<00:02:47.890> overall<00:02:48.220> excellent<00:02:48.879> trekking<00:02:49.180> poles
