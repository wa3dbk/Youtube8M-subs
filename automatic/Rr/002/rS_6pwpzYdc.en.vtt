00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.840
 that is to say, he then attends to all these 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.000
 creative this time by wishes of 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.560
 crystal and I can see what I have 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.790
 bought very few things though 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.700
 lately I'm taking off some 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.130
 whim and so I'm buying something 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.570
 concerning the beads or otherwise 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.670
 jewelry in general I will show you 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.410
 what I took anyway the site is 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.809
 very very rich you can too 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.580
 see what can be useful for you 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.340
 create your own jewels 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.989
 then I refueled mine 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.320
 miyuki children who are the wires that 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.760
 use of most ever and those that 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.100
 they all wanted its neutral tones or 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.380
 black and white so I decided to 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.640
 buy something colorful in order to 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.110
 you can also use them for the south 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.090
 in fact very often I didn't find myself 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.059
 these colors with color use stage 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.130
 very very lively so I decided to 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.810
 stock up precisely miyuki has wires 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.030
 got these here that were the ones that i 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.310
 they were missing then I bought these 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.580
 chains with dots because it is always the 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.860
 I want to use in my creations or to 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.420
 embroidery or in the south 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.100
 but I must say that I am very much 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.679
 nice also to use them with gods 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.569
 pendants very simple maybe I underwear 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.539
 I've never used them like this 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:30.250
 however, I have received some gifts 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.069
 say that they are very nice and so I have 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.390
 taken these colors a total I think of 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:36.130
 four colors 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.530
 here they are this black is a little more 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.610
 small and therefore these are for these 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.619
 I did not remember purchases 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.330
 not even what I bought or what I have 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.670
 bought from a lot of parts then 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.550
 see so many creative purchases then 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.140
 I wanted to try this spray glue though 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.759
 I don't want to use it for rhinestones 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.610
 the want to use more and more 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.770
 stage and I was at this spout 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.050

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.959

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.429

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:06.729

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.470

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.290

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.760
