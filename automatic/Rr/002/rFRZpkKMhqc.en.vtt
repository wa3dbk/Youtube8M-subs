 and tonight I'm here with the commitment to change politics in america 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.810

 a social center that helps them get back on their feet 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.970
 atrocities and terror are not political weapons 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.970
 and for those who use them 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.970
 the end has come 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.390
 are those people who believe that everything is legitimate if unfortunately the only one 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.230

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.480
 agents among the demonstrators to free the passage 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.480

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.580
 different from the others better 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.450
 we will never deal with it 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.980
 we will no longer tolerate and we will never fear again 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.410
 hidden behind the rhetoric of diplomacy 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.410
 I to put it to our personal political interest 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.100
