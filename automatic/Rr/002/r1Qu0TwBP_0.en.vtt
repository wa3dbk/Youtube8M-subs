going<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.500> look<00:01:10.770> into<00:01:10.979> one<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> L

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
going to have to look into one of the L

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.950 
going to have to look into one of the L
series<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.320> lenses<00:01:14.299> so<00:01:15.299> here<00:01:15.479> we<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
series of lenses so here we have the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.320 
series of lenses so here we have the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
of the lens extends like this typically

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.460 
of the lens extends like this typically
this<00:01:27.030> lens<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.450> rather<00:01:27.630> quick<00:01:27.990> quick<00:01:28.350> and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
this lens is rather quick quick and

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.730 
this lens is rather quick quick and
quiet<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.100> focus<00:01:32.960> this<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.079> because<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.560> has<00:01:34.590> a

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
quiet to focus this is because it has a

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.060 
quiet to focus this is because it has a
Canon<00:01:35.159> USM<00:01:35.640> ring<00:01:35.850> motor<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:37.070> mentioned

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
Canon USM ring motor I mentioned

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.230 
Canon USM ring motor I mentioned
previously<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.610> there<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.909> image

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
previously that there is image

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.800 
previously that there is image
stabilization<00:01:40.280> there<00:01:41.280> are<00:01:41.430> two<00:01:41.640> modes<00:01:41.939> mode

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
stabilization there are two modes mode

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.200 
stabilization there are two modes mode
one<00:01:43.170> will<00:01:43.409> control<00:01:43.799> image<00:01:44.340> stabilization<00:01:44.759> in

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
one will control image stabilization in

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.719 
one will control image stabilization in
the<00:01:45.299> horizontal<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.049> vertical<00:01:46.140> axes<00:01:46.920> mode

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
the horizontal and vertical axes mode

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.310 
the horizontal and vertical axes mode
two<00:01:47.970> will<00:01:48.210> stabilize<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> image<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
two will stabilize the image in the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.980 
two will stabilize the image in the
vertical<00:01:49.680> axis<00:01:49.829> only<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:51.420> typically<00:01:51.750> you'll

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
vertical axis only so typically you'll

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.630 
vertical axis only so typically you'll
use<00:01:52.259> mode<00:01:52.500> two<00:01:52.740> for<00:01:52.950> when<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.159> are<00:01:53.280> taking<00:01:53.579> a

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
use mode two for when you are taking a

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.760 
use mode two for when you are taking a
picture<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.119> moving<00:01:54.420> object<00:01:54.570> such<00:01:55.290> as<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.470> car

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.800 
picture of a moving object such as a car
for<00:01:55.950> example

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
for example

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.690 
for example
now<00:01:57.810> when<00:01:58.020> image<00:01:58.380> stabilization<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.250> actually

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
now when image stabilization is actually

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.609 
now when image stabilization is actually
being<00:01:59.909> used<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.600> will<00:02:00.899> notice<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> small

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
being used you will notice a small

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.050 
being used you will notice a small
amount<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.979> rumbling<00:02:02.399> going<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.729> within<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
amount of rumbling going on within the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.800 
amount of rumbling going on within the
lens<00:02:03.299> as<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.930> will<00:02:04.049> now<00:02:04.140> demonstrate

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.480 

so<00:02:11.810> here<00:02:11.959> we<00:02:12.050> have<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.260> few<00:02:12.560> examples<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:13.100> photos

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
so here we have a few examples of photos

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.360 
so here we have a few examples of photos
taken<00:02:13.940> with<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.209> lens<00:02:14.620> here<00:02:15.620> we<00:02:15.830> have<00:02:16.010> one<00:02:16.250> at

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
taken with this lens here we have one at

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.350 
taken with this lens here we have one at
70mm<00:02:17.890> here's<00:02:18.890> one<00:02:19.069> zoomed<00:02:19.370> in<00:02:19.490> at<00:02:19.610> 300<00:02:20.150> mil

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
70mm here's one zoomed in at 300 mil

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.479 
70mm here's one zoomed in at 300 mil
again<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:23.060> 70<00:02:23.540> millimeter<00:02:23.720> shot<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:25.090> again<00:02:26.090> and

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
again a 70 millimeter shot and again and

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.940 
again a 70 millimeter shot and again and
finally<00:02:28.489> this<00:02:28.700> is<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.880> picture<00:02:29.360> taken<00:02:30.170> 1.5

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
finally this is a picture taken 1.5

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.910 
finally this is a picture taken 1.5
meters<00:02:31.370> away<00:02:31.720> in<00:02:32.720> his<00:02:32.900> work<00:02:33.080> pointing<00:02:33.500> out<00:02:33.620> the

the<00:03:20.750> Canon<00:03:21.170> that<00:03:21.290> I<00:03:21.320> have<00:03:21.500> been<00:03:21.680> discussing

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
the Canon that I have been discussing

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.569 
the Canon that I have been discussing
secondly<00:03:23.450> we've<00:03:23.570> got<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.840> Sigma<00:03:24.320> 72<00:03:25.070> 300

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
secondly we've got the Sigma 72 300

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.880 
secondly we've got the Sigma 72 300
millimeter<00:03:26.030> lens<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:26.570> this<00:03:27.049> is<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.440> Tamron

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
millimeter lens and this is the Tamron

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.729 
millimeter lens and this is the Tamron
72<00:03:28.489> 300<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.810> first<00:03:30.019> thing<00:03:30.170> you'll<00:03:30.290> note<00:03:30.470> is

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
72 300 the first thing you'll note is

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.039 
72 300 the first thing you'll note is
the<00:03:31.010> Canon<00:03:31.310> is<00:03:31.459> slightly<00:03:32.390> larger<00:03:32.630> than<00:03:32.870> the

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
the Canon is slightly larger than the

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.780 
the Canon is slightly larger than the
other<00:03:33.170> two<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:33.920> this<00:03:34.160> will<00:03:34.280> be<00:03:34.400> because<00:03:34.579> of

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
other two and this will be because of

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.180 
other two and this will be because of
the<00:03:34.910> image<00:03:35.239> stabilization<00:03:35.769> that<00:03:36.769> takes<00:03:37.010> a<00:03:37.070> bit

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
the image stabilization that takes a bit

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.569 
the image stabilization that takes a bit
more<00:03:37.340> space<00:03:37.579> in<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.880> lens<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:40.040> Sigma<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:40.489> the

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
more space in the lens the Sigma and the

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.759 
more space in the lens the Sigma and the
Tamron<00:03:41.000> however<00:03:41.359> do<00:03:41.720> have<00:03:41.989> a<00:03:42.019> macro<00:03:42.530> function

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
Tamron however do have a macro function

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.880 
Tamron however do have a macro function
which<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.579> Canon<00:03:44.060> does<00:03:44.510> not<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.410> closest

and<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.000> tamarod<00:04:17.450> to<00:04:17.599> buy<00:04:17.720> these<00:04:17.780> brand<00:04:18.349> new

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
and the tamarod to buy these brand new

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.679 
and the tamarod to buy these brand new
you're<00:04:19.199> probably<00:04:19.349> talking<00:04:19.680> more<00:04:20.129> between<00:04:20.849> 150

00:04:21.679 --> 00:04:21.689 
you're probably talking more between 150

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:24.730 
you're probably talking more between 150
to<00:04:21.720> 170<00:04:22.590> so<00:04:23.069> the<00:04:23.220> cannon<00:04:23.520> is<00:04:23.789> more<00:04:24.210> expensive

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
to 170 so the cannon is more expensive

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.619 
to 170 so the cannon is more expensive
however<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:26.699> could<00:04:26.849> purchase<00:04:27.090> this<00:04:27.360> let's

00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:27.629 
however you could purchase this let's

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:29.809 
however you could purchase this let's
say<00:04:27.870> secondhand<00:04:28.500> or<00:04:28.740> refurbished<00:04:29.400> and<00:04:29.699> that

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:29.819 
say secondhand or refurbished and that

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:31.700 
say secondhand or refurbished and that
would<00:04:29.969> lower<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.270> price<00:04:30.479> somewhat<00:04:30.960> but<00:04:31.560> then

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
would lower the price somewhat but then

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.110 
would lower the price somewhat but then
again<00:04:31.830> you're<00:04:32.159> taking<00:04:32.250> more<00:04:32.520> of<00:04:32.580> a<00:04:32.669> risk<00:04:32.879> with

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
again you're taking more of a risk with

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.240 
again you're taking more of a risk with
the<00:04:33.240> actual<00:04:33.539> condition<00:04:33.960> of<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.080> lens<00:04:34.319> but

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
the actual condition of the lens but

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.709 
the actual condition of the lens but
secondhand<00:04:35.819> or<00:04:35.939> refurbished<00:04:36.539> you're

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:36.719 
secondhand or refurbished you're

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:39.980 
secondhand or refurbished you're
probably<00:04:36.930> talking<00:04:37.199> in<00:04:37.530> a<00:04:37.590> price<00:04:37.860> between<00:04:38.990> 280

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
probably talking in a price between 280

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.249 
probably talking in a price between 280
to<00:04:40.409> 360<00:04:41.340> depending<00:04:41.789> on<00:04:41.909> condition<00:04:42.389> with<00:04:43.169> the

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
to 360 depending on condition with the

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.439 
to 360 depending on condition with the
Sybil<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.740> term<00:04:43.979> Ron<00:04:44.159> lenses<00:04:44.610> these

Sybil and the term Ron lenses these

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.059 
Sybil and the term Ron lenses these
would<00:04:45.659> cost<00:04:45.840> probably<00:04:46.349> less<00:04:46.530> than<00:04:46.560> a<00:04:46.740> hundred

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
would cost probably less than a hundred

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.219 
would cost probably less than a hundred
pounds<00:04:47.219> to<00:04:47.580> buy<00:04:47.699> SEC<00:04:48.120> secondhand<00:04:49.020> or

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.820 
competitors like the cygwin the Tamron
and<00:05:18.330> it's<00:05:18.479> also<00:05:18.629> less<00:05:18.900> versatile<00:05:19.409> it<00:05:19.560> doesn't

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830

have<00:05:20.009> the<00:05:20.129> macro<00:05:20.310> functionality<00:05:21.300> but<00:05:22.050> then

have the macro functionality but then
