different alphabets ABCD but here we

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:24.490 
different alphabets ABCD but here we
don't<00:03:16.640> have<00:03:18.310> alphabets<00:03:19.450> after<00:03:20.450> P<00:03:22.569> so<00:03:23.569> instead

don't have alphabets after P so instead

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.289 
don't have alphabets after P so instead
of<00:03:24.560> Z<00:03:24.950> X<00:03:25.190> we<00:03:25.970> will<00:03:26.120> define<00:03:26.480> D<00:03:26.840> C<00:03:27.799> and<00:03:28.099> instead<00:03:29.090> of

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
of Z X we will define D C and instead of
