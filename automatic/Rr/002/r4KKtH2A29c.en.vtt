review<00:00:14.429> with<00:00:14.969> Tom<00:00:15.240> vassal<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:17.539> get<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> big<00:00:18.779> kick

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
review with Tom vassal I get a big kick

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.109 
review with Tom vassal I get a big kick
about<00:00:19.170> seeing<00:00:19.619> gears<00:00:20.070> moving<00:00:20.520> other<00:00:20.670> gears

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
about seeing gears moving other gears

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.359 
about seeing gears moving other gears
and<00:00:22.080> that's<00:00:22.410> something<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.769> fifth<00:00:23.130> gear

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
and that's something that fifth gear

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.970 
and that's something that fifth gear
does<00:00:23.789> although<00:00:24.600> actually<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.800> could

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
does although actually you could

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.859 
does although actually you could
probably<00:00:26.250> take<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.760> whole<00:00:26.910> gear<00:00:27.359> thing<00:00:27.689> out

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
probably take the whole gear thing out

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.929 
probably take the whole gear thing out
of<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.320> just<00:00:28.800> put<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.099> circles<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.670> mat

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
of it and just put on circles on a mat

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.609 
of it and just put on circles on a mat
this<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.300> really<00:00:30.539> an<00:00:30.630> abstract<00:00:31.080> strategy<00:00:31.470> game

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
this is really an abstract strategy game

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.920 
this is really an abstract strategy game
for<00:00:32.160> two<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.550> four<00:00:32.700> players<00:00:33.000> let's<00:00:33.719> take<00:00:33.899> a

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
for two to four players let's take a

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:56.180 
for two to four players let's take a
look

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.250 

mom<00:00:57.190> you're<00:00:57.579> going<00:00:57.699> to<00:00:57.820> put<00:00:58.030> this<00:00:58.270> comp<00:00:58.960> piece

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
mom you're going to put this comp piece

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.139 
mom you're going to put this comp piece
here<00:00:59.440> in<00:00:59.559> the<00:00:59.620> middle<00:00:59.890> and<00:01:00.100> then<00:01:00.520> in<00:01:00.760> all<00:01:00.969> the

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
here in the middle and then in all the

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.939 
here in the middle and then in all the
other<00:01:01.300> spots<00:01:02.230> you're<00:01:02.469> going<00:01:02.590> to<00:01:02.649> put<00:01:02.829> these

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
other spots you're going to put these

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.060 
other spots you're going to put these
numbers<00:01:03.370> that<00:01:03.399> are<00:01:03.670> numbered<00:01:04.000> from<00:01:04.509> 1<00:01:04.900> to<00:01:05.070> 24

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
numbers that are numbered from 1 to 24

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.050 
numbers that are numbered from 1 to 24
now<00:01:06.610> you<00:01:06.670> can<00:01:06.909> put<00:01:07.090> them<00:01:07.240> any<00:01:07.420> way<00:01:07.659> you<00:01:07.690> want

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
now you can put them any way you want

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.340 
now you can put them any way you want
random<00:01:10.060> is<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.450> way<00:01:10.540> that<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:10.869> game<00:01:11.020> tells

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
random is the way that the game tells

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.050 
random is the way that the game tells
you<00:01:11.440> to<00:01:11.530> do<00:01:11.619> it<00:01:11.740> I<00:01:11.799> suppose<00:01:12.220> there<00:01:12.820> would<00:01:12.909> be<00:01:12.940> a

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
you to do it I suppose there would be a

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.969 
you to do it I suppose there would be a
pretty<00:01:13.300> cool<00:01:13.390> optimal<00:01:14.259> way<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:14.409> do<00:01:14.649> it<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:14.950> I

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
pretty cool optimal way to do it and I

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.440 
pretty cool optimal way to do it and I
think<00:01:15.190> if<00:01:15.280> I<00:01:15.399> wanted<00:01:15.550> to<00:01:15.700> play<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:16.060> game<00:01:16.180> more

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
think if I wanted to play the game more

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.300 
think if I wanted to play the game more
I<00:01:16.690> would<00:01:17.200> figure<00:01:17.409> that<00:01:17.530> out<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:18.130> know<00:01:18.190> to

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
I would figure that out you know to

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.270 
I would figure that out you know to
figure<00:01:18.520> out<00:01:18.759> that<00:01:19.240> maybe<00:01:19.560> 24<00:01:20.560> was<00:01:20.740> best<00:01:21.009> in<00:01:21.190> a

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
figure out that maybe 24 was best in a

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.889 
figure out that maybe 24 was best in a
corner<00:01:21.729> or<00:01:21.880> something<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:22.420> that<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.630> smaller

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
corner or something and that the smaller

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.780 
corner or something and that the smaller
numbers<00:01:23.229> are<00:01:23.380> closer<00:01:23.590> to<00:01:23.800> the<00:01:23.890> middle<00:01:24.070> but<00:01:24.670> I'm

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
numbers are closer to the middle but I'm

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.039 
numbers are closer to the middle but I'm
not<00:01:24.909> sure<00:01:25.149> so<00:01:25.360> anyway<00:01:25.600> we<00:01:25.720> put<00:01:25.869> them<00:01:25.960> out

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
not sure so anyway we put them out

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.290 
not sure so anyway we put them out
randomly<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:27.549> then<00:01:27.670> I'm<00:01:27.759> gonna<00:01:27.880> put<00:01:28.060> a<00:01:28.090> white

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
randomly and then I'm gonna put a white

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.600 
randomly and then I'm gonna put a white
cog<00:01:28.600> here<00:01:28.810> in<00:01:28.929> the<00:01:28.990> middle<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.830> cogs<00:01:30.100> fit<00:01:30.399> very

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
cog here in the middle the cogs fit very

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.820 
cog here in the middle the cogs fit very
easily<00:01:30.910> around<00:01:31.420> those<00:01:31.630> numbers<00:01:31.990> in<00:01:32.170> fact<00:01:32.649> if

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
easily around those numbers in fact if

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.070 
easily around those numbers in fact if
you<00:01:32.920> add<00:01:33.039> another<00:01:33.280> tag<00:01:33.580> it's<00:01:34.390> fun<00:01:34.660> to<00:01:34.810> spin

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
you add another tag it's fun to spin

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.779 
you add another tag it's fun to spin
them<00:01:35.289> ok<00:01:35.830> it<00:01:35.950> has<00:01:36.100> nothing<00:01:36.429> to<00:01:36.460> do<00:01:36.610> with<00:01:36.640> the

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
them ok it has nothing to do with the

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.480 
them ok it has nothing to do with the
game<00:01:36.940> spinning<00:01:37.390> them<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.770> it's<00:01:38.920> still<00:01:39.369> pretty

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
game spinning them but it's still pretty

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.149 
game spinning them but it's still pretty
cool<00:01:39.820> on<00:01:40.179> your<00:01:40.570> turn<00:01:40.840> you're<00:01:41.590> going<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.950> roll

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
cool on your turn you're going to roll

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.570 
cool on your turn you're going to roll
to<00:01:42.429> 12<00:01:43.030> sided<00:01:43.270> dice<00:01:43.649> hopefully<00:01:44.649> so<00:01:45.340> here<00:01:45.520> I

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
to 12 sided dice hopefully so here I

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.090 
to 12 sided dice hopefully so here I
roll<00:01:45.789> a<00:01:45.820> 2<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.149> a<00:01:46.210> 5<00:01:46.390> that<00:01:46.960> means<00:01:47.289> if<00:01:47.560> I'm<00:01:47.710> green

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
roll a 2 and a 5 that means if I'm green

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.999 
roll a 2 and a 5 that means if I'm green
and<00:01:48.670> green<00:01:49.119> happens<00:01:49.899> have<00:01:50.050> six<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.530> these<00:01:50.619> cogs

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
and green happens have six of these cogs

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.160 
and green happens have six of these cogs
if<00:01:51.490> I'm<00:01:51.850> green<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:52.240> means<00:01:52.420> I<00:01:52.539> can<00:01:52.690> put<00:01:52.869> one<00:01:53.050> on

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
if I'm green that means I can put one on

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.809 
if I'm green that means I can put one on
a<00:01:53.200> 2<00:01:53.640> or<00:01:54.640> 1<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.330> 5<00:01:55.479> and<00:01:55.659> 1<00:01:55.899> on<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.080> 5<00:01:56.640> where<00:01:57.640> is

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
a 2 or 1 and a 5 and 1 on the 5 where is

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.559 
a 2 or 1 and a 5 and 1 on the 5 where is
my<00:01:57.970> 5<00:01:58.920> or<00:01:59.920> instead<00:02:00.849> of<00:02:00.940> putting<00:02:01.090> one<00:02:01.270> of<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.420> 2

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
my 5 or instead of putting one of the 2

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.930 
my 5 or instead of putting one of the 2
1<00:02:01.599> and<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.899> 5<00:02:02.110> I<00:02:02.410> could<00:02:02.830> put<00:02:02.979> one<00:02:03.009> on<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.399> 7

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
1 and the 5 I could put one on the 7

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.850 
1 and the 5 I could put one on the 7
I'd<00:02:04.479> rather<00:02:04.630> put<00:02:04.929> one<00:02:05.080> of<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.259> 2<00:02:05.410> and<00:02:05.440> 1<00:02:05.649> on<00:02:05.679> the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
I'd rather put one of the 2 and 1 on the

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.219 
I'd rather put one of the 2 and 1 on the
5<00:02:06.039> so<00:02:06.789> then<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.030> next<00:02:07.209> query<00:02:07.479> goes<00:02:07.720> yellow<00:02:07.989> and

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
5 so then the next query goes yellow and

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.410 
5 so then the next query goes yellow and
yellow<00:02:08.289> that's<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.619> ten<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:08.979> an<00:02:09.099> eight<00:02:09.420> so

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
yellow that's a ten and an eight so

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.059 
yellow that's a ten and an eight so
instead<00:02:10.630> of<00:02:10.780> putting<00:02:10.929> one<00:02:11.140> on<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.500> 10<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:11.950> one

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
instead of putting one on a 10 and one

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.220 
instead of putting one on a 10 and one
on<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.250> sides<00:02:12.879> to<00:02:12.970> put<00:02:13.120> one<00:02:13.300> on<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.510> 18<00:02:13.959> and

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
on the sides to put one on the 18 and

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.070 
on the sides to put one on the 18 and
then<00:02:14.980> red<00:02:15.220> goes<00:02:15.459> red<00:02:15.760> gets<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.060> 4<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.420> 4<00:02:16.599> so<00:02:16.930> he

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
then red goes red gets a 4 and a 4 so he

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.110 
then red goes red gets a 4 and a 4 so he
doesn't<00:02:17.620> really<00:02:17.739> have<00:02:17.920> much<00:02:17.950> options<00:02:18.610> other

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
doesn't really have much options other

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.790 
doesn't really have much options other
than<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.510> either<00:02:19.720> put<00:02:19.959> one<00:02:20.110> on<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.290> 4<00:02:20.470> 1<00:02:20.650> and

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
than to either put one on the 4 1 and

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.130 
than to either put one on the 4 1 and
the<00:02:20.860> 8<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.250> he<00:02:21.310> chooses<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.819> 8<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.239> then<00:02:22.900> blue

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
the 8 so he chooses the 8 and then blue

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.680 
the 8 so he chooses the 8 and then blue
goes<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.830> then<00:02:23.920> blue<00:02:24.099> gets<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.430> 1<00:02:24.610> in<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.819> 7<00:02:25.209> so

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
goes and then blue gets a 1 in the 7 so

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.930 
goes and then blue gets a 1 in the 7 so
blue<00:02:25.900> can<00:02:26.080> put<00:02:26.230> one<00:02:26.349> on<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.590> 1<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.700> on<00:02:27.819> the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
blue can put one on the 1 and on the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.240 
blue can put one on the 1 and on the
seven<00:02:28.270> or<00:02:28.390> one<00:02:28.569> on<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.780> 8<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.709> he<00:02:29.830> decided<00:02:30.129> to

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
seven or one on the 8 so he decided to

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.010 
seven or one on the 8 so he decided to
do<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.550> then<00:02:31.150> we're<00:02:31.270> back<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.450> green<00:02:31.599> and

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
do that then we're back to green and

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.619 
do that then we're back to green and
green<00:02:32.230> rolls<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.560> three<00:02:32.770> and<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:32.920> six<00:02:33.129> and<00:02:33.629> he

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
green rolls a three and a six and he

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.240 
green rolls a three and a six and he
wants<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.900> do<00:02:35.020> 2<00:02:35.110> 3<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.470> 6<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:35.860> he<00:02:35.980> puts<00:02:36.190> the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
wants to do 2 3 and the 6 so he puts the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.540 
wants to do 2 3 and the 6 so he puts the
green<00:02:36.489> there<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.030> he<00:02:37.930> puts<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.500> green<00:02:38.890> here<00:02:39.280> now

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
green there and he puts a green here now

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.250 
green there and he puts a green here now

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.059 
game is about doing the numbers this is
a<00:03:37.670> very<00:03:37.939> simple<00:03:38.569> game<00:03:38.680> you<00:03:39.680> know<00:03:39.799> you<00:03:39.829> don't

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
a very simple game you know you don't

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.920 
a very simple game you know you don't
have<00:03:40.189> a<00:03:40.250> lot<00:03:40.430> of<00:03:40.549> choices<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:41.120> roll<00:03:41.389> dice<00:03:41.599> and

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
have a lot of choices you roll dice and

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.869 
have a lot of choices you roll dice and
you<00:03:42.200> put<00:03:42.620> them<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:43.010> have<00:03:43.129> two<00:03:43.280> choices<00:03:43.519> each

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
you put them you have two choices each

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.699 
you put them you have two choices each
turn<00:03:44.150> so<00:03:44.720> this<00:03:44.930> isn't<00:03:45.109> gonna<00:03:45.319> be<00:03:45.500> anything

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
turn so this isn't gonna be anything

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.890 
turn so this isn't gonna be anything
that<00:03:45.980> seeing<00:03:46.189> in<00:03:46.370> great<00:03:46.669> depth<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.359> I<00:03:47.840> do

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
that seeing in great depth and I do

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.509 
that seeing in great depth and I do
wonder<00:03:48.379> if<00:03:48.500> it<00:03:48.620> might<00:03:48.799> have<00:03:48.889> been<00:03:49.010> better<00:03:49.189> with

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
wonder if it might have been better with

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.610 
wonder if it might have been better with
a<00:03:50.180> different<00:03:50.840> grid<00:03:51.079> and<00:03:51.260> maybe<00:03:51.409> a<00:03:51.470> better

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
a different grid and maybe a better

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.729 
a different grid and maybe a better
spread<00:03:52.129> because<00:03:52.519> for<00:03:52.819> example<00:03:52.879> that<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.989> 24

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
spread because for example that the 24

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.580 
spread because for example that the 24
is<00:03:55.040> almost<00:03:55.879> never<00:03:56.389> going<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:56.840> be<00:03:57.019> rolled<00:03:57.290> you

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
is almost never going to be rolled you

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.580 
is almost never going to be rolled you
have<00:03:57.799> a<00:03:57.829> one<00:03:58.730> out<00:03:58.879> of<00:03:59.000> 144<00:03:59.629> chance<00:04:00.049> to<00:04:00.319> roll

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
have a one out of 144 chance to roll

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.530 
have a one out of 144 chance to roll
that<00:04:00.859> and<00:04:01.099> then<00:04:01.639> likely<00:04:01.879> that's<00:04:02.209> never<00:04:02.359> going

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
that and then likely that's never going

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.970 
that and then likely that's never going
to<00:04:02.599> show<00:04:02.840> up<00:04:02.959> in<00:04:03.109> the<00:04:03.169> course<00:04:03.409> of<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.590> game<00:04:03.620> and

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
to show up in the course of a game and

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.649 
to show up in the course of a game and
if<00:04:04.040> that<00:04:04.159> number<00:04:04.519> goes<00:04:04.970> towards<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.389> middle

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
if that number goes towards the middle

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.110 
if that number goes towards the middle
then<00:04:06.169> you're<00:04:06.349> kind<00:04:06.530> of<00:04:06.650> that<00:04:07.340> spots<00:04:07.669> gonna<00:04:07.819> sit

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
then you're kind of that spots gonna sit

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.839 
then you're kind of that spots gonna sit
open<00:04:08.239> it's<00:04:09.139> a<00:04:09.319> much<00:04:09.590> better<00:04:09.859> two-player<00:04:10.549> game

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
open it's a much better two-player game

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.259 
open it's a much better two-player game
than<00:04:11.090> it<00:04:11.209> is<00:04:11.299> a<00:04:11.329> four<00:04:11.629> player<00:04:11.900> game<00:04:11.959> although

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
than it is a four player game although

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.939 
than it is a four player game although
I'm<00:04:14.269> kind<00:04:14.599> of<00:04:14.659> ambivalent<00:04:15.260> on<00:04:15.349> it<00:04:15.530> it's<00:04:15.680> it's

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:15.949 
I'm kind of ambivalent on it it's it's

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.490 
I'm kind of ambivalent on it it's it's
it's<00:04:16.400> okay<00:04:16.880> I<00:04:17.090> didn't<00:04:17.329> dislike<00:04:17.659> it<00:04:17.930> but<00:04:18.380> it

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
it's okay I didn't dislike it but it

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.289 
it's okay I didn't dislike it but it
didn't<00:04:18.709> really<00:04:18.919> you<00:04:19.459> know<00:04:19.579> bring<00:04:19.820> out<00:04:20.060> any

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
didn't really you know bring out any

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.750 
didn't really you know bring out any
kind<00:04:20.630> of<00:04:20.859> type<00:04:21.859> thing<00:04:22.070> except<00:04:22.370> spinning<00:04:22.699> the

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
kind of type thing except spinning the

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.430 
kind of type thing except spinning the
stuff<00:04:22.970> I<00:04:23.090> love<00:04:23.240> doing<00:04:23.539> that<00:04:23.690> what<00:04:24.229> did<00:04:24.289> you

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
stuff I love doing that what did you

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.180 
stuff I love doing that what did you
think<00:04:24.639> I<00:04:25.639> saw<00:04:26.120> a<00:04:26.150> lot<00:04:26.630> of<00:04:26.780> fun<00:04:27.080> putting<00:04:27.740> out<00:04:28.010> the

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
think I saw a lot of fun putting out the

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.270 
think I saw a lot of fun putting out the
gears<00:04:28.639> trying<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.449> get<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:29.720> five<00:04:30.039> together<00:04:31.039> in

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
gears trying to get the five together in

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.800 
gears trying to get the five together in
the<00:04:31.490> white<00:04:31.669> thing<00:04:32.889> the<00:04:33.889> thing<00:04:34.159> was<00:04:34.490> I<00:04:35.449> just

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
the white thing the thing was I just

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.899 
the white thing the thing was I just
thought<00:04:36.409> that<00:04:36.470> every<00:04:37.159> time<00:04:37.370> I<00:04:37.400> never<00:04:37.610> put

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:37.909 
thought that every time I never put

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:39.399 
thought that every time I never put
something<00:04:38.090> out<00:04:38.389> someone<00:04:38.780> else<00:04:38.930> would<00:04:39.080> get<00:04:39.260> it

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:39.409 
something out someone else would get it

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:40.750 
something out someone else would get it
and<00:04:39.440> then<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:40.099> game<00:04:40.250> would<00:04:40.370> just<00:04:40.550> take

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
and then the game would just take

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.760 
and then the game would just take
forever<00:04:41.060> yeah<00:04:41.599> the<00:04:41.750> game<00:04:41.900> can<00:04:42.229> take<00:04:42.440> a<00:04:42.470> long

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
forever yeah the game can take a long

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.500 
forever yeah the game can take a long
time<00:04:43.039> especially<00:04:43.099> considering<00:04:43.909> people<00:04:44.150> roll

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
time especially considering people roll

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.589 
time especially considering people roll
ah-ha-ah-ha<00:04:45.639> back<00:04:46.639> forth<00:04:46.880> for<00:04:47.180> yours<00:04:47.360> it's

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
can go on for a long time maybe making

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.060 
can go on for a long time maybe making
the<00:04:53.810> victory<00:04:54.169> yeah<00:04:54.500> especially<00:04:54.770> in<00:04:55.010> a

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
the victory yeah especially in a

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.830 
the victory yeah especially in a
four-player<00:04:55.370> game<00:04:55.490> maybe<00:04:56.240> making<00:04:56.419> a<00:04:56.599> victory

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
four-player game maybe making a victory

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.350 
four-player game maybe making a victory
condition<00:04:57.260> easier<00:04:57.560> four<00:04:57.919> or<00:04:58.310> three<00:04:58.340> rings<00:04:58.940> no

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
condition easier four or three rings no

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.689 
condition easier four or three rings no
that<00:04:59.720> might<00:04:59.840> be<00:04:59.960> too<00:05:00.139> easy<00:05:00.320> I<00:05:00.680> don't<00:05:01.400> know

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
that might be too easy I don't know

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.060 
that might be too easy I don't know
so<00:05:02.599> like<00:05:02.780> I'm<00:05:02.930> saying<00:05:03.139> I<00:05:03.349> would<00:05:03.770> play<00:05:03.919> this

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
so like I'm saying I would play this

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.129 
so like I'm saying I would play this
with<00:05:04.250> just<00:05:04.430> two<00:05:04.550> players<00:05:04.789> really<00:05:05.120> maybe<00:05:05.780> three

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
with just two players really maybe three

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:07.240 
with just two players really maybe three
but<00:05:06.169> I<00:05:06.320> would<00:05:06.530> not<00:05:06.650> play<00:05:06.800> it<00:05:06.919> with<00:05:07.039> four

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
but I would not play it with four

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.920 
but I would not play it with four
because<00:05:07.460> four<00:05:07.490> just<00:05:07.909> kind<00:05:08.240> of<00:05:08.300> really<00:05:08.570> bogged

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
because four just kind of really bogged

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.980 
because four just kind of really bogged
down<00:05:09.020> any<00:05:09.860> final<00:05:10.159> thoughts<00:05:10.430> on<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:10.580> game<00:05:10.990> no
