they come around the side of this knife
rotation<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:37.890> we'll<00:01:38.009> give<00:01:38.159> them<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> green<00:01:38.549> at

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
rotation so we'll give them a green at

rotation so we'll give them a green at
last<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:39.869> not<00:01:39.960> least<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.500> snipe<00:01:40.829> action

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
after and to do that you need the loons

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.030 
after and to do that you need the loons
in<00:01:59.640> your<00:01:59.790> inventory<00:02:00.240> not<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.110> CC<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.890> the

in your inventory not in the CC so the

CC 321 and the Loon should be an

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.080 
CC 321 and the Loon should be an
inventory<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.280> we're<00:02:05.399> gonna<00:02:05.520> give<00:02:05.700> me<00:02:05.790> yellow

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
and that kind of wraps up this first

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.169 
and that kind of wraps up this first
attack<00:02:08.009> will<00:02:08.190> go<00:02:08.310> into<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.520> sec<00:02:08.729> one<00:02:08.910> here<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.119> a

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
attack will go into a sec one here in a

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.910 
attack will go into a sec one here in a
minute<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.929> tech<00:02:10.140> shows<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.679> when

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
minute but the tech shows you that when

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.339 
minute but the tech shows you that when
the<00:02:11.069> base<00:02:11.280> has<00:02:11.640> kind<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.120> an<00:02:12.270> iffy<00:02:12.599> layout<00:02:13.020> you

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
the base has kind of an iffy layout you

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.670 
the base has kind of an iffy layout you
can

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
can

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.649 
can
don't<00:02:13.829> make<00:02:14.010> some<00:02:14.280> mistakes<00:02:14.700> or<00:02:15.299> do<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.480> little

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
don't make some mistakes or do a little

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.899 
don't make some mistakes or do a little
bit<00:02:15.780> if<00:02:15.959> Venus<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.439> the<00:02:16.469> framework<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.159> still

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
bit if Venus on the framework and still

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.420 
bit if Venus on the framework and still
pull<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.239> off<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:18.659> good<00:02:18.959> job<00:02:19.170> all<00:02:20.040> right<00:02:20.280> let's

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
pull it off so good job all right let's

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.920 
pull it off so good job all right let's
get<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.730> second<00:02:21.060> attack<00:02:21.329> it's<00:02:21.629> gonna<00:02:21.750> be<00:02:21.900> a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
get to the second attack it's gonna be a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.050 
get to the second attack it's gonna be a
mid<00:02:22.140> town<00:02:22.469> hall<00:02:22.709> 8<00:02:22.739> but<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.519> time<00:02:23.579> were<00:02:23.879> to<00:02:23.939> go

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
mid town hall 8 but this time were to go

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.789 
mid town hall 8 but this time were to go
along<00:02:24.299> a<00:02:24.329> playbook<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.900> lot<00:02:25.049> tighter<00:02:25.379> so<00:02:25.739> I

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
along a playbook a lot tighter so I

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.099 
along a playbook a lot tighter so I
think<00:02:25.890> it's<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.069> better<00:02:26.250> example<00:02:26.870> 80s<00:02:27.870> in<00:02:28.019> the

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
think it's a better example 80s in the

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.479 
think it's a better example 80s in the
middle<00:02:28.319> Archer<00:02:28.620> towers<00:02:28.829> and<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.069> edge<00:02:29.189> its

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
middle Archer towers and the edge its

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.190 
middle Archer towers and the edge its
absolute<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.939> right<00:02:30.090> attack<00:02:30.359> it's<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.959> green

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
absolute the right attack it's a green

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.080 
absolute the right attack it's a green
now<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.040> can<00:02:32.219> tell<00:02:32.400> but<00:02:32.609> the<00:02:32.700> colonel<00:02:33.030> is

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
now you can tell but the colonel is

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.220 
now you can tell but the colonel is
gonna<00:02:33.269> ignore<00:02:33.480> pulling<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:33.989> clan<00:02:34.200> castle

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
gonna ignore pulling the clan castle

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.080 
gonna ignore pulling the clan castle
just<00:02:34.739> like<00:02:34.859> Tyrion<00:02:35.219> did<00:02:35.370> because<00:02:35.760> he's<00:02:35.909> got

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
just like Tyrion did because he's got

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.399 
just like Tyrion did because he's got
those<00:02:36.239> two<00:02:36.420> columns<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.019> field<00:02:37.230> already

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
those two columns on the field already

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.410 
those two columns on the field already
but<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.920> spread<00:02:38.459> of<00:02:38.489> those<00:02:38.700> is<00:02:38.939> pretty<00:02:39.239> good

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
but the spread of those is pretty good

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.149 
but the spread of those is pretty good
and<00:02:39.569> they<00:02:39.689> are<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:39.989> viable<00:02:40.290> way<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.709> set<00:02:41.040> the

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
and they are a viable way to set the

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.800 
and they are a viable way to set the
flanks<00:02:41.579> with<00:02:41.639> wizards<00:02:42.090> behind<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.629> I'm<00:02:42.689> gonna

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
flanks with wizards behind so I'm gonna

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.020 
flanks with wizards behind so I'm gonna
give<00:02:42.930> my<00:02:43.019> green<00:02:43.230> on<00:02:43.379> both<00:02:43.560> then<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.489> couple<00:02:44.849> nice

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
give my green on both then a couple nice

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.699 
give my green on both then a couple nice
things<00:02:45.329> are<00:02:45.420> shown<00:02:45.659> here<00:02:45.689> by<00:02:45.959> colonel<00:02:46.439> and<00:02:46.500> one

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
things are shown here by colonel and one

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.890 
things are shown here by colonel and one
don't<00:02:47.099> get<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.430> golems<00:02:47.849> to<00:02:48.180> go<00:02:48.389> through<00:02:48.659> right

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
don't get the golems to go through right

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.599 
don't get the golems to go through right
where<00:02:49.139> they<00:02:49.290> are<00:02:49.319> instead<00:02:49.889> you<00:02:50.099> blow<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.459> wall

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
where they are instead you blow the wall

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.190 
where they are instead you blow the wall
breakers<00:02:51.090> right<00:02:51.299> between<00:02:51.629> them<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:51.989> they'll

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
breakers right between them and they'll

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.539 
breakers right between them and they'll
pull<00:02:52.409> together<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.889> go<00:02:52.950> through<00:02:53.159> that<00:02:53.280> hole

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
pull together and go through that hole

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.640 
pull together and go through that hole
and<00:02:53.790> also<00:02:54.329> notice<00:02:54.629> how<00:02:54.659> while<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.139> gongs<00:02:55.379> were

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
and also notice how while the gongs were

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.409 
and also notice how while the gongs were
standing<00:02:56.069> at<00:02:56.159> the<00:02:56.280> walls<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.760> Wizards<00:02:57.120> behind

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
standing at the walls the Wizards behind
