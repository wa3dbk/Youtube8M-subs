00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
think that's going to do several things

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.490 
think that's going to do several things
it's<00:01:43.289> it's<00:01:43.829> mainly<00:01:44.219> going<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.700> improve

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
it's it's mainly going to improve

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.620 
it's it's mainly going to improve
I<00:01:45.560> think<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:45.800> quality<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.640> quantity<00:01:47.360> of

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
I think the quality and the quantity of

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.120 
I think the quality and the quantity of
the<00:01:47.840> submissions<00:01:48.350> we<00:01:48.470> have<00:01:48.620> because<00:01:48.980> it's

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
the submissions we have because it's

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.730 
the submissions we have because it's
going<00:01:49.280> to<00:01:49.340> give<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:49.580> guys<00:01:49.730> two<00:01:50.630> months<00:01:51.110> to

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
going to give you guys two months to

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.280 
going to give you guys two months to
capture<00:01:52.370> really<00:01:53.030> good<00:01:53.150> gameplay<00:01:53.600> footage<00:01:53.870> and

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
capture really good gameplay footage and

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.610 
capture really good gameplay footage and
record<00:01:54.979> your<00:01:55.100> commentaries<00:01:55.790> I<00:01:56.390> think<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:57.530> will

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
record your commentaries I think it will

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.109 
record your commentaries I think it will
also<00:01:58.450> increase<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.600> quantity<00:02:00.260> I<00:02:00.860> think<00:02:01.760> more

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
also increase the quantity I think more

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.510 
also increase the quantity I think more
of<00:02:02.150> you<00:02:02.420> will<00:02:02.450> probably<00:02:02.750> submit<00:02:03.710> videos<00:02:04.100> that

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
of you will probably submit videos that

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.710 
of you will probably submit videos that
way<00:02:06.520> it's<00:02:07.520> just<00:02:07.729> going<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:07.910> be<00:02:08.000> a<00:02:08.090> better

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
way it's just going to be a better

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.360 
way it's just going to be a better
choice<00:02:09.020> I<00:02:09.320> think<00:02:09.500> all<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.950> way<00:02:09.979> around<00:02:10.190> and

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
choice I think all the way around and
