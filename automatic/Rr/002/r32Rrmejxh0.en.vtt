00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.009
 today I want to show how we are 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.340
 use feeder gum for example i 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:24.699
 Fedor dam diameter 0 8 millimeters 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.730
 Browning skiing means we use it 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:31.110
 as follows in the snap do 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.760
 twist we take a piece of feeder gama 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.750
 We begin to twist it apart from 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.039
 We formed the twisted. 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.579
 here is an interesting moment if 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.260
 twist more than necessary 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.810
 it will not work very well 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.540
 cut down the fish so for a twist 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.460
 from such a feeder din 0 8 millimeters 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.590
 should be about five 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.329
 centimeters I had a problem once 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.700
 I could not catch fish when I had 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.100
 twist 10 centimeters that 's basically 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.869
 Here is the length of the feeder din enough and 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.189
 to fix the twist you need 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:09.670
 make a knot of eight, that is, we 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:12.880
 make a loop turn it not here 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.130
 we start in all nodes on the feeder scale 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.350
 there is one feature they do not need 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.280
 wet need to tighten very strongly 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.969
 i.e. feeder gama is very elastic 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.549
 the material is therefore not sparing it like this 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:30.069
 here and tighten the knot turned out 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.889
 we have a minimal knot 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:37.299
 which does not discharge you ask how 

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:40.119
 this fasten to snap how to tie 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:43.569
 leash something we have a cut 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.060
 feeder gama what's the catch of this twist 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.249
 all the lack of rigidity to 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.499
 hem didnâ€™t work that is hem 

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:52.810
 we do and then on big fish he 

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:55.149
 already begins to save our thin leash 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.279
 from the cliff walls works because 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.369
 just a piece of Brownings Skog 

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:03.130
 convulsions from this 8 millimeter very 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.700
 so soft you can say that on 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.369
 undercuts it might somehow still worsens 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.430
 our cutting but skru . 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.230
 quite a good job starts 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.680
 it stretches only upon application 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.060
 certain of such efforts in the snatch 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.550
 see her there is her length here and for 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.540
 the maximum, that is, the principle when fishing 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.110
 bream this 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:30.020
 distance enough to enter jerks there 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.880
 shaking her head she is cushioning everything 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.910
 back to the question of how to tie it 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.970
 so here we assume we have a braided 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.970
 cord 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.290
 that's him there we are well let's say there do not know 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.330
 here for a leash on paternoster and let's say 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.780
 we want to insert before the flood 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.780
 Berg, here we are in this petelechku threaded 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:02.569
 braided cord and knit ordinary knot 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:05.120
 Someone who likes it here is a choice for 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:12.400
 which node of the Byzantine you usually have here 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:17.230
 this albright he called him dragging down 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:21.440
 not very comfortable here without the help of the mouth 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:29.769
 plain teeth here I tied him off 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:31.790
 more precisely here a piece cut off pletenochki 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.519
 here we have turned out 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.010
 so here we have a challenge for the leash to 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.519
 tied to him feeder gam and 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.940
 at the end of the bundle on this bundle we take 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.069
 snood we pass the hook into the loop at once 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.870
 form such a stranglehold throw 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:53.030
 noose here on this place before the knot here 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.370
 and and we throw and tighten then 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.030
 just a lady quit smoking 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.150
 we have already checked this hundreds 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.459
 fishing does not break anything here 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.190
 nothing slips off that extra knots 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.250
 no, this is the main way in my opinion and 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:14.180
 most rational in use 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:16.100
 feeder-din such as Fedor at home 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.280
 browning because there are others 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.680
 feeder gama do not differ in their 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.770
 properties let dranovsky fedor ladies 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.050
 very much different later 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.250
 someday i will tell about him 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.020
 how to tie him like him 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.750
 use 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.800
 all this is probably what I wanted to say 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.360
 Showed how to use them and another form 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.520
