going to these outposts trying to lock

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.570 
going to these outposts trying to lock
it<00:01:19.049> down<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.619> ultimately<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.340> want<00:01:20.460> to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
it down and ultimately you want to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.420 
it down and ultimately you want to
destroy<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.060> AI<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:21.990> there's<00:01:22.409> still<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.950> human

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
destroy the AI but there's still a human

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.429 
destroy the AI but there's still a human
being<00:01:23.549> at<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.180> heart<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.689> somewhere<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
being at the heart of it somewhere and

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.560 
being at the heart of it somewhere and
so<00:01:25.950> there's<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.220> choice<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.460> make<00:01:26.729> also<00:01:27.299> about

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
so there's a choice to make also about

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.390 
so there's a choice to make also about
what<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.869> would<00:01:27.990> do<00:01:28.200> with<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.740> person<00:01:29.100> when

you find them commissions are quite a
diverse<00:01:32.040> set<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.610> gameplay<00:01:34.400> ultimately<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.520> is

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
diverse set of gameplay ultimately it is

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.390
