00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.160 
and I'll bet it starts boot looping it
did<00:02:36.599> last<00:02:36.840> time<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:38.360> we'll<00:02:39.360> see<00:02:39.629> there's<00:02:40.110> a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
did last time so we'll see there's a

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.970 
did last time so we'll see there's a
brand<00:02:40.409> new<00:02:40.560> motorola<00:02:40.890> logo<00:02:41.430> it's<00:02:41.610> red<00:02:41.879> now

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
brand new motorola logo it's red now

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.500 
brand new motorola logo it's red now
kind<00:02:43.980> of<00:02:44.069> cool<00:02:44.250> i<00:02:44.280> guess<00:02:44.400> different<00:02:45.390> and

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
kind of cool i guess different and

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.920 
kind of cool i guess different and
should<00:02:48.510> start<00:02:48.900> up<00:02:49.049> now<00:02:50.720> hopefully<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.780> doesn't

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
should start up now hopefully it doesn't

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.720 
should start up now hopefully it doesn't
boot<00:02:52.200> loop<00:02:52.410> if<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.799> does<00:02:52.950> i'll<00:02:53.220> just<00:02:53.400> fix<00:02:53.579> it

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
boot loop if it does i'll just fix it

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.849 
boot loop if it does i'll just fix it
real<00:02:53.910> quick<00:02:54.150> might<00:02:55.140> as<00:02:55.230> well<00:02:55.379> throw<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.739> in

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
real quick might as well throw that in

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.589 
real quick might as well throw that in
