00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
there you go think of myself eloping now

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.460 
there you go think of myself eloping now
if<00:01:56.720> you<00:01:56.840> want<00:01:57.050> to<00:01:57.110> get<00:01:57.260> here<00:01:57.470> hit<00:01:58.160> a<00:01:58.190> major<00:01:59.350> if<00:02:00.350> I

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
if you want to get here hit a major if I

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.040 
if you want to get here hit a major if I
wanted<00:02:00.800> in<00:02:00.920> my<00:02:00.950> mouth<00:02:01.250> man<00:02:01.520> doubled<00:02:02.420> up<00:02:02.510> more<00:02:02.750> I

wanted in my mouth man doubled up more I
was<00:02:03.260> just<00:02:03.500> trying<00:02:03.620> to<00:02:03.800> reverse<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.250> order<00:02:04.280> we

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
was just trying to reverse the order we

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.600 
was just trying to reverse the order we
gonna<00:02:04.970> let<00:02:05.120> the<00:02:05.240> zombium<00:02:05.750> made

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
gonna let the zombium made

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.910 
gonna let the zombium made
meant<00:02:07.790> to<00:02:07.850> get<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.060> kill<00:02:08.300> simpler<00:02:09.289> page<00:02:09.500> and

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
meant to get the kill simpler page and

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.040 
meant to get the kill simpler page and
then<00:02:10.610> you<00:02:10.700> can<00:02:10.880> actually<00:02:10.970> get<00:02:11.180> anyone<00:02:11.570> to<00:02:11.810> the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
then you can actually get anyone to the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.210 
then you can actually get anyone to the
Mothman<00:02:12.470> Spa<00:02:12.770> if<00:02:12.980> you're<00:02:13.010> throwing<00:02:13.990> whoever

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
Mothman Spa if you're throwing whoever

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.790 
Mothman Spa if you're throwing whoever
so<00:02:16.220> that's<00:02:16.730> what<00:02:17.240> you<00:02:17.330> could<00:02:17.510> do<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.800> level

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
so that's what you could do to level

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.220 
so that's what you could do to level
easily<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.610> then<00:02:19.940> just<00:02:20.180> make<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.600> stronger

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
easily and then just make it stronger

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.840 
easily and then just make it stronger
enemy<00:02:21.560> stronger<00:02:21.890> enemies<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.340> can<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.670> go

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
enemy stronger enemies and can you go

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.330 
enemy stronger enemies and can you go
