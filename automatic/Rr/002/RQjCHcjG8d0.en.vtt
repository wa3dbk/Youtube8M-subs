then<00:03:52.960> right<00:03:53.950> we<00:03:54.940> all<00:03:55.150> play<00:03:55.390> a<00:03:55.420> game<00:03:55.690> yeah<00:03:56.290> so<00:03:56.710> I

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
then right we all play a game yeah so I

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.820 
then right we all play a game yeah so I
think<00:03:58.000> that<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.480> cells<00:03:58.720> in<00:03:58.930> our<00:03:59.020> body<00:03:59.080> have<00:03:59.800> a

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
think that the cells in our body have a

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.800 
think that the cells in our body have a
similar<00:04:00.370> thing<00:04:00.400> happening<00:04:01.060> right<00:04:01.090> because

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
similar thing happening right because

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.440 
similar thing happening right because
every<00:04:02.080> time<00:04:02.290> a<00:04:02.710> cell<00:04:03.370> gets<00:04:03.610> replaced<00:04:04.030> it<00:04:04.270> has

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
every time a cell gets replaced it has

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.420 
every time a cell gets replaced it has
to<00:04:04.600> tell<00:04:04.780> that<00:04:04.900> new<00:04:05.170> cell<00:04:05.470> what<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.040> message

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
to tell that new cell what the message

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.420 
to tell that new cell what the message
is<00:04:06.460> and<00:04:06.990> I<00:04:07.990> think<00:04:08.260> that<00:04:08.410> part<00:04:08.680> of<00:04:08.770> Aging<00:04:09.280> is

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
is and I think that part of Aging is

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.700 
is and I think that part of Aging is
that<00:04:09.790> we<00:04:09.880> lose<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.360> original<00:04:10.450> messages<00:04:11.410> and

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
that we lose the original messages and

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.970 
that we lose the original messages and
the<00:04:12.610> moment<00:04:13.090> contains<00:04:13.960> the<00:04:14.170> original<00:04:14.740> message

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
the moment contains the original message

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.700 
the moment contains the original message
for<00:04:15.400> it<00:04:15.460> one<00:04:15.610> cells<00:04:16.049> so<00:04:17.049> when<00:04:17.170> you<00:04:17.320> drink

for it one cells so when you drink

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.470 
for it one cells so when you drink
