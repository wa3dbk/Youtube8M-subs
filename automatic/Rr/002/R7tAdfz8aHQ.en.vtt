00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello to all youtube friends in this 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.350
 video I wanted to show you the main ones 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.880
 crochet stitches then we leave 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.389
 saying that as you know this is a 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.150
 crochet 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.490
 there are of various sizes I am 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.560
 used to especially using the 4th e 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.760
 half the 6 because I tend to work 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.460
 caps or scarves so big things 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.640
 anyway for little things I do n't know 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.910
 you want to make placemats or that 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.500
 they are also deer incentive crochet hooks 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.660
 a millimeter 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:43.020
 obviously this here and I am composed 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.649
 accustomed as I said this to 4 and a half 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:53.360
 this does not net us 6 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:53.360
 otherwise there are also those two john companies 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:02.219
 goes to measure at 2 and a half mm four e 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.750
 half 6 there are also smaller ones 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.580
 have been outside I found them in 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:13.970
 I've never used a magazine that 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:13.970
 they are 110 and 175 are minors anyway 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.580
 according to the crochet you will have wool 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.030
 special when you go to buy the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.430
 wool on the packaging is written with 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.970
 how to use them as a bearing 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.380
 usually self r5 the hook will be at 4 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.340
 precisely this does not have to work with a 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.570
 crochet 4 and I hold a crochet hook 4 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:43.530
 and nothing these are the basic notions 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.149
 however let's see how to work 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.460
 how to start a job 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.090
 we always start by making chains 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.610
 to make them I pass twice the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.240
 thread the breath breath the thread that is 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.820
 behind the front that brings the thread that before 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:05.100
 stood in front gone behind the port 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:08.149
 in front of it I pass the finger 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.500
 I crochet the hook and made my knot 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.200
 this is the starting point 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.390
 now they go very well always have a 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.060
 work chains to make you 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.060
 see how it started by making 5 chains 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:29.340
 2 the chain and here crochet already 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:33.900
 inside a chain the thread passes 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:42.120
 behind crochet and in front and I do it 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:44.190
 go through none at 3 4 and 5 vi 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.970
 shows how to make the high half knit 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:52.850
 once the 5 chains are done I will go to increase 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:58.440
 of two others therefore goes 7 one and two 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:04.320
 now we work in the fifth jersey 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.760
 as I said before I do so then I go 12 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.800
 45 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:15.780
 then I load the thread on the hook 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:19.260
 enter the fifth peach tree and I will have three 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:23.430
 children on crochet load narro 4 the 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:28.290
 fourth thread will make it pass under i 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.450
 first three so and this is a half 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.080
 high jersey 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:37.820
 always for the next load up 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:42.630
 enter the peach chain I will have 3 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:46.170
 and ii load through 4 on the second 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:50.430
 for the third load within peach load 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:53.700
 pesco fourth inter load in the 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:59.130
 chain stitched out the thread for reloading I go out of 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:03.030
 three for the fifth load always wait 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:09.410
 no loaded pieces entered the 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:12.390
 peach chain the loaded wire and disk 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:18.000
 now to turn then work 2 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:20.090
 chains 1 and 2 and turn work and return to 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.490
 make the high half knit then load 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:29.759
 entered the peskov chain 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:34.590
 the load I extract load within peach 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:37.849
 load I take out and so on until I have it 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.849
 reached the desired length 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.090
 it will thus be a process 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.510
 I hope these tutorials have been there
