is<00:00:29.699> going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.000> be<00:00:30.269> able<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.630> take<00:00:30.810> double<00:00:31.260> A's

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
is going to be able to take double A's

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.040 
is going to be able to take double A's
or<00:00:31.880> certain<00:00:32.880> types<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.300> camera<00:00:33.660> batteries

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
or certain types of camera batteries

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.750 
or certain types of camera batteries
which<00:00:34.260> you'll<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:34.469> listed<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.520> site

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
which you'll see listed out on the site

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.889 
which you'll see listed out on the site
now<00:00:36.649> the<00:00:37.649> video<00:00:37.860> 160<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.879> kind<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.239> interesting

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
now the video 160 is kind of interesting

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.190 
now the video 160 is kind of interesting
because<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.890> has<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.399> back<00:00:41.850> for<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> battery

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
because it has a back for the battery

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.459 
because it has a back for the battery
cover<00:00:43.500> that's<00:00:44.040> opened<00:00:44.640> back<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.660> reason<00:00:45.899> for

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
cover that's opened back the reason for

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.680 
cover that's opened back the reason for
this<00:00:46.710> window<00:00:47.160> style<00:00:47.460> back<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.510> when

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
this window style back is so that when

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.080 
this window style back is so that when
you<00:00:48.840> go<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> put<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.559> those<00:00:49.800> larger<00:00:50.250> camera

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
you go to put in those larger camera

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.389 
you go to put in those larger camera
batteries<00:00:51.539> they<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> place<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:53.219> them<00:00:53.370> to

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
batteries they have a place for them to

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.180 
batteries they have a place for them to
kind<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.879> poke<00:00:54.149> out<00:00:54.649> otherwise<00:00:55.649> they<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:56.070> to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
kind of poke out otherwise they have to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.799 
kind of poke out otherwise they have to
make<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.579> know<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> lot<00:00:56.969> thicker<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.719> it

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
make the you know a lot thicker for it

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.510 
make the you know a lot thicker for it
to<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:58.109> able<00:00:58.170> being<00:00:58.710> closed<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.399> would

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
to be able being closed and it would

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.229 
to be able being closed and it would
just<00:00:59.699> be<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> much<00:01:00.270> bulkier<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.350> use<00:01:01.590> so

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
just be a much bulkier for you to use so

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.210 
just be a much bulkier for you to use so
this<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.449> still<00:01:03.719> going<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.110> work<00:01:04.290> however<00:01:04.559> for

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
this is still going to work however for

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.039 
this is still going to work however for
your<00:01:05.430> batteries<00:01:06.390> you're<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:06.990> to

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
your batteries you're just going to

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.640 
your batteries you're just going to
insert<00:01:07.439> them<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:08.390> here<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.170> double<00:01:10.500> A's

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
insert them in here in the double A's

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.980 
insert them in here in the double A's
that<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.549> take<00:01:11.760> six<00:01:12.240> double-a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
that is going to take six double-a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.999 
that is going to take six double-a
batteries<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.320> want<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.650> put<00:01:16.830> them

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
batteries so you just want to put them

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.070 
batteries so you just want to put them
in<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.670> tell<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.299> course<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.810> spring

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
in you can tell of course the spring

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.350 
in you can tell of course the spring
side<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.770> negative<00:01:19.979> side<00:01:22.909> there<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.060> once

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
side is the negative side there and once

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.960 
side is the negative side there and once
you<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.720> all<00:01:24.990> six<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.590> there<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.670> window

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
you have all six in there the window

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.210 
you have all six in there the window
will<00:01:27.180> go<00:01:27.299> over<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.259> encloses<00:01:29.040> them

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
will go over and it just encloses them

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.530 
will go over and it just encloses them
enough<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.759> they're<00:01:29.850> not<00:01:30.030> gonna<00:01:30.180> fall<00:01:30.509> out

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
enough that they're not gonna fall out

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.030 
enough that they're not gonna fall out
so<00:01:31.140> now<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.040> turn<00:01:32.250> your<00:01:32.610> unit<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:34.110> it

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
so now you can turn your unit on and it

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.580 
so now you can turn your unit on and it
is<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.310> dimmer<00:01:35.640> on/off<00:01:36.299> switch<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.229> can<00:01:37.380> see

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
is a dimmer on/off switch so you can see

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.109 
is a dimmer on/off switch so you can see
that<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:37.920> any<00:01:38.189> more<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.579> less<00:01:38.759> powerful

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
that like any more and less powerful

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.170 
that like any more and less powerful
there<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.229> also<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.560> battery<00:01:40.979> indicator<00:01:41.220> button

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
there is also a battery indicator button

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.090 
there is also a battery indicator button
on<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> back<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:43.049> press<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.770> it'll

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
on the back you can press it and it'll

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.440 
on the back you can press it and it'll
light<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.790> lights<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.240> show<00:01:45.390> you

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
light up the lights to show you

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.359 
light up the lights to show you
approximately<00:01:46.229> how<00:01:46.350> much<00:01:46.590> battery<00:01:46.829> power<00:01:47.070> you

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
approximately how much battery power you

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.010 
approximately how much battery power you
have<00:01:47.700> left<00:01:48.500> now<00:01:49.500> there<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.430> also<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:51.630> option

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
have left now there is also your option

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.050 
have left now there is also your option
on<00:01:52.140> filters<00:01:52.619> obviously<00:01:53.520> most<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.850> time

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
on filters obviously most the time
