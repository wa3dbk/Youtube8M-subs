00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
black and when it is daytime somewhere

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.479 
black and when it is daytime somewhere
like<00:00:50.640> Mexico<00:00:51.510> City<00:00:51.780> Mexico<00:00:51.920> we<00:00:52.920> can<00:00:53.129> see<00:00:53.309> that

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
like Mexico City Mexico we can see that

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.939 
like Mexico City Mexico we can see that
the<00:00:53.550> clock<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.180> then<00:00:54.539> white<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:55.530> that

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
the clock is then white just like that

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.310 
the clock is then white just like that
so<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:56.940> also<00:00:57.059> edit<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.629> position<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
so we can also edit the position of the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.779 
so we can also edit the position of the
clocks<00:00:58.590> if<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:58.890> don't<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.280> where<00:00:59.489> they<00:00:59.640> are

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
clocks if we don't like where they are

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.549 
clocks if we don't like where they are
we<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.090> go<00:01:00.239> ahead<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.449> just<00:01:00.690> move<00:01:00.930> them<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.379> we

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
we can go ahead and just move them as we

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.319 
we can go ahead and just move them as we
would<00:01:01.770> with<00:01:01.949> widgets<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.640> Notification

ahead and stop it so nothing really to
new<00:01:42.270> but<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> completely<00:01:43.740> new<00:01:44.220> design<00:01:44.430> of

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
new but it is a completely new design of

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.999 
new but it is a completely new design of
the<00:01:45.149> clock<00:01:45.360> application<00:01:45.600> I'm<00:01:46.290> guessing<00:01:46.979> that

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
the clock application I'm guessing that

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.999 
the clock application I'm guessing that
basis<00:01:47.670> off<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.299> same<00:01:48.710> application<00:01:49.710> as<00:01:49.829> it

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
basis off of the same application as it

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.700 
basis off of the same application as it
does<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.640> smaller<00:01:51.000> screen<00:01:51.600> devices<00:01:51.960> so

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
does on the smaller screen devices so

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.499 
does on the smaller screen devices so
here<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.369> timer<00:01:53.670> which<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.149> actually

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
here we have the timer which is actually

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.060 
here we have the timer which is actually
really<00:01:54.689> nice<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.229> one<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.500> my<00:01:55.649> favorite

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
really nice this is one of my favorite

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.679 
really nice this is one of my favorite
things<00:01:56.280> about<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.360> go<00:01:57.479> ahead<00:01:57.570> and

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
things about this you can go ahead and

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.630 
things about this you can go ahead and
start<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.469> set<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> timer<00:01:59.100> for<00:01:59.250> one

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
start it and we set the timer for one

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.609 
start it and we set the timer for one
minute<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.119> you'll<00:02:00.479> see<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.170> circle

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
minute and you'll see that this circle

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.499 
minute and you'll see that this circle
will<00:02:01.770> start<00:02:02.100> filling<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.180> will<00:02:03.299> go

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
will start filling in and it will go

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.630 
will start filling in and it will go
around<00:02:03.780> kind<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.229> like<00:02:04.439> old<00:02:04.770> movies<00:02:05.100> used<00:02:05.490> to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
around kind of like old movies used to

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.010 
around kind of like old movies used to
start<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.090> forget<00:02:06.390> what<00:02:06.479> it's<00:02:06.630> called<00:02:06.689> like<00:02:06.930> a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
start I forget what it's called like a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.020 
start I forget what it's called like a
start<00:02:07.320> timer<00:02:07.590> or<00:02:07.799> something<00:02:08.160> like<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.340> let

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
start timer or something like that let

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.130 
start timer or something like that let
me<00:02:09.119> know<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.360> comments<00:02:09.750> section<00:02:09.780> below

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
me know in the comments section below

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.250 
me know in the comments section below
but<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.400> timer<00:02:11.670> part<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.050> clock

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
but this is the timer part of the clock

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.940 
but this is the timer part of the clock
application

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
application

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.650 
application
I really<00:02:14.459> like<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.879> this<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.209> probably<00:02:15.420> my

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
I really like this this is probably my

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.809 
I really like this this is probably my
favorite<00:02:16.140> part<00:02:16.379> of<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:16.620> because<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.640> has

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
favorite part of this because it has

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.640 
favorite part of this because it has
this<00:02:18.000> really<00:02:18.239> nice<00:02:18.480> animation<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.319> lets<00:02:19.500> you

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
this really nice animation that lets you

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.920 
this really nice animation that lets you
know<00:02:19.830> when<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.760> timer<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.300> about<00:02:21.629> to<00:02:21.750> finish

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
know when the timer is about to finish

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.170 
know when the timer is about to finish
so<00:02:22.620> let's<00:02:22.769> go<00:02:22.890> ahead<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.099> hit<00:02:23.370> done<00:02:23.670> other

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
so let's go ahead and hit done other

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.240 
so let's go ahead and hit done other
additions<00:02:24.810> or<00:02:24.930> things<00:02:25.170> like<00:02:25.290> adding<00:02:25.739> sounds

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
additions or things like adding sounds

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.830 
additions or things like adding sounds
to<00:02:26.400> when<00:02:26.550> your<00:02:26.700> timer<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.180> finished<00:02:27.599> so<00:02:27.690> you

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
to when your timer is finished so you

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.509 
to when your timer is finished so you
can<00:02:27.959> go<00:02:28.110> ahead<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.290> set<00:02:28.709> any<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.129> the<00:02:29.250> standard

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
can go ahead and set any of the standard

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.030 
can go ahead and set any of the standard
iOS<00:02:30.120> sounds<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.690> play<00:02:30.900> when<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.349> timer<00:02:31.709> has

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
iOS sounds to play when the timer has

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.490 
iOS sounds to play when the timer has
completed<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:33.030> that's<00:02:33.690> about<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:33.989> for<00:02:34.260> the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
completed and that's about it for the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.199 
completed and that's about it for the
