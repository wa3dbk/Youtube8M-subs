00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 i 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.010
 in this video we will learn to do 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.500
 something they can use to decorate 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.230
 any space in just 10 minutes 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.540
 we are going to be able to make this work of art and 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.880
 best of all, they do not even have to 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.730
 know how to paint 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.090
 let's start by giving a base color 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.919
 solid acrylic paint or if they finish 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.079
 of painting the houses and he left painting 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.940
 to use are always when it is a 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.180
 vibrant color that inspired them that 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.720
 like it very much and good you can use a 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:44.470
 frame can use a wooden box 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.120
 of mdf or can even use a room 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.250
 of paper illustration depending on 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.199
 where they are going to hang their picture or if 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.199
 they're going to frame or if they're not going to frame 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.019
 when it's ready, we're going to leave 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.629
 Dry our acrylic paint very well 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.180
 it takes very little in tecka about 10 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.000
 maximum minutes when dry we go to 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:08.130
 place small plants that we cut can 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.130
 choose your favorite garden plant 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.810
 and we put it on our canvas 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.850
 when we have it well accommodated 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.590
 let's take a little more king tape and 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.590
 we will adhere to our surface 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.590
 that the king is out because if he does not 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.590
 will notice and we do not want to be noticed 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.670
 let's take spray paint is 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.310
 super important is to have sun and 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.890
 white color preference we shake very 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.560
 all right 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.260
 and in a ventilated space to a 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.110
 distance of about 30 centimeters go to 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.650
 start spraying everything very close 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.650
 up down 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.890
 until everything is well covered 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.890
 White color 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.920
 here I have another canvas that is painted 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.469
 from the purple color degraded towards color 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.719
 Rosita this is also going to look very 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.550
 father when it's finished because it's going 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.800
 to see the difference in colors 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.690
 to like of my plants of different 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.850
 way are another type of seedlings more 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.620
 stretched and I'll do the same 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.930
 procedure at a distance of 30 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.740
 centimeters I will apply the paint 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.740
 white spray 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.849
 it is important that they have the area well 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.470
 cover because the spray paint is 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.569
 super volatile and it's going to end all 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.579
 painted if they do not cover everything from 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.579
 newspaper or plastic 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.310
 we are going to let it dry too 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.189
 very fast dry spray paint is 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.960
 almost instantaneous and nothing else we are going to give 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.910
 a layer of spray paint 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.620
 We are going to remove our seedlings with 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.090
 take care and remove the masking that 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.090
 we put so that they were sustained 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.800
 and we will have something like that 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.120
 we repeat the same we remove our 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.120
 little plants 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.909
 and we have our work of art ready 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.840
