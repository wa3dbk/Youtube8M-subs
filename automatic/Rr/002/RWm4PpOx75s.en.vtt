bass<00:01:17.750> cuts<00:01:18.759> we've<00:01:19.759> also<00:01:19.970> designed<00:01:20.330> for<00:01:20.720> this<00:01:20.869> a

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
bass cuts we've also designed for this a

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.430 
bass cuts we've also designed for this a
fairly<00:01:22.280> unique<00:01:22.580> shock<00:01:22.910> mount<00:01:23.179> which<00:01:24.140> allows

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
fairly unique shock mount which allows

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.309 
fairly unique shock mount which allows
the<00:01:24.679> user<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:25.899> use<00:01:26.899> it<00:01:27.050> on<00:01:27.140> multiple

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
the user to use it on multiple

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.550 
the user to use it on multiple
applications<00:01:28.099> very<00:01:28.340> easily<00:01:28.580> so<00:01:29.289> this<00:01:30.289> slots

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
applications very easily so this slots

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.690 
applications very easily so this slots
in<00:01:30.740> here<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.039> if<00:01:31.099> you<00:01:31.130> want<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.399> use<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.550> for

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
in here and if you want to use it for

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.880 
in here and if you want to use it for
vote<00:01:31.940> for<00:01:32.330> vocals<00:01:32.720> or<00:01:33.229> to<00:01:33.319> get<00:01:33.440> down<00:01:33.619> onto<00:01:33.860> the

vote for vocals or to get down onto the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.229 
vote for vocals or to get down onto the
head<00:01:34.099> of<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.280> snare<00:01:34.520> drum<00:01:34.759> you<00:01:34.880> can<00:01:35.000> put<00:01:35.149> them

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:35.239 
head of a snare drum you can put them

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:36.940 
head of a snare drum you can put them
like<00:01:35.360> straight<00:01:35.750> down<00:01:35.959> flat<00:01:36.289> onto<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.709> very

like straight down flat onto it very

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.260 
like straight down flat onto it very
easily<00:01:37.130> without<00:01:37.489> the<00:01:37.610> shock<00:01:37.759> mount<00:01:37.970> being<00:01:38.149> in

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
easily without the shock mount being in

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.270 
easily without the shock mount being in
the<00:01:38.360> way<00:01:38.479> if<00:01:39.410> however<00:01:39.709> you're<00:01:39.920> trying<00:01:40.130> to<00:01:40.190> get

it<00:01:40.340> into<00:01:40.459> a<00:01:40.580> small<00:01:40.880> space<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:41.450> for<00:01:41.599> example<00:01:41.660> the

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:41.989 
it into a small space so for example the

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:43.419 
it into a small space so for example the
inside<00:01:42.380> of<00:01:42.410> a<00:01:42.560> kick<00:01:42.739> drum<00:01:42.770> through<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.280> hole

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.609 
the shock mount mount the microphone
inside<00:01:47.539> under<00:01:47.929> whether<00:01:48.050> you<00:01:48.110> can<00:01:48.200> get<00:01:48.319> that<00:01:48.470> up

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
inside under whether you can get that up

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.889 
inside under whether you can get that up
you<00:01:48.770> can<00:01:48.950> mount<00:01:49.580> it<00:01:49.729> inside<00:01:50.209> the<00:01:50.479> shock<00:01:50.690> mount

you can mount it inside the shock mount

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.540 
you can mount it inside the shock mount
so<00:01:51.050> it<00:01:51.140> takes<00:01:51.289> up<00:01:51.440> a<00:01:51.530> very<00:01:51.739> small<00:01:52.009> footprint

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
so it takes up a very small footprint

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.400 
so it takes up a very small footprint
and<00:01:52.670> cut<00:01:53.060> into<00:01:53.149> very<00:01:53.270> tight<00:01:53.660> spaces<00:01:53.959> which<00:01:54.259> is

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
and cut into very tight spaces which is

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.990 
and cut into very tight spaces which is
especially<00:01:55.190> useful<00:01:55.369> for<00:01:55.550> making<00:01:55.729> up

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
especially useful for making up

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.969 
especially useful for making up
instruments<00:01:56.420> like<00:01:56.450> drums<00:01:56.569> is<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:57.709> also

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
instruments like drums is it also

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.589 
instruments like drums is it also

year we'll be releasing samples out onto
the<00:03:07.480> market<00:03:07.690> around<00:03:08.680> about<00:03:08.980> May<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.280> they'll

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
the market around about May and they'll

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.729 
the market around about May and they'll
go<00:03:10.239> into<00:03:10.360> mass<00:03:10.540> production<00:03:10.570> well<00:03:11.500> mass

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
go into mass production well mass

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.110 
go into mass production well mass
production<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.160> say<00:03:12.310> they<00:03:12.430> very<00:03:12.610> expensive<00:03:12.640> so

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
production I say they very expensive so

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.490 
production I say they very expensive so
I<00:03:13.150> won't<00:03:13.300> be<00:03:13.390> that<00:03:13.510> many<00:03:13.660> but<00:03:13.870> they're<00:03:14.380> going

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
I won't be that many but they're going

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.750 
I won't be that many but they're going
to<00:03:14.560> be<00:03:14.620> going<00:03:14.830> at<00:03:14.920> around<00:03:15.010> about<00:03:15.160> September

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
to be going at around about September

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.360 
to be going at around about September
time<00:03:15.940> so<00:03:16.750> basically<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.769> collaboration

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
time so basically the collaboration

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.460 
time so basically the collaboration
involves<00:03:18.760> us<00:03:18.850> producing<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.750> capsules<00:03:20.350> for

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
involves us producing the capsules for

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.259 
involves us producing the capsules for
the<00:03:20.560> microphones<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.549> microphone<00:03:21.970> design

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
the microphones the microphone design

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.120 
the microphones the microphone design
itself<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.780> chassis<00:03:23.140> is<00:03:23.170> an<00:03:23.380> SE<00:03:23.620> product<00:03:23.980> as

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
itself the chassis is an SE product as

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.759 
itself the chassis is an SE product as
well<00:03:24.360> they<00:03:25.360> will<00:03:25.540> be<00:03:25.660> built<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.140> engineered

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
well they will be built and engineered

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.530 
well they will be built and engineered
in-house<00:03:27.220> at<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.519> SC<00:03:27.760> factory<00:03:28.120> as<00:03:28.239> we<00:03:28.360> do<00:03:28.450> with
