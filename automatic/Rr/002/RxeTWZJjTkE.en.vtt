you<00:01:33.900> don't<00:01:34.170> suppose<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.770> photoelectric

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
you don't suppose the photoelectric

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.130 
you don't suppose the photoelectric
cells<00:01:35.910> gone<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> blink<00:01:38.390> young<00:01:39.390> people<00:01:39.990> of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
cells gone on the blink young people of

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.560 
cells gone on the blink young people of
today<00:01:40.170> he<00:01:43.340> could<00:01:44.340> be<00:01:44.520> live<00:01:44.820> wire<00:01:45.150> could<00:01:45.870> be

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
today he could be live wire could be

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.230 
today he could be live wire could be
spark<00:01:48.570> light<00:01:48.990> here<00:01:49.909> now<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.150> think<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.840> problem

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
spark light here now I think the problem

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.920 
spark light here now I think the problem
using<00:01:55.550> live<00:01:56.550> wire<00:01:56.909> reckons<00:01:57.510> it<00:01:57.630> might<00:01:57.750> be<00:01:57.870> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
using live wire reckons it might be the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.960 
using live wire reckons it might be the
photoelectric<00:01:58.800> cell<00:01:59.100> okay<00:01:59.400> could<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.730> go<00:01:59.940> up

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
photoelectric cell okay could you go up

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.430 
photoelectric cell okay could you go up
there<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.300> take<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.690> look<00:02:02.810> no<00:02:03.810> perhaps<00:02:04.110> you're

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
there and take a look no perhaps you're

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.110 
there and take a look no perhaps you're
right<00:02:04.560> yeah<00:02:05.100> I'll<00:02:05.280> send<00:02:05.610> up<00:02:05.760> one<00:02:05.940> of<00:02:06.030> the
