00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.980
 art 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.200
 ideal to go out at night to dance or 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.630
 dine to start you always have to 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.570
 place a base glaze and I use the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.119
 diamond strange desvalijan sun this is 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.160
 fortifier and also protects so that 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.920
 the unit does not stay yellow something of 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.260
 place a colored glaze is excellent 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.599
 and also let it dry at least one 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.900
 minute before placing the enamel 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.900
 colour 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.120
 for the black enamel I chose the blackout 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.030
 of maybelline show color is 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.190
 spectacular his formula is in gel is 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.890
 ultra pigmented and also has a 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.199
 finished as bright very cute 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.780
 requires only two layers to have 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.390
 the spectacular color and in this case what 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.750
 I'm going to put in a nail like that and a nail 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.750
 do not 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.420
 and 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.149
 now for the nails that were free 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.939
 I chose the resin platinum cosmetics is 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.670
 a spectacular metallic silver this 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.689
 requires 2 to 3 thin layers to 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.909
 achieve the color of the container is really 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:48.679
 beautiful and manages to combine very well with 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.679
 the tachas that we are going to place after 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.750
 to protect the design of more help 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.990
 faster drying I use the mini 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.470
 bullet quick phoenix placed it in all 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.880
 the nails and finally on the nail where 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.880
 I'm going to place the little houses 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.220
 ah 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.560
 these are the little houses that I will be 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.480
 using to make this design the 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.440
 I got a store in Born MartÃ­ store 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.290
 online of inputs to create mylar very 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.000
 He placed them very funny after 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.060
 place a layer of the protector that 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.220
 I showed before and helped me with a pincer 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.560
 depilating do not worry if you do not stay in 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.630
 the exact place because you can go 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.860
 running they will see later that 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.860
 I show you this 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.280
 finally placed one more layer of this 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.079
 protector to make sure that the 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.310
 tiles do not move and they remain 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.310
 intact for longer 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.460
 and as I mentioned them, notice that they can 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.920
 go moving them gently to achieve 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.920
 that is in the right place and desired 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.310
 because to err is human and nobody is 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.560
 perfect with a swab measured in 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.390
 nail polish remover I will start cleaning 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.150
 edges of the nail where I spend with the 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.830
 enamel you can do the same if 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.830
 is that they do not have a good pulse like me 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.800
 and ready we finished that way the design was 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.440
 final I hope you liked it
