not<00:00:25.620> familiar<00:00:25.770> with<00:00:26.130> these<00:00:26.250> stealth<00:00:26.580> rides

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.049 

these<00:00:30.720> little<00:00:30.930> micro<00:00:31.170> RC<00:00:31.530> cars<00:00:32.039> that<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:33.030> a

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
these little micro RC cars that have a

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.920 
these little micro RC cars that have a
gimmick<00:00:33.710> where<00:00:34.710> they<00:00:34.829> they<00:00:35.370> fold<00:00:35.670> down<00:00:35.930> so

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
gimmick where they they fold down so

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.720 
gimmick where they they fold down so
that's<00:00:37.110> that's<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.530> car<00:00:37.770> right<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.250> folds

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
that's that's the car right but it folds

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.500 
that's that's the car right but it folds
there<00:00:39.660> are<00:00:39.750> better<00:00:39.900> pictures<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:41.120> older<00:00:42.120> well

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
there are better pictures of older well

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.200 
there are better pictures of older well
I<00:00:42.780> guess<00:00:43.170> that's<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.590> folds<00:00:43.980> not<00:00:44.610> completely

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
I guess that's it folds not completely

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.370 
I guess that's it folds not completely
flat<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.630> says<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.020> falls<00:00:46.650> flat<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:48.380> really

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
flat it says it falls flat but really

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.310 
flat it says it falls flat but really
slim<00:00:49.710> fit<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.910> slides<00:00:51.270> right<00:00:51.420> into<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
slim fit it slides right into the the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.889 
slim fit it slides right into the the
controller<00:00:52.880> I'll<00:00:53.880> really<00:00:54.329> care<00:00:54.600> about<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
controller I'll really care about the

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.900 
controller I'll really care about the
gimmick<00:00:55.200> but<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.370> fact<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.670> some

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
gimmick but just the fact that some

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.560 
gimmick but just the fact that some

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.010 
basically hot wheel size I wouldn't say
exactly<00:02:15.110> one<00:02:15.530> sixty-fourth<00:02:16.220> scale<00:02:16.550> but<00:02:17.020> it's

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
exactly one sixty-fourth scale but it's

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.990 
exactly one sixty-fourth scale but it's
around<00:02:18.350> there<00:02:18.590> when<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.220> do<00:02:19.370> review<00:02:19.820> it<00:02:19.910> i'll

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
around there when I do review it i'll

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.840 
around there when I do review it i'll
probably<00:02:20.240> show<00:02:21.080> some<00:02:21.110> comparisons<00:02:22.010> it's<00:02:22.640> it's

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
probably show some comparisons it's it's

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.560 
probably show some comparisons it's it's
small<00:02:23.120> enough<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.690> it's<00:02:24.170> probably<00:02:24.500> uh

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
small enough and it's probably uh

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.650 
small enough and it's probably uh
probably<00:02:26.570> just<00:02:26.870> about<00:02:27.110> right<00:02:27.560> anyway<00:02:28.250> because

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
probably just about right anyway because

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.690 
probably just about right anyway because
you<00:02:29.660> know<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.050> tumbler<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:30.800> would<00:02:31.100> be<00:02:31.280> you

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
you know it is a tumbler it would be you

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.810 
you know it is a tumbler it would be you
know<00:02:31.820> a<00:02:31.850> little<00:02:32.060> larger<00:02:32.630> than<00:02:32.660> then<00:02:33.350> um<00:02:33.790> been<00:02:34.790> a

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
know a little larger than then um been a

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.900 
know a little larger than then um been a
regular<00:02:35.060> car<00:02:35.480> or<00:02:35.660> something<00:02:35.930> which<00:02:36.470> i<00:02:37.340> believe

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
regular car or something which i believe

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.640 
regular car or something which i believe
it<00:02:38.300> is<00:02:38.330> just<00:02:38.690> slightly<00:02:38.959> larger<00:02:39.470> than<00:02:39.500> a

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
it is just slightly larger than a

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.100 
it is just slightly larger than a
regular<00:02:39.860> hot<00:02:40.190> wheels<00:02:40.400> car<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:41.600> know<00:02:41.690> it's

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
regular hot wheels car you know it's

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.770 
regular hot wheels car you know it's
basically<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.620> tank<00:02:42.950> own<00:02:43.160> on<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:44.090> know<00:02:44.209> four

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
basically a tank own on you know four

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.970 
basically a tank own on you know four
wheels<00:02:45.110> so<00:02:46.570> there<00:02:47.570> you<00:02:47.720> have<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:47.930> saw<00:02:48.680> wheels
