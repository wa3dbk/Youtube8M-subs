probably<00:02:12.800> should<00:02:13.010> have<00:02:13.069> left<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.370> crates<00:02:13.640> a

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
probably should have left the crates a

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.699 
probably should have left the crates a
lot<00:02:13.849> earlier<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.360> don't<00:02:15.290> know<00:02:15.379> if<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.560> was<00:02:15.680> a

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
lot earlier I don't know if it was a

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.979 
lot earlier I don't know if it was a
miscommunication<00:02:16.040> or<00:02:16.730> what<00:02:17.209> happened<00:02:17.510> me<00:02:17.870> and

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
miscommunication or what happened me and

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.509 
miscommunication or what happened me and
Nestle<00:02:18.230> just<00:02:18.379> gots<00:02:18.530> laid<00:02:18.709> down<00:02:18.920> too<00:02:19.099> early<00:02:19.370> but

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
Nestle just gots laid down too early but

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.220 
Nestle just gots laid down too early but
if<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:20.420> start<00:02:20.569> getting<00:02:20.690> slide<00:02:21.019> like<00:02:21.200> that

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
if you start getting slide like that

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.170 
if you start getting slide like that
then<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.739> immediately<00:02:22.280> just<00:02:22.790> need<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.030> back

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
then you immediately just need to back

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.630 
then you immediately just need to back
up<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.540> be<00:02:23.659> look<00:02:23.930> towards<00:02:24.170> beef<00:02:24.409> like<00:02:24.590> so<00:02:25.489> now

on bedside that's on meaning that is

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.410 
on bedside that's on meaning that is

really easy to spawn trap
from<00:02:32.599> you<00:02:32.780> know<00:02:33.140> if<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.620> have<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:33.830> HB<00:02:34.670> is<00:02:34.849> really

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
from you know if you have a HB is really

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.910 
from you know if you have a HB is really
easy<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.390> spawn<00:02:35.569> trap<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.870> team<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:36.230> see<00:02:36.349> now

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
easy to spawn trap the team and see now

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.380 
easy to spawn trap the team and see now
I<00:02:36.950> just<00:02:37.099> hopped<00:02:37.459> on<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.610> flagrant<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:38.150> loan

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
I just hopped on the flagrant that loan

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.820 
I just hopped on the flagrant that loan
probably<00:02:38.930> should<00:02:39.080> not<00:02:39.200> have<00:02:39.319> done<00:02:39.440> that<00:02:39.500> price

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
probably should not have done that price

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.620 
probably should not have done that price
should<00:02:39.920> away<00:02:40.069> for<00:02:40.220> my<00:02:40.280> team<00:02:40.459> but<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.880> believe

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
should away for my team but I believe

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.080 
should away for my team but I believe
des<00:02:42.470> low<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:43.040> think<00:02:43.280> I<00:02:43.340> think<00:02:43.520> Nestle<00:02:43.760> picked<00:02:44.000> it

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
des low I think I think Nestle picked it

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.850 
des low I think I think Nestle picked it
up<00:02:44.180> in<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.450> neutralizing<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.349> so<00:02:45.440> now<00:02:45.560> we<00:02:45.620> just

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
up in the neutralizing it so now we just

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.050 
up in the neutralizing it so now we just
have<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:45.980> try<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.220> nate<00:02:46.400> them<00:02:46.550> off<00:02:46.640> but<00:02:46.849> they

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
have to try to nate them off but they

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.840 
have to try to nate them off but they
end<00:02:47.480> up<00:02:47.569> getting<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.900> back<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:49.040> is<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.520> is<00:02:49.550> good

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
end up getting it back it is it is good

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.760 
end up getting it back it is it is good

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.210 
to be just running out of front white
because<00:04:12.410> they're<00:04:12.590> not<00:04:12.650> going<00:04:12.769> to<00:04:12.829> spawn<00:04:13.040> and

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
because they're not going to spawn and

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.130 
because they're not going to spawn and
bottom<00:04:13.400> white<00:04:13.549> but<00:04:14.299> we<00:04:14.480> we<00:04:14.720> end<00:04:14.840> up<00:04:14.930> getting

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
bottom white but we we end up getting

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.180 
bottom white but we we end up getting
slide<00:04:15.380> down<00:04:15.590> that's<00:04:15.799> one<00:04:15.920> of<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.070> biggest

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
slide down that's one of the biggest

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.219 
slide down that's one of the biggest
things<00:04:16.459> about<00:04:16.579> domination<00:04:17.000> is<00:04:17.299> once<00:04:17.989> you<00:04:18.079> get

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
things about domination is once you get

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.840 
things about domination is once you get

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.430 
first blood try to treat it like SD just

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
victim of a first blood because then

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.029 
victim of a first blood because then
that<00:04:26.300> allows<00:04:26.570> them<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:26.990> group<00:04:27.350> up<00:04:27.530> and<00:04:27.919> they

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
that allows them to group up and they

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.500 
that allows them to group up and they
had<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.310> number<00:04:28.610> of<00:04:28.669> Energon<00:04:29.030> your<00:04:29.180> teammates

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
had the number of Energon your teammates

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.430 
had the number of Energon your teammates
so<00:04:30.340> with<00:04:31.340> about<00:04:31.490> a<00:04:31.550> minute<00:04:31.729> left<00:04:32.440> complexity

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
so with about a minute left complexity

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.719 
so with about a minute left complexity
we<00:04:33.530> have<00:04:33.650> two<00:04:33.740> three<00:04:33.919> campus<00:04:34.280> here<00:04:34.400> to<00:04:34.490> beat<00:04:34.610> us

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
we have two three campus here to beat us

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.820 
we have two three campus here to beat us
on<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:34.970> side<00:04:35.210> so<00:04:36.169> we're<00:04:36.350> just<00:04:36.380> kind<00:04:36.590> of<00:04:36.620> taking

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
on the side so we're just kind of taking

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.260 
on the side so we're just kind of taking

picking up this gown i'm using the

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.620 
picking up this gown i'm using the

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
grip i prefer the tar on land but i like

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.750 
grip i prefer the tar on land but i like
the<00:04:44.570> vector<00:04:44.840> online

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
the vector online

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.430 
the vector online
and<00:04:46.760> right<00:04:46.970> here<00:04:47.000> they're<00:04:47.270> just<00:04:47.780> having<00:04:47.900> a<00:04:48.050> BC

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
and right here they're just having a BC

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
and right here they're just having a BC
theory<00:04:48.650> jumps<00:04:48.950> on<00:04:49.070> it<00:04:49.100> to<00:04:49.280> try<00:04:49.370> the

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
theory jumps on it to try the

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.150 
theory jumps on it to try the
neutralizer<00:04:49.970> I<00:04:50.360> mean<00:04:50.660> uh<00:04:50.690> try<00:04:51.530> to<00:04:51.590> contest'<00:04:51.980> it

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
neutralizer I mean uh try to contest' it

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.220 
neutralizer I mean uh try to contest' it
he<00:04:52.370> ends<00:04:52.490> up<00:04:52.610> picking<00:04:52.730> up<00:04:52.910> a<00:04:53.030> kill<00:04:53.240> they<00:04:53.930> they

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
he ends up picking up a kill they they

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.300 
he ends up picking up a kill they they
kill<00:04:54.410> him<00:04:54.590> there's<00:04:54.770> still<00:04:54.889> camping<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.160> flag

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
kill him there's still camping the flag

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.010 
kill him there's still camping the flag
but<00:04:55.490> we<00:04:55.790> end<00:04:55.910> up<00:04:55.970> getting<00:04:56.210> mall<00:04:56.360> off<00:04:56.540> so<00:04:56.690> I<00:04:56.720> all

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
but we end up getting mall off so I all

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.450 
but we end up getting mall off so I all
right<00:04:57.110> let's<00:04:57.230> just<00:04:57.350> jump<00:04:57.530> it<00:04:57.710> I<00:04:57.860> jump<00:04:58.370> down

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
right let's just jump it I jump down

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.560 
right let's just jump it I jump down
right<00:04:58.639> there<00:04:58.790> the<00:04:58.940> reason<00:04:59.150> why<00:04:59.240> I<00:04:59.270> jumped<00:04:59.450> down

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
right there the reason why I jumped down

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.909 
right there the reason why I jumped down
is<00:04:59.720> a<00:04:59.780> lot<00:04:59.930> of<00:05:00.020> times<00:05:00.169> I'll<00:05:00.500> jump<00:05:00.710> on<00:05:00.830> that

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
is a lot of times I'll jump on that

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.140 
is a lot of times I'll jump on that
train<00:05:01.130> not<00:05:01.280> thanking<00:05:01.639> and<00:05:01.820> they'll<00:05:01.910> just<00:05:02.030> come

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
train not thanking and they'll just come

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.540 
train not thanking and they'll just come
medallion<00:05:02.660> pick<00:05:02.780> me<00:05:02.900> off<00:05:03.020> so<00:05:03.230> really<00:05:04.160> if<00:05:04.370> you

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550

medallion pick me off so really if you
if<00:05:04.820> you<00:05:04.910> have<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.150> sea<00:05:05.300> flagon<00:05:05.660> you're<00:05:05.750> in

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
if you have the sea flagon you're in

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.150 
if you have the sea flagon you're in
their<00:05:06.050> spawning<00:05:06.290> a<00:05:06.470> you<00:05:06.530> don't<00:05:06.830> really<00:05:06.919> want

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
their spawning a you don't really want

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.530 
their spawning a you don't really want
to<00:05:07.190> hop<00:05:07.310> on<00:05:07.490> the<00:05:07.520> top<00:05:07.700> trains<00:05:07.970> too<00:05:08.150> much<00:05:08.300> unless

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
to hop on the top trains too much unless

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.940 
to hop on the top trains too much unless
you<00:05:08.660> know<00:05:08.810> they're<00:05:09.020> spawning<00:05:09.230> crates<00:05:09.620> because

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
you know they're spawning crates because

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.260 
you know they're spawning crates because
they<00:05:10.100> can<00:05:10.250> just<00:05:10.400> go<00:05:10.490> mid<00:05:10.700> alley<00:05:10.850> and<00:05:11.030> pick<00:05:11.150> you

they can just go mid alley and pick you

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.810 
they can just go mid alley and pick you
off<00:05:11.419> by<00:05:12.139> there's<00:05:12.680> about<00:05:12.830> 20<00:05:13.130> seconds<00:05:13.430> left<00:05:13.639> in

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820
