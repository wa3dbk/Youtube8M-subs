00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.000
 Christmas tree we are going to teach you 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.610
 do this cane cited sugar with 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.990
 cool even for him to place it in the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.990
 tree once it is dry 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.250
 let's make the cane cited candy 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.410
 as I have done before in green and 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.020
 white so you can see how it looks now 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.420
 let's do in red in white very 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.920
 easy with a little white fondant 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.230
 let's make a roller well you know 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.260
 that the other day we told you or you can 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.100
 do it like that with your hands or if you think 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.470
 easier with the pantilina to smooth the 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.720
 cakes 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.110
 You can procrastination and then what happens 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.400
 that you will always be more 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.070
 uniform with your fingers because many 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.100
 sometimes with fingers we tend to leave 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.590
 lumps in let's say the liters we do 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.680
 So the truth is that if we do it 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.820
 with this that aside that is very easy not 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.250
 it sticks is very comfortable we will stay 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.530
 more uniform you can help that yes a 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.470
 let's just say with your fingers on 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.690
 extremes for let's say help you so that 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:28.710
 can run faster and does not stick to the 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.710
 work mat 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.740
 so white and good I'm 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.740
 doing so long enough so that 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.650
 you see the size me because I am 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.590
 doing so great because I 'm going to 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.080
 use these to decorate my tree 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.700
 Christmas that will be super cool and 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.890
 so you can do it for the children 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.570
 little ones are going to have a lot of fun but if 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.250
 you would like them for cupcakes 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.250
 you just have to do them more 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.320
 small but this I already tell you that I'm not going 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.520
 to put my Christmas tree this year 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.520
 we'll see 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.890
 It was a super sweet super cool 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.640
 then with the roll we are going to do the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.640
 red curl 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.110
 and we stretch well you see that easy and fast 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.020
 fear us 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.990
 because many times there are people who 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.510
 he says is that they hit me nothing without fear 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.470
 you already know that this is all start and 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.680
 put that if the first one does not come out or 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.520
 the second or third will come out but what 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.900
 you have to lose your fear 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.409
 Let's see 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.720
 I believe that with this I have enough 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.660
 I'm going to cut the fat areas what I do not 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.540
 I need so much 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.569
 what are we going to do now we are going to 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.260
 roll up like this 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.260
 OK 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.920
 and now we knead it together so that it 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.959
 stick and have the texture of candy 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.140
 because we do not want us to stay in 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.420
 way of say of sailor knots that 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.510
 you could say it looks like this if you do not 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:23.280
 You see that it goes like uniting red and 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.750
 white is already a candy shape 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.210
 lifetime 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.210
 so we are doing it like this with careful 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.990
 as themselves if you then anise less 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.650
 because we will be more wide lines or 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.650
 less wide 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.190
 let's cut here 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.330
 Here we go 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.420
 and let's go back 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.190
 Knead together this must be done with a 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.100
 little bit of care because there are times 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:00.760
 the two colors are detached then there is 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:04.300
 let's say do it little by little and 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.660
 joining it well so that the two colors 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.850
 join and then do not crack and you 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.370
 crack or let go of one of the 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.420
 another once this is gone 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.420
 it looks perfect 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.180
 you see like this with patience and calmly 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.740
 you see that 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.600
 and we cut through here and here you see what 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.230
 nice you can see you've joined and 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.120
 it is totally smooth 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.420
 it's perfect then what do we do 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.840
 simply 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.550
 we put like this and cut to the extent that 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.970
 You want me to tell you what I'm going to do 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.190
 big to decorate my tree you see a 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:51.380
 thing so the only thing that you have to leave it 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:53.360
 dry because this one is dry you see and 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.090
 then simply letting it dry 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.980
 you could not hang up anymore and if you want 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.410
 make smaller because you can also 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.100
 make these little ones to decorate 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.100
 cupcakes
