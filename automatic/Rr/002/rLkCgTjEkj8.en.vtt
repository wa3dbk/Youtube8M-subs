00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.920 
find while you're usually free and I
would<00:01:14.220> suggest<00:01:14.370> that<00:01:14.670> as<00:01:14.940> long<00:01:15.060> as<00:01:15.120> the<00:01:15.390> rim<00:01:15.900> of

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
would suggest that as long as the rim of

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.040 
would suggest that as long as the rim of
the<00:01:16.260> the<00:01:16.830> bucket<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.490> okay<00:01:17.850> they<00:01:18.570> use<00:01:18.780> you

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
the the bucket is okay they use you

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.560 
the the bucket is okay they use you
spend<00:01:19.350> your<00:01:19.470> money<00:01:19.620> on<00:01:19.710> your<00:01:19.920> bucket<00:01:20.100> lid<00:01:20.570> but

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
spend your money on your bucket lid but

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.390 
spend your money on your bucket lid but
occasionally<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.440> can<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.680> decent<00:01:22.950> bucket

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
occasionally you can get decent bucket

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.160 
occasionally you can get decent bucket
lids<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.820> don't<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.450> soy<00:01:24.600> sauce<00:01:24.720> buckle

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
lids I don't like the soy sauce buckle

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
lids I don't like the soy sauce buckle
it's<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:25.440> they<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.650> pour<00:01:25.890> spouts

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
it's because they have pour spouts

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.490 
it's because they have pour spouts
though<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:27.630> anyway<00:01:27.870> I<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.080> these<00:01:28.260> lids

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
though so anyway I like these lids

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.770 
though so anyway I like these lids
because<00:01:28.920> they<00:01:29.550> will<00:01:29.700> seal<00:01:29.940> it<00:01:30.090> up<00:01:30.150> now<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.630> do

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
because they will seal it up now I do

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.780 
because they will seal it up now I do
think<00:01:31.200> there's<00:01:31.380> definitely<00:01:31.650> room<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.370> gamma

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
think there's definitely room for gamma

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.250 
think there's definitely room for gamma
lights<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.210> gamma<00:01:33.420> lids<00:01:33.630> are<00:01:33.750> expensive

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
lights but gamma lids are expensive

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.100 
lights but gamma lids are expensive

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
seen buckets that have different kind of

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.530 
seen buckets that have different kind of
like<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> screw<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.780> lid<00:01:52.610> but<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.940> also<00:01:54.030> accept

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
like a screw on lid but can also accept

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.320 
like a screw on lid but can also accept
five-gallon<00:01:55.170> lids<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.590> that's<00:01:56.180> those<00:01:57.180> are

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
five-gallon lids and that's those are

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.720 
five-gallon lids and that's those are
cool<00:01:57.450> too<00:01:57.659> but<00:01:57.900> so<00:01:58.560> what<00:01:58.890> i<00:01:58.920> find<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.370> is<00:01:59.490> that

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
cool too but so what i find it is that

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.520 
cool too but so what i find it is that
if<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.030> put<00:02:00.180> these<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.570> all<00:02:00.720> your<00:02:00.840> buckets<00:02:01.290> and

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
if you put these on all your buckets and

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.000 
if you put these on all your buckets and
then<00:02:02.040> buy<00:02:02.310> yourself<00:02:02.909> some<00:02:03.150> gamma<00:02:03.420> lids<00:02:04.010> as

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
then buy yourself some gamma lids as

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.199 
then buy yourself some gamma lids as
well<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:06.180> idea<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.870> me<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.650> you<00:02:07.890> can<00:02:08.209> pop

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
well the idea to me is that you can pop

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.699 
well the idea to me is that you can pop
up<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.569> your<00:02:09.599> bucket<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.200> then<00:02:10.440> if<00:02:10.530> it's

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
up in your bucket and then if it's

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.930 
up in your bucket and then if it's
something<00:02:10.920> you're<00:02:11.069> going<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.250> be<00:02:11.400> accessing

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
something you're going to be accessing

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.750 
something you're going to be accessing
on<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.330> regular<00:02:12.599> basis<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:14.280> just<00:02:14.489> put<00:02:14.639> on

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
on a regular basis is you just put on

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.729 
on a regular basis is you just put on
your<00:02:14.909> gamma<00:02:15.180> ring<00:02:15.749> which<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.439> you<00:02:16.560> can<00:02:16.709> see

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
your gamma ring which is you can see

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.360 
your gamma ring which is you can see
it's<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.909> pretty<00:02:18.749> robust<00:02:19.230> ring<00:02:19.650> here

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
it's a pretty robust ring here

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.420 
it's a pretty robust ring here
and<00:02:20.489> then<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.480> has<00:02:21.629> threads<00:02:22.110> on<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.409> inside<00:02:23.250> of

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
and then it has threads on the inside of

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.890 
and then it has threads on the inside of
it<00:02:23.549> here<00:02:23.849> and<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.810> gamma<00:02:25.080> lid<00:02:25.379> just<00:02:26.629> you<00:02:27.629> put

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
it here and the gamma lid just you put

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.899 
it here and the gamma lid just you put
you<00:02:28.110> screw<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.530> down<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.159> and<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.640> tightens

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
you screw that down in and it tightens

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.479 
you screw that down in and it tightens
it<00:02:30.180> up<00:02:30.950> tightens<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.040> up<00:02:32.239> and<00:02:33.239> then<00:02:33.959> it's

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
it up tightens it up and then it's

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.220 
it up tightens it up and then it's
airtight<00:02:35.489> ish<00:02:35.700> or<00:02:36.030> close<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.540> airtight<00:02:36.900> if<00:02:37.049> not

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
airtight ish or close to airtight if not

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.649 
airtight ish or close to airtight if not
and<00:02:37.530> then<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.459> can<00:02:38.849> easily<00:02:39.209> open<00:02:39.510> it

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
and then you you can easily open it

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.110 
and then you you can easily open it
reopen<00:02:40.230> use<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:41.010> then<00:02:41.730> we<00:02:41.849> are<00:02:41.970> done

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
reopen use this and then we are done

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.610 
reopen use this and then we are done
with<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.420> bucket<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.900> can<00:02:43.049> either<00:02:43.170> clean<00:02:43.500> it

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
with that bucket you can either clean it

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.860 
with that bucket you can either clean it
out<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:43.980> reuse<00:02:44.129> it<00:02:44.310> or<00:02:44.640> move<00:02:45.239> this<00:02:45.450> lid<00:02:45.690> to

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
out and reuse it or move this lid to

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.580 
out and reuse it or move this lid to
another<00:02:46.110> bucket<00:02:46.349> which<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.890> pretty<00:02:47.040> cool<00:02:48.590> the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
another bucket which is pretty cool the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.920 
another bucket which is pretty cool the
other<00:02:49.709> thing<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.430> i<00:02:50.940> kind<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.480> think<00:02:51.720> is

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
other thing is that i kind of think is

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.420 
other thing is that i kind of think is
one<00:02:52.260> of<00:02:52.290> my<00:02:52.440> little<00:02:52.590> philosophies<00:02:53.250> and

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
one of my little philosophies and

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.729 
one of my little philosophies and
long-term<00:02:54.000> food<00:02:54.239> storage<00:02:54.299> is<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.109> get

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
long-term food storage is that get

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.589 
long-term food storage is that get
yourself<00:02:56.160> some<00:02:56.220> two<00:02:56.519> gallon<00:02:56.849> buckets<00:02:57.239> these

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
yourself some two gallon buckets these

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.199 
yourself some two gallon buckets these
are<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.959> small<00:02:58.470> buckets<00:02:58.980> there<00:02:59.910> are<00:03:00.000> little

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
are the small buckets there are little

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.400 
are the small buckets there are little
little<00:03:00.870> ones<00:03:01.019> like<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.500> yeah<00:03:02.280> two<00:03:02.519> gallon

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
little ones like this yeah two gallon

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.140 
little ones like this yeah two gallon
two<00:03:04.410> gallon<00:03:04.680> buckets<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.489> get<00:03:05.640> yourself<00:03:06.000> some

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
two gallon buckets and get yourself some

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.780 
two gallon buckets and get yourself some
gamma<00:03:06.390> lids<00:03:06.690> if<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.680> open<00:03:07.829> up<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.159> five-gallon

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
gamma lids if you open up a five-gallon

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.190 
gamma lids if you open up a five-gallon
bucket<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:10.519> say<00:03:11.519> hard<00:03:12.510> red<00:03:12.720> wheat<00:03:12.989> or

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
bucket of say hard red wheat or

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.569 
bucket of say hard red wheat or
something<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.769> you're<00:03:13.859> not<00:03:13.920> going<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.280> use<00:03:14.400> it

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
something and you're not going to use it

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.300 
something and you're not going to use it
all<00:03:14.700> or<00:03:14.940> maybe<00:03:15.569> you<00:03:16.290> want<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.560> grind<00:03:16.799> up<00:03:17.040> a

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
all or maybe you want to grind up a

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.729 
all or maybe you want to grind up a
whole<00:03:18.290> two<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:20.129> pet<00:03:20.400> two<00:03:20.909> gallons<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.599> it<00:03:21.780> you

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
whole two to pet two gallons of it you

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.800 
whole two to pet two gallons of it you
could<00:03:22.890> grind<00:03:23.159> up<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.640> whole<00:03:23.849> two<00:03:24.150> gallons<00:03:24.569> of<00:03:24.690> it

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
could grind up a whole two gallons of it

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.289 
could grind up a whole two gallons of it
and<00:03:24.989> then<00:03:25.169> you<00:03:25.530> have<00:03:25.680> this<00:03:25.859> extra<00:03:26.489> empty<00:03:27.090> two

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
and then you have this extra empty two

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.039 
and then you have this extra empty two
gallon<00:03:27.950> bucket<00:03:28.950> with<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.480> gamma<00:03:30.480> lid<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.930> you

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
gallon bucket with a gamma lid that you

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.710 
gallon bucket with a gamma lid that you
can<00:03:31.230> dispense<00:03:31.709> that<00:03:31.980> flower<00:03:32.280> from<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:33.540> you

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
can dispense that flower from that you

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.599 
can dispense that flower from that you
just<00:03:33.959> ground<00:03:34.200> up<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.650> still<00:03:34.889> keep<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.280> fresh

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
just ground up and still keep it fresh

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.909 
just ground up and still keep it fresh
and<00:03:35.910> that<00:03:36.000> way<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.750> can<00:03:37.049> have<00:03:37.290> all<00:03:37.530> the

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
and that way you can have all the

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.589 
and that way you can have all the
grinding<00:03:38.310> done<00:03:38.519> at<00:03:38.669> once<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.120> not<00:03:39.239> have<00:03:39.450> to

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
grinding done at once and not have to

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.289 
grinding done at once and not have to
say<00:03:39.840> grind<00:03:40.230> wheat<00:03:40.470> every<00:03:41.010> every<00:03:41.910> day<00:03:42.090> or

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
say grind wheat every every day or

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.479 
say grind wheat every every day or
something<00:03:42.599> you<00:03:43.319> could<00:03:43.500> just<00:03:43.590> have<00:03:43.799> a<00:03:43.829> maybe<00:03:44.400> a

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
something you could just have a maybe a

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.819
