00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello to all and with that of tess 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.919
 mobile.fr we are at mwc 2014 on the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.530
 htc stand that presents two novelties 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.670
 desire then there I have one here this is the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.560
 610 there at the 8 116 these two terminals 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.720
 it's really new to new 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.000
 HTC terminals at the desired range 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.130
 what is important the 2nd to say in 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.269
 introduction I would say it's really the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.460
 new is a new adventure 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.099
 design for for htc on this range 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.570
 desire we find a close spirit 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.250
 finally you see when to watch it 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.170
 by far we will say it looks like 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.970
 actually a one but when we go 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.950
 bring closer we'll see because they each 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.720
 their curtain tylor their identity the range 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.220
 desire begins to take an entity of 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.530
 design very quickly on 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.730
 specifications of both devices the 610 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.750
 which is smaller is a device that 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.480
 will be available 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.130
 I started with prices and 10 for 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.350
 299 euros in the second half in white 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.820
 navy blue navy that's just 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.170
 here I showed you after and coral 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.390
 but this edition is a little 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.410
 coral salmon the 810 which is bigger 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.180
 here at 379 euros in 3 colors also 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.150
 white coral is a kind of grid 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.010
 which is slightly bluish and 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.910
 specifications I will start with 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.070
 the 610 that's right here is a 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.090
 device that runs on android 4 points 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.320
 4 with 7 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.880
 in its latest version which is the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.020
 May 6 version that has not yet announced 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.000
 so I will not be able to read them but 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.580
 I'm sorry we'll see that during the test 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.680
 it's a 4g device that a 4.7 screen 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.490
 inches 540 by 960 we have a processor 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.409
 quad core snapdragon 401.2 gigahertz 1 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.300
 giga of ram 8giga naiman internal micro 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.530
 sd up to 64 giga which can be inserted 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.140
 on the side I'll show you that in 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.330
 a small instant front camera 1.3 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.280
 at the back 8 megapixels of course with 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.690
 htc zoe all small works and 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.490
 we have features we have 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.640
 behind a battery of 2040 bignan 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.200
 father and this one weighs 143 g 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.460
 I will linger for sure 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.290
 design and I'm going to show you the 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.500
 other editions 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.360
 you see in front was what 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.860
 speakers here holy boom then 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.960
 boumsong it's in it's exactly 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.759
 the same component in any case the same 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.490
 power delivered only on the htc one 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.229
 so we have some features we had on 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.369
 high-end he goes down on the 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.750
 mid-range is often like that 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.040
 that it's happening and we're happy with it 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.320
 see at htc 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.560
 this year so there speakers 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.750
 frontal here front camera you see 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.730
 it's unibody polycarbonate 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.350
 totally we have a glossy finish to 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.570
 the back and there we are on something 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.010
 of maths that is very elegant when we 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.330
 take it in hand it's very nice 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.739
 when I press ya not the crackle well 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.160
 heard it's level said that's it 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:36.280
 the idea here volume button on off 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.080
 lock unlock on the ocak there 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.390
 we have a little cache behind which you 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.610
 find the micro slot sd the slot for 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.350
 the asim micro usb camera and flash 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.190
 in back 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.070
 overall something actually 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.049
 very sober clean but what is a hymn 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.090
 anti an identity sorry kind and who 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.500
 pick up what's also on the 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.180
 range one i 'm going to show you the three 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.980
 colors one beside the douala water 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.470
 coral and navy blue 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.519
 here so feel free to mention in 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.180
 the comments which one you prefer 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:11.350
 I will move now where we will say 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.540
 to the biggest on 816 if I'm wrong 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.920
 no or 816 quickly on the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.170
 specifications expect i take the 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.440
 white on which we see a little bit 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.720
 better 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.860
 the design we are today in mena 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.150
 still in 4.4 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.500
 as I said we are not yet in 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.880
 the good version 200 so I can not 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.579
 turn it on do not worry long the 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.070
 will test under the right version 4g lte and 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:34.239
 them so a screen 5 3 5 inches 1280 by 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:37.340
 720 quad core snapdragon 420.6 gigahertz 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.750
 we have a point 5 gigas of ram 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.519
 i won me internal microsd up 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.910
 64 giga 13 megapixel camera 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.680
 htc zoÃ© and it's a front camera 5 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.390
 megapixels and a 2600 battery 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.110
 thousands in double loss speakers 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:54.110
 frontal frontal double loudspeakers 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.730
 frontal stereogoume sound like 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.680
 on the wan as I said for the 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.900
 previous terminal front camera 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.459
 justice see we have a space of 10 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.959
 years end which is occupied by the area of 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.549
 up and down which is very small we have 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.769
 a lot of one has a ratio finally 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.440
 screen design which is who is very 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.390
 interesting speakers also here 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.440
 of course we have a cache a little 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.750
 little bigger but finally who 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.220
 propose the same things 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.750
 the asim and the microsd so well to find 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.070
 micro sd everywhere of course 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.889
 micro usb 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.389
 on the left we have the volume key 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.310
 and has touch of lock unlock 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.450
 when we press it of course we have 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.040
 turned on the screen so well to have put it 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.810
 on the side here because the finger 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.430
 easily get on you would have it 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.539
 well seen here too but at least the 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.100
 parents and that's what of course 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.960
 a screen of this size the camera 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.260
 frontal all that we saw when stopped at 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.850
 the camera the flash the jack all 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.600
 that very well who did you see so I 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:48.410
 take 1,610 by the side we have the same 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.419
 original design approach rather 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.620
 rather successful I like a lot said 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.849
 far in the comment what color 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.510
 you prefer what you think of 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.729
 this new 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.130
 this new design approach on 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.900
 ten elsewhere and we're really looking forward to 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.460
 test them and we can not wait for them to arrive 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.590
 in France to be able to welcome 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.789
 their reservation that you reserve for them 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.289
 quite simply 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.289
 and I tell you next time
