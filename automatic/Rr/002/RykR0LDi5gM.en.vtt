00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.420
 encyclopedia marvel in russian from 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.660
 Eksmo publishing house I have it as you can see 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:23.039
 sealed, I have not even unpacked 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:29.400
 I'll do it all with you now 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:32.279
 very hard guys and she is pretty 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.290
 so thick and even already seen from here 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:40.250
 that the paper in us is just gorgeous 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:44.010
 here we are located on top of a superhero 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.989
 Marvelovsky below supervillains here in n1 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.379
 data favorite marvel skih general 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.309
 It turned out great here sideways 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.520
 wolverine which is very even in the subject 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:01:00.449
 bottom loki imposed everything looks like this 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.510
 this is the circulation of this encyclopedia 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:09.420
 I know I need to look inside 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.640
 but seemingly not very big and how 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.880
 people who know this here told me 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.270
 Russian edition is better than it 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.729
 American than English because in 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.409
 Western versions of this here it is 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.320
 peeled off over time because 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.590
 many pages hard and it opened and 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.990
 it seems like in the Russian version of this 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.729
 no very well very tightly glued 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.990
 I don't know if it's true or not, but he is a man 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.689
 who understands the comics I 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.899
 bought told me so let's 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.180
 unpack watch these honestly even 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.920
 I do not know how it will look like I do not 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.320
 watched other anboxing on youtube 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.960
 I did not see the photos on the Internet therefore 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:00.930
 I am very interested in a book such guys 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.460
 rough enough in some places then 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.689
 there is generally very well done to me 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.290
 like that is, here it is for example 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.390
 Where 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.700
 see here is a hand magnet here is very 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.910
 very cool 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:16.160

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.240

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.460

 I hope you will be interested 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:50.530

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.870
 Stan 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.940
 and now about this character 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.450

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.600

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:22.400
 very famous villains go immediately 1 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:25.700
 altron so that's done a series of alpha well 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.120
 all static goes all in alphabetical order 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.100

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:36.210
 the paper is excellent in quality 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:39.250
 glossy did not save everything on the level 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.880
 I do not know what about the translation, that is 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:45.120
 for example, I'm used to the fact that 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.240
 one of hulky 's most important enemies 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.719
 muck 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:53.169
 here it is a measure with a dream and I do n't know either 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:55.800
 which translation is more accurate 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.659
 just read and judge like that 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:03.240
 translation level but I think the translation 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:03.240
 good after picking on me 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:21.479
