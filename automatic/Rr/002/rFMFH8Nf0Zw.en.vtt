not the hair on his face but it's also

shifts in the architecture of that face

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.669 
shifts in the architecture of that face
that<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.940> being<00:02:09.149> brought<00:02:09.479> out<00:02:09.750> by<00:02:10.200> those

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
that is being brought out by those

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.100 
that is being brought out by those
brushstrokes<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.730> want<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.300> figure<00:02:12.540> out<00:02:12.720> how

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
brushstrokes I want to figure out how

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.990 
brushstrokes I want to figure out how
he's<00:02:13.680> done<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.069> if<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.430> think<00:02:14.610> about<00:02:14.849> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
he's done it if you think about the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.820 
he's done it if you think about the
Caravaggio<00:02:15.690> asked<00:02:15.840> use<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.650> dramatic

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
Caravaggio asked use of dramatic

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.580 
Caravaggio asked use of dramatic
lighting<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.150> go<00:02:18.360> from<00:02:18.540> an<00:02:18.780> area<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.140> stark

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
lighting so you go from an area of stark

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.199 
lighting so you go from an area of stark
illumination<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.459> an<00:02:20.550> area<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:20.940> shadow

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
illumination to an area of shadow

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.990 
illumination to an area of shadow
usually<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.290> area<00:02:22.620> is<00:02:22.830> demarcated<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:23.910> a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
usually that area is demarcated in a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.180 
usually that area is demarcated in a
very<00:02:24.209> clear<00:02:24.540> way<00:02:24.810> you're<00:02:25.380> in<00:02:25.560> Rembrandt

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
very clear way you're in Rembrandt

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.280 
very clear way you're in Rembrandt
there's<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.520> movement<00:02:26.819> in<00:02:27.239> an<00:02:27.480> out<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.810> light

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
there's a movement in an out of light

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.070 
there's a movement in an out of light
that<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.560> think<00:02:28.980> adds<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:30.030> emotion<00:02:30.870> and

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
that I think adds to that emotion and

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.350 
that I think adds to that emotion and
look<00:02:31.290> at<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.470> coloration<00:02:32.040> as<00:02:32.519> well<00:02:32.730> I'm

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
look at the coloration as well I'm

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.900 
look at the coloration as well I'm
seeing<00:02:33.630> greens<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.590> yellows<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.040> blues<00:02:35.459> and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
seeing greens and yellows and blues and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.660 
seeing greens and yellows and blues and
reds<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.930> browns<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.769> grays

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
reds and browns and grays

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.820 
reds and browns and grays
so<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.060> intimacy<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:39.750> two<00:02:40.260> parts<00:02:40.590> it's

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
so the intimacy is two parts it's

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.860 
so the intimacy is two parts it's
because<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.340> Rembrandt's<00:02:42.030> own<00:02:42.180> careful

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
because of Rembrandt's own careful

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.140 
because of Rembrandt's own careful
observation<00:02:43.620> about<00:02:43.799> what<00:02:44.160> he's<00:02:44.340> seeing<00:02:44.610> but

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
observation about what he's seeing but

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.940 
observation about what he's seeing but
it's<00:02:45.209> also<00:02:45.540> about<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.230> fact<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.590> we<00:02:46.769> can

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
it's also about the fact that we can

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.970 
it's also about the fact that we can
feel<00:02:47.310> his<00:02:47.790> hand<00:02:48.510> moving<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.410> brush<00:02:49.650> across

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
feel his hand moving the brush across

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.800 
feel his hand moving the brush across
this<00:02:50.340> surface<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.390> there's<00:02:51.569> a<00:02:51.600> kind<00:02:51.780> of

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
this surface and so there's a kind of

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.990 
this surface and so there's a kind of
double<00:02:52.049> intimacy<00:02:52.860> well<00:02:53.220> we<00:02:53.340> do<00:02:53.580> know<00:02:53.790> that

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
double intimacy well we do know that

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.970 
double intimacy well we do know that
this<00:02:54.120> was<00:02:54.330> especially<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.959> vulnerable<00:02:55.530> moment

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
this was especially a vulnerable moment

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.250 
this was especially a vulnerable moment
in<00:02:56.130> Rembrandt's<00:02:56.700> career<00:02:57.090> he<00:02:57.450> had<00:02:57.569> been<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.900> very

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
in Rembrandt's career he had been a very

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.800 
in Rembrandt's career he had been a very
famous<00:02:58.530> sought-after<00:02:59.060> portrait<00:03:00.060> painter<00:03:00.569> in

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
famous sought-after portrait painter in

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.580 
famous sought-after portrait painter in
Amsterdam<00:03:01.650> but<00:03:02.160> had<00:03:02.430> reached<00:03:02.970> too<00:03:03.360> far

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
Amsterdam but had reached too far

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.220 
Amsterdam but had reached too far
financially<00:03:04.590> he<00:03:04.769> had<00:03:04.920> gone<00:03:05.220> into<00:03:05.459> debt<00:03:05.820> and

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
financially he had gone into debt and

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.840 
financially he had gone into debt and
just<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.350> year<00:03:07.590> or<00:03:07.709> two<00:03:07.890> before<00:03:08.100> this<00:03:08.430> painting

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
just a year or two before this painting

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.610 
just a year or two before this painting
he<00:03:09.000> had<00:03:09.090> declared<00:03:09.540> bankruptcy<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.290> had<00:03:10.470> to

he had declared bankruptcy and had to

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.280 
he had declared bankruptcy and had to
sell<00:03:10.859> his<00:03:11.100> assets<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.970> pay<00:03:12.120> his<00:03:12.239> creditors<00:03:12.290> his

wife that he loved very much Saskia had

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.360 
wife that he loved very much Saskia had
died<00:03:15.510> but<00:03:15.989> I<00:03:16.049> think<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.590> can<00:03:16.859> step<00:03:17.190> into

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
died but I think that you can step into

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.849 
died but I think that you can step into
the<00:03:17.519> biographical<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.540> little<00:03:19.079> too<00:03:19.350> much<00:03:19.590> and

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
the biographical a little too much and

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.920 
the biographical a little too much and
read<00:03:20.100> this<00:03:20.340> painting<00:03:20.820> through<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.510> pain<00:03:21.750> of

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
read this painting through the pain of

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.960 
read this painting through the pain of
those<00:03:22.049> experiences<00:03:22.859> clearly<00:03:23.459> this<00:03:23.609> is<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.760> man

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
those experiences clearly this is a man

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.449 
those experiences clearly this is a man
who<00:03:24.150> has<00:03:24.299> lived<00:03:24.540> very<00:03:25.049> complex<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:25.920> rich<00:03:26.130> life

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
who has lived very complex and rich life

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.330 
who has lived very complex and rich life
as<00:03:26.910> people<00:03:27.600> do<00:03:27.840> by<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.260> time<00:03:28.590> they<00:03:28.799> reach<00:03:29.040> the

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
as people do by the time they reach the

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.220 
as people do by the time they reach the
age<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.700> Rembrandt<00:03:29.940> has<00:03:30.420> so<00:03:30.720> we<00:03:31.049> don't

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
age that Rembrandt has so we don't

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.140 
age that Rembrandt has so we don't
really<00:03:31.320> need<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.920> read<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.280> biography<00:03:32.910> to

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
really need to read the biography to

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.780 
really need to read the biography to
know<00:03:33.390> that<00:03:33.720> by<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:33.989> time<00:03:34.320> you<00:03:34.530> reach<00:03:34.739> 53<00:03:35.519> that

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
know that by the time you reach 53 that

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.090 
know that by the time you reach 53 that
one<00:03:36.030> is<00:03:36.209> wiser<00:03:36.510> when<00:03:36.989> has<00:03:37.140> experienced<00:03:37.950> when

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
one is wiser when has experienced when

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.099 
one is wiser when has experienced when
has<00:03:38.220> lived<00:03:38.430> -<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:38.730> death<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.299> loved<00:03:39.750> ones

has lived - the death of loved ones

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.170 
has lived - the death of loved ones
that's<00:03:40.500> what<00:03:40.680> life<00:03:40.829> is<00:03:40.859> and<00:03:41.400> that's<00:03:41.850> what

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
that's what life is and that's what
