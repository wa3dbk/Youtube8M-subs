 is a friend and can not friend is a friend 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.500
 without a guy who knows everything if you laugh 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.510
 of that in the face that's why it adds up but 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.420

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.420

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.440
 is a great brother-in-law of diego luquitas is 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.780
 the one who takes care of the house when he arrived 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.500
 is 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.530
 he takes care of him the house takes care of him the 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.819
 piece takes care of the pile is more called me and 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.819
 he told me that beer is missing 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.210
 and a lot 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.780
 it was what came to the animal 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.780
 one sees the normal 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.889
 to assess that they are up to date because in 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.030
 any time because I suffered all this 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.030
 kind of things are going to ask 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.090
 the lights all so take advantage of that 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.539
 die 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:48.060
 normal that is right and wrong do not always 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:51.810
 he said he's worth everything on the radio but he's not going 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.240
 everything to the air is a great is a grace 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.229
 I watch it all but not go all the 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.210
 air and what it said that if we or 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.569
 some shines is because the light is 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.889
 that's how the game is distributed very well very 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.430
 well always and something does not use lenses 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.669
 dark 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.430
 I think it speaks of a star or 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.870
 a common type and I do not know if he has lenses 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.530
 dark never in my life I saw it with 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.530
 dark glasses 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.690
 so the treasure is closed in half with 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.080
 pichu with the companions of the souls and 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.080
 choirs
