00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
lenses this year if I made the same

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.520 
lenses this year if I made the same
decision<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:17.940> would<00:02:18.030> go<00:02:18.270> with<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.530> $190

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
decision I would go with the $190

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.750 
decision I would go with the $190
version<00:02:20.010> instead<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.960> 140<00:02:21.960> it's<00:02:22.440> $50<00:02:23.040> more<00:02:23.340> but

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
version instead of 140 it's $50 more but

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.250 
version instead of 140 it's $50 more but
I<00:02:23.790> always<00:02:24.180> choose<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.540> go<00:02:24.630> with<00:02:24.660> polarized

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260

these lenses and the frames have
actually<00:03:12.390> held<00:03:12.600> up<00:03:12.750> really<00:03:13.260> nicely<00:03:13.530> if<00:03:13.980> you

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
actually held up really nicely if you

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.820 
actually held up really nicely if you
can<00:03:15.120> look<00:03:15.300> closely<00:03:15.690> at<00:03:16.019> these<00:03:16.140> lenses<00:03:16.620> which

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
can look closely at these lenses which

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.820 
can look closely at these lenses which
unfortunately<00:03:17.340> we<00:03:17.400> can't<00:03:17.580> do<00:03:17.760> here<00:03:18.209> exactly

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
unfortunately we can't do here exactly

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.740 
unfortunately we can't do here exactly
you'll<00:03:19.830> see<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:20.970> there<00:03:21.209> is<00:03:21.330> a<00:03:21.360> little<00:03:21.570> bit<00:03:21.660> of

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
you'll see that there is a little bit of

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.630 
you'll see that there is a little bit of
fogging<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.500> can<00:03:22.650> easily<00:03:22.950> get<00:03:23.250> rid<00:03:23.310> of

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
fogging that you can easily get rid of

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.660 
fogging that you can easily get rid of
with<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.480> cleaning<00:03:24.900> cloth<00:03:25.170> but<00:03:26.130> overall

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
with the cleaning cloth but overall

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.199 
with the cleaning cloth but overall
there<00:03:26.910> are<00:03:26.940> no<00:03:27.300> real<00:03:27.900> scratches<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:28.980> impede<00:03:29.430> my

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
there are no real scratches to impede my

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.160 
there are no real scratches to impede my
view<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.980> no<00:03:31.980> real<00:03:32.310> scratches<00:03:33.060> on<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.930> side

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
view and no real scratches on the side

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.259 
view and no real scratches on the side
as<00:03:34.470> well<00:03:34.650> so<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.010> think<00:03:35.130> everything<00:03:35.820> here<00:03:36.090> is

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
as well so I think everything here is

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.110 
as well so I think everything here is
looking<00:03:36.750> pretty<00:03:37.290> good<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.680> again<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.640> am<00:03:38.910> the

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
looking pretty good and again I am the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.110 
looking pretty good and again I am the
kind<00:03:39.269> of<00:03:39.390> person<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:40.049> doesn't<00:03:41.120> necessarily

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
kind of person that doesn't necessarily

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.539 
kind of person that doesn't necessarily
take<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.320> best<00:03:43.590> care<00:03:43.769> of<00:03:44.310> their<00:03:45.239> sunglasses<00:03:46.019> I

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
take the best care of their sunglasses I

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.789 
take the best care of their sunglasses I
just<00:03:47.549> have<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.850> admit<00:03:47.940> that<00:03:48.269> but<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:49.080> year<00:03:49.530> of

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
just have to admit that but a year of

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.060 
just have to admit that but a year of
use<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.700> these<00:03:51.330> sunglasses<00:03:51.620> still<00:03:52.620> look

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
use and these sunglasses still look

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.190 
use and these sunglasses still look
brand-new<00:03:53.459> if<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:54.239> just<00:03:54.450> polish<00:03:54.900> them<00:03:55.110> up

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
brand-new if you just polish them up

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.560 
brand-new if you just polish them up
they<00:03:55.980> could<00:03:56.220> basically<00:03:56.370> look<00:03:56.910> like<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.209> brand

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
they could basically look like a brand

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.110 
they could basically look like a brand
new<00:03:57.810> pair<00:03:58.170> of<00:03:58.380> sunglasses<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:59.370> that's<00:03:59.880> good

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
new pair of sunglasses and that's good

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.940 
new pair of sunglasses and that's good
just<00:04:00.570> in<00:04:00.690> case<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:01.019> want<00:04:01.230> your<00:04:01.380> sunglasses<00:04:01.709> to
