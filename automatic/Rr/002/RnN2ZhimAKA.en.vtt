showed<00:01:13.850> you<00:01:13.940> my<00:01:14.030> little<00:01:14.240> project<00:01:14.660> and<00:01:14.930> he<00:01:15.080> come

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
showed you my little project and he come

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.050 
showed you my little project and he come
to<00:01:15.350> me<00:01:15.470> with<00:01:15.619> his<00:01:15.710> little<00:01:15.860> project<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.970> this

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
to me with his little project and this

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.490 
to me with his little project and this
is<00:01:17.119> what<00:01:17.360> we<00:01:17.479> ended<00:01:17.660> up<00:01:17.780> with<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:18.289> hybrid

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
is what we ended up with the hybrid

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.100 
is what we ended up with the hybrid
feeder<00:01:19.300> it's<00:01:20.300> maple<00:01:20.479> with<00:01:20.780> brand<00:01:20.990> new

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
feeder it's maple with brand new

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.620 
feeder it's maple with brand new
material<00:01:21.710> where<00:01:22.520> actually<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.090> weight<00:01:23.360> is

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
material where actually the weight is

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.510

actually<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.289> body<00:01:24.590> as<00:01:24.800> well<00:01:25.039> so<00:01:25.310> it's<00:01:25.430> a

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
actually the body as well so it's a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.940 
actually the body as well so it's a
solid<00:01:25.820> piece<00:01:26.390> of<00:01:26.630> kit<00:01:26.869> so<00:01:27.289> it<00:01:27.380> practically<00:01:27.770> and

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
solid piece of kit so it practically and

solid piece of kit so it practically and
unbreakable<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.690> feeder<00:01:29.899> itself<00:01:30.350> we're

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
unbreakable and the feeder itself we're

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.230 
unbreakable and the feeder itself we're
going<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.830> be<00:01:30.920> doing<00:01:31.039> it<00:01:31.190> in<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.340> usual<00:01:31.520> sizes

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
going to be doing it in the usual sizes

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.219 
going to be doing it in the usual sizes

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
introduced there's a little mini one

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.730 
introduced there's a little mini one
into<00:01:40.939> the<00:01:41.030> range<00:01:41.270> which<00:01:41.600> is<00:01:41.750> perfect<00:01:42.259> at<00:01:42.680> this

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
into the range which is perfect at this

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.100 
into the range which is perfect at this
time<00:01:43.009> of<00:01:43.189> year<00:01:43.220> coming<00:01:43.700> out<00:01:43.909> a<00:01:43.939> winner<00:01:44.210> fish

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
time of year coming out a winner fish

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.170 
time of year coming out a winner fish
it's<00:01:45.290> starting<00:01:46.040> to<00:01:46.189> feed<00:01:46.400> but<00:01:46.640> not<00:01:46.820> eating<00:01:47.090> a

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
it's starting to feed but not eating a

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.359 
it's starting to feed but not eating a
lot<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:47.570> this<00:01:47.689> is<00:01:47.869> perfect<00:01:48.290> for<00:01:48.439> that<00:01:48.470> they<00:01:49.220> all

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
lot so this is perfect for that they all

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.039 
lot so this is perfect for that they all
come<00:01:49.520> in<00:01:49.640> line<00:01:49.850> but<00:01:50.479> they've<00:01:50.630> got<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.869> nice

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
come in line but they've got the nice

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.929 
come in line but they've got the nice
option<00:01:51.500> of<00:01:51.740> being<00:01:52.070> able<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.310> take<00:01:52.549> the<00:01:52.670> tubes

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
option of being able to take the tubes

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.899 
option of being able to take the tubes
out<00:01:53.150> and<00:01:53.659> interchanging<00:01:54.350> with<00:01:54.380> all<00:01:54.619> the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
out and interchanging with all the

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.170 
out and interchanging with all the
exosystem

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
exosystem

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.999 
exosystem
so<00:01:56.390> you've<00:01:56.540> got<00:01:56.689> a<00:01:56.720> safe<00:01:56.960> elasticated<00:01:57.650> feeder

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
so you've got a safe elasticated feeder

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.380 
so you've got a safe elasticated feeder
still<00:01:59.590> feed<00:02:00.590> itself<00:02:01.009> works<00:02:01.399> very<00:02:02.060> much<00:02:02.180> like

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
still feed itself works very much like

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.780 
still feed itself works very much like
well<00:02:03.200> it's<00:02:03.320> like<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.500> hybrid<00:02:03.770> between<00:02:04.189> the

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
well it's like a hybrid between the

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.270 
well it's like a hybrid between the
method<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:05.509> a<00:02:05.600> pellet<00:02:05.899> feeder<00:02:06.130> there's<00:02:07.130> no

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
method and a pellet feeder there's no

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.169 
method and a pellet feeder there's no
mold<00:02:07.549> needed

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
mold needed

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.300 
mold needed
you're<00:02:08.509> literally<00:02:08.750> mold<00:02:09.049> the<00:02:09.170> bait<00:02:09.410> straight

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
you're literally mold the bait straight

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.940 
you're literally mold the bait straight
into<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.790> into<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.750> section<00:02:12.170> there<00:02:12.380> you<00:02:12.769> can

can<00:02:27.470> just<00:02:27.560> have<00:02:27.739> a<00:02:27.769> small<00:02:28.070> amount<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:28.370> bait<00:02:28.579> in

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
can just have a small amount of bait in

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.580 
can just have a small amount of bait in
there<00:02:28.940> or<00:02:29.269> you<00:02:29.420> can<00:02:29.570> build<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.930> right<00:02:30.170> up<00:02:30.380> and

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
there or you can build it right up and

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.229 
there or you can build it right up and
take<00:02:30.920> full<00:02:31.130> advantage<00:02:31.489> of<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.760> room<00:02:31.970> in<00:02:32.150> the

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
take full advantage of the room in the

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.300 
take full advantage of the room in the
feeder<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:33.019> put<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.260> decent<00:02:33.860> amount<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:34.100> bait<00:02:34.280> in

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
feeder to put a decent amount of bait in

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.070 
feeder to put a decent amount of bait in
there

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
there

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.130 
there
the<00:02:35.590> main<00:02:35.770> features<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.430> feeder<00:02:36.730> ah

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
the main features of this feeder ah

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.510 
the main features of this feeder ah
you'll<00:02:38.140> probably<00:02:38.290> see<00:02:38.620> it's<00:02:38.920> got<00:02:39.100> holes<00:02:39.340> in

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
you'll probably see it's got holes in

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.980 
you'll probably see it's got holes in
the<00:02:39.640> bottom<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.120> run<00:02:40.270> on<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.510> bottom<00:02:40.660> and

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
the bottom to run on the bottom and

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.260 
the bottom to run on the bottom and
there's<00:02:41.710> some<00:02:41.890> holes<00:02:42.100> around<00:02:42.340> side<00:02:42.820> and

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
there's some holes around side and

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.240 
there's some holes around side and
basically<00:02:43.540> what<00:02:43.840> happens<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.350> as<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:44.950> feeder

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
basically what happens is as a feeder

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.030 
basically what happens is as a feeder
enters<00:02:45.580> water<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:47.380> water<00:02:47.620> pushes

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
enters water and the water pushes

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.920 
enters water and the water pushes
through<00:02:48.190> these<00:02:48.430> holes<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.000> loosens<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.750> bait

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
through these holes and loosens the bait

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.870 
through these holes and loosens the bait
up<00:02:50.080> nice<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.290> quickly<00:02:50.710> also<00:02:51.310> releases<00:02:51.850> a

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
up nice and quickly also releases a

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.280 
up nice and quickly also releases a
little<00:02:52.150> bit<00:02:52.240> of<00:02:52.360> bait<00:02:52.510> on<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.780> way<00:02:52.900> down<00:02:53.140> to

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
little bit of bait on the way down to

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.080 
little bit of bait on the way down to
the<00:02:53.380> bottom<00:02:53.530> if<00:02:53.740> fishing<00:02:54.100> people<00:02:54.310> wore<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:55.030> it

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
the bottom if fishing people wore so it

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.880 
the bottom if fishing people wore so it
shows<00:02:55.270> those<00:02:55.510> fish<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:56.050> there<00:02:56.560> is<00:02:56.680> bait

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
shows those fish that there is bait

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.080 
shows those fish that there is bait
going<00:02:57.130> through<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.460> waters<00:02:57.820> if<00:02:57.940> you're

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
going through the waters if you're

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.540 
going through the waters if you're
feeding<00:02:58.360> with<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.660> kinder<00:02:58.990> pot<00:02:59.280> then<00:03:00.280> when

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
feeding with the kinder pot then when

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.280 
feeding with the kinder pot then when
it's<00:03:00.700> on<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.850> bottom<00:03:01.090> rather<00:03:01.750> than<00:03:02.020> a<00:03:02.110> method

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
it's on the bottom rather than a method

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.560 
it's on the bottom rather than a method
where<00:03:02.710> it<00:03:02.830> breaks<00:03:03.130> down<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.700> all<00:03:03.790> disperses

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
where it breaks down and all disperses

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.320 
where it breaks down and all disperses
all<00:03:04.600> around<00:03:05.080> it<00:03:05.680> tends<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.100> but<00:03:06.640> pop<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.150> bait

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
all around it tends to but pop the bait

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.240 
all around it tends to but pop the bait
up<00:03:07.510> over<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.930> feeder<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.470> actually<00:03:08.830> hide<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
up over the feeder and actually hide the

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.400 
up over the feeder and actually hide the
feeder<00:03:09.490> itself<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:10.480> your<00:03:10.660> baits<00:03:10.870> out<00:03:11.140> nice<00:03:11.380> and

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
feeder itself so your baits out nice and

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.740 
feeder itself so your baits out nice and
proud<00:03:11.860> with<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.430> nice<00:03:12.790> amount<00:03:13.180> of<00:03:13.390> bait<00:03:13.570> around

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
proud with a nice amount of bait around

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.200 
proud with a nice amount of bait around
it<00:03:14.170> got<00:03:14.620> evenly<00:03:14.950> spread<00:03:15.280> disguising<00:03:16.120> the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
it got evenly spread disguising the

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.990 
it got evenly spread disguising the
feeder<00:03:16.800> so<00:03:17.800> there<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.040> go<00:03:18.190> that's<00:03:18.460> a<00:03:18.610> hybrid

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
feeder so there you go that's a hybrid

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.580 
feeder so there you go that's a hybrid
I'll<00:03:19.150> show<00:03:19.360> you<00:03:19.450> exactly<00:03:19.660> how<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:19.960> load<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.410> and

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
I'll show you exactly how to load it and

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.790 
I'll show you exactly how to load it and
then<00:03:21.160> in<00:03:21.460> a<00:03:21.550> moment<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.350> yeah<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.560> try<00:03:23.710> and

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
then in a moment and yeah the try and

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.870 
then in a moment and yeah the try and
catch<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.010> few<00:03:24.130> more<00:03:24.310> fish<00:03:24.520> as<00:03:24.670> well<00:03:26.820> loaded<00:03:27.820> in

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
catch a few more fish as well loaded in

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.340 
catch a few more fish as well loaded in
the<00:03:27.940> hybrid<00:03:28.300> could<00:03:28.450> be<00:03:28.570> any<00:03:28.690> simpler<00:03:29.050> really

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
the hybrid could be any simpler really

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.990 
the hybrid could be any simpler really
it's<00:03:29.860> obviously<00:03:30.100> got<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.250> palms<00:03:30.550> on<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:30.820> so

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
it's obviously got the palms on it so

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.550 
it's obviously got the palms on it so
it's<00:03:31.120> easier<00:03:31.330> to<00:03:31.360> load<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.720> bait<00:03:31.930> is<00:03:32.080> home<00:03:32.260> and

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
it's easier to load the bait is home and

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.740 
it's easier to load the bait is home and
literally<00:03:32.830> get<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.850> bait<00:03:34.090> fill<00:03:34.360> it<00:03:34.450> level

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
literally get the bait fill it level

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.390 
literally get the bait fill it level
with<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.990> bottom<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.320> the<00:03:35.380> hybrid<00:03:35.830> and<00:03:36.190> press

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
with the bottom of the hybrid and press

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.190 
with the bottom of the hybrid and press
it<00:03:36.550> in<00:03:36.670> nice<00:03:37.360> thing<00:03:37.540> about<00:03:37.600> this<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:37.960> can

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
it in nice thing about this you can

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.170 
it in nice thing about this you can
gauge<00:03:38.440> how<00:03:38.470> much<00:03:38.710> you<00:03:38.830> want<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.100> put<00:03:39.220> in<00:03:39.400> so<00:03:39.640> if

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
gauge how much you want to put in so if

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.820 
gauge how much you want to put in so if
you're<00:03:40.300> fishing<00:03:40.540> deeper<00:03:40.870> water<00:03:41.080> give<00:03:41.680> it<00:03:41.800> a

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
you're fishing deeper water give it a

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.410 
you're fishing deeper water give it a
bigger<00:03:42.010> press<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:42.730> can<00:03:42.790> put<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.060> bit<00:03:43.209> extra

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
bigger press you can put a bit extra

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.660 
bigger press you can put a bit extra
bait<00:03:43.720> in<00:03:43.930> she<00:03:44.650> shallow<00:03:44.920> pool<00:03:45.160> but<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.490> want<00:03:45.640> it

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
bait in she shallow pool but you want it

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:58.320 
bait in she shallow pool but you want it
down<00:03:46.150> really<00:03:46.390> quickly<00:03:56.550> there<00:03:57.550> you<00:03:57.610> go<00:03:57.820> until

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
down really quickly there you go until

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.940 
down really quickly there you go until
you<00:03:58.390> use<00:03:58.630> ground<00:03:58.930> bait<00:03:59.110> for<00:03:59.320> this<00:03:59.440> or<00:03:59.890> a

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
you use ground bait for this or a

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.290 
you use ground bait for this or a
mixture<00:04:00.310> of<00:04:00.400> different<00:04:00.580> pellets<00:04:01.030> you<00:04:01.150> can

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
mixture of different pellets you can

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.970 
mixture of different pellets you can
also<00:04:01.420> get<00:04:01.720> away<00:04:01.840> because<00:04:02.440> you've<00:04:02.740> got<00:04:02.860> the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
also get away because you've got the

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
also get away because you've got the
walls<00:04:03.130> you<00:04:03.220> can<00:04:03.370> get<00:04:03.459> away<00:04:03.580> with<00:04:03.790> bigger

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
walls you can get away with bigger

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.730

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
new dimension to this type of fishing

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.770 
new dimension to this type of fishing
and<00:04:11.980> for<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.310> top<00:04:12.490> layer<00:04:12.640> just<00:04:12.820> literally<00:04:13.570> a

like<00:04:18.200> so<00:04:18.530> just<00:04:18.890> keep<00:04:19.160> everything<00:04:19.430> in<00:04:19.700> place
