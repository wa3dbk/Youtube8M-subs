00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.100

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.390

 So good luck everybody 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.709
 I will also do it because the pri I think 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.959
 I'll do until today because at 6:00 a.m. 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.959
 still the proportions are going there 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.090
 also the team of the week and the touches 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.519
 so the chance is gigantic to take 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.780
 Some kind of card, I'll do it. 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.099
 That 's what I take the gulp for. 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.409
 You sure? 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.940
 good, it's going to be the silver team very quickly. 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:27.609
 I'm just here for some non-players. 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.349
 know very well these good little letters the 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.780
 great highlight of this kind of dish for 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:35.049
 I 'll be sure the bullet looks 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.870
 only 92 fish 80 finalizing it 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.459
 did not change 1974 overall because he is 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.889
 practice so I think it's going to be 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.439
 the most desired carton in the galera there 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.729
 will open the silver feet and I 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.620
 I also wanted to test this part a lot 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:49.419
 of the anti leaving Uruguay 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.889
 he played on the river and I did not play either. 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:53.169
 Uruguay squadron then this little box 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.579
 fits very well on my team and 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:56.109
 Let's see if I can get some 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.790
 Letters and to finish the galera I'll 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.859
 leave here also on the screen a whole team 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.449
 all the players that will come out of bronze 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.519
 I do not know the faces very well then. 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.319
 mask for sure the little letters will 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.150
 worth a lot of money if you're opening 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.079
 bronze pecs as I already brought a video 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.759
 if you did not watch 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.739
 back there and changes in description as well 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:12.819
 I'm talking about whether it's worth it or not. 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.590
 bronze pecs 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.299
 so this is good luck everybody 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.919
 world I 'm very happy you left 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.530
 those touches here were in need of 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.719
 a motivation there is more to play the 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.849
 film was now sure to 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:25.870
 next few weeks everyone will return 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:28.060
 The market will come back with 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.290
 jonah belezinha prices for sure 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.300
 should also fall 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.699
 so be smart there, this first team 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.680
 it's not worth it to open both the pecs like this 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.479
 the next teams one is sure to be 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.669
 better but here we will have a lot of 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.830
 option then good luck to everyone else 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.870
 Once together, guys, if I 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.430
 Do you have anything for you? 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.620
 let me tell you, did you like this video? 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.620
 until the next video a hug I went
