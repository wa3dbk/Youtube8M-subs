00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
 this is decent with angel hair in 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.440
 the house is here 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.950
 this book is all the recipes that 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.680
 we have done in the two seasons of 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.739
 blessed palate here are the recipes 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.349
 salted desserts and salads 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:31.220
 the mother comforted in the other if 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.620
 they were only desserts and in this 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.960
 Well, you can find all the food 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.190
 the whole menu full first courses 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.580
 second courses there are fish meats 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.780
 much much fruit many desserts be that 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.030
 this one is complete 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.700
 the editorial good lyrics was the one 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.910
 he asked us to take it out because the 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.460
 people were asking for it there are recipes that 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.260
 they are very simple very economic 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.850
 then also especially for 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.710
 teach people to eat well that 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.450
 eat healthy because we know that now the 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.360
 people do not have time 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.510
 and that is bad economically and also 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.200
 for us because as always 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.940
 we say the convent always needs 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.620
 restoration branches not for now not 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.540
 because look for example here the 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.650
 protagonist that Sor Beatriz today is not 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.030
 here because it's a bit bad and because 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.800
 then little boys and clear then 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.340
 us if maybe they came more 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.870
 vocations or because we are already few and 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.180
 this is not our life neither do we 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.680
 we are dedicated to prayer and this has 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.340
 been like I do not know there's a stop in 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.290
 our life a different thing but for 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.060
 now we have not thought about books I do not know what 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.940
 better why recipes there are always many 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.500
 in the convent we have many already 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.119
 better let's see how it goes with this 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.450
 book and then we will go thinking 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.570
 asked a lot and that's how I tell you how 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.580
 They know they are simple recipes and also 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.440
 the program received him very well because 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.470
 they are solace and sorbet and they are very 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.850
 Affectionate and everything they have done with love 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.220
 or is normal not like other kitchens we 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.680
 people say it's all luxuries and things 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.950
 faces of us as fixed ones of san 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.230
 francisco with the vow of poverty there 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.750
 trick none is all simple what 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.060
 It is a normal house without anything 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.880
 extraordinary everything normal normal no 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.030
 would advise the singles since it is 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.040
 the lettuce with a little pickle and 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.050
 if you have a little bit of pepper too 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:40.170
 tomato and it 's enough for my taste 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.170
 vinegar are very friend of the vinegar she 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.510
 with their salads as they have here 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.190
 passed many sisters today today we fulfill 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.120

 looking at which one was easiest is which 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.540
