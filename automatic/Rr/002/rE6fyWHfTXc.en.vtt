very<00:00:59.910> easy<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.180> see<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.570> smoke<00:01:00.930> comes<00:01:01.320> out<00:01:01.440> of

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
very easy to see that smoke comes out of

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.319 
very easy to see that smoke comes out of
both<00:01:01.739> sides<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> ridge<00:01:02.430> vent<00:01:02.460> under<00:01:03.149> all

both sides of the ridge vent under all

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.940 
wind conditions and it operates as

planned as opposed to without the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
external baffle smoke typically only

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.320 
external baffle smoke typically only
comes<00:01:10.229> out<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:10.590> side<00:01:10.939> during<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.030> series

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
comes out of one side during this series

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.149 
comes out of one side during this series
of<00:01:12.479> tests<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.869> also<00:01:13.020> had<00:01:13.320> cameras<00:01:13.740> inside<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
of tests we also had cameras inside the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.770 
of tests we also had cameras inside the
attic<00:01:14.549> spaces<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.150> could<00:01:15.390> see<00:01:15.540> what<00:01:15.689> was

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
attic spaces so we could see what was

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.920 
attic spaces so we could see what was
going<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> attics<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:18.540> could<00:01:18.720> see

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
going on in the attics and you could see

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.140 
going on in the attics and you could see
that<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.409> attic<00:01:19.950> spaces<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.640> external

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
that the attic spaces with the external

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.420 
that the attic spaces with the external
baffle<00:01:21.509> were<00:01:21.630> evacuated<00:01:22.259> much<00:01:22.409> quicker<00:01:22.680> this

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
baffle were evacuated much quicker this

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.590 
baffle were evacuated much quicker this
is<00:01:23.549> due<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.850> fact<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.360> wind

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
is due to the fact that the wind

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.080 
is due to the fact that the wind
actually<00:01:24.990> helps<00:01:25.320> pump<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> smoke<00:01:26.009> out<00:01:26.250> with

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
actually helps pump the smoke out with

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.179 
actually helps pump the smoke out with
the<00:01:27.270> action<00:01:27.659> over<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> external<00:01:28.500> baffle<00:01:29.040> and

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
the action over the external baffle and

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.740 
the action over the external baffle and
so<00:01:29.340> they<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:29.520> clear<00:01:29.970> out<00:01:30.060> much<00:01:30.240> quicker

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
so they do clear out much quicker

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.249 
so they do clear out much quicker
in<00:01:31.650> test<00:01:32.189> after<00:01:32.460> test<00:01:32.640> time<00:01:33.509> after<00:01:34.020> time
