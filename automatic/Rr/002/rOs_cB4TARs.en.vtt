the school and I think you like to what
I'm<00:01:26.520> saying<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.720> gives<00:01:27.780> us<00:01:28.290> that

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
I'm saying is that it gives us that

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.649 
I'm saying is that it gives us that
course<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.950> shower<00:01:29.340> before<00:01:29.759> violently<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
course to shower before violently the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.359 
course to shower before violently the
red<00:01:30.810> cards<00:01:31.200> you're<00:01:31.500> right<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.920> does<00:01:32.130> at<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
red cards you're right it does at the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.460 
red cards you're right it does at the
point<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.030> questions<00:01:33.780> need<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.140> asked

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470

about<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.950> think<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.250> goes<00:01:35.400> back<00:01:35.579> to

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
about that and I think that goes back to
