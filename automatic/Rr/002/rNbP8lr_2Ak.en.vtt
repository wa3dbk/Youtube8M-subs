00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
incorporated in is so intentional and so

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.310 
incorporated in is so intentional and so
like<00:01:38.799> appropriate<00:01:39.400> for<00:01:39.670> each<00:01:40.000> song<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.659> each

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
like appropriate for each song and each

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.840 
like appropriate for each song and each
second<00:01:41.770> of<00:01:41.950> each<00:01:42.100> part<00:01:42.430> like<00:01:42.610> very

I<00:01:53.380> guess<00:01:53.680> for<00:01:53.860> Hamlin<00:01:54.159> in<00:01:54.250> his<00:01:54.340> career<00:01:54.610> was<00:01:54.790> a

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
I guess for Hamlin in his career was a

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.310 
I guess for Hamlin in his career was a
turning<00:01:55.210> point<00:01:55.240> where<00:01:55.570> he<00:01:55.990> kind<00:01:56.170> of<00:01:56.200> broke

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
turning point where he kind of broke

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.710 
turning point where he kind of broke
away<00:01:56.470> from<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.770> traditional<00:01:57.670> bossa<00:01:58.270> nova

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
away from the traditional bossa nova

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.289 
away from the traditional bossa nova
sound<00:01:59.500> that<00:01:59.680> came<00:01:59.830> out<00:02:00.040> and<00:02:00.340> then<00:02:00.640> going

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
sound that came out and then going

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:01.890 
sound that came out and then going
somewhere<00:02:01.600> else

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
somewhere else

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.530 
somewhere else
it<00:02:02.140> was<00:02:02.290> Chico<00:02:02.619> Vargas<00:02:03.009> first<00:02:03.430> record<00:02:04.299> that
