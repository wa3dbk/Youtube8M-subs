inch motor a little bit of nitrous and a
chassis<00:03:07.910> that<00:03:07.940> works<00:03:08.270> I<00:03:08.540> mean<00:03:08.690> that<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:08.959> which

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
chassis that works I mean that you which

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.020 
chassis that works I mean that you which
is<00:03:09.200> what's<00:03:09.380> easier<00:03:09.709> than<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.070> it's<00:03:10.310> truly<00:03:10.910> a

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
is what's easier than that it's truly a

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.910 
is what's easier than that it's truly a
situation<00:03:11.630> where<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:12.350> know<00:03:12.440> you<00:03:12.560> can<00:03:12.770> make<00:03:12.860> a

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
situation where you know you can make a

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.979 
situation where you know you can make a
ton<00:03:13.160> of<00:03:13.190> power<00:03:13.459> but<00:03:13.760> if<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.360> doesn't<00:03:14.540> hook<00:03:14.750> up

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
ton of power but if it doesn't hook up

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.840 
ton of power but if it doesn't hook up
it's<00:03:15.440> really<00:03:15.650> kind<00:03:15.830> of<00:03:15.920> useless<00:03:16.190> so<00:03:16.550> you<00:03:16.610> end

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
it's really kind of useless so you end

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.160 
it's really kind of useless so you end
up<00:03:16.880> spin<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.180> tires<00:03:17.390> halfway<00:03:17.690> down<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.930> track

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
up spin the tires halfway down the track

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.190 
up spin the tires halfway down the track
and<00:03:18.680> it's<00:03:18.800> really<00:03:18.950> not<00:03:19.100> safe<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:20.060> guys<00:03:20.959> worked

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
and it's really not safe so guys worked

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.380 
and it's really not safe so guys worked
on<00:03:21.350> on<00:03:21.620> making<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.040> thing<00:03:22.250> hook<00:03:22.489> it's<00:03:23.030> real

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
on on making the thing hook it's real

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.370 
on on making the thing hook it's real
simple<00:03:23.690> you<00:03:23.840> look<00:03:23.959> under<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.230> rear

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
simple you look under the rear

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.229 
simple you look under the rear
suspension<00:03:24.950> there's<00:03:25.100> very<00:03:25.370> little<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.910> it<00:03:26.090> and

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
suspension there's very little to it and

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.380 
suspension there's very little to it and
yet<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.140> works<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:28.310> they've<00:03:28.640> worked<00:03:29.090> on<00:03:29.269> the

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
yet it works and they've worked on the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.640 
yet it works and they've worked on the
power<00:03:29.600> and<00:03:29.930> then<00:03:30.019> you<00:03:30.110> gradually<00:03:30.500> increase

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
power and then you gradually increase

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.560 
power and then you gradually increase
the<00:03:31.160> power<00:03:31.370> as<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:31.970> can<00:03:32.120> increase<00:03:32.360> the

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
the power as you can increase the

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.970 
the power as you can increase the
traction<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:33.019> stuff<00:03:33.260> on<00:03:33.380> it<00:03:33.470> they've<00:03:33.590> widened

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
traction and stuff on it they've widened

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.430 
traction and stuff on it they've widened
the<00:03:34.070> rear<00:03:34.730> wheel<00:03:34.880> well<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.090> little<00:03:35.239> bit<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.750> fit

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
the rear wheel well a little bit to fit

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.860 
the rear wheel well a little bit to fit
a<00:03:36.470> bigger<00:03:36.709> tire<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.310> you<00:03:38.120> know<00:03:38.450> you<00:03:38.510> make<00:03:38.750> it

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
a bigger tire and you know you make it

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.780 
a bigger tire and you know you make it
stick<00:03:39.140> and<00:03:39.410> then<00:03:39.800> plant<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.250> nitrous<00:03:40.580> to<00:03:40.760> it

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
stick and then plant the nitrous to it

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.570 
stick and then plant the nitrous to it
so<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:42.200> know<00:03:42.290> and<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:42.769> and<00:03:42.950> five<00:03:43.489> hundred

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
so you know and and and five hundred

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.830 
so you know and and and five hundred
forty<00:03:43.910> eight<00:03:43.970> inches<00:03:44.239> don't<00:03:44.450> hurt

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
and upper rear control arms would meet

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.580 
and upper rear control arms would meet
if<00:03:57.459> they<00:03:57.670> were<00:03:57.730> long<00:03:58.000> enough<00:03:58.180> by<00:03:58.930> elevating

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
if they were long enough by elevating

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.650 
if they were long enough by elevating
the<00:03:59.709> upper<00:03:59.980> control<00:04:00.099> arm<00:04:00.550> mount<00:04:00.819> you<00:04:01.330> change

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
the upper control arm mount you change

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.809 
the upper control arm mount you change
the<00:04:01.870> geometry<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:02.680> shorten<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.340> instant

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
the geometry and shorten the instant

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.089 
the geometry and shorten the instant
center<00:04:04.090> length<00:04:04.360> it<00:04:04.930> basically<00:04:05.530> makes<00:04:05.890> the

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
center length it basically makes the

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.610 
center length it basically makes the
triangulation<00:04:06.730> shorter<00:04:07.360> this<00:04:07.989> reduces<00:04:08.560> the

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
the track it really does everything you

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
could you could ever ask for from a tank

basically another freak of nature in

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.320 
basically another freak of nature in
cars<00:04:24.160> this<00:04:24.370> big<00:04:24.550> just<00:04:24.729> were<00:04:24.850> never<00:04:25.030> meant<00:04:25.240> to

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
cars this big just were never meant to

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.150 
cars this big just were never meant to
go<00:04:25.450> this<00:04:25.479> fast<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:26.110> know<00:04:26.229> when<00:04:26.380> people<00:04:27.070> would

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
go this fast you know when people would

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.510 
go this fast you know when people would
see<00:04:27.340> these<00:04:27.490> cars<00:04:27.790> they<00:04:28.630> would<00:04:28.950> always<00:04:29.950> you

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
see these cars they would always you

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.920 
see these cars they would always you
know<00:04:30.550> correlate<00:04:31.090> them<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.389> being<00:04:31.570> driven<00:04:31.690> by<00:04:31.900> a

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
know correlate them to being driven by a

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.100 
know correlate them to being driven by a
grandma<00:04:32.320> to<00:04:32.410> church<00:04:32.620> on<00:04:32.830> Sundays<00:04:33.250> well<00:04:34.110> she

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
grandma to church on Sundays well she

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.300 
grandma to church on Sundays well she
went<00:04:35.200> to<00:04:35.350> church<00:04:35.470> on<00:04:35.620> Sundays<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:35.979> this<00:04:36.190> to

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
went to church on Sundays and this to

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.980 
went to church on Sundays and this to
she'd<00:04:36.669> get<00:04:36.790> there<00:04:36.970> pretty<00:04:37.120> fast<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.720> think

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
she'd get there pretty fast I think

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.310 
she'd get there pretty fast I think
Nick's<00:04:38.139> days<00:04:38.290> run<00:04:38.500> 1060<00:04:39.010> 432<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:40.169> then<00:04:41.169> it

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
Nick's days run 1060 432 and then it

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.440 
Nick's days run 1060 432 and then it
it's<00:04:42.100> capable<00:04:42.310> of<00:04:42.520> going<00:04:42.669> quicker<00:04:43.000> I<00:04:43.120> know<00:04:43.270> if

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
it's capable of going quicker I know if

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.909 
it's capable of going quicker I know if
you<00:04:43.540> put<00:04:43.690> a<00:04:43.720> little<00:04:43.780> more<00:04:43.930> squeeze<00:04:44.290> to<00:04:44.530> it<00:04:44.650> so<00:04:44.889> I

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
you put a little more squeeze to it so I

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.240 
you put a little more squeeze to it so I
very<00:04:45.700> impressive<00:04:46.300> for<00:04:46.479> a<00:04:46.510> real<00:04:46.720> heavy<00:04:46.930> car<00:04:47.260> you

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
very impressive for a real heavy car you

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.860 
very impressive for a real heavy car you
know<00:04:48.340> you<00:04:48.370> don't<00:04:48.669> look<00:04:49.150> at<00:04:49.300> this<00:04:49.450> and<00:04:49.660> think

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
know you don't look at this and think

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.630 
know you don't look at this and think
that's<00:04:50.440> a<00:04:50.560> 10-second<00:04:51.100> car<00:04:51.130> you<00:04:51.460> know<00:04:51.610> and

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
that's a 10-second car you know and

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.190 
that's a 10-second car you know and
there's<00:04:52.180> gonna<00:04:52.300> be<00:04:52.390> guys<00:04:52.600> out<00:04:52.870> there<00:04:52.900> with

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
there's gonna be guys out there with

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:11.770 
there's gonna be guys out there with
much<00:04:53.560> lighter<00:04:53.860> cars<00:04:54.190> going

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.059 

now<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:12.840> cool<00:05:13.080> part<00:05:13.319> about<00:05:13.379> a<00:05:13.530> car<00:05:13.740> like<00:05:13.919> this

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:14.069 
now the cool part about a car like this

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:15.950 
now the cool part about a car like this
is<00:05:14.310> that<00:05:14.340> it<00:05:14.669> it's<00:05:15.090> so<00:05:15.300> simple<00:05:15.599> I<00:05:15.720> mean<00:05:15.810> if<00:05:15.870> you

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
is that it it's so simple I mean if you

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.059 
is that it it's so simple I mean if you
look<00:05:16.080> inside<00:05:16.229> of<00:05:16.470> it<00:05:16.560> there's<00:05:16.710> not<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:16.860> single

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:17.069 
look inside of it there's not a single

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:18.680 
look inside of it there's not a single
gauge<00:05:17.370> in<00:05:17.550> it<00:05:17.669> except<00:05:18.210> for<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.389> ones<00:05:18.539> that

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
gauge in it except for the ones that

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.839 
gauge in it except for the ones that
came<00:05:18.870> from<00:05:19.080> GM<00:05:19.409> the<00:05:19.919> speedometer<00:05:20.460> in<00:05:20.550> a<00:05:20.610> gas

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
came from GM the speedometer in a gas

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.420 
came from GM the speedometer in a gas
gauge<00:05:21.470> no<00:05:22.470> play<00:05:22.650> about<00:05:22.949> to<00:05:23.099> do<00:05:23.250> there's

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
gauge no play about to do there's

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.279 
gauge no play about to do there's
nothing<00:05:23.699> else<00:05:23.819> to<00:05:23.940> shoot

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
nothing else to shoot

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.029 
nothing else to shoot
there's<00:05:26.289> no<00:05:26.410> roll<00:05:26.680> bar<00:05:26.710> you<00:05:27.610> know<00:05:27.669> no<00:05:27.850> fire<00:05:28.090> no

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
there's no roll bar you know no fire no

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.379 
there's no roll bar you know no fire no
seatbelt<00:05:30.039> restraints<00:05:30.819> like<00:05:30.970> that<00:05:31.090> on<00:05:31.240> race

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
seatbelt restraints like that on race

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:32.939 
seatbelt restraints like that on race
cars<00:05:31.569> it's<00:05:31.750> got<00:05:31.870> the<00:05:31.960> standard<00:05:32.229> seatbelts<00:05:32.740> on

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 
cars it's got the standard seatbelts on

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.400 
cars it's got the standard seatbelts on
it<00:05:33.100> you're<00:05:33.880> used<00:05:34.090> to<00:05:34.180> seeing<00:05:34.449> interior<00:05:35.139> shots

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
it you're used to seeing interior shots

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.350 
it you're used to seeing interior shots
with<00:05:35.620> you<00:05:35.740> know<00:05:35.830> gauges<00:05:36.430> and<00:05:36.729> shifters<00:05:37.330> and

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
with you know gauges and shifters and

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.010 
with you know gauges and shifters and
and<00:05:38.160> stuff<00:05:39.160> and<00:05:39.460> there<00:05:40.270> isn't<00:05:40.509> anything<00:05:40.630> here

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
and stuff and there isn't anything here

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.439 
and stuff and there isn't anything here
now<00:05:41.319> the<00:05:41.500> not<00:05:41.830> so<00:05:42.160> cool<00:05:42.370> part<00:05:42.699> is<00:05:42.849> that<00:05:43.180> it<00:05:43.300> just

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
now the not so cool part is that it just

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:45.779 
now the not so cool part is that it just
got<00:05:43.630> done<00:05:43.810> run<00:05:43.990> in<00:05:44.110> ten<00:05:44.259> 60s<00:05:44.680> you<00:05:45.340> know<00:05:45.400> promote

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
got done run in ten 60s you know promote

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.159 
got done run in ten 60s you know promote
from<00:05:45.940> the<00:05:46.030> legality<00:05:46.539> standpoint<00:05:46.900> they<00:05:47.050> can

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
from the legality standpoint they can

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.779 
from the legality standpoint they can
only<00:05:47.319> go<00:05:47.470> so<00:05:47.710> fast<00:05:47.889> the<00:05:48.160> car<00:05:48.370> doesn't<00:05:48.610> have<00:05:48.699> a

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
only go so fast the car doesn't have a

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.010 
only go so fast the car doesn't have a
roll<00:05:48.970> bar<00:05:49.120> in<00:05:49.270> it<00:05:49.389> and<00:05:49.509> that<00:05:49.599> kind<00:05:49.780> of<00:05:49.810> stuff

roll bar in it and that kind of stuff

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.620 
roll bar in it and that kind of stuff
