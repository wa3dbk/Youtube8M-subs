00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.150
 by friends of 3 rain review soy david y 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.820
 today I want to introduce you to the house 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.160
 fast responses in the version already 21 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.859
 and you have adidas says it's the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.170
 entry shoe to the trail range and 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.200
 that the Canary Islands do not get it 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.440
 really consider as a 3rd model 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:32.039
 ning set many new things for this one 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.379
 adidas response of 321 one of the 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:37.470
 I think more comfortable shoes that have 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.780
 passed through our hands logically 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.260
 we are going to have to see what happens 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.780
 but I'm going to teach you little to 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.120
 little let's start with what would be the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.370
 sole fixos tacos here and I give the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.620
 back so you can see it with a good 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.960
 bit here you have them as you know 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.760
 enough of what the half-sole would be 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.489
 much prominence especially fixos 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.350
 here in the heel area as they come out 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.660
 many are actually inclined in this 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.339
 position to have more grip in the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.490
 fixed descents also in the zone 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.790
 fixed inside and a sole 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.260
 composed by adaptive technology 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.840
 traction here puts it 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.140
 do not element me as you see a technology 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.660
 what it does is that the tacos act 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.820
 in an independent way each 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.570
 set more or less as if what 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.880
 get sinking in the most areas 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.770
 hard to get more traction from 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.260
 all the shoe on the ground and 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.480
 also greater adaptability than what 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.790
 would be the shoe set two areas very 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.340
 differentiated a central green area and 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.590
 a black zone with another type of attack to 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.500
 two fixed fixes to give more 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.550
 stability to everything that would be the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.210
 tread 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.370
 as always backside of adidas with 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.120
 this skirt look how it protrudes a lot 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.790
 from the vertical of the shoe to 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.010
 maximize the support surface in the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.950
 descents 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.040
 and therefore in theory get higher 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.070
 pull a sole that is made of material to 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:14.160
 draw therefore what it guarantees is 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.590
 greater durability in this regard 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.240
 of the film material 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.820
 all this logically we will have 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.950
 what to see in our review as you see 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.080
 also here the sole that goes up a little 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.230
 especially on the bridge, look at the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.720
 two laterals to get a 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.660
 light stabilization control since 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.050
 the shoe does not have any type 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.290
 of stabilization control medium sole 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.230
 as you see with high profiles or means of 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.030
 between media and highs here you can see 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.030
 fix an exterior part and I'm going to 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.770
 teach here to see if you can see it as 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.410
 on the outside this part of here 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.020
 it is much narrower than the part 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.780
 inside here you see it as this part of 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.770
 here has a lot more material this is 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.170
 go in the area below set as here 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.660
 the distance is greater than here here what 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.560
 You can see this because it's good 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.459
 Well, it's done 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.080
 to make a light tread control 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.810
 since, as in the mountains, it tends to 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.430
 try to get more material in tona in 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.939
 all this inner area of the shoe 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.310
 in slipper fixes very easy flexa yo 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.719
 I think adidas lately in all 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.379
 versions that we are seeing for this 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:33.409
 season fall winter 2014 we are 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:37.400
 seeing lighter shoes and that 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:39.439
 frisan easier to notice that it was easy to 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.560
 I flex and that I have in my hand a 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.700
 pretty big number fixes pretty 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.170
 easy now I'm doing strength 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:51.319
 but it weighs quite easy another of the 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.810
 super novelties that of these response 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.000
 between 21 this month 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.159
 exterior that as you can see covers 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.970
 absolutely all the shoe a 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:04.250
 really different design that has been 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.709
 got with this good first win 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.500
 in logically in protection and 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.620
 durability of everything that would be the month 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.989
 since it is a fairly resistant fabric 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.720
 the time they do not prevent the foot from continuing 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.970
 perspiring since logically by the 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.400
 holes we can go transpiring 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.280
 easily as you see the three bands 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.870
 still even is this mesh 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.810
 mesh 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.240
 and orange that I do not know if you get to see 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.400
 here if it looks good , look at this whole area 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.229
 inside that what it does is like a 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.250
 kind of inner harness that what 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:44.000
 does when when we make the laces 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:47.700
 is to gain a lot in subjection internally 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.090
 I 'm going to open it for you to see 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.680
 if you do not see much but I'm going to 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.620
 try to open 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:00.039
 here you have it fix the three bands and 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.770
 the interior you can not see the harness that is 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:05.530
 in the middle part 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:09.000
 Here you can see it fixed and I take advantage of you 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.570
 I show the inside of the shoe 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.600
 with these generous quilts and they are 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:19.860
 quite long enough 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.780
 in high plate problems we go with 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.540
 the profiling superprotection the part 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:29.250
 front with the mesh this going 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:31.890
 stuck and skirts as they stretch 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.380
 both outside and inside 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.390
 this is doing to day in all 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.080
 the models and I think it 's one thing 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.870
 that you have to thank the back 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.160
 set a light protection 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:49.560
 and the chassis that goes down to this 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:52.080
 protection here in the heel area 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.970
 look also at the shooter who 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.580
 he incorporates that they are also carrying it 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:00.710
 some models of adidas lately 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:03.800
 otherwise a tongue 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.510
 pretty rough the truth with some 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.130
 pins here for the laces that are 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.500
 the flat and running laces 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:13.490
 pretty good and a tongue that is not 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.229
 tied stitched to what would be the paper 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.250
 look here you have it now I'm going to 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:20.930
 teaching the template is a template myself 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.720
 I think from the heaviest 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.060
 lately I've noticed that the 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.849
 thickness of material I think it goes on 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.310
 around 34 millimeters 4 at least 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:33.500
 sure but more is a template 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.260
 really with a lot of material and that 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:39.830
 pick up a little what would be the foot 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:42.530
 template that is sum to all the 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.960
 cushioning of the shoe will have to 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.570
 see how it is because the ribbon of the model 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:51.820
 previous was very high and will have to see 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:55.400
 How do these adidas responses work? 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:58.280
 321 in this version with this month 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:02.330
 lighter exterior 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:04.910
 the taco traction and more flexible in my 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.190
 opinion let's see how it works 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.530
 I invite you to what you continue to see 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.870
 the review how our website has gone 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.580
 train review dotcom and follow us 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.130
 as always in our social networks 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.500
 youtube channel thing that you are doing 

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.800
 now and I thank you until next time 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.800
 friends
