00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:08.889
 hi friends today like a football in 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:13.200
 what are you doing to me 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.200
 commanded the command leave it 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.010
 the trigger does not give me 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.780
 you can observe you can see that 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.040
 down to below not 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.040
 the scoop that I made 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.009
 as you can see 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.839
 has a cap 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.370
 that is the stop for you can not lower 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:37.289
 plus 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.230
 thing that in this until it does not come down from 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.230
 everything has seen nothing and this car 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.430
 untill there 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.769
 and this is going to be bottom that is what I have 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.769
 done you take a pen all your life 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:00.790
 no cuts around the corner have once 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.790
 cut the tube this 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.070
 I'll see if you can see well 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.360
 from the other side it's worth 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.360
 he gets to see 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.890
 get in here 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.440
 It was given to me 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:31.130
 and as you can see once issued that or 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.549
 be a shit that everyone will have 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.549
 at home 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.950
 it does not go down to the bottom 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.659
 it does not go down to the bottom 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.149
 what happens if we remove that 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.460
 well that would go down to the bottom good 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:52.740
 what else have I put aside from that see that 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.740
 a tuning is done here 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.299
 the light 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.380
 the light is like but watch the 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:07.110
 pretty little red light is worth now yes that 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.590
 I teach it, it's worth it, it's here 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.270
 Luce is going to be where the castle is 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.140
 this of the X or the effect that 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.090
 lost cap here came out when you pressed or 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.880
 be shoot when it is with the vibration 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.860
 is going to turn on the light of the number of 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.050
 number one player that as you can see 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.209
 is that I charged the number one light 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:32.269
 so it would be a light also there 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.269
 it's 4 to see the light 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.590
 since there are 4 squares this is the 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.370
 1 I'm missing, because I 'm already putting the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.050
 little red light here 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.890
 in exemption at red light 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.840
 will light up as the player 141 be 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.740
 turn off the light in less energy then 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.910
 There is going to suck a lot I will teach you 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:04.630
 how would it work if you want 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.630
 you have to do a short and 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.470
 and now that we live I do not know is 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.280
 good thing already of another video of how it is 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.280
 all position is worth 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.930
 ok I tell you how to solder the light is worth 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.459
 to do it better Libramiento 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.580
 not to screw what the cables are 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.610
 these that come from doing it from the 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.730
 vibrators are going to fuck I do them for 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.709
 plugged in, if you look, they go here 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.760
 soldiers then valuable go here the 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.400
 welded little people 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.120
 It must be said is a positive and negative 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.690
 that is 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.880
 look is where the red is so red with 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.040
 red top black black top 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.920
 without glasses console red red 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:04:00.120
 black with black 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:02.130
 you do not know that which will come with a 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.260
 longer leg one longer and another 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.630
 shorter valuable small or it has 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.240
 imagined with ideas are the shit that's not 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.400
 it's like that 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.960
 that there is a difference because the most 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.090
 big I think the positive one that does not 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:18.800
 do you give me a video a lot 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.780
 internet and well I'm going to follow and 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.870
 When everything is assembled good to do 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.170
 since it explains how social that to the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.170
 final 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:34.199
 well we look for here the track over 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.199
 it is invisible we put it 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.770
 that this record and put it at the same time is 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.770
 I think I'm lame 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:50.460
 he was here shit 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:54.650
 I also understood you 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.650
 ok and if it comes out of the balls to get 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.050
 for now 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.880
 but disputes madrid with the subject of there 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:14.619
 I recommend you to see or that you put 

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:17.219
 here black masking tape is worth so 

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:17.219
 I'm going to take a piece 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.509
 because we are like that because I for more 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:25.400
 that he throws me for a while trying to get in and 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.590
 without them leaving he was going 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.530
 we put it here is the tape 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:34.610
 very careful not to cover any 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:36.080
 mechanism that is no mechanism of what 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.810
 what is the trigger must be covered or 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.740
 none that if not at the time of giving the 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.740
 trigger gets fucked 

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:49.339
 it is a lot now yes it is worth it I recognize it 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.479
 but then when it is mounted 

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:52.479
 you do not notice 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.840
 and I got it and the tube could not 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:02.060
 have promised 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.760
 I already think it does well 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:10.000
 already does it well as you can see me here 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:14.280
 I was wrong about this more 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.280
 so it does not interfere 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.410
 it's worth once we do that we take another 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.250
 piece of masking tape can already be 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.160
 zeal 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:27.280
 insulating tape what comes out of the pp 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.110
 and with the other adhesive tape the 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.920
 place in the slot is so that you do not 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:36.050
 come out the little piece that we have put 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.050
 we put it well we seal well 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:48.200
 If we go well, you see that the 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:50.450
 woman x and you can see 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.700
 the puig would already be mounted so good 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.740
 we left it here for today 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:59.760
 well this explained that this new 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:02.460
 command of quick there is already a video how 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.850
 is finished and well I hope that you
