00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
it right here i guess i'll make like an

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.360 
it right here i guess i'll make like an
annotation<00:02:22.560> but<00:02:22.890> if<00:02:22.950> there's<00:02:23.100> nothing<00:02:23.190> there

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
annotation but if there's nothing there

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.610 
annotation but if there's nothing there
then<00:02:24.120> nothing<00:02:24.510> else<00:02:24.600> really<00:02:24.780> came<00:02:25.110> newswise
