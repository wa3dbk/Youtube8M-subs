00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.700
 the truth is that it feels like a 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:21.270
 change in your life not 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:24.390
 to be in your house training piloting 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.380
 with just for fun in the simulator 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:32.430
 in the big tourism and change that to be 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.100
 in reality a real track with more 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.250
 competitors with high cars 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.120
 benefits because it is something difficult to 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.870
 describe is not adrenaline is emotions 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.910
 nerve pressures is that is the passion 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.430
 that I carry inside and is what I most 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.980
 like in me in my case because I had to 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.740
 first face in the first place 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.630
 the playstation to the great tourism from 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:02.360
 house to fight against 25 thousand people 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.339
 competitors from all over Europe to 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.310
 classify in my country in Spain 'and 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.890
 Well, after a month of effort 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.090
 Daily training in the simulator 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.550
 then get classified and later 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.729
 qualify for the European final in 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.200
 silverstone in england circuit 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.479
 prestigious and our 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.640
 and that's when the finals were 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.399
 European countries where we had evidence 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.299
 very hard physical with sergeants 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:35.759
 military squeezing us to the fullest for 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.679
 play with our mental pressure what 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.829
 strong that we are mentally and 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.829
 physically 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.270
 they put us then imagine in a circuit 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:51.090
 through the forest with mud and lake the two 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.659
 areas of jump zones that had to be 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.859
 burying himself under the mud 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.560
 under the rain of climbing mountains were 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.780
 tests that put us to the limit of 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.750
 our our physical but more 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.239
 mentally they wanted to see it how strong 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.910
 we were mentally and that and that 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.720
 physically I was not the best at that 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.220
 moment but mentally I wanted to win and 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.440
 I wanted to demonstrate at all times that 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.410
 I wanted to continue and follow until the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.049
 final only by the experiences you feel 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.510
 the car more commit more mistakes than you 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:30.410
 they do improve that make you feel better 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.390
 of the car and good to communicate well 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.760
 with an engineer you have to be clear 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.410
 you have to be concise you have to be 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:43.490
 brief and especially that he understands 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.360
 in the best way better better than the 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.370
 simplest way as well as 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.980
 have to feel in the car that what 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.160
 feels like we are very 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.420
 complicated to describe but but the 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.360
 communication between both is this 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.230
 good for me mans is the race of 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.690
 year the key career 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.500
 where the teams are 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.349
 most important sponsors and good 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.390
 that's where you have to prove everything and 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:18.379
 being on the podium including the year was 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.540
 something unforgettable very very special that 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.060
 marked a before and after in my 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.540
 sports career and above all also 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.420
 for nissan gt academy in which 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.790
 we really show that 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.380
 system this mentor that is 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.150
 organization works and nothing was a 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.970
 unforgettable feeling and the most 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.790
 pretty we have with 23 years I entered the 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.980
 gt academy and of course if not at 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.410
 principle I said I'm from already a little 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.440
 too old to enter the 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.170
 competition but I think it goes in the world 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.160
 of the resistance you can compete until 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:01.040
 the 45 years to make a good living is the 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.019
 professional pilot of a brand and be 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.750
 Quick 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:08.269
 I did not have any complex and what I try 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.760
 is to keep improving year by year and not 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.840
 think of nothing 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:17.019
 the nissan sports brand so what 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.250
 We intend to reach the youngest 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.370
 and not so young for 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:27.210
 make it clear that what nissan is full 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.860
 of adrenaline of emotions and examination 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.700
 as the logo says 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.830
 of the site so that is part of our 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.110
 work 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.520
 when in our great product like the 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.520
 nissan gt-r obviously 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.069
 It gives us many facilities when it comes to 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.550
 demonstrate to everyone that we are a 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:49.960
 mark that apart from doing from trucks 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:54.220
 until 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:57.850
 and SUVs up to cars micro cars 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:01.380
 we are also able to do super 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:05.319
 sports that exceed many brands 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.870
 man i would like to compete online 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:10.419
 with the fans because I miss it what 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.280
 they ask for a lot I do not feel bad because 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.500
 I have many followers and many people 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.900
 that asks me to compete with them and the 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.160
 truth is that 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.470
 I would like it is not competition 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.500
 of adrenaline really that is that it 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.870
 Enjoy to the fullest and produce emotions 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.960
 Being connected with people from all over the 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.910
 world friends and is not there not friends 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.350

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.169
 circuit and to get get in that 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.889
 moment is something exciting 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:43.199
 the big tourism developers are 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.759
 they are extremely extra 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:50.190
 perfectionists 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:53.610
 if you notice the cars when 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:56.700
 you give the zoom in the car you can see 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.340
 up carbon fiber dirt from the 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:03.060
 car and that you will never allow it 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.920
 you will perceive in driving but they are 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.960
 an instant perfectionists and want 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.960
