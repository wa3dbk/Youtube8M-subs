again<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.739> fan<00:02:30.069> pattern<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:30.819> complete<00:02:31.239> it<00:02:31.269> by

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
again a fan pattern you complete it by

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.479 
again a fan pattern you complete it by
casting<00:02:32.290> out<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.620> far<00:02:32.830> right<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.370> go

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
casting out to the far right so you go

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.210 
casting out to the far right so you go
left<00:02:33.760> center<00:02:34.599> right<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.440> then<00:02:35.590> obviously<00:02:35.709> a

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
left center right and then obviously a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.490 
left center right and then obviously a
lot<00:02:36.459> between<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:37.690> is<00:02:37.900> see<00:02:38.050> where<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.349> can

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
lot between this is see where you can

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.949 
lot between this is see where you can
maybe<00:02:38.620> find<00:02:38.890> some<00:02:39.130> wall<00:02:39.310> art<00:02:45.720> that's<00:02:46.720> pretty

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959
