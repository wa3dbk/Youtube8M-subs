00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.100
 Hmm 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.090
 Hmm

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:30.220
 You're 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:35.380
 Of course the new part that I participated in was also a difficult part 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.520
 Is whether the Tteyuu everyone's shooting of the world their own members is not it was really very 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.970
 The amazing site is 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.070
 It's about the healing space already it's really a blast scene 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.620
 Because it was great 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.620
 I was surprised to see the work of 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:59.899
 Pretty If you leave without the glasses Toka thought or been in fine stone is flying 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:03.820
 It's was after system Toka or thought I Na'm very is also difficult amazing walls stone I Haiku 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:07.170
 If there is nothing else if it is warm, even a facial expression 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.170
 I hear 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:17.130
 6 cars and that Hirata-san's microphone action combine this power over and over again and again the camera 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.980
 That team too 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.290
 Riding towards the rack 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:27.690
 Please be fair 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:33.030
 I'm just wondering because a lot of people got their breath together 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.659
 I was just putting it behind me early, but I was already overwhelmed by the power of that 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.740
 It was put away 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:44.930
 I think it was even faster, but I soon got used to the colors 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:47.200
 It becomes stronger and not to not to think even two nothing much this not slow to get used 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.460
 Because it takes about 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.460
 I wanted to know 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.600
 I agree 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:00.650
 It was not so good to say good luck with everyone, but with Enka 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:06.260
 I had it, but I could not stop 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:10.490
 Since it was found that to come back and then shoot went 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:15.500
 It will be entered also you and a square meal 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.340

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.230

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:25.590
 Not 's say say Toka are Toka talk to Toka interval of 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:30.180
 Even if everyone is silent 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:34.080
 We had a thing or line say mean like a something kind of relationship good 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:38.980
 Not change unless I'm the same likely even without saying a thing 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:45.390
 I just want to see you without being able to speak something 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:48.560
 There was some kind of cohesion that everyone had 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.460
 I can see that 7 moon bars 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.800
 Because it is too cool 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:03:00.950
 Standing went yet a look even better to me is to see the movie 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:06.610
