 windows and for mac we just give it 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.250
 here to this little button here the page 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.170
 web automatically detects us that the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.150
 operating system we have us and we 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.950
 will allow to download the client for 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.930
 our operating system in my case 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.710
 for mac I have already downloaded it 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.870
 I have in this one 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.210
 so I'm going to teach you just 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.530
 in the application of the line is this 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.540
 here 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.860
 this is the interface of the application 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.080
 line of change that I do a little bit more 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.260
 This is the application of 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.630

 we have added the phone number or 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.930
 because simply with the line aid and with 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.640

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.360
 add contacts we can search 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.769

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.489
 when they through line or well 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.100
 line is going to make us a series of 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.540
 recommendations to add friends not in 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.250

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.780
 we follow and all this 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.670
 let's do a mini test so that 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.850

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.860

 perfect and what we can do here 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.180
 also if we give this little button of 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.370
 here is to add stickers we have all 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.410

 Lots of pretty cool girls we can 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.270
 put stickers of teddy bears 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.270
 the truth is that we have good ones 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.569
 Pretty pretty stickers, let's go 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.219
 to put this one of a few beers 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.379
 well here we have all the stickers 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:13.700
 available are free so this 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.109
 it's pretty good obviously we're going to 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.630
 be able to buy stickers if you want not 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.949
 We put the smartphone application is 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.989
 pretty good, well, if we give 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.880
 this little button here we will be able to 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.460
 share files I will select 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.070
 We can share videos or videos 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.199
 audios at the moment we can not share 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.820
 nothing else we are going to send you a photograph 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.639
 I'll send you the podcast logo 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.680
 of your mother who is sending and good not 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.690
 he answers me to see if he answers between 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.070
 a little while and just tell you that this is 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.960
 the review of the application application 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.580
 does not have anything else still has certain 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.530
 deficiencies I would not like it to be possible 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.880
 for example make a call that does not 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.590
 you can now just only going to 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.270
 be able to chat but good everything will walk 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.220
 the application is quite good and the 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.900
 true that having it on the computer is a 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.000
 relief because when they send me a 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.410
 message to the iphone the truth that no 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.639
 I want to go to the iphone to answer if I'm 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.410
 on the computer I want to answer 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.539
 directly from the computer and that 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.759
 it seems brutal besides there is an option in 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.320
 the adjustments that I will be able to say that 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:07.610
 if it comes to me if I have the computer 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.800
 lit with the application of air 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.720
 turned on the messages do not reach me 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.460
 iphone but I get to the 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.110
 application of the computer with which the 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.940
 iphone already encouraged to whistle with which 3 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.740
 fantastic good is an application that 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.420
 I recommend you if you use line I think that 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.580
 you have to have this application in 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.020
 your computer and nothing else here I go 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.070
 to dismiss and we're going to see in a 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.070
 next video see you later
