 ae 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.459
 hello my name is yellow and I am 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.289
 here today to present to you a 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.550
 recipe that is very cool 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.410
 some people can not seem like a 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.259
 little strange but I assure you 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.029
 it will be a delight so people with 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:24.349
 less orthodox palates will be a 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.579
 perfect combination and if you want 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.869
 try something new 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.720
 I think it's worth making this recipe. 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.880
 to test we will start 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.469
 preparing the last ingredients in the 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.910
 Indeed the caramel and then the bacon 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.829
 people start slicing bacon 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.020
 We're going to need 400 grams a 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.149
 we cut it we will affect this 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.530
 bacon we're going to book this alley 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.449
 Then we'll put you on top of it. 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.219
 end, we put here to quote 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.170
 Leave him here a little until he 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.609
 stay in point when the bacon goes 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.839
 It takes a while to get to 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.999
 take that point I told you to 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:56.570
 You guys, it 's really crispy and dark. 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:58.969

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.010
 Hot, we also put the sugar 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.050
 refined, people are melting this 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.960
 sugar and it will reach that point of 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.340
 very dense caramel in an amber color and 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.290
 only when it is completely 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.570

 You're the one with a paper towel. 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.940
 for him to be very crispy let's do 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.100
 now we put the butter and the 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.900
 half bitter chocolate and will put it 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.280
 microwave for four minutinhos 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.960
 a little bit is ready and the 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.540
 people enter the size 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.670
 let's start to make the mass of the 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.920
 our brauneck fpf 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.160
 we start beating 4 eggs as 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.160
 was 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.390
 Okay, both of us beaten now. 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.880
 melted chocolate and butter sugar 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.240
 There's a little rock we're going to put 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.370
 in our sugar egg mixture 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.380
 we will gently incorporate the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.880
 flour already venerated gives you a halt 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.580
 Turn on your oven to let it 170 degrees already 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.280
 pre warmed up ending here we go 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.200
 take a shape that we already have 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.790
 bacon fat 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.370
 we live with a little flour 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.280
 and we're going to play that race beautifully 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.230
 here in this form we are here 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.270
 brownie now looking at the oven 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.070
 I'd rather leave it 20 minutes later 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.709
 in your team loses much of the power of the 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.200
 your oven you leave for another 10 12 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.970
 minutes but always with an eye that the great 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.360
 The secret of a great success is the oven. 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.459
 so keep an eye on 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.560
 we have reached a better moment of the recipe 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.560
 what to take brazil out of the common mount 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.280
 accounts because the best part is 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.400
 we matter here and then we go 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.019
 play this wonderful cause over 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.080
