00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hello, I'll show you today how to do that 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.429
 code lock on the iphone ipod touch or 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.219
 ipad is aimed at all devices 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.509
 pretty easy so go first time 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:20.699
 then the settings then generally 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:25.470
 down here you see, you get on it and 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:29.849
 then activate call above gives her the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.439
 code you just want me 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.840
 times for testing purposes 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:39.320
 then give it again to confirm 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.879
 well then yes already activated and 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.149
 after that how much was required 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:50.489
 so should be if you lure the ipad 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:01:03.739
 whether the immediately displayed 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:01:03.739
 after a minute immediately easier code 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.840
 the first league pay well and you can 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.979
 just an x-any long pay 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.390
 Enter letter sign code 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:24.270
 then you can still set whether here 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:29.009
 in the lockscreen here and now the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.840
 use picture frame word here are yes 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.340
 already in the cent area enter the code 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.939
 So if now a minute 1 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.939
 given 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.590
 you're the one minute and then wait 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.649
 so that the cost demanded 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.649
 if we lock it now yes 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.659
 if you wanted the calendars again 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.909
 on it enters the new code 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.190
 come talk and thanks dileo code 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.460
 change goes under an old modern 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.720
 99 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.080
 here you can still set 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:13.550
 at the failed try that 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.120
 then the entire content of your device 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.590
 should be deleted 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.000
 how do i do these things on it is 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.350
 that's pretty useful in the summer 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.680
