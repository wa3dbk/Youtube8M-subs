do I need to dedicate to my training
program<00:02:47.959> each<00:02:48.500> week<00:02:48.549> I'll<00:02:49.549> learn<00:02:49.819> to<00:02:49.879> run

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
program each week I'll learn to run

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.059 
program each week I'll learn to run
program<00:02:50.629> or<00:02:50.810> even<00:02:51.109> a<00:02:51.170> more<00:02:51.319> advanced<00:02:51.799> training

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
program or even a more advanced training

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.729 
program or even a more advanced training
program<00:02:52.459> really<00:02:53.239> only<00:02:53.540> requires<00:02:54.109> about<00:02:54.409> 30

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
program really only requires about 30

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.410 
program really only requires about 30
minutes<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.189> your<00:02:55.220> time<00:02:55.400> three<00:02:55.879> days<00:02:55.909> per<00:02:56.269> week

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
minutes of your time three days per week

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.009 
minutes of your time three days per week
that's<00:02:56.629> it

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
that's it

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.830 
that's it
so<00:02:57.319> it's<00:02:57.560> realistic<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:58.370> can<00:02:58.519> fit<00:02:58.760> into<00:02:58.970> almost

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
so it's realistic it can fit into almost

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.020 
so it's realistic it can fit into almost
every<00:03:00.409> single<00:03:00.620> person's<00:03:01.099> lifestyle<00:03:01.549> what

kind of workouts can I expect and I

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.460 
kind of workouts can I expect and I
learn<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:04.400> run<00:03:04.549> program<00:03:05.060> well<00:03:05.930> if<00:03:06.079> you're<00:03:06.200> just

by far the worst training surface to do

you're an experienced runner I would
highly<00:03:57.590> recommend<00:03:58.069> that<00:03:58.129> you<00:03:58.250> do<00:03:58.489> very<00:03:58.790> little

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
highly recommend that you do very little

highly recommend that you do very little
with<00:03:59.239> any<00:03:59.480> of<00:03:59.780> your<00:04:00.379> training<00:04:00.739> runs<00:04:01.069> on

with any of your training runs on
sidewalks<00:04:02.209> paved<00:04:02.599> roads<00:04:02.870> are<00:04:03.079> a<00:04:03.109> little<00:04:03.260> bit

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
sidewalks paved roads are a little bit

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.409 
sidewalks paved roads are a little bit
more<00:04:03.530> forgiving<00:04:04.190> so<00:04:04.370> it's<00:04:04.549> not<00:04:04.730> quite<00:04:04.970> as<00:04:05.239> bad

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
more forgiving so it's not quite as bad

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.050 
more forgiving so it's not quite as bad
but<00:04:05.709> sidewalks<00:04:06.709> by<00:04:06.949> far<00:04:07.310> in<00:04:07.400> a<00:04:07.489> way<00:04:07.519> should<00:04:07.940> be

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
but sidewalks by far in a way should be

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.180 
but sidewalks by far in a way should be
avoided<00:04:08.530> especially<00:04:09.530> if<00:04:09.709> you're<00:04:09.949> a<00:04:10.040> beginner

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
avoided especially if you're a beginner

now<00:04:11.150> when<00:04:11.540> you<00:04:11.629> talk<00:04:11.810> about<00:04:12.139> some<00:04:12.379> of<00:04:12.409> the<00:04:12.560> best

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
now when you talk about some of the best

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.460 
now when you talk about some of the best
training<00:04:13.489> surfaces<00:04:14.139> obviously<00:04:15.139> we're

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
training surfaces obviously we're

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.289 
training surfaces obviously we're
standing<00:04:15.859> here<00:04:15.919> on<00:04:16.159> a<00:04:16.190> synthetic<00:04:16.699> track<00:04:16.970> when

standing here on a synthetic track when

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.750 
standing here on a synthetic track when
you're<00:04:17.419> outdoors<00:04:17.599> this<00:04:18.470> is<00:04:18.739> probably<00:04:19.370> the

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
you're outdoors this is probably the

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.120 
you're outdoors this is probably the
best<00:04:19.940> surface<00:04:20.359> to<00:04:20.510> Train<00:04:20.750> on<00:04:21.099> gravel<00:04:22.099> roads

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
best surface to Train on gravel roads

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.939 
best surface to Train on gravel roads
rails<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.180> trails<00:04:23.210> surfaces<00:04:24.020> are<00:04:24.229> another

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
rails to trails surfaces are another

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.529 
rails to trails surfaces are another
excellent<00:04:25.430> training<00:04:25.880> surface<00:04:26.300> and<00:04:26.449> then

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
excellent training surface and then

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:27.790 
excellent training surface and then
obviously<00:04:26.720> when<00:04:27.139> you<00:04:27.260> move<00:04:27.440> indoors

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
obviously when you move indoors

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.000 
obviously when you move indoors
treadmills<00:04:28.760> are<00:04:29.080> probably<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.320> best<00:04:30.650> surface

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
treadmills are probably the best surface

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.649 
treadmills are probably the best surface
to<00:04:31.159> train<00:04:31.370> on<00:04:31.490> because<00:04:31.880> they're<00:04:32.090> all<00:04:32.270> equipped

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:32.659 
to train on because they're all equipped

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.810

with<00:04:32.900> shock<00:04:33.200> absorbing<00:04:33.740> decks<00:04:34.039> so<00:04:34.520> it's<00:04:34.669> going

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
with shock absorbing decks so it's going

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.339 
with shock absorbing decks so it's going

run around the track and it'll tell you

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.250 
run around the track and it'll tell you

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.750 
that okay it's time to run for 30
seconds<00:05:00.710> it's<00:05:00.950> like<00:05:01.100> having<00:05:01.340> a<00:05:01.400> personal

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760
