00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
we've been playing with it and it seems

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.450 
we've been playing with it and it seems
like<00:00:46.170> one<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> most<00:00:46.680> fun<00:00:46.890> toys<00:00:47.129> I've<00:00:47.309> seen

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
like one of the most fun toys I've seen

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.580 
like one of the most fun toys I've seen
on<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> floor<00:00:47.879> his<00:00:48.600> name<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.870> jo<00:00:49.079> baat<00:00:49.289> he's

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
on the floor his name is jo baat he's

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.860 
on the floor his name is jo baat he's
not<00:00:49.950> your<00:00:50.010> average<00:00:50.309> Joe<00:00:50.730> Sarah<00:00:51.420> Palin<00:00:51.780> would

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
not your average Joe Sarah Palin would

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.979 
not your average Joe Sarah Palin would
say<00:00:52.110> Joe<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.010> Plumber<00:00:53.250> perhaps<00:00:53.960> he's<00:00:54.960> a

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
say Joe the Plumber perhaps he's a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.080 
say Joe the Plumber perhaps he's a
beatboxer<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.890> basically<00:00:56.280> what<00:00:56.430> he<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.879> is

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
beatboxer so basically what he can do is

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.420 
beatboxer so basically what he can do is
uh<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.960> actually<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.440> tap<00:00:58.620> out<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> rhythm<00:00:59.190> on

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
uh you actually can tap out a rhythm on

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.029 
uh you actually can tap out a rhythm on
his<00:00:59.609> body<00:00:59.820> he'll<00:01:00.539> sense<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:01.800> be<00:01:01.949> able

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
his body he'll sense it and then be able

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.670 
his body he'll sense it and then be able
to<00:01:02.160> repeat<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.670> store<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.030> later<00:01:03.530> why<00:01:04.530> we

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
to repeat it in store it later why we

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.630 
to repeat it in store it later why we
actually<00:01:04.979> came<00:01:05.100> out<00:01:05.250> with<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.489> original

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
actually came out with the original

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.240 
actually came out with the original
robosapien<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.540> 2004<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.350> he's<00:01:07.530> really<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> next

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
robosapien in 2004 so he's really a next

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.590 
robosapien in 2004 so he's really a next
generation<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.000> he's<00:01:09.180> got<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> lot<00:01:09.540> more

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
generation of that he's got a lot more

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.039 
generation of that he's got a lot more
content<00:01:09.990> built<00:01:10.439> into<00:01:10.770> him<00:01:11.119> he<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.299> dance<00:01:12.510> walk

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
content built into him he can dance walk

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.100 
content built into him he can dance walk
he's<00:01:13.590> got<00:01:13.799> games<00:01:14.130> he<00:01:14.520> tells<00:01:14.729> jokes<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.960> then

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
he's got games he tells jokes and then

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.080

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
to detect objects and if you have a

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.740 
to detect objects and if you have a
regular<00:01:23.400> TV<00:01:23.580> mode<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.060> remote<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.720> can

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
regular TV mode you remote you can

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.510 
regular TV mode you remote you can
actually<00:01:25.140> engage<00:01:25.259> him<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.680> battle<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.189> gotta

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
actually engage him in battle I gotta

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.679 
actually engage him in battle I gotta
say<00:01:26.670> he's<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.850> little<00:01:27.060> rude<00:01:27.210> because<00:01:27.479> we're

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
say he's a little rude because we're

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.210 
say he's a little rude because we're
sitting<00:01:27.900> or<00:01:27.990> having<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.259> conversation<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.100> he

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
sitting or having a conversation and he

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.740 
sitting or having a conversation and he
keeps<00:01:29.520> trying<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.820> interrupt<00:01:30.000> us<00:01:30.240> yeah<00:01:30.509> his

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
keeps trying to interrupt us yeah his

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.999 
keeps trying to interrupt us yeah his
that<00:01:31.020> what<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.229> think<00:01:31.259> we're<00:01:31.530> triggering<00:01:31.920> his

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
that what I think we're triggering his

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.920 
that what I think we're triggering his
ir<00:01:32.369> sensor<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:32.970> every<00:01:33.180> time<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.450> move<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.720> front

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
ir sensor so every time we move in front

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.999 
ir sensor so every time we move in front
of<00:01:33.990> them<00:01:34.110> he's<00:01:34.170> going<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.470> make<00:01:34.560> some<00:01:34.740> sort<00:01:34.920> of

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
of them he's going to make some sort of

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.160 
of them he's going to make some sort of
quip<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.180> want<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.509> show<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
quip but if you want I can show you the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.780 
quip but if you want I can show you the
beatbox<00:01:37.770> boat<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:38.310> yeah<00:01:38.520> what<00:01:38.640> kind<00:01:38.700> of

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
beatbox boat here yeah what kind of
