trimming<00:01:57.280> off<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:58.450> extra<00:01:58.690> clay<00:01:58.930> we're<00:01:59.170> just

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
trimming off the extra clay we're just

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.990 
trimming off the extra clay we're just
going<00:01:59.470> to<00:01:59.590> smooth<00:01:59.830> out<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.070> edges<00:02:00.100> like<00:02:00.850> the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
going to smooth out the edges like the

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.810 
going to smooth out the edges like the
rough<00:02:01.180> edges<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:02.070> smooth<00:02:03.070> out<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.369> top<00:02:03.580> to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
rough edges and smooth out the top to

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.660 
rough edges and smooth out the top to
make<00:02:03.940> it<00:02:04.090> smooth<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:05.190> more<00:02:06.190> attractive

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
make it smooth and more attractive

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:36.210 
make it smooth and more attractive
looking<00:02:06.940> yeah

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.680

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
after we're done putting our cupcake in

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.230 
after we're done putting our cupcake in
like<00:02:39.440> our<00:02:39.620> yellow<00:02:40.340> clay<00:02:40.640> into<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.030> cupcake

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
like our yellow clay into the cupcake

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.460 
like our yellow clay into the cupcake

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
face mode we're going to want to grab

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.610 
face mode we're going to want to grab
some<00:02:42.500> tannish<00:02:43.430> beige<00:02:44.240> is<00:02:44.569> type<00:02:44.870> color<00:02:45.260> and

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
we're going to want to roll it up after

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.000 
we're going to want to roll it up after
done<00:02:47.870> rolling<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.319> we're<00:02:48.530> just<00:02:48.650> going<00:02:48.770> to<00:02:48.830> want

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
done rolling it we're just going to want

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.100 
done rolling it we're just going to want
to<00:02:49.160> patent<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:49.700> down<00:02:50.060> onto<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.480> cupcake<00:02:50.900> base

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
to patent it down onto the cupcake base

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.140 
to patent it down onto the cupcake base
mold<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.650> we're<00:02:52.310> just<00:02:52.400> going<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.610> smooth<00:02:52.970> out

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
mold and we're just going to smooth out

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.540 
mold and we're just going to smooth out
the<00:02:53.360> edges<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:54.080> create<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.590> round<00:02:55.040> circular

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
the edges to create a round circular

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.650 
the edges to create a round circular
shape<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.420> create<00:02:56.810> like<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.980> cupcake<00:02:58.430> top<00:02:59.390> I

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
shape to create like the cupcake top I

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.920 
shape to create like the cupcake top I
guess<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.200> yeah<00:03:01.120> that's<00:03:02.120> all<00:03:02.420> you're<00:03:02.600> doing<00:03:02.810> is

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
guess so yeah that's all you're doing is

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.750 
guess so yeah that's all you're doing is
smoothing<00:03:03.200> out<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.590> edges<00:03:03.709> down<00:03:04.250> onto<00:03:04.640> the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
smoothing out the edges down onto the

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.920 
smoothing out the edges down onto the
base

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.330 

now<00:03:10.930> we're<00:03:11.200> getting<00:03:11.410> to<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.560> fun<00:03:11.830> part<00:03:12.070> which

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
now we're getting to the fun part which

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.970 
now we're getting to the fun part which
we're<00:03:12.610> going<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.850> want<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.150> grab<00:03:13.330> rtls<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:14.380> all

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
we're going to want to grab rtls and all

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.520 
we're going to want to grab rtls and all
I<00:03:15.040> did<00:03:15.430> here<00:03:15.760> was<00:03:15.790> grab<00:03:16.210> a<00:03:16.240> piece<00:03:16.420> of<00:03:16.480> paper<00:03:16.720> put

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
I did here was grab a piece of paper put

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.620 
I did here was grab a piece of paper put
my<00:03:17.650> clay<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:18.100> mighty<00:03:18.430> LS<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.270> we're<00:03:19.450> going<00:03:19.600> to

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
my clay and mighty LS and we're going to

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.960 
my clay and mighty LS and we're going to
put<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.930> good<00:03:20.350> amount<00:03:20.410> of<00:03:20.710> TLS<00:03:21.130> at<00:03:21.370> first<00:03:21.640> and

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
put a good amount of TLS at first and

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.820 
put a good amount of TLS at first and
since<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:22.690> glow-in-the-dark<00:03:22.990> is<00:03:23.350> really

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
since the glow-in-the-dark is really

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.080 
since the glow-in-the-dark is really
soft<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:24.730> like<00:03:25.120> it's<00:03:25.450> easy<00:03:26.460> to<00:03:27.460> mix<00:03:27.640> it<00:03:27.880> it

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
soft and like it's easy to mix it it

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.000 
soft and like it's easy to mix it it
this<00:03:28.450> is<00:03:28.630> going<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:28.870> be<00:03:28.930> really<00:03:29.260> fast<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.770> easy

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
this is going to be really fast and easy

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.490 
this is going to be really fast and easy
to<00:03:30.310> get<00:03:30.520> our<00:03:31.260> icing<00:03:32.260> in<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.770> good<00:03:33.160> amount<00:03:33.610> and

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
to get our icing in a good amount and

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.930 
to get our icing in a good amount and
yeah<00:03:35.500> so<00:03:35.710> basically<00:03:35.860> after<00:03:36.310> we<00:03:36.550> put<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.760> good

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
yeah so basically after we put a good

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.060 
yeah so basically after we put a good
amount<00:03:37.000> of<00:03:37.300> TLS<00:03:37.630> we're<00:03:38.590> going<00:03:38.710> to<00:03:38.770> want<00:03:38.980> to

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
amount of TLS we're going to want to

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.110 
amount of TLS we're going to want to
grab<00:03:39.310> a<00:03:39.630> nice<00:03:40.630> tool<00:03:41.260> that<00:03:41.710> you<00:03:41.920> can<00:03:41.950> like<00:03:42.670> use

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
grab a nice tool that you can like use

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.210 
grab a nice tool that you can like use
to<00:03:43.450> mix<00:03:43.660> up<00:03:43.960> this<00:03:44.140> heelys<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.740> what<00:03:44.890> I<00:03:44.920> did

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
to mix up this heelys and what I did

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.800 
to mix up this heelys and what I did
here<00:03:45.520> was<00:03:45.670> I<00:03:46.180> just<00:03:46.450> grabbed<00:03:46.960> a<00:03:48.300> bobby<00:03:49.300> pin<00:03:49.450> and

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
here was I just grabbed a bobby pin and

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.810 
here was I just grabbed a bobby pin and
that's<00:03:50.290> what<00:03:50.440> I'm<00:03:50.530> going<00:03:50.650> to<00:03:50.710> do<00:03:50.890> shown<00:03:51.490> in<00:03:51.700> the

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
that's what I'm going to do shown in the

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.110 
that's what I'm going to do shown in the
clip

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.280 

as<00:03:57.680> you<00:03:58.680> can<00:03:58.799> see<00:03:59.099> from<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.519> video<00:03:59.670> i<00:04:00.180> am<00:04:00.840> now

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
as you can see from the video i am now

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.399 
as you can see from the video i am now
mixing<00:04:02.099> the<00:04:02.310> TLS<00:04:02.909> with<00:04:03.209> my<00:04:03.450> glowing<00:04:03.720> dark<00:04:04.110> clay

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
mixing the TLS with my glowing dark clay

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.350 
mixing the TLS with my glowing dark clay
and<00:04:04.739> it's<00:04:05.370> actually<00:04:05.790> working<00:04:05.940> out<00:04:06.180> pretty

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
and it's actually working out pretty

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.509 
and it's actually working out pretty
well<00:04:06.480> since<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.080> clay<00:04:07.290> was<00:04:07.319> really<00:04:08.010> soft<00:04:08.280> and

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
well since the clay was really soft and

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.089 
well since the clay was really soft and
smooth<00:04:08.940> so<00:04:09.870> that's<00:04:10.260> pretty<00:04:10.530> much<00:04:10.680> it<00:04:10.739> you're

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
smooth so that's pretty much it you're

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.979 
smooth so that's pretty much it you're
just<00:04:11.220> going<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.400> want<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.610> mix<00:04:11.760> on<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.360> TLS<00:04:12.750> and

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
just going to want to mix on the TLS and

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.619 
just going to want to mix on the TLS and
they<00:04:13.049> play<00:04:13.200> together<00:04:13.409> really<00:04:14.060> go<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:15.360> then<00:04:15.510> you

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
they play together really go so then you

00:04:15.629 --> 00:05:06.350 
they play together really go so then you
create<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:16.169> icing<00:04:16.650> effect

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.779 

next<00:05:07.229> as<00:05:07.409> you<00:05:07.530> can<00:05:07.680> see<00:05:07.889> i<00:05:07.919> just<00:05:08.400> finished

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
next as you can see i just finished

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.209 
next as you can see i just finished
