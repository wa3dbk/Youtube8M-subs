and and when I'm working on the project
it<00:04:06.099> goes<00:04:06.280> straight<00:04:06.609> in<00:04:06.760> there<00:04:06.970> for<00:04:07.269> example<00:04:07.889> I

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
it goes straight in there for example I

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.710 
it goes straight in there for example I
finished<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:11.040> finishing<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.849> apron<00:04:13.269> and

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
finished the finishing the apron and

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.960 
finished the finishing the apron and
it's<00:04:13.870> still<00:04:14.049> in<00:04:14.139> this<00:04:14.230> little<00:04:14.579> project<00:04:15.579> bag

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
it's still in this little project bag

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.680 
it's still in this little project bag
and<00:04:16.450> it's<00:04:17.019> it's<00:04:17.320> you<00:04:17.739> know<00:04:17.769> with<00:04:18.039> the<00:04:18.190> pattern

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
and it's it's you know with the pattern

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.870 
and it's it's you know with the pattern
and<00:04:19.690> it's<00:04:20.229> right<00:04:20.469> there<00:04:20.769> and<00:04:21.039> I<00:04:21.640> know<00:04:21.700> exactly

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
and it's right there and I know exactly

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.249 
and it's right there and I know exactly
where<00:04:22.450> this<00:04:22.599> and

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:23.259 
where this and

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.200 
where this and
it's<00:04:24.259> visible<00:04:24.860> I<00:04:25.370> think<00:04:25.910> it's<00:04:26.030> really

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
it's visible I think it's really

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.870 
it's visible I think it's really
important<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:26.780> have<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.080> visibility<00:04:27.880> because

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
important to have the visibility because

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.290 
important to have the visibility because
when<00:04:29.120> we<00:04:29.330> just<00:04:29.570> put<00:04:29.870> it<00:04:30.020> away<00:04:30.139> in<00:04:30.620> sort<00:04:30.919> of<00:04:31.040> like

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
when we just put it away in sort of like

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.300 
when we just put it away in sort of like
fabric<00:04:32.300> bags<00:04:32.539> or<00:04:32.900> things<00:04:33.500> like<00:04:33.620> that<00:04:33.740> we

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
fabric bags or things like that we

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.120 
fabric bags or things like that we
forget<00:04:34.340> we<00:04:34.789> have<00:04:35.120> them<00:04:35.800> and<00:04:36.800> when<00:04:36.979> you're

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
forget we have them and when you're

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.010 
forget we have them and when you're
working<00:04:37.280> on<00:04:37.610> them<00:04:37.820> they're<00:04:38.150> right<00:04:38.419> there<00:04:38.720> you

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
working on them they're right there you

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.110 
working on them they're right there you
can<00:04:39.169> see<00:04:39.350> exactly<00:04:39.590> how<00:04:39.919> far<00:04:39.949> you've<00:04:40.400> come<00:04:40.430> and

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
can see exactly how far you've come and

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.790 
can see exactly how far you've come and
what<00:04:41.330> more<00:04:41.479> you<00:04:41.539> have<00:04:41.810> to<00:04:41.990> do<00:04:42.169> and<00:04:42.440> things<00:04:42.620> like

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
what more you have to do and things like

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.890 
what more you have to do and things like
that<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.280> I<00:04:43.460> just<00:04:43.759> think<00:04:43.970> it<00:04:44.180> makes<00:04:44.570> our

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
that and I just think it makes our

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.409 
that and I just think it makes our
sewing<00:04:45.169> life<00:04:45.500> a<00:04:45.680> lot<00:04:45.889> easier<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:46.419> more

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
sewing life a lot easier and more

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:54.100 
sewing life a lot easier and more
organized<00:04:48.880> so<00:04:50.050> lovely<00:04:51.050> ladies<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:51.860> germs
