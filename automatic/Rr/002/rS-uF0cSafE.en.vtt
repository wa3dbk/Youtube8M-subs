hype<00:02:40.610> like<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.239> don't<00:02:41.300> think<00:02:41.569> he<00:02:41.690> really<00:02:41.959> should

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
hype like I don't think he really should

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.600 
hype like I don't think he really should
have<00:02:42.170> one<00:02:42.349> like<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:42.560> dumped<00:02:42.980> over<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.340> car

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
have one like that dumped over the car

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.729 
have one like that dumped over the car
that<00:02:43.880> was<00:02:44.030> kind<00:02:44.300> of<00:02:44.420> weak<00:02:44.599> they<00:02:45.200> hyped<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.620> up

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
that was kind of weak they hyped it up

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.100 
that was kind of weak they hyped it up
so<00:02:46.040> much<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:47.390> just<00:02:47.569> wasn't<00:02:47.780> what<00:02:47.930> you

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
so much and it just wasn't what you

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.809 
so much and it just wasn't what you
really<00:02:48.260> expected<00:02:48.950> he<00:02:49.069> jumped<00:02:49.370> over<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:49.580> hood

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
really expected he jumped over the hood

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.090 
really expected he jumped over the hood
of<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.000> car<00:02:50.030> so<00:02:51.019> it<00:02:51.319> wasn't<00:02:51.650> like<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.830> jumped

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
of the car so it wasn't like you jumped

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.620 
of the car so it wasn't like you jumped
all<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.310> way<00:02:52.459> over<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.850> car<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:53.299> you<00:02:53.360> know<00:02:53.510> I'm

all the way over the car so you know I'm

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.330 
all the way over the car so you know I'm
saying<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:54.019> I<00:02:54.140> felt<00:02:54.650> like<00:02:54.799> they<00:02:55.010> kind<00:02:55.220> of

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
saying it I felt like they kind of

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.610
