that's blocking the white bone so the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.380 
that's blocking the white bone so the
black<00:01:01.680> king<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.070> very<00:01:02.100> well<00:01:02.670> placed<00:01:03.030> over

prevents<00:01:07.049> him<00:01:07.170> from<00:01:07.790> advancing<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:10.580> in<00:01:11.580> this

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
prevents him from advancing so in this

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.060 
prevents him from advancing so in this
position<00:01:12.420> black<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:13.170> black<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.619> move<00:01:13.799> and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
position black it's black to move and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.310 
position black it's black to move and
the<00:01:14.400> first<00:01:14.670> move<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> black<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.900> very<00:01:16.140> very

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
the first move of black is a very very

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.469 
the first move of black is a very very
important<00:01:16.860> one<00:01:17.990> black<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.790> achieve<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.150> raw

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
important one black can achieve that raw

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.020 
important one black can achieve that raw
in<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.110> position<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.830> faded<00:01:23.460> opposition

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
in this position the faded opposition

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.109 
in this position the faded opposition
but<00:01:24.750> it's<00:01:25.350> important<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.159> understand<00:01:26.670> how<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
but it's important to understand how to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.109 
but it's important to understand how to
do<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:28.710> first<00:01:29.009> move<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.400> very<00:01:29.610> important

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
do it the first move is very important

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.100 
do it the first move is very important
its<00:01:30.329> rook<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.869> h6<00:01:31.430> actually<00:01:32.659> this<00:01:33.659> rook<00:01:33.990> is

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
its rook to h6 actually this rook is

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.069 
its rook to h6 actually this rook is
cutting<00:01:34.650> off<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:36.299> way<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.770> White<00:01:38.070> King

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
cutting off the way for the White King

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.020 
cutting off the way for the White King
because<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.259> White<00:01:40.470> King<00:01:40.829> cannot<00:01:41.310> cross<00:01:41.790> this

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
because the White King cannot cross this

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.580 
because the White King cannot cross this
line<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:43.500> sixth-ranked<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.610> see<00:01:45.439> so<00:01:46.439> this

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
line of the sixth-ranked you see so this

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.010 
line of the sixth-ranked you see so this
first<00:01:46.829> move<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.280> very<00:01:47.460> important<00:01:47.939> now<00:01:48.780> what

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
first move is very important now what

can why do you can go to g7 give a check

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.179 
can why do you can go to g7 give a check

is<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.850> no<00:02:12.210> pass<00:02:13.070> so<00:02:14.070> for<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.910> White<00:02:15.510> King<00:02:15.980> but

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
is a no pass so for the White King but

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.010 
is a no pass so for the White King but
of<00:02:17.100> course<00:02:17.370> there<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.760> way<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.480> wise<00:02:18.750> can

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
of course there is a way that wise can

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.640 
of course there is a way that wise can
try<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:21.030> cut<00:02:21.300> this<00:02:21.600> line<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.350> is<00:02:22.530> by

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
try to cut this line and that is by

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.950 
try to cut this line and that is by
playing<00:02:22.920> his<00:02:23.190> own<00:02:23.370> pond<00:02:24.140> from<00:02:25.140> me<00:02:25.350> 5<00:02:25.620> 36<00:02:26.160> and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
playing his own pond from me 5 36 and

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.340 
playing his own pond from me 5 36 and
that's<00:02:27.960> exactly<00:02:28.110> what<00:02:28.890> black<00:02:29.580> ones<00:02:30.350> because

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
that's exactly what black ones because

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.180 
that's exactly what black ones because
now<00:02:32.060> Black<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.090> moving<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.510> route<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.990> g1<00:02:34.350> and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
now Black is moving this route to g1 and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.640 
now Black is moving this route to g1 and
the<00:02:35.610> idea<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:36.000> black<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:37.080> start<00:02:37.380> giving

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
the idea of black is to start giving

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.310 
the idea of black is to start giving
checks<00:02:39.080> from<00:02:40.080> this<00:02:40.380> background<00:02:40.650> from<00:02:41.460> here<00:02:42.320> ok

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
checks from this background from here ok

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.920 
checks from this background from here ok
and<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:45.090> White<00:02:45.270> King<00:02:45.890> cannot<00:02:46.890> hide<00:02:47.630> in<00:02:48.630> front

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
and the White King cannot hide in front

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.310 
and the White King cannot hide in front
of<00:02:49.050> comp<00:02:49.290> on<00:02:49.910> because<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.090> white<00:02:51.810> bone<00:02:52.140> is

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
of comp on because the white bone is

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.870 
of comp on because the white bone is
must<00:02:52.680> move<00:02:52.860> too<00:02:53.130> much<00:02:53.480> too<00:02:54.480> much<00:02:54.510> forward<00:02:55.880> so

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
must move too much too much forward so

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.590 
must move too much too much forward so
here<00:02:57.420> if<00:02:58.310> white<00:02:59.310> let's<00:02:59.820> say<00:03:00.060> goes<00:03:00.360> through

here if white let's say goes through

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.860 
here if white let's say goes through
this<00:03:00.780> route<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.890> 4<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.580> order<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.090> put<00:03:03.750> this

this route to a 4 in order to put this

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.840 
this route to a 4 in order to put this
rope<00:03:04.140> in<00:03:04.320> front<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.680> Chongqing<00:03:05.160> when<00:03:05.580> the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
attack one more time the poem so then

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:21.340 
attack one more time the poem so then
white<00:03:14.580> has<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.360> work<00:03:15.989> play<00:03:16.560> route<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.070> 7<00:03:17.750> to

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.460 
if white tries to walk towards the rook
and<00:03:53.250> it's<00:03:53.430> easy<00:03:53.640> because<00:03:54.000> then<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:55.230> pawn

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
and it's easy because then the pawn

and it's easy because then the pawn
Falls<00:03:56.630> I'll<00:03:57.630> go<00:03:57.900> back<00:03:58.080> to<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.410> initial

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
Falls I'll go back to the initial

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.150 
Falls I'll go back to the initial
position<00:03:59.269> this<00:04:00.269> one<00:04:00.510> maybe<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.650> think<00:04:01.890> okay

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
position this one maybe you think okay

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.600 
position this one maybe you think okay
if<00:04:02.220> those<00:04:03.620> checks<00:04:04.820> from<00:04:05.820> with<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.810> rook<00:04:07.610> from

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
the first rank are so important why not

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.890 
the first rank are so important why not
do<00:04:10.769> it<00:04:10.799> at<00:04:11.360> first<00:04:13.220> well<00:04:14.220> I'll<00:04:14.640> show<00:04:15.330> you<00:04:15.390> why<00:04:15.840> it

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
do it at first well I'll show you why it

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.560 
do it at first well I'll show you why it
doesn't<00:04:16.350> work

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
doesn't work

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.730 
doesn't work
because<00:04:18.440> if<00:04:19.360> we<00:04:20.360> go<00:04:20.540> like<00:04:20.750> this<00:04:20.960> let's<00:04:21.470> say

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:21.740 
because if we go like this let's say

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.910 
because if we go like this let's say
white<00:04:22.130> gives<00:04:22.760> a<00:04:22.910> check<00:04:23.180> to<00:04:23.510> force<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:24.110> black

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
white gives a check to force the black

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.400 
white gives a check to force the black
into<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.370> background<00:04:25.790> then<00:04:26.210> why<00:04:26.930> it<00:04:26.990> has<00:04:27.260> to

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
into the background then why it has to

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.760 
into the background then why it has to
save<00:04:27.680> you<00:04:27.800> some<00:04:27.980> work<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:28.490> now<00:04:29.420> black<00:04:30.410> if

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
save you some work and now black if

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.590 
save you some work and now black if
black<00:04:31.130> wants<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.520> give<00:04:31.700> this<00:04:31.880> background

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
black wants to give this background

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.430 
black wants to give this background
checks<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:34.370> difference<00:04:34.880> is<00:04:35.150> that<00:04:35.390> the<00:04:36.080> bonus

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
checks the difference is that the bonus

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.140 
checks the difference is that the bonus
is<00:04:36.560> then<00:04:36.740> going<00:04:36.920> to<00:04:37.010> five<00:04:37.280> so<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.670> King<00:04:37.910> can

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
is then going to five so the King can

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.190 
is then going to five so the King can
hide<00:04:38.390> in<00:04:38.960> front<00:04:39.290> of<00:04:39.410> someone<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:40.190> see<00:04:40.400> and

hide in front of someone you see and
with<00:04:42.200> we<00:04:42.440> move<00:04:42.710> a<00:04:42.740> little<00:04:43.010> move<00:04:43.310> a<00:04:43.460> few<00:04:43.820> moves

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
with we move a little move a few moves

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.970 
with we move a little move a few moves
further<00:04:44.860> we<00:04:45.860> see<00:04:46.300> that<00:04:47.300> white<00:04:48.970> tries<00:04:49.970> and

white can win by you know building this

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.190 
white can win by you know building this
bridge<00:05:11.710> again<00:05:13.750> because<00:05:14.750> we<00:05:14.870> have<00:05:14.990> the<00:05:15.110> new

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
bridge again because we have the new

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.980 
bridge again because we have the new
center<00:05:15.440> position<00:05:16.360> this<00:05:17.360> is<00:05:17.510> the<00:05:17.570> way<00:05:17.690> to<00:05:17.750> win

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
center position this is the way to win

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.950 
center position this is the way to win
or<00:05:18.590> white<00:05:18.770> and<00:05:19.160> that<00:05:19.910> is<00:05:20.030> why<00:05:20.180> the<00:05:20.240> first<00:05:20.660> move

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
or white and that is why the first move

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:30.280 
or white and that is why the first move
should<00:05:21.880> be<00:05:24.430> route<00:05:25.430> to<00:05:25.730> h6<00:05:28.450> the<00:05:29.450> idea<00:05:29.720> one<00:05:30.140> more

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
should be route to h6 the idea one more

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:36.460 
should be route to h6 the idea one more
time<00:05:30.470> is<00:05:31.310> to<00:05:32.800> force<00:05:34.090> black<00:05:35.090> to<00:05:35.390> movies<00:05:35.660> pawn<00:05:35.900> to

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
a6 because then we can start giving

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.120 
a6 because then we can start giving
these<00:05:40.550> checks<00:05:40.880> and<00:05:41.120> the<00:05:41.840> White<00:05:42.470> King<00:05:42.740> cannot
