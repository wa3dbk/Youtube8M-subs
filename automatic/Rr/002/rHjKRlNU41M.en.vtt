this<00:00:26.609> breakfast<00:00:27.090> set<00:00:28.070> because<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.550> can

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
this breakfast set because you can

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.690

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
think this does not have its name in the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.970 
think this does not have its name in the
box<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.129> there<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.430> no<00:00:39.200> no<00:00:40.200> fear<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.680> like

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
box so there is no no fear of like

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.540 
box so there is no no fear of like
retirement<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.879> think<00:00:42.090> for<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.390> one<00:00:42.600> soon<00:00:43.550> so

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
retirement I think for this one soon so

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.520 
retirement I think for this one soon so
this<00:00:44.700> box<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.120> super<00:00:45.660> heavy<00:00:45.899> used<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.260> start

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
this box is super heavy used to start

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.860 
this box is super heavy used to start
out<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:47.090> tacked<00:00:49.340> whole<00:00:50.340> their<00:00:50.879> coat<00:00:51.149> something

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
out is tacked whole their coat something

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.529 
out is tacked whole their coat something
is<00:00:52.070> had<00:00:53.070> full<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.360> items<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.699> am<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.180> going

is had full of items so I am just going
to<00:00:57.660> start<00:00:57.960> unpacking<00:00:58.859> because<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.820> would<00:01:00.000> be

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
to start unpacking because this would be

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.049 
to start unpacking because this would be
impossible<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.809> try<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.609> with<00:01:02.609> holding<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
impossible to try to do with holding the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.539 
impossible to try to do with holding the
camera<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.080> I'm<00:01:04.290> going<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.470> try<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.890> describe

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
camera so I'm going to try to describe

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.490 
camera so I'm going to try to describe
everything<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.240> show<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.540> everything<00:01:07.049> as

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
everything and show you everything as

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.240 
everything and show you everything as
well<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.299> first<00:01:09.630> thing<00:01:09.960> they<00:01:10.860> have

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
well as I can the first thing they have

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.460 
well as I can the first thing they have
and<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:12.090> only<00:01:12.270> assume<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.960> one<00:01:13.320> is

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and I can only assume that one is

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.219 
and I can only assume that one is
wrapped<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.040> what<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.400> not<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.780> pancakes

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.450 
wrapped and what is not of the pancakes
just<00:01:16.590> because<00:01:16.860> they<00:01:16.979> don't<00:01:17.189> want<00:01:17.340> one

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
just because they don't want one

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.539 
just because they don't want one
scratching<00:01:18.030> up<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> other<00:01:18.619> so<00:01:19.619> there's<00:01:20.310> one
