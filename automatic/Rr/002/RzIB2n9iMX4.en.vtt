00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
be a video tour of my layout which will

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.800 
be a video tour of my layout which will
be<00:00:17.860> different<00:00:18.220> because<00:00:18.369> I<00:00:18.580> usually<00:00:19.060> just<00:00:19.630> show

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
be different because I usually just show

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.859 
be different because I usually just show
you<00:00:19.869> my<00:00:20.110> trains<00:00:20.500> and<00:00:20.860> not<00:00:21.010> the<00:00:21.660> context<00:00:22.660> of

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
you my trains and not the context of

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.370 
you my trains and not the context of
where<00:00:23.349> it<00:00:23.470> is<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:25.000> hopefully<00:00:25.900> you'll<00:00:26.050> enjoy

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
looking at is the actual layout this

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.990 
looking at is the actual layout this
section<00:00:34.930> being<00:00:35.200> the<00:00:35.530> very<00:00:36.130> very<00:00:36.460> first

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000

section being the very very first
original<00:00:37.809> section<00:00:38.140> of<00:00:38.649> my<00:00:39.010> model<00:00:39.490> train<00:00:39.640> hobby

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
original section of my model train hobby

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.900 
original section of my model train hobby
and<00:00:40.440> from<00:00:41.440> there<00:00:41.590> I<00:00:41.620> expanded<00:00:42.310> it<00:00:42.460> out<00:00:42.610> and

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
and from there I expanded it out and

and from there I expanded it out and
I'll<00:00:43.330> talk<00:00:43.540> you<00:00:43.570> through<00:00:43.780> a<00:00:43.990> couple<00:00:44.260> of<00:00:44.500> those

I'll talk you through a couple of those

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.580 
I'll talk you through a couple of those

see<00:00:47.860> that<00:00:48.070> door<00:00:48.460> there<00:00:48.760> that<00:00:49.450> is<00:00:49.660> a<00:00:49.690> garage

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
see that door there that is a garage

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.520 
see that door there that is a garage
door<00:00:50.380> and<00:00:50.620> you're<00:00:51.550> in<00:00:51.640> my<00:00:51.760> garage<00:00:51.970> and<00:00:52.480> this<00:00:53.380> is

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
door and you're in my garage and this is

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.350 
door and you're in my garage and this is
the<00:00:53.710> third<00:00:54.040> stall<00:00:54.340> in<00:00:54.490> a<00:00:54.580> garage<00:00:54.730> in<00:00:54.850> a<00:00:55.180> newer

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
the third stall in a garage in a newer

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.080 
the third stall in a garage in a newer
house<00:00:55.630> and<00:00:56.050> it's<00:00:56.770> walled<00:00:57.070> off<00:00:57.280> to<00:00:57.610> separate<00:00:58.000> it

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
house and it's walled off to separate it

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.910 
house and it's walled off to separate it
from<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.300> cars<00:00:58.570> and<00:00:58.840> all<00:00:58.930> of<00:00:59.079> that<00:00:59.110> so<00:00:59.620> it's<00:00:59.829> a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
from the cars and all of that so it's a

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.710 
from the cars and all of that so it's a
little<00:01:00.130> bit<00:01:00.280> nicer<00:01:00.700> than<00:01:00.730> just<00:01:01.090> having<00:01:01.420> it<00:01:01.510> in

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
little bit nicer than just having it in

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.350 
little bit nicer than just having it in
a<00:01:01.900> in<00:01:02.200> a<00:01:02.290> normal<00:01:02.440> garage<00:01:02.970> I'm<00:01:03.970> going<00:01:04.150> to<00:01:04.210> turn

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
a in a normal garage I'm going to turn

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.940 
a in a normal garage I'm going to turn
around<00:01:04.420> here<00:01:04.839> and<00:01:04.930> give<00:01:05.019> you<00:01:05.110> a<00:01:05.199> view<00:01:05.470> of<00:01:05.530> my

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
around here and give you a view of my

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.310 
around here and give you a view of my
workbench<00:01:06.430> area<00:01:06.880> this<00:01:07.240> is<00:01:07.299> an<00:01:07.600> area<00:01:07.869> I<00:01:07.930> don't

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
workbench area this is an area I don't

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.980 
workbench area this is an area I don't
show<00:01:09.070> up<00:01:09.100> for<00:01:09.579> obvious<00:01:09.939> reasons<00:01:10.329> on<00:01:10.479> my<00:01:10.630> videos

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
show up for obvious reasons on my videos

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.010 
show up for obvious reasons on my videos
and<00:01:11.439> as<00:01:12.310> you<00:01:12.490> can<00:01:12.609> tell<00:01:12.670> it<00:01:13.210> has<00:01:13.240> all<00:01:13.840> the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
and as you can tell it has all the

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.319 
and as you can tell it has all the
various<00:01:14.469> tools<00:01:14.829> and<00:01:15.490> different<00:01:15.670> bits<00:01:16.090> and

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
various tools and different bits and

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.260 
various tools and different bits and
pieces<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.810> things<00:01:17.200> that<00:01:17.640> one<00:01:18.640> ends<00:01:19.179> up

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
pieces of things that one ends up

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.209 
pieces of things that one ends up
accumulating<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.499> somewhat<00:01:20.920> vast

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
accumulating and somewhat vast

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.190 
accumulating and somewhat vast
quantities<00:01:22.179> when<00:01:22.420> you're<00:01:22.569> building<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.990> model

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
quantities when you're building a model

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.169 
quantities when you're building a model
train<00:01:23.530> layout<00:01:23.889> so<00:01:24.189> this<00:01:24.340> is<00:01:24.520> it<00:01:24.700> this<00:01:24.880> is<00:01:24.939> the

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
train layout so this is it this is the

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:27.809 
train layout so this is it this is the
workbench<00:01:25.659> I<00:01:25.869> I<00:01:26.079> built<00:01:26.679> this<00:01:26.799> myself<00:01:27.009> so<00:01:27.579> I<00:01:27.609> can

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819 
workbench I I built this myself so I can

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.330 
workbench I I built this myself so I can
have<00:01:27.969> plenty<00:01:28.240> of<00:01:28.329> room<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:28.749> spread<00:01:28.960> out<00:01:29.049> but<00:01:29.499> it

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
have plenty of room to spread out but it

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.980 
have plenty of room to spread out but it
always<00:01:30.520> seems<00:01:30.819> to<00:01:30.909> get<00:01:31.030> filled<00:01:31.299> with<00:01:31.539> stuff<00:01:31.810> as

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
always seems to get filled with stuff as

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.200 
always seems to get filled with stuff as
you<00:01:32.109> can<00:01:32.229> tell<00:01:32.439> I've<00:01:32.619> got<00:01:32.799> some<00:01:33.369> buildings<00:01:33.850> and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
you can tell I've got some buildings and

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.819 
you can tell I've got some buildings and
just<00:01:34.479> kind<00:01:34.899> of<00:01:34.929> moving<00:01:35.109> them<00:01:35.319> around<00:01:35.469> and

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
just kind of moving them around and

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.469 
just kind of moving them around and
another<00:01:36.100> building<00:01:36.549> project<00:01:37.060> in<00:01:37.209> the<00:01:37.299> works

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
another building project in the works

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.639 
another building project in the works
right<00:01:37.780> now<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:38.319> and<00:01:38.819> over<00:01:39.819> here<00:01:40.149> is<00:01:40.299> a<00:01:40.649> tool

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
right now and and over here is a tool

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.410 
right now and and over here is a tool
chest<00:01:41.979> but<00:01:42.609> in<00:01:42.759> breadth<00:01:42.969> of<00:01:43.090> them<00:01:43.240> putting

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
chest but in breadth of them putting

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.539 
chest but in breadth of them putting
tools<00:01:43.689> in<00:01:43.929> it<00:01:44.079> I'm<00:01:44.740> actually<00:01:44.889> using<00:01:45.189> it<00:01:45.429> to

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
tools in it I'm actually using it to

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.879 
tools in it I'm actually using it to
store<00:01:45.819> my<00:01:46.179> model<00:01:46.780> trains<00:01:47.079> I<00:01:47.350> actually<00:01:47.499> find

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:47.889 
store my model trains I actually find

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:50.309 
store my model trains I actually find
it's<00:01:48.069> a<00:01:48.219> pretty<00:01:49.090> nice<00:01:49.389> place<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:49.929> keep<00:01:50.109> them

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
it's a pretty nice place to keep them

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.230 
it's a pretty nice place to keep them
rather<00:01:50.529> than<00:01:50.770> having<00:01:50.920> them<00:01:51.159> just<00:01:51.310> placed<00:01:51.969> in

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
rather than having them just placed in

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.129 
rather than having them just placed in
random<00:01:52.840> boxes<00:01:53.469> and<00:01:53.649> so<00:01:53.770> forth<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.340> the

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:55.139 
random boxes and so forth and the

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:58.099 
random boxes and so forth and the
smallest<00:01:56.139> shelf<00:01:56.619> is<00:01:56.920> actually<00:01:57.249> great<00:01:57.459> for

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
smallest shelf is actually great for

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:01.440 
smallest shelf is actually great for
rolling<00:01:59.109> stock<00:01:59.380> and<00:01:59.639> wagons<00:02:00.639> and<00:02:00.789> so<00:02:00.939> forth<00:02:01.240> so

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
rolling stock and wagons and so forth so

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.739 
rolling stock and wagons and so forth so
it's<00:02:01.569> really<00:02:01.749> worked<00:02:02.079> out<00:02:02.229> well<00:02:03.389> on<00:02:04.389> the<00:02:04.569> wall

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
it's really worked out well on the wall

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:08.120 
it's really worked out well on the wall
here<00:02:05.020> I've<00:02:05.200> got<00:02:05.380> very<00:02:06.279> temporarily<00:02:06.849> tacked<00:02:07.420> up

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
here I've got very temporarily tacked up

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.010 
here I've got very temporarily tacked up
pieces<00:02:09.130> for<00:02:09.459> scenery<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:10.030> for<00:02:10.450> landscaping

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
pieces for scenery and for landscaping

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.290 
pieces for scenery and for landscaping
and<00:02:11.410> I<00:02:11.590> like<00:02:12.130> to<00:02:12.220> keep<00:02:12.340> them<00:02:12.550> handy<00:02:12.970> while<00:02:13.180> I'm

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
and I like to keep them handy while I'm

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.180 
and I like to keep them handy while I'm
in<00:02:13.450> projects<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.140> can<00:02:14.319> find<00:02:14.620> exactly<00:02:14.980> what<00:02:15.100> I'm

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
in projects I can find exactly what I'm

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.870 
in projects I can find exactly what I'm
looking<00:02:15.250> for

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
looking for

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.900 
looking for
that<00:02:16.750> will<00:02:17.050> come<00:02:17.290> down<00:02:17.320> though<00:02:17.770> once<00:02:18.670> this

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
that will come down though once this

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.220 
that will come down though once this
layout<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.240> all<00:02:19.480> finished<00:02:19.720> and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
layout is all finished and

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.530 
layout is all finished and
ready<00:02:20.379> to<00:02:20.500> roll<00:02:20.680> but<00:02:21.000> finishing<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.180> layout<00:02:22.390> is

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
ready to roll but finishing a layout is

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.240 
ready to roll but finishing a layout is
an<00:02:22.629> interesting<00:02:22.870> idea<00:02:23.170> because<00:02:23.950> as<00:02:24.129> I

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
an interesting idea because as I

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.940 
an interesting idea because as I
mentioned<00:02:24.610> earlier<00:02:25.200> I've<00:02:26.200> been<00:02:26.440> working<00:02:26.830> on

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
mentioned earlier I've been working on

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.710 
mentioned earlier I've been working on
this<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.459> expanding<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.180> for<00:02:28.330> about<00:02:28.450> three

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
this and expanding it for about three

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.869 
this and expanding it for about three
years<00:02:28.750> now<00:02:29.019> and<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.830> just<00:02:29.980> started<00:02:30.519> with<00:02:30.549> this

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
years now and it just started with this

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.210 
years now and it just started with this
and<00:02:31.299> this<00:02:31.510> this<00:02:31.900> little<00:02:32.170> section<00:02:32.709> here<00:02:32.739> which

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
and this this little section here which

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.720 
and this this little section here which
is<00:02:33.400> actually<00:02:33.549> a<00:02:34.440> hollow<00:02:35.440> core<00:02:35.799> door<00:02:35.860> fairly

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
is actually a hollow core door fairly

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.500 
is actually a hollow core door fairly
typical<00:02:38.250> way<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.310> start<00:02:39.700> off<00:02:39.879> with<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.180> layout

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
typical way to start off with a layout

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.729 
typical way to start off with a layout
and<00:02:40.959> it<00:02:41.920> worked<00:02:42.190> really<00:02:42.430> well<00:02:42.580> but<00:02:43.209> I<00:02:43.739> decided

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
and it worked really well but I decided

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.860 
and it worked really well but I decided
to<00:02:44.980> expand<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.549> and<00:02:45.640> this<00:02:46.420> is<00:02:46.569> what<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.750> would

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
to expand it and this is what I would

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.319 
to expand it and this is what I would
call<00:02:47.049> version<00:02:47.530> 1<00:02:47.739> version<00:02:47.980> 2<00:02:48.489> started<00:02:49.120> right

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
call version 1 version 2 started right

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.770 
call version 1 version 2 started right
here<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:50.709> can<00:02:50.860> almost<00:02:50.980> tell<00:02:51.790> there's<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.239> line

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
here you can almost tell there's a line

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.680 
here you can almost tell there's a line
of<00:02:52.930> division<00:02:53.200> there<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.970> ended<00:02:55.569> up

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
of division there and that ended up

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.080 
of division there and that ended up
being<00:02:55.930> this<00:02:56.230> longer<00:02:56.530> yard<00:02:56.980> in<00:02:57.340> this<00:02:57.459> loop<00:02:57.790> with

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
being this longer yard in this loop with

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.349 
being this longer yard in this loop with
the<00:02:58.269> mill<00:02:58.829> and<00:02:59.829> then<00:03:00.069> ultimately<00:03:00.250> with<00:03:00.879> what<00:03:01.329> I

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
the mill and then ultimately with what I

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.630 
the mill and then ultimately with what I
call<00:03:01.569> version<00:03:01.959> 3<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.470> viaduct<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.549> was

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
call version 3 the viaduct and it was

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.150 
call version 3 the viaduct and it was
really<00:03:03.879> just<00:03:04.030> two<00:03:04.599> hollow-core<00:03:05.410> doors<00:03:05.440> laid

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
really just two hollow-core doors laid

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
really just two hollow-core doors laid
end<00:03:06.489> on<00:03:07.390> end<00:03:07.629> next<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:08.019> each<00:03:08.170> other<00:03:09.000> which<00:03:10.000> was

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
end on end next to each other which was

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.020 
end on end next to each other which was
essentially<00:03:10.660> my<00:03:10.840> layout<00:03:11.290> up<00:03:12.129> until<00:03:12.609> last<00:03:12.819> year

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
essentially my layout up until last year

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.680 
essentially my layout up until last year
when<00:03:13.480> I<00:03:14.019> decided<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.940> extend<00:03:15.940> it<00:03:16.239> a<00:03:16.299> little<00:03:16.480> bit

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
when I decided to extend it a little bit

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.210 
when I decided to extend it a little bit
more<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.049> give<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.230> little<00:03:17.379> bit<00:03:17.500> more<00:03:17.590> variety

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
more and give a little bit more variety

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.470 
more and give a little bit more variety
to<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.459> layout<00:03:18.760> give<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.209> little<00:03:19.299> bit<00:03:19.420> more

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
to the layout give a little bit more

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.680 
to the layout give a little bit more
storage<00:03:20.410> space<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:21.040> four<00:03:21.280> trains<00:03:21.579> with<00:03:22.480> what<00:03:22.660> I

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
storage space to four trains with what I

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.839 
storage space to four trains with what I
call<00:03:22.930> version<00:03:23.349> four<00:03:23.650> which<00:03:23.920> starts<00:03:24.310> here<00:03:24.400> and

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
call version four which starts here and

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.849 
call version four which starts here and
has<00:03:25.030> these<00:03:25.239> tracks<00:03:25.569> branching<00:03:26.139> off<00:03:26.290> going

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
has these tracks branching off going

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.980 
has these tracks branching off going
over<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.160> this<00:03:27.280> section

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.340 

and<00:03:31.670> what<00:03:32.670> will<00:03:32.850> ultimately<00:03:32.970> be<00:03:33.540> more<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:34.200> a

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
and what will ultimately be more of a

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.900 
and what will ultimately be more of a
more<00:03:34.740> urban<00:03:34.920> environment<00:03:36.320> it<00:03:37.320> is<00:03:37.380> all<00:03:37.910> wired

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
more urban environment it is all wired

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.360 
more urban environment it is all wired
on<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.150> separate<00:03:39.600> circuit<00:03:39.830> so<00:03:40.830> when<00:03:41.040> I'm<00:03:41.160> ready

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
on a separate circuit so when I'm ready

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.700 
on a separate circuit so when I'm ready
to<00:03:41.550> turn<00:03:41.730> on<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.540> trains<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.020> run<00:03:43.170> trains<00:03:43.530> I

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
to turn on the trains and run trains I

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.590 
to turn on the trains and run trains I
just<00:03:43.890> come<00:03:44.010> over<00:03:44.100> here<00:03:44.960> flip<00:03:45.960> the<00:03:46.110> switch<00:03:46.380> and

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
just come over here flip the switch and

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.060 
just come over here flip the switch and
power<00:03:48.600> goes<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:48.960> the<00:03:49.140> layout<00:03:49.470> really

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
power goes to the layout really

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.330 
power goes to the layout really
fantastic<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:51.480> makes<00:03:51.660> it<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:51.930> much<00:03:51.990> easier<00:03:52.340> to

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
fantastic it makes it so much easier to

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.940 
fantastic it makes it so much easier to
have<00:03:53.490> it<00:03:53.610> all<00:03:53.670> set<00:03:53.880> up<00:03:53.910> like<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.890> so<00:03:55.890> as

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
have it all set up like that and so as

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.040 
have it all set up like that and so as
you<00:03:56.100> can<00:03:56.160> see<00:03:56.340> there's<00:03:56.520> now<00:03:56.670> lights<00:03:57.570> on<00:03:57.780> in<00:03:57.960> the

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
you can see there's now lights on in the

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.300 
you can see there's now lights on in the
city<00:03:58.730> track<00:03:59.730> lights<00:04:00.030> on<00:04:00.710> control<00:04:01.710> panels<00:04:02.100> lit

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
city track lights on control panels lit

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.330 
city track lights on control panels lit
up<00:04:02.490> I<00:04:02.780> got<00:04:03.780> blue<00:04:03.990> indicators<00:04:04.590> on<00:04:04.740> my<00:04:04.860> circuits

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
up I got blue indicators on my circuits

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.820 
up I got blue indicators on my circuits
which<00:04:05.490> means<00:04:05.760> no<00:04:06.060> shorts<00:04:06.540> so<00:04:07.350> we're<00:04:07.560> ready<00:04:07.740> to

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
which means no shorts so we're ready to

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.160 
which means no shorts so we're ready to
run<00:04:08.130> trains<00:04:08.550> and<00:04:08.940> when<00:04:09.300> I<00:04:09.360> want<00:04:09.600> to<00:04:09.660> run<00:04:09.810> trains

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
run trains and when I want to run trains

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.710 
run trains and when I want to run trains
I'm<00:04:11.070> using<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:12.600> Roco<00:04:13.260> multi<00:04:14.100> mouse<00:04:14.310> system<00:04:14.880> as

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
I'm using the Roco multi mouse system as

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.650 
I'm using the Roco multi mouse system as
it<00:04:16.050> it's<00:04:16.290> wireless<00:04:17.239> although<00:04:18.239> I<00:04:18.270> do<00:04:18.390> have<00:04:18.630> a

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
it it's wireless although I do have a

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.990 
it it's wireless although I do have a
wireless<00:04:19.290> version<00:04:19.620> or<00:04:20.040> a<00:04:20.070> wired<00:04:20.550> version<00:04:20.940> I

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
wireless version or a wired version I

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.260 
wireless version or a wired version I
use<00:04:21.239> which<00:04:21.420> is<00:04:21.540> sitting<00:04:21.870> right<00:04:22.020> over<00:04:22.050> there

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
use which is sitting right over there

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.730 
use which is sitting right over there
it's<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.390> really<00:04:24.630> nice<00:04:24.750> system<00:04:25.170> so<00:04:25.380> I'll<00:04:25.470> just

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
it's a really nice system so I'll just

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.490 
it's a really nice system so I'll just
turn<00:04:25.890> it<00:04:26.040> on<00:04:26.750> it'll<00:04:27.750> do<00:04:27.930> a<00:04:27.960> little<00:04:28.170> bit<00:04:28.320> of<00:04:28.410> a

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
turn it on it'll do a little bit of a

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.400 
turn it on it'll do a little bit of a
startup<00:04:29.220> mode<00:04:29.460> here<00:04:30.080> hopefully<00:04:31.080> that's<00:04:31.260> in

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
startup mode here hopefully that's in

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.160 
startup mode here hopefully that's in
focus<00:04:31.650> somewhat<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:33.510> tells<00:04:33.750> me<00:04:33.930> right<00:04:33.960> now

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
focus somewhat and it tells me right now

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.920 
focus somewhat and it tells me right now
that<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.860> current<00:04:35.430> locomotive<00:04:36.390> selected<00:04:36.780> is

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
that the current locomotive selected is

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.340 
that the current locomotive selected is
the<00:04:37.110> CC<00:04:37.640> 72,000<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:39.810> can<00:04:39.990> go<00:04:40.140> ahead<00:04:40.200> and

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
the CC 72,000 and I can go ahead and

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.520 
the CC 72,000 and I can go ahead and
give<00:04:40.440> that<00:04:40.470> a<00:04:40.620> little<00:04:40.860> power<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:42.690> will<00:04:42.840> cure

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
give that a little power and will cure

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.780 
give that a little power and will cure
it<00:04:43.650> over<00:04:43.860> there<00:04:44.010> in<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.160> distance<00:04:44.460> I<00:04:44.640> think

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
it over there in the distance I think

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.930 
it over there in the distance I think
it's<00:04:44.880> over<00:04:45.090> at<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.500> station<00:04:46.500> yes<00:04:47.370> there<00:04:47.730> it<00:04:47.820> is

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
it's over at the station yes there it is

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.330 
it's over at the station yes there it is
it's<00:04:48.390> going<00:04:48.540> backwards<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:49.230> it<00:04:50.040> doesn't<00:04:50.250> have

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
it's going backwards and it doesn't have

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.420 
it's going backwards and it doesn't have
its<00:04:50.430> lights<00:04:50.610> on<00:04:50.880> so<00:04:50.910> I'll<00:04:51.210> just<00:04:51.420> stop<00:04:51.660> that<00:04:51.930> by

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
its lights on so I'll just stop that by

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.550 
its lights on so I'll just stop that by
hitting<00:04:53.430> that<00:04:53.550> pushing<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:54.660> light<00:04:55.200> button

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
hitting that pushing the light button

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.660 
hitting that pushing the light button
and<00:04:55.710> bringing<00:04:56.550> it<00:04:56.640> forward<00:04:57.410> and<00:04:58.550> there<00:04:59.550> are

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
and bringing it forward and there are

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:08.379 
and bringing it forward and there are
thumbs

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.360 

all<00:05:09.020> right<00:05:09.289> so<00:05:09.620> I<00:05:09.650> want<00:05:09.949> to<00:05:09.979> switch<00:05:10.099> to<00:05:10.340> another

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
all right so I want to switch to another

train I have the BLS class for 20 and

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.300 
train I have the BLS class for 20 and
switch<00:05:16.039> locomotives<00:05:16.759> I<00:05:17.259> will<00:05:18.259> click<00:05:19.099> down

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
switch locomotives I will click down

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.850 
switch locomotives I will click down
here<00:05:19.340> in<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:19.759> directory<00:05:20.300> till<00:05:21.169> I<00:05:21.229> get<00:05:21.289> the<00:05:21.500> BLS

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
here in the directory till I get the BLS

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.830 
here in the directory till I get the BLS
for<00:05:21.889> 20<00:05:22.550> and<00:05:23.949> regoing<00:05:24.949> I<00:05:25.039> just<00:05:25.189> passed<00:05:25.400> it<00:05:25.840> turn

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
for 20 and regoing I just passed it turn

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.240

the<00:05:26.960> lights<00:05:27.169> on<00:05:27.400> and<00:05:28.840> give<00:05:29.840> it<00:05:29.870> some<00:05:30.080> gas<00:05:30.289> here

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
the lights on and give it some gas here

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.200 
the lights on and give it some gas here
we<00:05:31.400> go<00:05:31.490> okay

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
we go okay

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.909 
we go okay
give<00:05:32.599> it<00:05:32.689> some<00:05:32.780> electricity<00:05:33.229> as<00:05:33.590> we<00:05:33.740> would

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
give it some electricity as we would

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.390 
give it some electricity as we would
more<00:05:34.479> prototypically<00:05:35.479> and<00:05:35.949> even<00:05:36.949> in<00:05:37.039> a<00:05:37.129> model

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
more prototypically and even in a model

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.070 
more prototypically and even in a model
sense<00:05:37.610> a<00:05:37.819> correct<00:05:38.090> one<00:05:38.240> correctly<00:05:38.599> so<00:05:38.960> there

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
sense a correct one correctly so there

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.140 
sense a correct one correctly so there
we<00:05:39.199> are<00:05:39.229> so<00:05:40.039> this<00:05:40.099> is<00:05:40.219> the<00:05:40.310> multi<00:05:40.550> mouse<00:05:40.759> it's

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
we are so this is the multi mouse it's

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.600 
we are so this is the multi mouse it's
fantastic<00:05:41.960> because<00:05:42.229> I<00:05:42.379> can<00:05:42.529> hold<00:05:43.159> it<00:05:43.370> in<00:05:43.460> one

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
fantastic because I can hold it in one

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.909 
fantastic because I can hold it in one
hand<00:05:43.669> it's<00:05:44.210> really<00:05:44.779> designed<00:05:45.169> well<00:05:45.650> for

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
hand it's really designed well for

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.950 
hand it's really designed well for
one-hand<00:05:46.340> operation<00:05:46.490> and<00:05:47.210> I<00:05:47.300> really<00:05:47.779> like

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
one-hand operation and I really like

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.969 
one-hand operation and I really like
that<00:05:47.990> feature<00:05:48.319> so<00:05:48.680> I'm<00:05:48.740> obviously

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
that feature so I'm obviously

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:50.709 
that feature so I'm obviously
videotaping<00:05:49.849> with<00:05:50.060> one<00:05:50.240> hand<00:05:50.509> and

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:50.719 
videotaping with one hand and

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:53.140 
videotaping with one hand and
controlling<00:05:51.560> trains<00:05:51.830> with<00:05:52.009> the<00:05:52.159> other<00:05:52.310> but

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
controlling trains with the other but

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.550 
controlling trains with the other but
what<00:05:53.330> I<00:05:53.360> can<00:05:53.569> do<00:05:53.719> and<00:05:53.900> we'll<00:05:54.020> just<00:05:54.169> follow<00:05:54.409> the

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
what I can do and we'll just follow the

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.339 
what I can do and we'll just follow the
420<00:05:55.159> around<00:05:55.430> the<00:05:55.520> layout<00:05:56.050> it's<00:05:57.050> going<00:05:57.169> to<00:05:57.229> go

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:57.349 
420 around the layout it's going to go

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:01.089 
420 around the layout it's going to go
through<00:05:57.560> this<00:05:57.680> cut<00:05:58.029> which<00:05:59.029> was<00:05:59.270> a<00:05:59.860> this<00:06:00.860> cut

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099 
through this cut which was a this cut

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:03.700 
through this cut which was a this cut
was<00:06:01.310> an<00:06:01.430> interesting<00:06:02.289> add-on<00:06:03.289> it<00:06:03.469> wasn't

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
was an interesting add-on it wasn't

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.800 
was an interesting add-on it wasn't
originally<00:06:04.189> part<00:06:04.550> of<00:06:04.699> my<00:06:04.789> layout<00:06:05.150> plan<00:06:05.509> but

edge<00:06:11.750> of<00:06:11.960> the<00:06:12.080> layout<00:06:12.289> you<00:06:12.710> can<00:06:12.860> tell<00:06:13.099> there's

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
edge of the layout you can tell there's

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.610 
edge of the layout you can tell there's
maybe<00:06:13.639> half<00:06:14.210> an<00:06:14.389> inch<00:06:14.539> there<00:06:14.779> before<00:06:15.289> you<00:06:15.440> had

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
maybe half an inch there before you had

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.040 
maybe half an inch there before you had
a<00:06:15.650> drop<00:06:15.979> to<00:06:16.190> the<00:06:16.279> floor<00:06:16.430> and<00:06:16.610> that<00:06:17.599> was<00:06:17.779> just<00:06:17.990> a

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
a drop to the floor and that was just a

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.689 
a drop to the floor and that was just a
little<00:06:18.199> bit<00:06:18.409> too<00:06:18.529> nerve-racking<00:06:19.190> for<00:06:19.219> me<00:06:19.490> so<00:06:19.669> I

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:19.699 
little bit too nerve-racking for me so I

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.430 
little bit too nerve-racking for me so I
extended<00:06:20.330> on<00:06:20.479> to<00:06:20.719> the<00:06:20.839> original<00:06:21.259> whole

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
extended on to the original whole

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.829 
extended on to the original whole
corridor<00:06:21.889> this<00:06:22.250> section<00:06:22.729> here<00:06:23.060> and<00:06:23.240> then

00:06:23.829 --> 00:06:23.839 
corridor this section here and then

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:25.990 
corridor this section here and then
obviously<00:06:24.469> added<00:06:24.770> in<00:06:24.860> these<00:06:24.979> skyscrapers<00:06:25.759> is

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
obviously added in these skyscrapers is

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.260 
obviously added in these skyscrapers is
a<00:06:26.029> little<00:06:26.300> bit<00:06:26.449> of<00:06:26.569> almost<00:06:27.500> a<00:06:27.650> scenic<00:06:27.979> backdrop

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
a little bit of almost a scenic backdrop

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.290 
a little bit of almost a scenic backdrop
and<00:06:29.270> now<00:06:29.479> I<00:06:29.509> have<00:06:29.779> security<00:06:30.560> and<00:06:30.800> safety<00:06:31.300> with

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
and now I have security and safety with

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.249 
and now I have security and safety with
the<00:06:32.449> layout<00:06:33.370> and<00:06:34.370> we'll<00:06:34.969> call<00:06:35.150> the<00:06:35.300> BLS<00:06:35.629> 440

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:36.259 
the layout and we'll call the BLS 440

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:38.439 
the layout and we'll call the BLS 440
it's<00:06:36.919> on<00:06:37.129> the<00:06:37.279> lower<00:06:37.580> track<00:06:37.969> it's<00:06:38.210> going<00:06:38.330> to<00:06:38.389> go

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:38.449 
it's on the lower track it's going to go

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:39.790 
it's on the lower track it's going to go
into<00:06:38.629> a<00:06:38.659> tunnel<00:06:38.960> there<00:06:39.199> and<00:06:39.439> go<00:06:39.529> underneath

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
into a tunnel there and go underneath

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.550 
into a tunnel there and go underneath
this<00:06:40.069> section<00:06:40.750> this<00:06:41.750> section<00:06:41.810> is<00:06:42.229> actually<00:06:42.529> a

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
this section this section is actually a

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.379 
this section this section is actually a
lift<00:06:42.830> out<00:06:42.979> section<00:06:44.199> there's<00:06:45.199> the<00:06:45.409> BLS<00:06:45.710> 420<00:06:46.389> so

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:47.389 
lift out section there's the BLS 420 so

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:48.490 
lift out section there's the BLS 420 so
I<00:06:47.449> can<00:06:47.539> get<00:06:47.629> in<00:06:47.719> there<00:06:47.839> and<00:06:47.930> clean<00:06:48.080> the<00:06:48.199> tracks

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
I can get in there and clean the tracks

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.420 
I can get in there and clean the tracks
it's<00:06:49.039> a<00:06:49.310> piece<00:06:49.699> of<00:06:49.779> Sentra<00:06:50.779> and<00:06:51.020> I<00:06:51.860> have<00:06:52.250> some
