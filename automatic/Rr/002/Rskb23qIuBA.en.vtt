00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello the summer of last year my brother 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.150
 and I discovered a blogger who does 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.519
 call bollycao what good is the girl 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.380
 quite funny and the truth that thinking 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.170
 in it I said then hey it would not be bad 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.120
 try to make a dump and of course 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.600
 I was not aware of the fred now that I 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.670
 I was getting 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.670
 we will start making a pre-ferment 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.340
 with 100 grams of flour 5 grams of 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.080
 baker's yeast powder that 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.110
 mix well with the flour and 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.239
 We also add 100 grams of milk 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.010
 we will mix well and let it rest 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.010
 a night covered with transparent film 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.290
 do not 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:50.840
 the next day to the mix we will add 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.840
 400 grams of flour 300 grams of milk 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.700
 150 grams of sugar and a teaspoon 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.550
 of salt 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.500
 and now is when the nightmare begins 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.610
 when I started to mix everything you will see 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.379
 that this is excessively liquid 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.110
 and once you have it more or less 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.000
 mixed in the bowl it's time to take it out 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.710
 all of the bowl trying to rush it to 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.700
 maximum and start kneading on the table 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.700
 i 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.319
 as you can see in the video this is 

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:23.729
 practically a porridge and also he 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.219
 how you love is it seems that you are not 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.229
 doing nothing but yes that is doing 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:31.049
 kneading base with the technique that we have 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.600
 seen in other videos upload it spin 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.969
 90 degrees and then fold the envelope 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.280
 himself good little by little he's catching 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.490
 way and as you can see after the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.750
 pause because this already has another color 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.729
 It has another color but based on time and 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.270
 time think I was kneading 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.709
 practically two hours that yes they are 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.170
 two hours with some interruptions 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:54.289
 you are kneading five minutes 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.700
 stand for five minutes and then give it back 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.469
 and when the mass appeared to be 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.690
 dominated then is when we add 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.790
 about 100 grams of butter 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.500
 Butter should be a good time 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.600
 before out of the fridge so that it 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.390
 integrate more easily and now play 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.730
 then integrate it well mix it inside and 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.020
 Re-kneading 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.550
 and that's when the 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.920
 nightmare because this is again 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.100
 practically intractable but the same to 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.230
 time base of being a while kneading 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.330
 leave 5 minutes of rest to go back to 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.200
 knead comes a moment that is more or 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.200
 less manageable 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.260
 what comes here well you can count on 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.880
 helping someone else to give you 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.650
 conversation so that you change the 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.870
 TV channels because with your hands 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.760
 As you carry them, you will tell me or 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.410
 just to help you too and 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.180
 well already if you have a thermomix for 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.960
 have it there is kneaded and do not worry 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.960
 Well, I do not even tell you 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.230
 and when it is more or less manageable it 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.790
 it is a ball with it and you keep it 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.390
 in a bowl covered with transparent film 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.829
 about four or five hours after 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.450
 about four or five hours you can see 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.849
 how it has gone up 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.379
 by the way to clean hands a 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.879
 trick is thrown a little bit of 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.590
 flour above you behave well 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.599
 then that flour what will do is that 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.940
 the dough returns to be much thicker 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.820
 and it will be much easier to clean them 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.220
 well the most now we give it there a half 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.200
 a matter of a minute something like that 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.780
 and we will start to give shape to 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.170
 our bollicaos we will cut a piece 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.170
 of dough 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:41.720
 We flour a little worktable 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.720
 lengthen the dough a little 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.000
 and 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.910
 and on top we put the good squares of 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.430
 chocolate you can use chocolate 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.770
 white or dark chocolate or some other 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.510
 things for example I used a cream 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.510
 I've frozen in a bucket 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.980
 You can also mix and in one 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.170
 bun put several things later with the 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.750
 dough we wrap the pieces of chocolate 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.920
 and you look to roll it up a bit so that 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.920
 everything is very compact 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.320
 and this with patience so you go 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.030
 repeating until finishing the dough with 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.859
 the amounts that I have given you there 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.820
 approximately to do about 8 way and 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.100
 kaos 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.860
 for everyone to the oven tray in the 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.580
 we will have the oven at 220 degrees about 12 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.620
 minutes 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.419
 it's worth spending all this time 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.860
 to make them man I think so 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.419
 because it is always interesting to learn 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.249
 something new and the truth that they were very 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.049
 rich 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:42.699
 but come on, it's not like doing it 

00:04:41.049 --> 00:04:44.499
 every weekend because apart from 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.750
 work that they have at the level of calories 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:50.150
 you can imagine the bomb that is 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.200
 I hope you liked the recipe and 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.640
 if you liked 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.520
 you can cheer up and share it with 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.410
 our friends on facebook on twitter or 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.770
 subscribe to our channel to be 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.040
