00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.319
 It is not 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.770

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.740
 OK OK 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.350
 a partner in charge of life has 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.610
 that has shown 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.610
 mother of another 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.400

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.790

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.659
 porrÃ³n 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.690
 that kills me is doing me the 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.220
 asshole recharged for that is worth the 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.550
 weapon that I carry is like a shotgun or 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.819
 be that it only works closely and the 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.299
 first time they kill me now I say 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.889
 I'm a hate 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:25.180
 I'm busted too, what does it look like? 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:28.409
 result of 661 I think that also 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.409
 we are all together 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.920
 we are breaking up partners yes yes but 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.410
 also the fine Filipinos 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.099
 this is very little and although it seems that 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.099
 It looks a lot like 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.090
 Wait, I'm going to relive this payment 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.720
 OK 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.150
 let's go then 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.710

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.819
 go beating state I do not know where it is 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.390
 going to the center 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.390
 OK 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.560
 really shoveling but I have not seen so much 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.370
 revive 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.620
 and since a stupid man left the 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.269
 paw print 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.269
 what is that to that I do not get 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.840
 and a shotgun god had been 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:32.550
 where are they playing the video 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.550

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.630
 sorry and that we have never given ourselves over 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.040
 it seems to me it has already happened to lose more 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.450
 time is worth vale 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:48.680

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.759

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:07.630
