00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
plus a few extra inches I always start

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.660 
plus a few extra inches I always start
out<00:00:39.660> by<00:00:39.899> stretching<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> elastic<00:00:40.710> because<00:00:41.340> I

out by stretching the elastic because I

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.490 
out by stretching the elastic because I
found<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.120> tying<00:00:42.450> bracelets<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.110> too<00:00:43.350> much

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
found that tying bracelets with too much

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.410 
found that tying bracelets with too much
tension<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:44.309> cause<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.820> snap<00:00:45.090> pretty

I'm going to show you how to tie a
surgeon's<00:01:06.119> knot<00:01:06.540> which<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.990> more<00:01:07.229> secure<00:01:07.650> than

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
surgeon's knot which is more secure than

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.620 
surgeon's knot which is more secure than
a<00:01:07.890> double<00:01:08.189> knot<00:01:08.369> I'm<00:01:08.850> demonstrating<00:01:09.150> with

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
a double knot I'm demonstrating with

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.480 
a double knot I'm demonstrating with
cord<00:01:09.930> first<00:01:10.200> because<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> clear<00:01:10.920> elastic<00:01:11.340> is

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
cord first because the clear elastic is

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.880 
cord first because the clear elastic is
a<00:01:11.520> little<00:01:11.909> harder<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.409> cross<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.619> left

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
a little harder to see cross the left

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.249 
a little harder to see cross the left
cord<00:01:14.280> over<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.820> right<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.360> then<00:01:15.960> wrap<00:01:16.229> it

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
cord over the right and then wrap it

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.850 
cord over the right and then wrap it
around<00:01:16.470> twice<00:01:17.810> tighten<00:01:18.810> until<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.470> beads<00:01:19.680> on

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
around twice tighten until the beads on

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.649 
around twice tighten until the beads on
the<00:01:19.950> bracelet<00:01:20.340> come<00:01:20.549> together<00:01:20.729> as<00:01:21.060> close<00:01:21.420> as

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
the bracelet come together as close as

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.600 
the bracelet come together as close as
possible<00:01:21.830> you'll<00:01:22.830> want<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> beads<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.520> be

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
possible you'll want the beads to be

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.749 
possible you'll want the beads to be
touching<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.030> knot<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.390> either<00:01:24.540> side<00:01:25.759> now

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
touching the knot on either side now

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.670 
touching the knot on either side now
take<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.240> new<00:01:27.390> right<00:01:27.659> cord<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.259> cross<00:01:28.530> it

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
take the new right cord and cross it

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.649 
take the new right cord and cross it
over<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> left<00:01:29.040> cord<00:01:29.579> then<00:01:30.210> bring<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.600> around

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
over the left cord then bring it around

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.649 
over the left cord then bring it around
and<00:01:31.229> through<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.009> loop<00:01:32.189> now<00:01:32.970> tighten<00:01:33.360> as<00:01:33.479> much

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
and through the loop now tighten as much

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.870 
and through the loop now tighten as much
as<00:01:33.810> possible<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.470> trim<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.250> excess<00:01:35.610> and

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
as possible so trim the excess and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.940 
as possible so trim the excess and
that's<00:01:36.150> all<00:01:36.329> there<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.810> it

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.200 

let's<00:01:40.950> see<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.220> again<00:01:41.250> with<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.759> actual

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210

just painting some polish on the knot
and<00:02:21.270> then<00:02:21.840> I'll<00:02:22.050> trim<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.500> rest<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
and then I'll trim the rest of the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.860 
and then I'll trim the rest of the
excess<00:02:23.250> cord<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:24.060> knot<00:02:24.209> is<00:02:24.240> barely

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
excess cord so that the knot is barely

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.900 
excess cord so that the knot is barely
visible<00:02:25.310> normally<00:02:26.310> I'd<00:02:26.430> hide<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.790> knot

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
visible normally I'd hide the knot

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.150 
visible normally I'd hide the knot
inside<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.420> one<00:02:27.570> of<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.780> beads<00:02:27.989> but<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.920> holes

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
inside of one of the beads but the holes

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.710 
inside of one of the beads but the holes
in<00:02:29.340> these<00:02:29.459> beads<00:02:29.730> aren't<00:02:29.970> large<00:02:30.209> enough<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.480> do

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
in these beads aren't large enough to do

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.590 
in these beads aren't large enough to do
that<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.730> that's<00:02:32.730> all<00:02:32.880> there<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.420> I

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
that and that's all there is to it I

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.690 
that and that's all there is to it I
