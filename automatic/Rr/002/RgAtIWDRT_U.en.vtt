00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
I quite like to learn why some reading

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.280 
I quite like to learn why some reading
so<00:02:42.670> for<00:02:42.970> me<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.210> was<00:02:43.270> fine<00:02:43.510> if<00:02:43.930> that's

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
so for me it was fine if that's

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.990 
so for me it was fine if that's
off-putting<00:02:44.470> for<00:02:44.740> other<00:02:45.250> people<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.700> sort<00:02:45.820> be

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
off-putting for other people to sort be

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.340 
off-putting for other people to sort be
taken<00:02:46.300> away<00:02:46.390> from<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.690> story<00:02:46.930> for<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.200> while

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
taken away from the story for a while

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.200 
taken away from the story for a while
then<00:02:47.620> maybe<00:02:48.340> that'll<00:02:48.550> be<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.730> bit<00:02:48.850> annoying<00:02:49.030> but

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
then maybe that'll be a bit annoying but

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.000 
then maybe that'll be a bit annoying but
it<00:02:49.420> doesn't<00:02:49.780> happen<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.530> continuously

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
it doesn't happen and I continuously
