00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:24.079
 This video show easy-to-follow techniques to diagnose 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.860
 appropriately the fault an ignition system of iese 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.040
 fox without much distribution 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.430
 for our project we will use meet cube 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.880
 sevin pava 2000 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.640
 with a 3-point engine 4 liters 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.640
 and about 130 thousand mileage tickets 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.740
 the complaint that is pistone or 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.740
 underway 30 acceleration titles 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.260
 we begin the diagnosis 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.510
 a scanner 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.590
 and observing how many times it fails 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.260
 we see that cylinder number 2 piston a couple of times 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.680
 unfortunately 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.690
 It's not always so easy 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.770
 when the scanner shows no faults in case you do not have one available 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.780
 here we show a way the terror 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.040
 to find 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.260
 although cylinder lacks spark 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.300
 usi is a specific problem before the commission 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.970
 with strict time-tested lamp on txistorra line every 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.290
 one of the incentive cables 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.800
 turn on the engine 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.910
 ideal if the lamp emits a flash continued 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.610
 if it is not continuous as it would be fifth you have just found at least 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.170
 one of the cylinders 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.520
 who are trusting 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.700
 Each coil of iese lights two cylinders 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.080
 with an electrical link 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.650
 see our video 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.980
 of her is about our counteroffensive 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.900
 available at the post buenos aires 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.000
 poyo tuba 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 for detailed information on this function 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.710
 to determine which are the two cylinders that lit by each ear 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.429
 this first will need the order of meaning of the vote 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.419
 available on our website saez 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.519
 divide the sense order two halves 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.689
 and move the second half below the first expo 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:31.959
 that means 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.960
 that the 105 and 2 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.960
 are lit by the same or life and so on 

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:42.019
 the specifications of its pressure for the cables resignation 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.519
 it's not more than econsult thousand and ate sporting 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.329
 the resistance which places in the secondary wiring of this move 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.639
 is to get the old ones 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.069
 in this circuit 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.159
 we have a cable of approximately 3 100 long 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:00.819
 with one more than 24 thousand buses 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.889
 another cable of approximately one foot 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.559
 with one more than 8 thousand buses 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:08.919
 and the secondary cable of the sheep 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.739
 with less than 11 thousand bulbs 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.510
 when we add all the link reading 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.510
 should not exceed 43 thousand Bosnians 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:25.769
 to replace it you took 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.930
 Insert a terminal of the union meter into the spark plug terminal of the 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.110
 cylinder number 2 and the other in number 5 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.309
 Our culture 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:45.569
 71 thousand Bosnians 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.599
 which is far above the maximum allowed for this in 43 thousand gazette 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:54.870
 now it's worth disarming it 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.339
 and examine the components 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:02.049
 you will see that there is corrosion in the terminals of the cables and in the towers 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.329
 of the coil 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.619
 this vehicle 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:09.869
 Messi definitely quote changes of ignition cables and the apothecary 

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:15.769
 when an internal one is learning at all the ignition cluster or he 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:16.809
 says m 

00:04:16.809 --> 00:04:19.669
 could be the cause of the problem 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.199
 The ies xcm test on the vehicle can be done with a current tester 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.330
 like this 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.310
 I removed the bobbins and with this one of the tips of the troubadour of the stream 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.039
 to one of the terminals 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.689
 males of rice 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:37.099
 that connect with sheep 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:38.210
 after 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.360
 I played with the current tester 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.630
 autoterminal 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.630
 and start the engine 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:46.789
 the light the tester 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.999
 they should study like this 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:52.909
 when he says welfare is lighting bass right 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.770
 repeat this test all connections will see ovine 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.990
 on the ice a fault 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.970
 It can also be caused 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.990
 for a compression fuel problem 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.259
 that will not be seen with the current tester 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.450
 This is a way to individually short circuit 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.770
 cylinders no diesel system 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.789
 to determine which of them is failing you will need a hose 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:20.860
 suction 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.339
 impregnated with carbon that is not plastic 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:26.240
 lateral cutters 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.449
 and a troubadour of current 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.039
 they considered that suction was about one inch 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:34.169
 and a half 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.089
 one for each bovine tower 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:39.089
 and accurate pieces about the shape of a minute 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.300
 and inside the cable terminals 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.749
 ground courtesy the current tester with the engine block 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:48.789
 and turn on the moscoso 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.400
 with the engine at minimum 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.060
 I touched with the tip of the current tester each piece of the hose 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.930
 suction 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.409
 shorting the emission of that center 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.330
 the button must fail noticeably 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.569
 yes it will not fail 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.620
 This is a cylinder with a lack 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.370
 a common cause so that it does not start because there is no spark in 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.169
 this type of systems 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.210
 it's a faulty sensor 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.599
 of dream possession 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:19.220
 This sensor generate alternating voltage or these specifications for this sensor 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:22.219
 are available there were no exams 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:29.099
 to prove it a fish with suspicion of smn 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:37.219
 and with the bus measuring curtain 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.249
 the resistance 3023 omnibus 

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:45.169
 and within the specifications 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.270
 then conca the jasen business order 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.059
 and engine start 

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:53.470
 the sensor the general in efe conditions 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.090
 normal revolutions per minute at least five podiums point 

00:06:58.869 --> 00:07:01.869
 to be within specifications 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:03.779
 be careful 

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:08.480
 because when the revolutions per minute are low the voltage generated 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.619
 It will also be low 

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:13.539
 we ended up replacing willian cables 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:15.409
 and the move I know that this vehicle 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:17.449
 and it works again I know
