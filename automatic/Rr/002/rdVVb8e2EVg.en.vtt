00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.419
 they never change 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:20.939
 at the very dawn of mankind when 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.869
 our ancestors took stones for the first time and 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.259
 sticks 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.720
 blood flowed in the name of anything 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.800
 from god and justice 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.800
 to the banal rage of psychopaths 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.280
 in 2070 in the seventh year 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.610
 after many millennia 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.890
 armed conflicts 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.330
 the destructive nature of humanity 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
 I could not restrain myself further 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.590
 turned out to be completely different but then 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.540
 flood radiation 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.550
 but it was not the end of the world as 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.590
 predicted some 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.710
 in fact the apocalypse is left 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.319
 just a prologue 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:04.119
 like another bloody pages 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.950
 human history 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.830
 for though people have succeeded in 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.920
 destruction of the world 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.540
 war 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.540
 war does not change 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.550
 in the early days thousands of people were saved from 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.080
 horror armageddon 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.380
 taking cover in the giant underground 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.380
 shelters 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.880
 but when they went outside 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.090
 they were met only by the scorched he 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.150
 devastation 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.369
 besides the residents haven so 1 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.390
 for that day when it was not spilled 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.770
 fiery rain 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.750
 awesome 101 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.750
 closed forever 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.190
 it's here you were born 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.830
 live here and die 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.010
 by god 2101 nobody will enter 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:10.879
