00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
you some basic biology on most of you

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
you some basic biology on most of you
already<00:01:19.560> know<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.770> but<00:01:19.920> there's<00:01:20.220> something

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
already know this but there's something

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.610 
already know this but there's something
called<00:01:20.580> MHC<00:01:21.360> proteins<00:01:21.510> which<00:01:22.050> were<00:01:22.200> found<00:01:22.440> on

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
called MHC proteins which were found on

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.100 
called MHC proteins which were found on
the<00:01:22.710> surface<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.360> many<00:01:24.360> cells<00:01:24.690> within<00:01:24.960> our

bodies now those proteins are used to

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.320 
bodies now those proteins are used to
distinguish<00:01:28.590> self<00:01:28.980> from<00:01:29.100> non-self<00:01:29.550> and

this lack of genetic variability comes

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.520 
this lack of genetic variability comes
with<00:05:17.950> a<00:05:17.980> severe<00:05:18.580> price<00:05:19.000> so<00:05:19.930> now<00:05:20.050> the<00:05:20.110> question

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
with a severe price so now the question

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.650 
with a severe price so now the question
arises<00:05:20.590> what<00:05:21.250> caused<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:21.880> severe<00:05:22.330> lack<00:05:22.360> of

arises what caused the severe lack of

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.659 
arises what caused the severe lack of
genetic<00:05:22.870> variability<00:05:23.380> in<00:05:23.650> the<00:05:23.740> cheetah<00:05:24.040> it's

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669

the cheetah went through a severe

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.600 
the cheetah went through a severe
population<00:05:28.390> bottleneck<00:05:29.460> which<00:05:30.460> is

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
population bottleneck which is

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.150 
population bottleneck which is
essentially<00:05:31.150> when<00:05:32.110> a<00:05:32.380> population<00:05:32.800> goes<00:05:33.130> down

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
essentially when a population goes down

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.790 
essentially when a population goes down
to<00:05:33.400> such<00:05:33.550> a<00:05:33.580> very<00:05:33.850> small<00:05:34.270> size<00:05:34.540> that<00:05:34.990> the<00:05:35.650> only

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
to such a very small size that the only

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.700 
to such a very small size that the only
thing<00:05:35.979> that<00:05:36.010> you<00:05:36.160> can<00:05:36.400> do<00:05:36.610> is<00:05:36.910> in<00:05:37.180> breed<00:05:37.710> the

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
thing that you can do is in breed the

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.260 
thing that you can do is in breed the
cheetah<00:05:39.010> was<00:05:39.160> essentially<00:05:39.580> wiped<00:05:39.790> out<00:05:40.000> it<00:05:40.180> was

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
cheetah was essentially wiped out it was

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.240 
cheetah was essentially wiped out it was
limited<00:05:40.630> or<00:05:40.900> it<00:05:41.050> was<00:05:41.169> lowered<00:05:41.770> down<00:05:41.890> to<00:05:41.950> very

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
limited or it was lowered down to very

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.159 
limited or it was lowered down to very
few<00:05:42.520> individuals<00:05:42.760> although<00:05:43.240> certainly<00:05:43.960> many

ten<00:05:46.540> thousand<00:05:46.900> years<00:05:47.020> ago<00:05:47.140> so<00:05:48.090> stop<00:05:49.090> and<00:05:49.240> think

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
ten thousand years ago so stop and think

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.040 
ten thousand years ago so stop and think
for<00:05:49.510> a<00:05:49.690> moment<00:05:50.250> let's<00:05:51.250> take<00:05:51.490> the<00:05:51.640> cheetah<00:05:52.050> ten

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
for a moment let's take the cheetah ten

note<00:06:33.880> is<00:06:34.180> how<00:06:34.390> they<00:06:34.540> often<00:06:34.900> comment<00:06:35.320> on<00:06:35.470> kind

note is how they often comment on kind

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.440 
note is how they often comment on kind
well<00:06:36.890> in<00:06:36.980> order<00:06:37.100> to<00:06:37.280> fit<00:06:37.580> all<00:06:37.820> of<00:06:38.090> the<00:06:38.180> species

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450 
well in order to fit all of the species

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.210 
well in order to fit all of the species
onto<00:06:38.900> the<00:06:39.020> ark<00:06:39.170> they<00:06:39.380> often<00:06:39.650> have<00:06:39.770> to<00:06:39.800> consider

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
onto the ark they often have to consider

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.280 
onto the ark they often have to consider
breaking<00:06:40.850> the<00:06:41.060> species<00:06:41.390> down<00:06:41.540> to<00:06:41.690> a<00:06:41.720> genus<00:06:42.080> and

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290 
breaking the species down to a genus and

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.870 
breaking the species down to a genus and
saying<00:06:42.620> that<00:06:42.770> the<00:06:42.890> individual<00:06:43.490> species

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 
saying that the individual species

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.860 
saying that the individual species
evolved<00:06:44.390> so<00:06:44.920> even<00:06:45.920> if<00:06:46.130> every<00:06:46.880> single<00:06:47.210> species

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
evolved so even if every single species

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.470 
evolved so even if every single species
in<00:06:48.170> the<00:06:48.500> world<00:06:48.620> fit<00:06:48.980> onto<00:06:49.130> the<00:06:49.250> ark<00:06:49.550> you<00:06:50.330> would

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.480 
in the world fit onto the ark you would

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.270 
in the world fit onto the ark you would
still<00:06:50.810> not<00:06:51.230> have<00:06:51.290> this<00:06:51.710> kind<00:06:51.920> of<00:06:52.040> genetic

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280 
still not have this kind of genetic

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.830 
still not have this kind of genetic
variability<00:06:52.730> that<00:06:53.030> we<00:06:53.150> see<00:06:53.330> displayed<00:06:53.720> on

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
variability that we see displayed on

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.590 
variability that we see displayed on
every<00:06:54.140> single<00:06:54.380> species<00:06:54.740> on<00:06:55.130> earth<00:06:55.420> so<00:06:56.420> another

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 
every single species on earth so another

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.030 
every single species on earth so another
question<00:06:56.780> comes<00:06:57.170> how<00:06:57.440> do<00:06:57.500> creationists

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.040 
question comes how do creationists

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.250 
question comes how do creationists
explain<00:06:58.640> this<00:06:58.790> well<00:06:59.750> the<00:06:59.900> answer<00:07:00.140> is<00:07:00.170> that

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260 
explain this well the answer is that

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.860 
explain this well the answer is that
they<00:07:00.470> simply<00:07:00.710> don't<00:07:01.060> because<00:07:02.060> any<00:07:02.450> evidence

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
they simply don't because any evidence

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.870 
they simply don't because any evidence
for<00:07:03.050> evolution<00:07:03.200> or<00:07:03.830> whatnot<00:07:04.340> that's<00:07:04.520> not<00:07:04.730> on<00:07:04.850> a

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 
for evolution or whatnot that's not on a

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.240 
for evolution or whatnot that's not on a
mainstream<00:07:05.210> creationist<00:07:05.960> website<00:07:06.380> they're

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.250 
mainstream creationist website they're

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.010 
mainstream creationist website they're
unable<00:07:07.700> to<00:07:07.880> respond<00:07:08.330> to<00:07:08.450> because<00:07:08.750> they<00:07:08.900> have

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.020 
unable to respond to because they have

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.320 
unable to respond to because they have
no<00:07:09.140> training<00:07:09.290> whatsoever<00:07:09.530> in<00:07:09.980> biology<00:07:10.580> which

no training whatsoever in biology which

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.730 
no training whatsoever in biology which
is<00:07:11.510> essentially<00:07:12.200> what<00:07:12.410> makes<00:07:12.590> the

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:12.740 
is essentially what makes the

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.870 
is essentially what makes the
creationists<00:07:13.280> because<00:07:13.550> if<00:07:13.670> they<00:07:13.820> were

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:13.880 
creationists because if they were

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.670 
creationists because if they were
educated<00:07:14.540> whatsoever<00:07:14.930> in<00:07:15.050> biology<00:07:15.470> they

educated whatsoever in biology they

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.890 
educated whatsoever in biology they
would<00:07:15.950> accept<00:07:16.340> evolution<00:07:16.690> but<00:07:17.690> nonetheless

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:17.900 
would accept evolution but nonetheless

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.560 
would accept evolution but nonetheless
short<00:07:18.590> of<00:07:18.710> saying<00:07:18.950> that<00:07:19.280> there<00:07:20.000> is<00:07:20.180> super
