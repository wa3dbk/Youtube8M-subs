00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 some of you will surely still 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.540
 the gamepad were games pokémon mystery 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.849
 dungeon team bread and the blue know 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.650
 and those of you who played these times 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.019
 certainly know the urge 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.830
 all the legendary pokémon his team 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.640
 take 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.890
 the axa sa and the whole overpowering one 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.080
 rest you have this at all 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.250
 Most of the time you have to come up with a lot of heavy 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.019
 overcome levels 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.849
 Unfortunately, there is no certainty 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.340
 that the pokemon also in your team 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.849
 want there is no recorded 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.009
 full 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.000
 in the legendary pokémon team 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.760
 was present 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.840
 and those who made it june again 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.079
 seen alive 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.149
 I'm one of them when I play this game 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.000
 I was still a little schicchi 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.649
 At level 1, nothing suspects me in the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.930
 would expect next week 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.850
 or what will happen to me 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.280
 At first I smiled quite normally 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.020
 I regularly bought items and picked up 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.940
 every new pokémon into my team 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.989
 because every help was important and so 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.030
 I could be nice too 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.350
 designed areas of the most diverse 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.180
 watch pokémon 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.040
 with the help of my team pokémon 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.590
 I spooned myself up and down 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.710
 now reaches the last 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.600
 development stage 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.670
 so I could with the main story 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.439
 easy to play through then made 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.720
 I'm already recruiting to that 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.580
 seen legendary pokémon and that was 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.170
 not too difficult, but then 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.680
 I had to rest was 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.050
 who have been harder to recruit 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.210
 At first , the axis was still relatively 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.700
 easy to recruit was when I 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.110
 I had to try it a few times 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.000
 in the area very curious and 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.990
 Therefore , it is me immediately after the 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.850
 recruitment 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.830
 I was very happy after this success 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.960
 optimistic the other pokémon too 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.910
 I still recruited and so I played 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.700
 Day and night and almost all managed 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.110
 to recruit pokémon 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.030
 i almost had my collection 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.640
 completes how you are missing now 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.479
 new to youtuber very hard too 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.729
 recruit 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.649
 since you have 99 had to climb up 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.539
 before you even get it to face 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.759
 only disturbing but I had the feeling 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.970
 that it just does not want to join my team 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.009
 although I had equipped sympathy 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.750
 after some attempts I noticed too 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.909
 that the text boxes are getting more and more 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.420
 I think maybe changed 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.769
 therefore this repellent feeling 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.900
 At some point it only seemed sad 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.569
 and depressed as if it were lonely 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.519
 that seemed slightly autistic before that 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.280
 more and more encapsulates and even 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.079
 did not want to fight with the 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.970
 time I also noticed the changes 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:28.480
 the color intensity and the saturation 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.069
 At first he thought that 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.739
 would be in my gamer 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.739
 but otherwise everything is unchanged 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.620
 From the text boxes changed 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.019
 Further, they were definitely depressive 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.819
 text him to early suicide him 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.040
 seemed to know 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.870
 his sprite changed after each one 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.530
 try on we are just one more 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.239
 sad and cloudy color differently 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.489
 Meanwhile, the text boxes were full of 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.480
 hints of suicide it was already 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.609
 no more play 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.299
 it all feels so realistic 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.920
 and I could feel with in Jewish 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.930
 I went way too easy now 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.269
 become and just now no longer high 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.269
 Recruit youtube but out 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.340
 curiosity what will happen to him I will 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.280
 I had no idea that it was not 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.560
 but I will happen to him 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.090
 played this part of the day for days 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.549
 game 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.859
 I know why that all 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.919
 happened and why there was nobody else 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.000
 The recruit managed 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:31.359
 I'm probably already over 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.840
 been a hundred times and depressed aura 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:36.310
 For some reason it was weak 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.199
 usually ran when entering the 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.840
 space is a shame on the back 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:43.569
 but now everything seemed aggressive and 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.459
 The colors were also stronger youtube 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.849
 sprite convinces with a light weight 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.040
 At the strong bot the text boxes 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:54.759
 changed again, this time 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.290
 they were angry and hated the music 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:58.359
 suddenly played faster and faster 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.389
 strangely enough loud laughter the 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.280
 volume level is not so slow at rattle 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.900
 I thought I knew something about everyone 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.690
 that happened to all pokémon 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.550
 wanted to recruit 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.650
 they probably committed suicide 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.480
 because of the terrible events 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.000
 I experience in recent days 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.980
 I always thought I was one 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.680
 very strong and mentally unstable people 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.290
 because never and self-injury or 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.200
 quite suicidal thought still remained 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.000
 still there 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.080
 By now I realized that I was me 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.800
 no longer in a normal game 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.510
 was 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.710
 it just feels like one 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.350
 realistic nightmare 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.770
 I can not stop thinking of myself 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.450
 was too curious what would happen to me 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.150
 against the levels over and over again 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.490
 up and every single time were the 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.650
 textboxes more aggressive and hateful 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.530
 but somehow with the time again 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.650
 sad as it would be so sorry that I 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:57.310
 Again and again hardly was me too 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.110
 from the textbox just go not surprised 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.840
 just because I have the german version of the 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.120
 but also because of him 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.270
 A tiny tears ran down his face 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.860
 The picture then went black 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.170
 I woke up as usual in my house 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.790
 up and was back with the west wages 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.100
 to get to youtube 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.560
 but the text on the screen was a 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.500
 little darker and not selectable than 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.600
 I do not care about him no matter what 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.370
 I tried was no longer allowed 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.770
 to go to the west wages to youtube 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.720
 and when I gave it up, I was undressed 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.510
 For some reason, my recruited 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.370
 I probably wanted pokémon 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.650
 again the areas of the pokemon mine 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.770
 look at the collection because they have me 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.200
 So far, I always enjoy and calm down 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.180
 So went left to the areas and 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.220
 When I came to the selection I want the 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.590
 shudder always when entering the 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.130
 dim room of youtube com over the 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.290
 move 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.580
 because the only pokémon in the list 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.310
 from youtube 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.740
 leave the list I could not I 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:01.069
 could only switch the games but 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:05.919
 I will be in youtube and you know 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:05.919
 the only claim here is the cat dead
