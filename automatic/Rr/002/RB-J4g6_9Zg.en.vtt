00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
can go ahead and reconnect our main wire

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.950 
can go ahead and reconnect our main wire
here

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.960 

you'll<00:03:08.960> notice<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.380> difference<00:03:09.770> between

you'll notice the difference between

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.910 
you'll notice the difference between
this<00:03:10.970> light<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.930> factory<00:03:12.380> light<00:03:12.560> is<00:03:12.740> that

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
this light and the factory light is that

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.040 
this light and the factory light is that
there's<00:03:13.100> no<00:03:13.280> clip<00:03:13.610> for<00:03:13.850> this<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:14.750> what<00:03:14.900> we're

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
there's no clip for this so what we're

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.090 
there's no clip for this so what we're
going<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.200> do<00:03:15.320> is<00:03:15.410> we're<00:03:15.560> just<00:03:15.590> going<00:03:15.800> to<00:03:15.890> tuck
