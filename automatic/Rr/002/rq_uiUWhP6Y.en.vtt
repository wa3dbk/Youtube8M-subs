well<00:01:17.880> as<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.119> textbook<00:01:18.900> because<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.380> could<00:01:19.530> be<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
well as a textbook because it could be a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.480 
well as a textbook because it could be a
huge<00:01:19.950> potential<00:01:20.430> market<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> device<00:01:22.490> and

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
huge potential market for the device and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.020 
huge potential market for the device and
the<00:01:24.330> highest<00:01:25.020> storage<00:01:25.799> capacity<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> ipad

the highest storage capacity on the ipad
is<00:01:27.530> 64<00:01:28.530> gigabytes<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.880> i<00:01:29.909> think<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.390> may<00:01:30.869> not

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
is 64 gigabytes so i think that may not

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.039 
is 64 gigabytes so i think that may not
be<00:01:31.110> enough<00:01:31.259> for<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> average<00:01:32.100> um<00:01:32.990> for<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
be enough for the average um for the
