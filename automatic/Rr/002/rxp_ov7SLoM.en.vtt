shotgun bunch so that's nice they got
the<00:01:04.890> regular<00:01:05.220> split<00:01:05.519> close<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.210> mean<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> basic

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the regular split close I mean the basic

the regular split close I mean the basic
standard<00:01:07.680> version<00:01:08.100> are<00:01:08.640> not<00:01:09.450> split<00:01:09.780> close

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
standard version are not split close

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.980 
standard version are not split close
split<00:01:10.229> flex<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.920> should<00:01:11.130> say<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.869> you<00:01:12.869> know

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
split flex I should say and you know

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.789 
split flex I should say and you know
just<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.830> basic<00:01:14.340> everything<00:01:14.760> else<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.799> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
just just basic everything else and the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.450 
just just basic everything else and the
last<00:01:16.950> thing<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.340> obviously<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> five<00:01:18.840> wide

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
last thing is obviously the five wide

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.100 
last thing is obviously the five wide
it's<00:01:20.460> not<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.640> five<00:01:20.880> wide<00:01:21.119> receiver<00:01:21.570> set<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.020> it

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
it's not a five wide receiver set but it

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.870 
it's not a five wide receiver set but it
is<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> four<00:01:22.590> wide<00:01:22.770> receiver<00:01:23.100> one<00:01:23.369> tight<00:01:23.640> end

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
is a four wide receiver one tight end

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.249 
is a four wide receiver one tight end
and<00:01:24.119> we'll<00:01:24.240> be<00:01:24.360> able<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.570> take<00:01:24.720> advantage<00:01:24.750> of

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
and we'll be able to take advantage of

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.410 
and we'll be able to take advantage of
this<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:26.130> put<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.580> wide<00:01:26.850> receiver<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
this to put the wide receiver in the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.050 
this to put the wide receiver in the
fourth<00:01:27.780> spot<00:01:27.960> at<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.590> running<00:01:28.799> back<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.310> we

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
fourth spot at the running back if we

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.969 
fourth spot at the running back if we
get<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.900> tired<00:01:31.200> running<00:01:31.439> back<00:01:31.650> or<00:01:31.680> anything

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
get a tired running back or anything

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.350 
get a tired running back or anything
like<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.790> we'll<00:01:32.909> be<00:01:33.030> able<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.210> take

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
like that so we'll be able to take

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.240 
like that so we'll be able to take
advantage<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:34.350> also<00:01:34.740> we<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> lot<00:01:35.220> of

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
advantage and also we have a lot of

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.920 
advantage and also we have a lot of
receivers<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:35.939> we<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.210> automotive<00:01:36.689> pretty

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
receivers so we can automotive pretty

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.690 
receivers so we can automotive pretty
much<00:01:37.110> any<00:01:37.290> formation<00:01:37.680> from<00:01:37.979> there<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.670> be
