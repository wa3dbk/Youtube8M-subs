00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.210
 me 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.210
 me 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:18.500
 Say this jailing pick today 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:25.279
 I will use it, but I will explain this pick a little 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:27.380
 Publisher of Audio Specialty Magazine Stereo Sound and Ultra-Fine Precision Machining Manufacturer 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.690
 Milly so precision 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:35.120
 It says the two companies and the jailing pick and has collaborated 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.300
 You can tan Keredomoetto of two 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.129
 Pick to the 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:48.790
 Can you see well ? Mirai Two picks overlap 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:50.100
 I 'm staying with a very small screw, but it's also a 1 mm acetate pick 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.660
 of 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:01:00.040
 It is 2 sheets, but it is 8 still thinner from the middle , 0.3 billy 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:03.870
 These two picks are being fished to you soon 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.000
 In this small screw 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.140
 Well stopped 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.310
 Once a little ordinary pick this is my original pick of me 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:19.760
 It is a so-called general result that is the first single pick called new one 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.760
 I think that I want to put out this sound for a moment 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.649
 First of all it looks like arpeggio yeah 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.430
 Well well know want pro 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.700
 I Sound is also in this decommissioning pick 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.780
 The two are fixed in a slightly misaligned form 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.780
 Now you have a little entered 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.690
 DEA 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.850
 goo 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:19.730
 Fairly spread to is playing quite at that one person This alone 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:21.180
 I think you can understand that it is an image but 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.799
 Jar that 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.530
 I think the most obvious is the stroke , but for a moment try it 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.340
 Let's go 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.340
 me 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.810
 me 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.020
 This newspaper pick is an ordinary pick 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.390
 And let's go pick 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.110
 Doing the same thing 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.110
 Good Iiii 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.209
 me 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.590
 me 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.270
 I think that maybe I can understand the difference even if only one 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.530
 This ordinary pick hmm 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:39.420
 I think there is a great use for the mall 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.980
 In fact the same way of playing 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:49.110
 I can not use it 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.110
 And try 8:00 kinda in the same how to wear as with a single pick 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.880
 To be the same shape as now such a thing is that single 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:09.120
 For the purpose of this pick 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:13.050
 It's as soft as possible, and it's really nice to have a room and a little later 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.050
 There is in this kind of sound 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:28.500
 To do well I can say double-double track at this another apparent to the recording of 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:30.300
 I do everyone well but I do the same thing twice 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.870
 It says to extend 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:40.840
 That in you I'm something just once is a recording that 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:47.110
 It is not such a sound that has an effect, so the highs are also beautiful 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.710
 I think that the feeling that 2 times of this child is slightly deviated is also one of the effects very much 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.490
 I will 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:55.479
 I think this is probably music spread 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.540
 There are plenty of uses and if you use this place of ah 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.540
 Hm 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.530
 When you use Fighter Arpeggio, there is already a 12-string guitar effect. 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:17.240
 If you use this for a moment 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.240
 Because it will be that single pick 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.530
 none 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.530
 me 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.169
 I mean both 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.390
 You can say that it can be used 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:39.740
 I think it can be used in various ways 8 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:43.700
 Read What we electric acoustic guitar to obtain particularly that electric love in the band 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.320
 It is very hard when I use it with Eleako 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.689
 Ah 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:53.440
 Feeling that it spread so well without using various effects and that 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:59.760
 Well, the effect of the double track is very good 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:02.460
 After I a little grind the way for this do I need to research the right hand it is also 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:08.479
 It is good to be taken in practice that pull out the power 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.479
 I think that I want you to remember a little to hear once more this sound 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.480
 me 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.710
 me 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.110
 Minutes 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.040
 eme 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.120
 done 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.980
 me 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.720
 me 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.560
 me 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.560
 me 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.140
 me 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.070
 Hmm 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.070
 Hmm
