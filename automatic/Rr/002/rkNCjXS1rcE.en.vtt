in<00:00:00.420> your<00:00:00.659> research<00:00:00.930> you<00:00:00.989> looked<00:00:01.319> at<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.439> lot<00:00:01.589> of

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
in your research you looked at a lot of

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.379 
in your research you looked at a lot of
alternative<00:00:02.190> treatments<00:00:02.700> as<00:00:02.879> well<00:00:03.240> and

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
alternative treatments as well and

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.740 
alternative treatments as well and
there's<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.680> ton<00:00:04.680> out<00:00:05.069> there<00:00:05.339> yeah<00:00:05.670> how<00:00:06.569> do<00:00:06.629> you

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
there's a ton out there yeah how do you

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.250 
there's a ton out there yeah how do you
know<00:00:06.899> which<00:00:07.589> ones<00:00:07.859> might<00:00:08.370> work<00:00:09.260> everybody's

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
know which ones might work everybody's

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.129 
know which ones might work everybody's
different<00:00:10.610> so<00:00:11.960> I<00:00:12.960> tried<00:00:14.120> what<00:00:15.120> what<00:00:15.719> God<00:00:15.900> led

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
different so I tried what what God led

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.720 
different so I tried what what God led
me<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.590> beginning<00:00:16.830> which<00:00:17.220> was<00:00:17.369> Budwig

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
me to in the beginning which was Budwig

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.090 
me to in the beginning which was Budwig
can<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.359> explain<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:18.779> process<00:00:19.350> too<00:00:19.859> before

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
can you explain that process too before

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.830 
can you explain that process too before
we<00:00:20.340> go<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.580> what<00:00:20.789> does<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:20.939> entail<00:00:21.180> max<00:00:21.510> it's

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
we go in what does that entail max it's

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.630 
we go in what does that entail max it's
flaxseed<00:00:22.380> oil<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.740> cottage<00:00:23.100> cheese

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
flaxseed oil and cottage cheese

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.359 
flaxseed oil and cottage cheese
so<00:00:24.269> it's<00:00:24.930> emulsified<00:00:25.560> together<00:00:25.890> doctor

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
so it's emulsified together doctor

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.279 
so it's emulsified together doctor
joanna<00:00:26.550> budwiq<00:00:26.880> she<00:00:27.240> was<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.359> biochemist<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.199> a

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
joanna budwiq she was a biochemist and a

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.210 
joanna budwiq she was a biochemist and a
pharmacologist

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
pharmacologist

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.400 
pharmacologist
and<00:00:29.539> also<00:00:30.539> doctor<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:32.360> she<00:00:33.360> found<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.260> when

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and also doctor and she found that when

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.170 
and also doctor and she found that when
you<00:00:34.500> emulsify<00:00:35.040> flax<00:00:35.370> oil<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.850> cottage<00:00:36.149> cheese

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
you emulsify flax oil and cottage cheese

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.290 
you emulsify flax oil and cottage cheese
it<00:00:37.079> creates<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.649> sulfur<00:00:38.010> rated<00:00:38.309> probe<00:00:38.520> protein

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
it creates a sulfur rated probe protein

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.530 
it creates a sulfur rated probe protein
which<00:00:39.989> actually<00:00:40.860> penetrates<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:42.149> cancer

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
which actually penetrates the cancer

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.920 
which actually penetrates the cancer
cell<00:00:42.750> wall<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.730> delivers<00:00:44.730> oxygen<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
cell wall and delivers oxygen to the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.260 
cell wall and delivers oxygen to the
cancer<00:00:46.320> cell<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.160> also<00:00:47.399> provides<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
cancer cell and it also provides the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.049 
cancer cell and it also provides the
body<00:00:48.420> with<00:00:48.710> you<00:00:49.710> know<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.160> flax<00:00:50.489> oil<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
body with you know the flax oil the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.619 
body with you know the flax oil the
omega-3s<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.890> are<00:00:53.039> lacking<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
omega-3s and that are lacking so and

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.880 
omega-3s and that are lacking so and
then<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:56.100> utilizing<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:58.350> sunlight

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
then you utilizing that with sunlight

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.389 
then you utilizing that with sunlight
afterwards<00:01:00.140> actually<00:01:01.140> helps<00:01:02.129> with<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
afterwards actually helps with the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.090 
afterwards actually helps with the
energy<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.149> like<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> biochemistry<00:01:04.170> thing<00:01:04.439> it

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
energy it's like a biochemistry thing it

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.289 
energy it's like a biochemistry thing it
works<00:01:05.280> really<00:01:05.640> well

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
works really well

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.410 
works really well
for<00:01:06.659> most<00:01:06.810> cancers<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:08.030> she<00:01:09.030> was<00:01:09.210> actually

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
for most cancers and she was actually

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.870 
for most cancers and she was actually
saving<00:01:09.960> people<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:11.130> know<00:01:11.250> thousands<00:01:11.790> of

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
saving people you know thousands of

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.219 
saving people you know thousands of
people<00:01:12.210> when<00:01:12.330> they<00:01:12.420> were<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.630> their<00:01:12.780> deathbed

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
people when they were on their deathbed

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.440 
people when they were on their deathbed
the<00:01:13.380> doctors<00:01:13.830> sent<00:01:14.130> them<00:01:14.250> home<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.580> die<00:01:14.820> they

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the doctors sent them home to die they

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.670 
the doctors sent them home to die they
could<00:01:15.689> no<00:01:15.840> longer<00:01:15.869> eat

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
could no longer eat

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.200 
could no longer eat
she<00:01:17.070> was<00:01:17.189> actually<00:01:17.369> giving<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:17.970> treatment

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
she was actually giving that treatment

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.160 
she was actually giving that treatment
to<00:01:18.420> them<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.720> an<00:01:18.810> enema<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:20.750> to<00:01:21.750> where<00:01:21.960> it

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
to them in an enema and to where it

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.630 
to them in an enema and to where it
healed<00:01:22.470> them<00:01:22.650> enough<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.100> where<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:23.460> they

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
healed them enough to where now they

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.070 
healed them enough to where now they
were<00:01:23.700> able<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.000> eat<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:24.570> she<00:01:24.810> could<00:01:24.960> give

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
were able to eat and then she could give

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.039 
were able to eat and then she could give
the<00:01:25.320> protocol<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.430> them<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:27.450> know<00:01:27.570> by<00:01:27.810> mouth

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the protocol to them you know by mouth

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.609 
the protocol to them you know by mouth
and<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:29.340> was<00:01:29.490> working<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.210> saving<00:01:30.689> people<00:01:31.140> you

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
and it was working so saving people you

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.160 
and it was working so saving people you
know<00:01:31.770> from<00:01:32.070> death<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.479> worked<00:01:33.689> pretty

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
know from death and it worked pretty

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.550 
know from death and it worked pretty
immediately<00:01:34.770> with<00:01:35.070> me<00:01:35.930> maybe<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.380> had

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
immediately with me maybe because I had

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.280 
immediately with me maybe because I had
never<00:01:37.740> had<00:01:37.950> chemo<00:01:38.430> or<00:01:38.460> radiation<00:01:39.290> anything

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
never had chemo or radiation anything

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.140 
never had chemo or radiation anything
like<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.369> don't<00:01:41.490> know<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.820> was<00:01:41.939> really

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
like that so I don't know it was really

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.480 
like that so I don't know it was really
receptive<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:42.960> me<00:01:43.110> does<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.159> depend<00:01:44.340> on

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
receptive with me does it depend on

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.280 
receptive with me does it depend on
where<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.670> cancer<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.119> at<00:01:45.390> do<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.659> think<00:01:45.899> in

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
where the cancer is at do you think in

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.810 
where the cancer is at do you think in
your<00:01:46.350> body<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.890> what<00:01:47.040> type<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.369> well

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
your body and what type you have well

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.310 
your body and what type you have well
yeah<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.210> depends<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.689> which<00:01:48.810> type<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.290> have

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
yeah it depends on which type you have

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.380 
yeah it depends on which type you have
there<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> list<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.670> have<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:51.060> my<00:01:51.210> book

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
there is a list that I have in my book

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.569 
there is a list that I have in my book
of<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:52.350> know<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.619> different<00:01:53.009> types<00:01:53.430> of

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
of you know the different types of

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.539 
of you know the different types of
cancer<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:54.000> works<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.659> best<00:01:54.840> for<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.619> of

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
cancer that works the best for and of

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.340 
cancer that works the best for and of
course<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.030> have<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.450> eat<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.899> certain<00:01:58.140> way

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
course you have to eat a certain way

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.870 
course you have to eat a certain way

because with bite awake there's a lot of

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.420 
because with bite awake there's a lot of
contradiction<00:02:00.659> therapies<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.860> see<00:02:02.280> what

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
contradiction therapies and see what

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.789 
contradiction therapies and see what
happens<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.270> lot<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.509> people<00:02:03.869> are<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.350> scared

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
you know when you have cancer you know I

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.089 
you know when you have cancer you know I
mean<00:02:07.799> naturally<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.170> that<00:02:10.170> you're<00:02:10.860> searching

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
mean naturally so that you're searching

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.920 
mean naturally so that you're searching
the<00:02:11.370> internet<00:02:11.400> for<00:02:11.760> everything<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.450> can<00:02:12.690> and

you

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.280 
you
start<00:02:13.430> trying<00:02:13.790> everything<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.960> problem

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
start trying everything and the problem

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.130 
start trying everything and the problem
with<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:15.590> this<00:02:16.130> is<00:02:16.450> why<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.480> lot<00:02:17.600> of<00:02:17.780> people

with it is this is why a lot of people

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.340 
with it is this is why a lot of people
will<00:02:18.350> die<00:02:18.970> from<00:02:19.970> cancer<00:02:20.180> when<00:02:20.720> they're<00:02:21.200> doing

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
will die from cancer when they're doing

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.110 
will die from cancer when they're doing
alternatives<00:02:21.950> is<00:02:22.370> they're<00:02:22.670> doing<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:22.940> lot<00:02:23.090> of

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
alternatives is they're doing a lot of

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.760 
alternatives is they're doing a lot of
contradictory<00:02:23.720> therapies<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.440> I've<00:02:24.560> seen

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
contradictory therapies and I've seen

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.430 
contradictory therapies and I've seen
this<00:02:24.890> happen<00:02:25.310> with<00:02:25.340> people<00:02:25.850> where<00:02:26.660> they'll

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
this happen with people where they'll

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.190 
this happen with people where they'll
try<00:02:27.770> you<00:02:28.190> know<00:02:28.310> Budwig<00:02:28.790> with<00:02:29.180> an<00:02:29.480> oxygenated

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
try you know Budwig with an oxygenated

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.250 
try you know Budwig with an oxygenated
therapy<00:02:30.800> at<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.520> same<00:02:31.760> time<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.450> Budwig

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
therapy at the same time and Budwig

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.460 
therapy at the same time and Budwig
strictly<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:34.250> know<00:02:34.280> forbids<00:02:35.240> that<00:02:35.510> because

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
strictly you know forbids that because

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.400 
strictly you know forbids that because
she<00:02:36.710> says<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.100> doesn't<00:02:37.720> they<00:02:38.720> don't<00:02:38.750> mesh<00:02:39.380> well

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
she says it doesn't they don't mesh well

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.800 
she says it doesn't they don't mesh well
together<00:02:39.830> so<00:02:40.640> if<00:02:40.730> you're<00:02:40.880> doing<00:02:41.030> these<00:02:41.270> two<00:02:41.540> it

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
together so if you're doing these two it

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.390 
together so if you're doing these two it
could<00:02:41.990> actually<00:02:42.200> send<00:02:42.830> you<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.040> your<00:02:43.160> deathbed

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
could actually send you to your deathbed

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.449 
could actually send you to your deathbed
quicker<00:02:44.500> so<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.680> was<00:02:45.770> amazing<00:02:46.010> the

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
quicker so it was amazing the

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.190 
quicker so it was amazing the
biochemistry<00:02:47.180> of<00:02:47.480> everything<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:47.990> how<00:02:48.080> it

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
biochemistry of everything and how it

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.660 
biochemistry of everything and how it
works<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:48.740> it<00:02:49.220> was<00:02:49.340> really<00:02:49.580> pretty

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
works so it was really pretty

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.949 
works so it was really pretty
fascinating<00:02:50.360> yeah<00:02:50.480> I've<00:02:50.570> read<00:02:50.780> through

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
fascinating yeah I've read through

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.170

notice well what I noticed is when you
do<00:03:25.910> too<00:03:26.870> many<00:03:27.190> treatments<00:03:28.190> at<00:03:28.280> once<00:03:28.519> because<00:03:29.150> I

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
do too many treatments at once because I

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.090 
do too many treatments at once because I
experiment<00:03:29.660> on<00:03:29.810> my<00:03:29.959> body<00:03:30.110> all<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.709> time<00:03:30.739> I'm

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
experiment on my body all the time I'm

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.830 
experiment on my body all the time I'm
still<00:03:31.370> experimenting<00:03:32.090> I<00:03:32.180> always<00:03:32.450> have<00:03:32.630> like

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
still experimenting I always have like

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.930 
still experimenting I always have like
at<00:03:33.290> least<00:03:33.530> six<00:03:33.769> experiments<00:03:34.130> going<00:03:34.519> on<00:03:34.730> in<00:03:34.850> my

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
at least six experiments going on in my

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.770 
at least six experiments going on in my

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
body at the same time what I noticed is

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.420 
body at the same time what I noticed is
when<00:03:39.680> you<00:03:40.070> combine<00:03:41.030> all<00:03:41.750> of<00:03:41.810> these<00:03:42.430> treatments

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
when you combine all of these treatments

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.590 
when you combine all of these treatments
at<00:03:43.519> once<00:03:43.700> because<00:03:43.940> like<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:44.180> would<00:03:44.330> get<00:03:44.420> up<00:03:44.540> in

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
pineapple will the enzymes for bromelain

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.940 
pineapple will the enzymes for bromelain
I<00:03:50.000> would<00:03:50.150> do<00:03:50.209> the<00:03:50.299> pineapple<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:51.049> would<00:03:51.500> do<00:03:51.650> the

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
I would do the pineapple I would do the

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.759 
I would do the pineapple I would do the
Budwig<00:03:52.280> protocol<00:03:52.880> I<00:03:53.150> would<00:03:53.600> do<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:54.290> glass<00:03:54.739> of

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
Budwig protocol I would do a glass of

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.740 
Budwig protocol I would do a glass of
green<00:03:55.160> juice<00:03:55.549> and<00:03:55.580> I<00:03:56.030> would<00:03:56.180> do<00:03:56.299> my<00:03:56.420> apricot

and<00:04:07.940> I<00:04:08.060> would<00:04:08.239> have<00:04:08.630> to<00:04:08.720> run<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:09.049> the<00:04:09.140> bathroom

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
day of doing this I finally figured out

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.990 
day of doing this I finally figured out
it<00:04:18.109> was<00:04:18.350> detoxing<00:04:18.739> my<00:04:19.130> body<00:04:19.340> of<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.609> cancer

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
it was detoxing my body of the cancer

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.330 
it was detoxing my body of the cancer
too<00:04:20.120> fast<00:04:20.390> and<00:04:21.019> so<00:04:21.470> when<00:04:21.620> I<00:04:21.650> started<00:04:22.160> to

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
too fast and so when I started to

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.909 
too fast and so when I started to
actually<00:04:22.880> spread<00:04:23.390> out<00:04:23.599> the<00:04:24.260> treatments

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
actually spread out the treatments

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.410 
actually spread out the treatments
throughout<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.640> day

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
throughout the day

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.920 
throughout the day
then<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.260> detoxification<00:04:27.860> was<00:04:28.400> slower<00:04:28.790> and<00:04:29.150> I

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
then the detoxification was slower and I

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.510 
then the detoxification was slower and I
didn't<00:04:30.170> have<00:04:30.290> those<00:04:30.410> problems<00:04:30.710> anymore

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
didn't have those problems anymore

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.920 
didn't have those problems anymore
but<00:04:31.760> I<00:04:31.790> see<00:04:32.030> that<00:04:32.180> happen<00:04:32.540> because<00:04:32.570> I<00:04:32.870> do

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930
