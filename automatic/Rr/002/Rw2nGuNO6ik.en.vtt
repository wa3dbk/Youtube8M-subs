00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
put a PSP right here then the PSP will

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.000 
put a PSP right here then the PSP will
be<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.920> little<00:02:24.100> bit<00:02:24.280> smaller<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:25.650> if<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.860> have

be a little bit smaller and if you have
a<00:02:27.040> PSP<00:02:27.430> slim<00:02:27.580> probably<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.300> little<00:02:28.390> bit<00:02:28.600> more<00:02:28.870> um

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
a PSP slim probably a little bit more um

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.910 
a PSP slim probably a little bit more um
um<00:02:29.760> um<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:32.760> smaller<00:02:33.760> right<00:02:34.090> here<00:02:34.330> but<00:02:34.990> this<00:02:35.620> more

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
um um a smaller right here but this more

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.890 
um um a smaller right here but this more
wider<00:02:36.130> than<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.490> PSP<00:02:36.970> anyone<00:02:37.980> any<00:02:38.980> kind<00:02:39.580> of<00:02:39.670> PSP

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
wider than a PSP anyone any kind of PSP

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.480 
wider than a PSP anyone any kind of PSP
but<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:42.280> is<00:02:42.490> a<00:02:42.730> really<00:02:43.090> good<00:02:43.270> case<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:43.720> like<00:02:43.900> it

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490
