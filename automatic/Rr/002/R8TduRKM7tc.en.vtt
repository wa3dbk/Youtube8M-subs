00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.769

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.210

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.440
 Esther tell us what we are going to 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.720
 do how are we going to prepare for 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.500
 prepare a trout that we carry 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.760
 Tamale 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:29.160
 what is wrapped in corn leaves 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.160
 then let's slice the onion 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.670
 how do I have to slice explain to me 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.180
 because he grabbed this one that is already if they know 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.360
 to remove them put me the sample then 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.470
 we clean it, we're giving it to you 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.110
 what is it called is that it is called or as 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.210
 it is called is the first capita that 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.850
 it takes away the week so we do not want it 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:00.340
 already the slices and as they see as in 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.890
 segments in strips very well 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.720
 Chechen is very well Mrs. Esther 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.810
 then we have jackie chopped our 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.810
 our onion which is what is 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.130
 Of course we have the tail 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.770
 and they're already registered and that's fine 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.950
 Mrs. Esther we now enjoy the 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.900
 epazote very well to see here I think that 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.900
 if it goes to me nothing else removes it without nothing more 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.970
 how much do we need in passing if you paquito 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.790
 about 4 giving about 4 twigs now 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.480
 let's grab the leaves 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:53.370
 well let's make a band-aid first 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.370
 two strips to tie the tamale 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.540
 well soaked leaves agree because 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.939
 if you can not do the tasks that you 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.830
 would break if they are noticeably thin 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.310
 that the number that holds the moored 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:16.540
 now we put two of these and 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.500
 we place the onion a bit of onion 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.090
 finish 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.460
 a handful and about half of what 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.780
 then a few sheets of chili then more 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.410
 or less than half of the onion that 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.780
 we had put it already and in the in the in 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.140
 the sheet 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.980
 half of chili and leaflets of 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.940
 everything well distributed this part is very 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:46.480
 Mexican because of onion white 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.230
 green cited from the leaves of a handful of 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.230
 salt of salt 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.959
 and we are going to place the trout and our 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.360
 beloved guest of this day the 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.700
 fight open three times and is that the 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.209
 they just pulled out of the open pond 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.569
 As the mother opens nothing we do not take away 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:12.489
 the spine and the little ribs that's what 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:16.060
 better to me so much is clear can then 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.670
 we make another stretch and another capita 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.910
 step back 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.190
 well stuffed back other chiles chiles 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.230
 and I guess I 'm going to all the 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.700
 onions that I put well and everything 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.700
 you want a lot of onion 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.400
 it is already beginning to shrink this 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.680
 and the onion without change a little bit good 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.590
 the whole cell we already had is everything 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.750
 Now another because I already have already 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.150
 will like another little bit of meadow another bit 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.020
 of salt are like 12 2 points 1 to 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.930
 beginning and another at the end 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.930
 and now it comes to demonstrate the wrap 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:06.170
 that they put other bases that are 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:09.560
 two leaves with reason today his little golito 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.990
 Look at the size of the tamal we place 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:17.489
 another hit three sheets then 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.270
 and the time 4 according to what we can 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.850
 follow 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.310
 then we have a little trout 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.770
 same and the challenge to declare because it is 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.840
 a trout now andy if it's not cheating no 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.360
 Well if you want but good 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:35.389
 then notice how he tied him made a 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.389
 knot here to see it tied it I do not 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.240
 then a knot like that as it is 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.040
 call this knot then sometimes they have 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.940
 name the knots 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.010
 no gift tonight I think so 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.170
 here is look at part that this one 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.960
 present floor was delayed to put 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.810
 to the comal 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:58.789
 we go there to put the fire for 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:02.389
 that they see the oven that esther has 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.889
 here with firewood obviously if you guys 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.780
 Well, they can not do it with wood that 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.630
 they can do in a normal stove 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.880
 whole year but the best thing is that what 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.270
 do with firewood because it is better 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.740
 taste now what a good good to see and 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:23.210
 how long will it last and the tamale 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:24.919
 Up to 20 minutes 20 minutes no 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.510
 I can stand it is already making water 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.450
 mouth 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.290
 sometimes have here we see everything we're going to 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.290
 grab a good piece 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.270
 the date can be enjoyed in 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.999
 many places just let yourself be carried away 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.860
 by his instinct in addition to that the 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:44.139
 wooded places like this where 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.749
 breeding the trout can be magnificent 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.900
 to have a good time, relax and 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:50.729
 enjoy nature 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.650
 they will not leave me in the 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.990
 next issue that every time we're 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.820
 discovering more and more surprises about 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.350
 from each of the corners of our 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.360
 country we will continue in the adventure of 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.570
 know our Mexico through its 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.570
 flavors 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.860
 and
