in<00:01:11.880> hormone<00:01:12.360> levels<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.890> release<00:01:14.159> of

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
in hormone levels so the release of

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.620 
in hormone levels so the release of

biggest surges in those sort of
fat-burning<00:01:27.540> muscle<00:01:28.320> building<00:01:28.710> hormones

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
fat-burning muscle building hormones

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.880

a<00:01:40.409> lot<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.740> leg<00:01:40.860> training<00:01:41.250> he<00:01:41.340> gets<00:01:41.549> that

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
a lot of leg training he gets that

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.749 
a lot of leg training he gets that
hormonal<00:01:42.150> surge<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.220> it's<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.520> so

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
important for that even if your goal is

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.780 
important for that even if your goal is
just<00:01:46.290> upper<00:01:46.710> body<00:01:46.950> being<00:01:47.369> an<00:01:47.520> upper<00:01:47.759> body<00:01:47.880> go

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
and actually use that point that maybe

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.760 
and actually use that point that maybe
