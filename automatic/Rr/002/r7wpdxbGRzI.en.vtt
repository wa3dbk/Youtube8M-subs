00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.480
 very good people of youtube we are 

00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:07.970
 here one more day use go pro ping here 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.860
 with a new video tutorial instead of 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.920
 with king minos with another one of my characters 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.980
 in which I will explain what is 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.359
 that mission that you are looking for in the achievement 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.730
 but where are the two bush that are 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.619
 titula mission of panda customs 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.499
 there is no mission with that name 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.630
 it's true there are several missions that are 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:29.810
 inside screen that I'm going to show you 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.289
 now to start before anything you have 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:38.179
 to go talk to this guy with a 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:39.710
 ship I do not know what you buy basically 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:42.980
 a little hat that costs you about 1,000 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.859
 beds you have to equip it because 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.870
 buying it alone is useless and clear 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.640
 you have to pay the tax as you 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.440
 they ask here then they equip it gives you 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.300
 bad use but it allows you to talk with 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.760
 the people 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.170
 I'm with this character of mine instead 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.000
 of with king minos because king minos already 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.610
 has missions done then for 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.829
 as some of you asked about this 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.200
 mission specifically what was it then 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.520
 here I leave it in a video tutorial 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.680
 I'm going on the video at speed 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.940
 fast because it is that it does not have much 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.440
 science is to say from one side to another 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.509
 side for another once they have the 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.890
 missions to follow earth where it says 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:21.979
 and not much more crumb much 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.320
 saying it like that before doing is before 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.190
 get this is advisable to have 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.800
 made the two previous achievements of the 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.140
 internet missions and another that is 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.360
 the missions of a disciple's star 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.940
 model that precisely as you can see 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.830
 at the beginning of the video he already gets it 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.890
 with this character I just got it 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.649
 everything and it's basically here right now 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.660
 you have to go from one side to another talk to 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:53.100
 this is to cut it take it to the 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.439
 source if I remember correctly 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.799
 and after that it is very advisable 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.479
 have saved saved to the position 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.320
 because that's how you can do as I say 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.960
 now use 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.180
 the next one I remember and I'll save you 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.850
 something on the way is not much but after 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.730
 when you have to go true today here 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.610
 you have to give it a good option if you do not 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.510
 they give it to us since you have to remember them 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.250
 that is a jar of bread 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.310
 neuquÃ©n 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.620
 and then again you have to take it back 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.290
 to talk to that with which he sold us 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.210
 that bottle to continue the mission 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.910
 then he asks us to go see 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.530
 support to see support well very well 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.680
 we return to throw up 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.930
 that gets pretty fast as you see 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.580
 I do not have barely do anything with this 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.940
 character that is and unlocking everything 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.770
 and nothing is the simplest strips for 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.450
 up follows the indications very 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.610
 important as long as you do not know how 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.090
 continue a vision try to click on 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.010
 her and give it to the kind of circuit 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.530
 that already indicates the position on the map 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.010
 I know that most of you already 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.680
 you know 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.440
 Meza and for example hidden state is worth 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.560
 ok see you later come and let's see the 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.769
 master of actuated the other time I use the 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.200
 potion of remembrance because if it does not take 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.660
 something else and this one the truth is that it is not 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.400
 a very long video because it is quite 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.080
 simple pretty short is a very mission 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.209
 simple and if I do not plan to do more 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.560
 videos like this from these missions because the 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.019
 rest of the missions are already quite 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.360
 simpler but yes I have thought 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.420
 make a purple tofu guide 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.430
 although I 've already achieved it with realms and 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.410
 with two other characters I'm going to go back to 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.540
 make them and so on some video 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:47.650
 tutorial I'll explain them step by step 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:51.189
 of the doctor if you liked the x 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.900
 subscribe agreed on the posts 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.640
 comments also matter to you 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.680
 opinion if you have something to say to me as 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.620
 you can see here the achievement is already 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.930
 unlocked, do not succeed if you do not 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.209
 mission in particular and that's it 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.209
 a greeting people to take care of themselves goodbye
