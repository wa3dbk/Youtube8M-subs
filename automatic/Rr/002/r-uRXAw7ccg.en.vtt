lyrically<00:04:04.329> i<00:04:04.599> just<00:04:04.870> i<00:04:05.139> don't<00:04:05.440> really<00:04:05.650> know

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
lyrically i just i don't really know

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.680 
lyrically i just i don't really know
because<00:04:06.250> sometimes<00:04:06.910> it's<00:04:07.060> hard<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:07.239> critique

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
because sometimes it's hard to critique

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.080 
because sometimes it's hard to critique
i<00:04:07.950> definitely<00:04:08.950> thought<00:04:09.370> about<00:04:09.430> how<00:04:09.849> to<00:04:09.910> be

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
i definitely thought about how to be

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.849 
i definitely thought about how to be
true<00:04:10.299> to<00:04:10.419> myself<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:11.019> yet<00:04:11.230> do<00:04:11.410> some<00:04:11.620> things

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
true to myself and yet do some things

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
differently roasted it is some

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.170 
differently roasted it is some
simplicity<00:04:14.349> to<00:04:14.799> it<00:04:14.829> lyrically<00:04:15.310> because<00:04:15.910> i

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
simplicity to it lyrically because i

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.110 
simplicity to it lyrically because i

that album at
time<00:04:29.050> progressed<00:04:29.650> got<00:04:30.220> it<00:04:30.340> showed<00:04:30.790> a<00:04:30.820> little

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
time progressed got it showed a little

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.670 
time progressed got it showed a little
more<00:04:31.300> variety<00:04:31.509> and<00:04:31.930> diversity<00:04:32.020> in<00:04:32.530> the

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
more variety and diversity in the

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.980 
more variety and diversity in the
personality<00:04:33.430> but<00:04:33.550> at<00:04:33.669> first<00:04:33.910> I<00:04:34.210> was<00:04:34.660> a<00:04:34.690> very

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
personality but at first I was a very

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.529 
personality but at first I was a very
monochromatic<00:04:35.650> just<00:04:36.400> one<00:04:36.669> color<00:04:36.970> almost<00:04:37.240> like

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
monochromatic just one color almost like

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.600 
monochromatic just one color almost like
when<00:04:38.229> you<00:04:38.320> use<00:04:38.500> black<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:38.979> white<00:04:39.130> versus

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
when you use black and white versus

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.460 
when you use black and white versus
color<00:04:39.910> when<00:04:40.240> you<00:04:40.360> use<00:04:40.630> something<00:04:41.289> that's

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
color when you use something that's

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.920 
color when you use something that's
grainy<00:04:41.979> on<00:04:42.340> purpose<00:04:42.910> it's<00:04:43.090> like<00:04:43.270> literally

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
grainy on purpose it's like literally

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.200 
grainy on purpose it's like literally
there<00:04:44.139> was<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.650> somberness<00:04:45.310> that<00:04:45.669> matched<00:04:45.940> the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
there was a somberness that matched the

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.080 
there was a somberness that matched the
state<00:04:46.509> of<00:04:46.539> my<00:04:46.780> soul<00:04:47.110> as<00:04:47.380> in<00:04:47.979> process<00:04:48.550> i<00:04:48.699> went

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
state of my soul as in process i went

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.540 
state of my soul as in process i went
from<00:04:49.300> black<00:04:49.600> and<00:04:49.630> white<00:04:49.870> to<00:04:49.990> color<00:04:50.199> in<00:04:50.770> vibrant

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
from black and white to color in vibrant

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.150 
from black and white to color in vibrant
so<00:04:51.729> I<00:04:51.789> think<00:04:51.880> lyrically<00:04:52.389> you're<00:04:52.600> going<00:04:52.780> to<00:04:52.840> see

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
so I think lyrically you're going to see

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.710 
so I think lyrically you're going to see
some<00:04:54.160> acrobatics<00:04:54.970> but<00:04:55.180> you'll<00:04:55.300> also<00:04:55.479> see

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
some acrobatics but you'll also see

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.120 
some acrobatics but you'll also see
sometimes<00:04:56.139> when<00:04:56.289> it's<00:04:56.410> just<00:04:56.560> simple<00:04:57.009> like<00:04:57.100> a

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
sometimes when it's just simple like a

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.700 
sometimes when it's just simple like a
song<00:04:57.400> I<00:04:57.490> have<00:04:57.610> caught<00:04:57.850> up<00:04:58.030> down<00:04:58.419> very<00:04:59.050> simple

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710
