 six applications that you can not 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.380
 missing on your cell phone as you will remember the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.190
 everyone's sensitivity is so high that

 you can use the phone with good gloves 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.090
 we will start with the most important thing that is 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.340
 and do not you 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.180
 and it can not help you remember appointments 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.150
 birthday events etc. we will put a 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.150
 example do the homework good 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.640
 we can say it with brush or context ok 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:37.079
 let's take the example of this 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.970
 and it's going to be but as it can not but arrive 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.940
 to fit we can write it too 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.340
 context do not worry it does not cost in 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.860
 some applications of notes if it costs 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.690
 put a text you have to buy the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.090
 pro version 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.350
 or we can also put an image that 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.200
 identify the task we can not this 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.960
 image 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.270
 and we will put something of you 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.180
 to do the homework 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.140
 what we have 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.140
 and we hear it 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.050
 ok it sounds perfectly and now what 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.040
 we keep 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.610
 is saved and finally we are going to give 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.610
 anchor to start 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.850
 and so you can not forget you can 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.409
 put it of the two we can put no 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.229
 only two sizes large and 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.450
 small the next application is 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.009
 connectivity short cuts this application 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.500
 It serves for quick access to 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:40.460
 important collections such as wifi in 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.950
 youtube the 3g connection and the airplane mode and 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.360
 the location we put the wifi and we're going 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.360
 to give corn cost 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.090
 and we can change the type of icon that 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.960
 it could be the original 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.580
 the platinum consigned and colored to me 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.350
 like to be seen with a sign and we can 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.450
 change the name in a way 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.760
 customized and we can also change 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.220
 the color of the feet of the following 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.300
 colors that are here 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.330
 I'm going to choose the red 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.360
 and now we are going to give him here to painted 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.400
 be that it would be clear start that 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.820
 we can only put it of the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.820
 two sizes 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.680
 Y

 I'll take it with the other networks 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.459
 and here is 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.090
 and we are going to do the test 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.810
 yes definitely if it serves perfect the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.910
 next application is the creator of 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.880
 tones as saying you can create me your 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.290
 own tones using your own music

 you can direct the beginning times 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.220

 ok we can only here from minute 1 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.120
 that's why we can play it to see if 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.120
 you chose is the right time 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.709
 When the time is right we can 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.840
 save it and says save the whole name 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.850

 and the message says your new corner has been 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.200
 saved in your screaming library 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.440
 you can create another you can simply 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.880
 say the next shadow the 8 is 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.280

 of your city or of several there is not much 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.630
 what to say about this application since it 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.140
 define by itself 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:06.120
 cities and we only have reynosa 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.120
 we can add more if we wish 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.959
 we can give it here and it says anchor to 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.959
 start 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.600
 and here is 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.640
 we promise and he sends us the same 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.880
 application and here tells us how many 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.460
 degrees we are 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.110

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.110
 details and schedule 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.670
 that's the diary of how it can be 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.860
 tomorrow on sunday monday until the 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.510
 next days the next application 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.510
 de la calera is battery plus 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.950
 this application serves to see the level 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.500
 of remaining material and gives you advice 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:55.660
 to save the battery here we can see 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.660
 that here says 81 percent battery 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.520
 and he can give you advice, say you can 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.130
 disable several things so that your 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.310
 phone 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.140
 damn ad 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.750
 so you can save the battery says 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.740
 you can stop the bluetooth so that 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.590
 extend 30 minutes duration 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.740
 if you put in airplane mode it extends to 5 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.740
 hours 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.880
 here are more things that can serve you 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.060
 this application I highly recommend 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.060
 why 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.110
 it's faster and here it tells you how many 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.220
 hours left you say 8 hours and 44 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.480
 minutes 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.120
 the next application is a music 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.200
 it's like youtube but it's music ok 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.450
 we will see here the example 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.040
 we can take our own music and 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.380
 download it directly 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.940
 of music like that is I do not have to 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.770
 to put 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.120
 you do not have to go to the 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.050
 application to listen to your own 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.970
 music 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.660
 well we will give the example here to that 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.430
 Martin 's grab this Gareis animals 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.490
 and we simply give the cloud here if 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.180
 is in pain 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.550
 and now that's the most entertaining thing 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.199
 of the application here says the name of 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.509
 the song and we're going to remove it from 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:19.229
 official video name of the artist martín 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:23.660

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:33.650
 supermix 2014 I do not know 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.690
 and now we can choose the own photo 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.150
 to be identified faster as 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.950
 I do not have a photo of the album or something 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.950
 related I will 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.120
 the photo of a piano 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.220
 now we can save it 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.580
 and this one will leave a message although already here 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.770
 is 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.770
 now we go to our music library 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:08.990

 how to see how to listen to is heard with 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.370
 high definition since we download it 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.780
 direct from youtube well that was it 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:25.010
