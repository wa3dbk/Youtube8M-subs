00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.730
 These pages have really been through 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.789
 this variety of colors you have and these 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.280
 High quality and this special feature of 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.680
 the house is that really goes my heart 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.420
 when I'm standing there and the songs 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.320
 is allowed to choose and is out of the full 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.900
 can draw 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.970
 with those colors and then that's it 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.650
 I'm really grateful for this one 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.009
 to exercise work because it is a 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.009
 great gift 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.100
 b 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.240
 there is 12 for the tie 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.870
 what it is is what it is 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.120
 the cut very expensive we have 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.469
 pattern going in one direction 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.520
 that means you have to between already 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.520
 be very attentive 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.480
 the one big difference is really 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.549
 the high quality of the page the second 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.490
 difference that is now with us that 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.560
 We take a very high quality deposit 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.700
 the master part is wool and the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.700
 see the elastic 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.680
 we have objection to the process of 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.230
 hand made is not around with air pressure 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.650
 Also there to protect the page for nothing 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.650
 to break 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.270
 the iron predecessors last a very long time 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.030
 we just do not use normal presses 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.070
 just by hand just as a bit 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.000
 about the tie breathe around yes the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.000
 Do not destroy pages 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.290
 we are one of the last tie 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.340
 manufactories worldwide the oldest on 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.780
 my parents have me 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.500
 Management seven years ago 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.760
 to hand over 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.620
 The founding of the company was without complaint in 1838 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.090
 He was first with English drops 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.160
 and umbrellas and sheets 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.790
 acted the real one 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:06.490
 ties manufaktur came in 1890 these were 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.289
 already old heavy wood furniture 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.179
 these old machines the raadters 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.459
 Of course all or had very different 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.920
 so today what is so good today 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.420
 is everything and then it had that 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.959
 had other effect that were 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.620
 of course it was over 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.110
 600 employees 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.739
 that was not even at first 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.739
 manufactory 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.140
 we produce ties here but we 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.050
 also produce grinding and ascot 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.060
 and pocket squares that means that my 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.350
 real attention lies on the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.299
 side and that is so to speak and that 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.380
 plot and the heart of this whole 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.380
 products that arise 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.590
 we are also trying with this good 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.359
 quality for which you want something nice too 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.329
 create meaning he wants to joy 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:09.609
 have on what he carries and love 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.150
 to detail we put in there as well 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.129
 feel 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.810
 and that should actually cause that 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.310
 he feels better and arrives and 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.310
 says that's fine
