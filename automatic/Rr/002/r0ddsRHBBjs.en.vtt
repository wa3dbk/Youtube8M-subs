00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.950
 hello I'm in, although a nationwide 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.080
 active defense lawyer of the firm 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.760
 polin and master is my name 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.510
 christian solmecke i am a lawyer 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.130
 and partner of the cologne 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.850
 media law firm wild bender 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.160
 Solmecke 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.480
 and as we have already announced 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.359
 Let's face it today 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.010
 what can actually happen 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.320
 if I have a like-button third in 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.239
 contribute a facebook to the one 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.750
 insulting or defamatory the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.340
 nato 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.079
 Christian you are waiting for the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.719
 Civil matters say something yes 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.760
 and there was a case that that 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.550
 Labor Court of the House to negotiate 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.590
 had what had happened there was a one 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.690
 coworker of a coworker one 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.760
 Sparkasse which had a husband and 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.070
 this husband has something on facebook 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.289
 posted about the boss of the savings bank 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.070
 there and that was an offensive 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.430
 testify 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.640
 that was I have my savings 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.470
 pig on rechristened on heinz so called 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.630
 the boss of the savings bank there well 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.299
 At some point all pigs have to go to 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.450
 Butcher and now happened the following 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.700
 the wife who should the like button 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.189
 pressed and said ilike 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.470
 she likes that statement and the critical one 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.110
 it was that the wife at the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.840
 Sparkasse worked now but has 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.030
 the statement is not made by yourself 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.159
 but only ilike was pressed here and there 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.210
 So the labor court said so 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.250
 who sets such a statement of 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.020
 she also repeats that is like this 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.520
 if she had herself made the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.680
 I already found an impressive 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.570
 statement of the work equipment of the end 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.890
 she was not the termination 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.030
 legally effective because the lady already very much 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.380
 But the Sparkasse was very long 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.360
 that shows but you have to watch the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.979
 like button presses yes sure and that 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.850
 of course applies also in criminal law 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.159
 respect 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.630
 as far as I know there is still 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.100
 no criminal sorrow 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.780
 decisions that come with the question 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.880
 the punishability of printing a 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.549
 like-buttons with offensive content 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.409
 but it is clear when the 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.950
 labor court and the civil courts 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.000
 say 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.560
 the one of the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 button pushes the power 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.830
 where appropriate, the more protection 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.390
 infringing statement 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.890
 then of course threatens that the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.630
 criminal justice follows and then 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.100
 someday says yes with that you have yourself 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.940
 also punishable if then again 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.690
 a corresponding application for a fine 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.920
 posed 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.620
 the bad thing is also the like button 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.270
 which damned so quickly so where 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.010
 the people over all the like -button 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.530
 you can push that one can do it that way 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.840
 Maybe you can do that quickly 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.790
 again out boxing as a defender 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.890
 Announcing power was not at all 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.540
 reasonably thought of water 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.850
 you press or you have to already 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.920
 concentrate if you say yes me 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.060
 I want to confirm this statement and me 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.989
 press the like button now completely 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.310
 aware of well good it is so that a 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.560
 insult or even a libel 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.180
 an intentional offense is that is 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.370
 Of course I have to do that too 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.380
 have perceived offensive content 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.120
 that is certainly clear but that speaks 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.920
 of course a certain apparently 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.780
 always against the one who has the button 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.970
 has pressed and can defend 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.610
 you always only guess first read 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.600
 think about it and push it or miss it 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.520
 just refrain from it 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.500
 I have brought an example 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.700
 that turns to the like button that 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.739
 is again civil law nature 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.980
 and there it is the question whether bought 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.700
 User opinions may be 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.870
 anticompetitive kite because I imagine what 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.700
 one example so clearly 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.459
 Normally you are not allowed to 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.350
 buy positive reviews at de 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.670
 then one tends to the 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.739
 garden case in front of the upper court 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.900
 hamm there someone said ten percent 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.810
 discount if you rate me that positively 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.610
 was forbidden now the question was what is 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.290
 if a company says accept 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.829
 our lottery 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.900
 presses the like button like button 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.660
 and that is the requirement for the 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.950
 have to share games from mine 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.930
 so far I have always had that 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.850
 seen is also the purchased user 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.410
 opinion from my point of view is if you 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.000
 Somebody promises something to them 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.459
 participation in a competition 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.650
 if he values ​​the company positively 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.570
 namely by a like-button that 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.680
 also a purchased user opinion but 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.930
 here is the first one 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.060
 The court decision that says no the 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.760
 like-button of pressing the like-button 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.079
 is not synonymous with a 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.610
 buy recommendation 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.090
 I see that a bit 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.650
 differentiated the 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.690
 The consumer advocates are in there now 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.739
 the vocation went that want this 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.270
 Do not take judgment 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.660
 but it is relevant and needs to be there 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.470
 just take care yes that 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.710
 lit by the question poses or 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.870
 at least one and a lot in the 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.710
 I also swear in this area 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.110
 criminal I see first times 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.820
 no problem there would be at best in 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.880
 consider that still an arbitrary one 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.320
 Gaps of the like buttons a consumer 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.270
 it is simply deceived that is 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.400
 relatively far away from fraud 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.440
 So I would not say criminally 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.740
 risk but civil law of course 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.600
 beautiful 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.360
 So you see that things are so simple 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.220
 like the like button lawyers directly one 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.840
 can handle the whole program and 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.340
 if you liked that there we would 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.040
 We are very happy if the next 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.510
 again while you are in the 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.050
 common video blog production of 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.090
 taut block and wbs law.de v 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.889
 and the next time there is about the 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.210
 crack of iphones and that is 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.310
 certainly also a topic that far 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.330
 Thank you for watching and 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.330
 like to see you next time
