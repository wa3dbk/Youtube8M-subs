00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.380
 Hello dear friends with you cars 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.780
 mps 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.610
 my name is igor serjen and i'm not driving 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.580
 myself 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.890
 the middle is a new hatchback created on 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.300
 nissan sentra platform 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.460
 and he is going to Izhevsk in the same place 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.430
 wheelbase remains the same but the length 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:32.710
 bodywork has visibly declined and a separate 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:35.559
 the trunk was part of the cabin with us 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.230
 such cars for some reason do not favor 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.980
 look at the ratio gets 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.520
 and golf to bolt grants and viburnum or 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.260
 even some of the koreans like ari his 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.670
 or solaris that have 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.460
 ridge with film body has all the data 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.840
 Clearly the first priority myth 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.890
 and I like this type of body in 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.579
 technical plan 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.250
 absolutely no news former motor 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.070
 1 and 6 then 17 horsepower to choose from 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.750
 either mechanics 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.790
 stepless variator now I'm going 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.939
 on the variator 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.770
 for city driving ok out of town 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.770
 start to feel the lack of torque 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.960
 not only in the low zone but also in 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.930
 zone of medium speed in order to 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.659
 more or less accelerate on the rise either 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.969
 just go on overtaking 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.789
 have to push the gas to the floor and the motor 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.319
 spins up to at least 4000 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.960
 turns only later 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:40.319
 it appears more or less sane 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.109
 accelerating dynamics with mechanics situation 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.689
 similar but a little bit closer 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:48.890
 then numbers in fifth gear are over 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.810
 less can go at speeds after 100 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.869
 on the tachometer will be at least 3000 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.799
 variator speed is incredibly stretched 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.840
 then numbers 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.849
 ratio between extremes 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.890
 work variator about seven 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:04.560
 this way at a speed of one hundred euros in 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.709
 hour on your tachometer and just 2000 or 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.019
 two or more acceleration requires 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:13.230
 engine sound changes turnover 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.360
 jumped and acceleration will start noticeable 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.269
 delayed 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.590
 but look how the suspension works I 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:25.049
 Now in Georgia, where there is a squad fought and and 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.470
 frankly, the roads don't shine i don't 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.790
 I remember in Russia is so broken-down 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.470
 at least if it burns about Moscow 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.239
 area further course there will be 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.349
 the road I 'm sure of even worse quality 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.630
 but in Moscow all Moscow region 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:43.109
 most of the way is much better here 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.900
 they are all narrow enough broken-down you 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.810
 sensitive from shakes but for all 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.239
 Our trip 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.060
 friends more than two hundred kilometers this 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.400
 Suspension has never broken through so little 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.000
 a little swing is allowed 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.410
 but in comparison, for example, the slogan 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.270
 comparison with almost any cars 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.400
 which are specifically adapted for 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.960
 Russian conditions and 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.550
 Yes, and accordingly the sedan center 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.890
 probably one of the best 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.590
 highway is good enough road 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.800
 lumen declared at least 155 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.550
 millimeters that's the motor protection and when 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.200
 this can go long fast 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.740
 the main thing is not to wait on this car 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.300
 some kind of sports flood because 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.120
 he doesn't like them especially on the broken one 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.260
 the road is prevented from affecting the big moves 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.800
 suspension good ground clearance and 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.000
 drive almost no date 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.950
 It turns out at a very modest expense 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.990
 fuel precisely thanks to the stretched 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.130
 Variator city can be easily 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.990
 to keep within 8 liters on the highway 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.270
 66 half 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.830
 offers a choice of saying that a lot 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.560
 equipment options 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.110
 but they picked up a little strange 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.240
 For example, the stabilization system is already included 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.870
 in the basic version in which there is not even 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.860
 air conditioning and heated seats 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.200
 Now we are driving on the most expensive 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.230
 car each salon order 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.730
 impossible that senri will have and 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.500
 how the car is focused on more 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.540
 young audience to the maximum 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.170
 complete because the combined 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.640
 Salon backstage recorder say that 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.740
 it looks like alcantara 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.300
 see her clean somewhere Kara 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.120
 will be well washed she will be very 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.810
 wear resistant it is after all 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:35.860
 synthetic in cheaper versions upholstery 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.440
 also simpler but surprising is that 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.130
 all trim levels except the maximum 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.410
 hands on the village completely without skin 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.510
 just plain polyurethane leather 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.590
 trim selector machine and steering 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.770
 only top grade is available 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.290
 only snow is available cruise control 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.660
 which for me, for example, is very necessary for 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.890
 those who just simply ride a lot 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:04.410
 and both in the city and the contrast 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:07.650
 probably the most important advantage dido 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.460
 against the background of absolutely all competitors in 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.950
 segment c 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.500
 It is of course the size of the cabin line 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.170
 wheelbase she is one of the biggest 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.610
 but not the limit is exactly the same as 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.820
 for example mazda 3 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.240
 but at the same time the back seat is very very 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.910
 look a lot well here we are in the back 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.360
 despite the shorter length itself 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:33.330
 car place here is even more than in 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.350
 center thanks to a longer and higher 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.460
 roof lines instead for but as you see 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.770
 an incredible amount 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.340
 taxi driver's dream 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.180
 or a basketball player from the means of security 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:52.289
 comfort nothing unexpected there is only 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:54.740
 heating with steam heating 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.740
 cup holder 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:00.470
 I run on the Russian market utda 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:03.180
 there are two tasks at once 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.750
 the main thing is not only to attract those 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:11.220
 who bought the food of the previous generation but 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:13.530
 also lure customers and new ones for 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.530
 he had his own rather extensive and 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.729
 army of fans who rated 8 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.949
 spacious lounge 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:24.479
 but now unfortunately there was no notes 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:25.590
 really the hall turned out probably 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:28.620
 even more spacious 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.810
 but he struck the trunk of the truth in smaller but 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.820
 This problem was solved there. 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:36.229
 the whole sofa could be moved forward 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:39.539
 and back here unfortunately impossible but 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:42.600
 I repeat not the main advantage of time 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:43.440
 it could of course suspension and 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.370
 second turn 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.710
 very economical moderately powerful 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:52.470
 engine but here it is from in the mountain 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.610
 conditions on quite steep climbs 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.729
 sometimes 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.880
 visited fatal literally fatal 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:03.000
 lack of dynamics going on overtaking 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.919
 pushing the gas pedal to the floor version with 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.320
 CVT border is extremely extreme 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:09.210
 reluctantly and to pick up speed on 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:13.500
 mechanics had to support bards 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:16.139
 above 4000 turn of a separate case 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:19.949
 normal overclocking us simply 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:23.180
 I didn’t see with you Igor Sirin of the 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:23.180
 empire from good day bye
