00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:09.090
 we're here with a game 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.870
 between two great of the same 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.970
 Brazilian Alexandre is in european 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:22.910
 gravel and some oaks we smear 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:29.699
 games open in mogi of crosses 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:31.619
 clear opposition, but a great deal 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:41.579
 will roll in this position 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:46.800
 follow at this moment alexandre has 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:49.140
 its damage in the house and so it is in the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.960
 the moral and regional media of my 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.590
 employers and the position is clear in 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.590
 low 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:06.850
 the first great error of alexandre he 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.780
 I should not have abandoned the bible. 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.780
 now eight players 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:16.030
 if he keeps the domain of this bible 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:20.500
 Some of the banal work can not 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.030
 move only thinks about getting to 4 because 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.520
 will be caught 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.450
 so he can not move his 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:33.130
 because it opens the way for the 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.590
 garcez and alexandre valdano keeping the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:41.619
 domain 8 to 2 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:46.200
 augusto tries to enter diagonally through 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.200
 from asset alexandre jorge 8 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.909
 some entered in 1982 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.460
 If I like it well in general though I enter 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.100
 at the diagonal shit 2 alexandre 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.569
 young players 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:07.869
 Augustus can not get in the way. 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:12.819
 easy just keep track of this media 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:16.120
 regional and the tie is great throw 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.780
 alexandre tadeu will complicate the match 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.780
 accompany 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.030
 the only bid of works can only play in 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.890
 6 3 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.890
 any other bid loses the game 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:26.269
 the only bid of alexandre can only play 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.269
 innocence any other game bid 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:40.620
 in this position until you tie but return 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.959
 next move after move only giving you no 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.069
 test involvement without capture 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.440
 tied the game 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:51.510
 however the player has to prove this not 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.599
 it is a wide function 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.650
 the player has been finding and despite the 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:00.920
 to be sure that Alexandre 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.920
 we approach the 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:26.360
 In this moment some know only part f8 in 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:29.800
 seek to complicate the position to see if 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.800
 alexandre makes a mistake 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.590
 ae 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:53.240
 now leaving the game wrong to observe the 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:56.470
 the attitude of alan silva that is 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:00.949
 watching the father life there are also teams 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:05.590
 fiber is very concentrated in the 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.590
 departure did not notice this vibration 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:15.770
 Today was a pleasure 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:18.250
 if he was going to see that he has something for 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:23.889
 that everyone has to stay here 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.889
 ball diverted beautiful everything 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.970
 I am the queen as they are my good 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:43.370
 music now I've been through property 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:48.900
 carbon was only 12 won 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:51.390
 easily in the game and until brand is over 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:57.570
 some win would go that easily by playing 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:06:02.310
 dijon com alexandre cÃ©sar dani e joy 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:06.930
 some would play for 1 alexandre to capture 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:09.360
 and some young people not to be three of Europe 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:13.520
 alexandre capture and captures two name 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.520
