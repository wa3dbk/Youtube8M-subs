00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:17.560
 hello friends today I bring you a new 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.920
 tutorial on how to build a 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.230
 small jail for good for people 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.510
 in theory that which you do for 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.010
 servers are supposed to good the first 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.199
 what will we need to make a jail 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:33.489
 It's a claim I've obviously put 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:35.830
 is where free diamonds here and good a 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.800
 diamond in there supposed to talk 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.580
 there would be free diamond is supposed 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.930
 then what we had 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.930
 innocently it would be 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.930
 come here 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.930
 and steel 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.930
 and we will be locked up as you can see 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.270
 it's a very simple prison you see 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.520
 pretty to the league that is a jail 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.820
 nou enough for people or new 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.820
 Minecraft 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.460
 but good 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.990
 could do many ways could 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.670
 complicate yourself much more but you want a 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.619
 simple jail because we can do 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.690
 more complicated things as you see 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.159
 put a button to open it is worth it 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.869
 We waited about the same two 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.990
 others that is to treat our house by 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.530
 example but if we press this 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.530
 lever here 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.030
 this is fine so have it inside the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.440
 house leaves it out to be suspected 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:36.290
 less if we press that lever 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.270
 as much as we have been in now the 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.010
 jail will open us up like that would be like 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.720
 we had to leave it when we are 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.720
 when we leave home 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.310
 it's a very simple song to build 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.390
 basically explained what you have to 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.390
 it is nothing less 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.590
 and nothing good let's start 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.570
 first a very basic concept of 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:11.590
 the tribes of the ropes as you see here 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.960
 looks very little despite being in the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.810
 lawn that is giving less but here 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.960
 look at everything that looks white 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.270
 how do we solve this 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.990
 6 account through the water you do not see 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:28.440
 then disappear here what has been 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.570
 a waterfall of water and well the truth that 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.850
 you do not see until you go inside and 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.650
 up here practically 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.570
 suspicions already when you're already 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.820
 between the trap is to grace this 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.940
 trap although very simple print very simple 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.200
 gross but that is the grace of the trap 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.270
 then until you are not inside no 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.270
 You suspect that trap 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.590
 as for rest system that leads 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.680
 It's also quite simple, I've already 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.200
 said that it is a very simple trap by 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.159
 up as you see we simply have the 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.159
 rest here is worth 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.750
 nothing that comes from the obstacles of those of 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.670
 the hooks 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.330
 and good by means of a t flip flow that 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.330
 we have here like this is worth it here 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.770
 what we do is that this is closed 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.450
 ok we turn a pulse on two of the 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.640
 cuts or pulse in a continuous stream 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.220
 we will make this close we do that 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.250
 I'm up here get off and those here 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.000
 down here they come here they are sorry 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.630
 here, they go up 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.630
 you see 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.860
 as for the circuit it is a very circuit 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.630
 simple 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.200
 I already tell you, we simply have Teflon 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.050
 and up and the current that comes from the 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.030
 strings that has brought you here under 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.730
 over there 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.849
 more things to see 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:02.580
 after what I told you we have this 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.580
 button here to reset what 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.910
 but of course 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.100
 we do not want this always 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.630
 button can see the door is then 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.940
 I have added this the system here 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.549
 very simple simply to one of the 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.459
 currents that for example the one that do 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:24.150
 at the door or going up and down the 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:28.110
 pistons one of those is worth one that comes 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.360
 of fitflop what we do is we take it out 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.590
 over here and we interspersed here between 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.530
 half a piston with a block of this 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.730
 way it happens that what was 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:44.090
 doing here is when you flick flock 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.090
 of a pulse is worth now you will see 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.650
 second 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.280
 what we do that when you friction 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:58.460
 a pulse is worth a pulse of reston what 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.070
 will be that later block this 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.410
 preventing repetitive give again 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.910
 another pulse for gorosito is great if you 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.340
 I teach will be better understood 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.460
 As you can see, the flip flop is activated 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.530
 all the mechanism is valid and what we see is 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.330
 that feeds these pistons that 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.200
 close to the top ones that go down and 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.370
 down that go up 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.590
 now 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.580
 this the same current as used 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:28.699
 We use it to block Teflon 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.919
 this piston is blocked and then 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.630
 no matter how much we give to this 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.350
 Don 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.930
 nothing happens but at the moment in the 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.580
 what do we do 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:45.810
 the button has been enabled again 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.810
 and it opens and closes 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:51.490
 how are you seeing that is a system of 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:55.630
 I'm leaving the house 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:58.720
 for example I would put this here and 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:01.450
 well I know if someone good comes in I know 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.970
 will be canceled to be able to leave and I tell you 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.520
 it is very simple to build does not require 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.220
 neither 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:12.039
 practically nor that we do it because 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.720
 it's a pretty fat bullshit then 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.190
 well I do not know anybody tell me here 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.379
 he wants to destroy it we pass 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.680
 then I will do it but for now what 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:21.400
 a bullshit then I will not build 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.639
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.819
 the idea and the tutorial because this is more 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:29.440
 an idea that a tutorial can be 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:31.900
 improve in many ways if someone 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.699
 have a better one please do it to me 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.220
 know and well we will see what is 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:37.629
 it works and good friends until it has already 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.659
 come this pretty short tutorial 

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:44.220
 but interesting and nobody see you in the 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:44.220
 next video goodbye
