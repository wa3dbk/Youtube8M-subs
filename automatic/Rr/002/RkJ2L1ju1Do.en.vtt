httyd three let's go ahead I tried this
on<00:02:03.729> a<00:02:03.789> bunch<00:02:04.180> of<00:02:04.299> different<00:02:04.360> personal<00:02:05.170> my

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
on a bunch of different personal my

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.309 
on a bunch of different personal my
other<00:02:05.439> TV<00:02:05.939> my<00:02:06.939> bigger<00:02:07.180> TV<00:02:07.479> but<00:02:07.780> it<00:02:08.110> doesn't

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
other TV my bigger TV but it doesn't

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.719 
other TV my bigger TV but it doesn't
really<00:02:08.440> scale<00:02:08.830> up<00:02:09.099> it<00:02:09.220> doesn't<00:02:09.280> let<00:02:09.519> me<00:02:09.580> run

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
really scale up it doesn't let me run

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.559 
really scale up it doesn't let me run
the<00:02:09.819> app<00:02:09.940> because<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.269> pair<00:02:10.390> another

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
the app because the pair another

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.140 
the app because the pair another
resolution<00:02:10.810> is<00:02:11.140> too<00:02:11.290> low<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.730> there<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.120> go

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
resolution is too low so there you go

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.570 
resolution is too low so there you go
you<00:02:13.239> have<00:02:13.330> that<00:02:13.980> now<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.099> does<00:02:15.250> actually<00:02:15.370> work

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
you have that now it does actually work

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.180 
you have that now it does actually work
um<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.420> do<00:02:16.540> have<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.810> use<00:02:17.099> obviously<00:02:18.099> you

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
um you do have to use obviously you

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.979 
um you do have to use obviously you
can't<00:02:18.400> just<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:18.940> can<00:02:19.060> use<00:02:19.209> like<00:02:19.390> this<00:02:19.569> too<00:02:19.780> but

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989

controls aw S&amp;D that works perfectly
fine<00:02:36.069> I<00:02:36.400> know<00:02:37.269> you<00:02:37.330> probably<00:02:37.480> can't<00:02:37.750> see<00:02:38.049> that

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
fine I know you probably can't see that

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.830 
fine I know you probably can't see that
on<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.920> screen<00:02:39.190> but<00:02:40.000> now<00:02:40.209> we're<00:02:40.420> we<00:02:40.510> go<00:02:40.630> one

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
on the screen but now we're we go one

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.500 
on the screen but now we're we go one
step<00:02:40.959> further<00:02:41.280> we're<00:02:42.280> going<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.459> go<00:02:42.549> ahead<00:02:42.580> and

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
step further we're going to go ahead and

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.110 
step further we're going to go ahead and
if<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.319> have<00:02:44.500> an<00:02:44.620> xbox<00:02:44.799> controller<00:02:45.340> that

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
if you have an xbox controller that

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.870 
if you have an xbox controller that
would<00:02:46.239> be<00:02:46.330> great<00:02:46.630> because<00:02:47.519> that<00:02:48.519> is<00:02:48.670> going<00:02:48.730> to

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
would be great because that is going to

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.860 
would be great because that is going to
allow<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.450> actually<00:02:50.670> use<00:02:51.670> D<00:02:52.360> controller

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
allow you to actually use D controller

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.800 
allow you to actually use D controller
now<00:02:53.470> let's<00:02:54.430> take<00:02:54.519> a<00:02:54.579> second<00:02:54.910> because<00:02:55.000> it<00:02:55.569> has

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
now let's take a second because it has

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.059 
now let's take a second because it has
it<00:02:55.989> has<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.980> load<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.220> controller<00:02:57.549> and<00:02:59.040> now<00:03:00.040> I

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
it has to load the controller and now I

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.130 
it has to load the controller and now I
am<00:03:00.310> in<00:03:00.340> fact<00:03:00.730> using<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.569> controller<00:03:01.870> see<00:03:02.049> us

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
am in fact using the controller see us

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.110 
am in fact using the controller see us
moving<00:03:02.410> left<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:02.709> right<00:03:02.920> I<00:03:03.160> am<00:03:03.790> at<00:03:03.910> thank

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
moving left and right I am at thank

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.300 
moving left and right I am at thank
using<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.450> controller<00:03:04.980> go<00:03:05.980> ahead<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:06.190> play

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
using the controller go ahead and play

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.539 
using the controller go ahead and play
this<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:08.410> is<00:03:08.590> kind<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:09.010> weird<00:03:09.160> it's<00:03:09.340> kind<00:03:09.519> of

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
this it is kind of weird it's kind of

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:10.920 
this it is kind of weird it's kind of
like<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:09.790> feel<00:03:10.390> like<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> controller's

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
like I feel like the controller's

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.250 
like I feel like the controller's
lagging<00:03:11.319> just<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.560> bit<00:03:12.329> that<00:03:13.329> audio<00:03:13.720> does<00:03:13.989> work

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
lagging just a bit that audio does work

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.449 
lagging just a bit that audio does work
so<00:03:14.500> if<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.799> don't<00:03:14.889> hear<00:03:15.069> it<00:03:15.130> that's<00:03:15.310> just

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
so if you don't hear it that's just

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.849 
so if you don't hear it that's just
because<00:03:15.730> i<00:03:16.060> have<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:17.019> set<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:17.290> my<00:03:17.470> music<00:03:17.650> right

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
because i have it set to my music right

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.949 
because i have it set to my music right
now<00:03:17.920> but<00:03:18.280> it's<00:03:18.340> not<00:03:18.489> playing<00:03:18.670> right<00:03:18.970> now<00:03:19.000> the

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
now but it's not playing right now the

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.520
