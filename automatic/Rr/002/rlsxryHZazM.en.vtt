00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
or too weird and there's robot picking

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.379 
or too weird and there's robot picking
up<00:03:10.370> his<00:03:10.549> speed<00:03:10.849> but<00:03:11.000> he<00:03:11.060> wasn't<00:03:11.209> doing

anything too funky or weird with his
head<00:03:13.519> position<00:03:13.910> so<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.060> might<00:03:14.329> be<00:03:14.359> something

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
head position so that might be something

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.979 
head position so that might be something
that<00:03:14.750> we<00:03:14.900> work<00:03:15.079> on<00:03:15.519> having<00:03:16.519> cove<00:03:16.760> do<00:03:17.060> see<00:03:17.810> he's

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
that we work on having cove do see he's

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.300 
that we work on having cove do see he's

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
kind of picking up that chin so maybe

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.890 
kind of picking up that chin so maybe
we'll<00:03:19.849> just<00:03:19.910> have<00:03:20.090> him<00:03:20.180> on<00:03:20.299> rack<00:03:20.569> with<00:03:20.780> his

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
we'll play with it but the reason for

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.909 
we'll play with it but the reason for
that<00:03:25.579> is<00:03:25.880> that<00:03:26.319> dysfunction<00:03:27.319> in<00:03:27.440> one<00:03:27.620> spot
