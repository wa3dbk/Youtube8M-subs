00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.560 
it'll ask me if I want a pair and if I
do<00:01:04.489> there's<00:01:05.489> going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.880> code<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.420> you

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
do there's going to be a code that you

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.590 
do there's going to be a code that you
can<00:01:06.720> use<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.860> case<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.250> 2<00:01:08.549> 0<00:01:08.580> 7<00:01:09.150> 0<00:01:09.180> but

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
can use in this case it's 2 0 7 0 but

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.330 
can use in this case it's 2 0 7 0 but
this<00:01:09.720> code<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> randomly<00:01:10.560> generated<00:01:10.680> all<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
this code is randomly generated all the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.990 
this code is randomly generated all the
time<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.500> make<00:01:13.500> sure<00:01:13.530> that

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
time and it's just to make sure that

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.820 
time and it's just to make sure that
it's<00:01:15.000> paired<00:01:15.270> properly<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.080> put<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> code

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
it's paired properly so I put the code

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.039 
it's paired properly so I put the code
press<00:01:17.130> enter<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.759> now<00:01:17.939> I'm<00:01:18.299> paired<00:01:18.720> with<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
press enter and now I'm paired with the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.870 
press enter and now I'm paired with the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
keyboard I can go to notepad and in this

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.920
