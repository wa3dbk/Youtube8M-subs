00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
a lot of fun and the exclusive form of

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.590 
a lot of fun and the exclusive form of
the<00:01:14.530> forum<00:01:14.920> sneak<00:01:15.430> peek<00:01:15.640> for<00:01:15.760> this<00:01:15.820> says<00:01:16.270> that

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
the forum sneak peek for this says that

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.140 
the forum sneak peek for this says that
hog<00:01:17.320> riders<00:01:17.680> now<00:01:17.920> take<00:01:18.310> increased<00:01:18.880> damage

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
hog riders now take increased damage

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.630 
hog riders now take increased damage
from<00:01:19.450> giant<00:01:19.840> bombs<00:01:20.020> so<00:01:20.799> that's<00:01:20.979> pretty<00:01:21.340> huge

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
from giant bombs so that's pretty huge

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.850 
from giant bombs so that's pretty huge
considering<00:01:22.450> how<00:01:22.600> effective<00:01:23.350> hog<00:01:23.560> riders

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
considering how effective hog riders

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.649 
considering how effective hog riders
have<00:01:24.010> been<00:01:24.040> I<00:01:24.400> just<00:01:24.820> totally<00:01:25.030> clearing<00:01:25.570> out

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
have been I just totally clearing out

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.719 
have been I just totally clearing out
bases<00:01:26.110> so<00:01:26.650> I<00:01:26.680> really<00:01:27.040> think<00:01:27.220> this<00:01:27.369> is<00:01:27.520> going<00:01:27.640> to

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
bases so I really think this is going to

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.000 
bases so I really think this is going to
be<00:01:27.820> a<00:01:27.850> huge<00:01:28.210> debuff<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:29.260> the<00:01:29.380> hog<00:01:29.619> riders

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
be a huge debuff to the hog riders

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.280 
be a huge debuff to the hog riders
because<00:01:30.369> if<00:01:30.549> you<00:01:30.939> place<00:01:31.180> a<00:01:31.360> few<00:01:31.630> really<00:01:31.930> nicely

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
because if you place a few really nicely

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.249 
because if you place a few really nicely
placed<00:01:32.890> giant<00:01:33.640> bombs<00:01:33.850> you<00:01:34.570> aren't<00:01:35.020> going<00:01:35.170> to

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
placed giant bombs you aren't going to

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.690 
placed giant bombs you aren't going to
be<00:01:35.320> able<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.560> destroy<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:35.890> base<00:01:36.220> with<00:01:36.490> only

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
be able to destroy that base with only

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.429 
be able to destroy that base with only
hogs<00:01:37.030> so<00:01:37.689> I<00:01:37.720> don't<00:01:37.840> think<00:01:38.080> this<00:01:38.140> is<00:01:38.229> going<00:01:38.380> to

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
hogs so I don't think this is going to

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.170 
hogs so I don't think this is going to
totally<00:01:38.650> eliminate<00:01:38.920> a<00:01:39.310> hog<00:01:39.490> rider<00:01:39.729> some<00:01:40.000> just

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
totally eliminate a hog rider some just

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.690 
totally eliminate a hog rider some just
wrecking<00:01:40.840> basis<00:01:41.259> but<00:01:41.740> I<00:01:41.799> do<00:01:41.979> think<00:01:42.400> it's<00:01:42.580> gonna

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
wrecking basis but I do think it's gonna

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.300 
wrecking basis but I do think it's gonna
get<00:01:42.939> it<00:01:43.090> a<00:01:43.210> lot<00:01:43.720> harder<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:44.530> consistently<00:01:45.100> win

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
get it a lot harder to consistently win

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.490 
get it a lot harder to consistently win
with<00:01:45.490> only<00:01:45.729> using<00:01:46.119> hog<00:01:46.270> riders<00:01:46.630> so<00:01:47.110> I'm<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.290> fan

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
with only using hog riders so I'm a fan

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.950 
with only using hog riders so I'm a fan
of<00:01:47.530> that<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:48.700> kind<00:01:48.909> of<00:01:49.030> change<00:01:49.689> as<00:01:49.810> well

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
of that that kind of change as well

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.870 
of that that kind of change as well
already<00:01:50.920> so<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.189> next<00:01:51.369> thing<00:01:51.549> we're<00:01:51.759> going

already so the next thing we're going

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.359 
already so the next thing we're going
over<00:01:52.090> is<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.540> level<00:01:52.930> 8<00:01:53.049> Tesla<00:01:53.560> hidden<00:01:54.189> test

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
over is the level 8 Tesla hidden test

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.969 
over is the level 8 Tesla hidden test
level<00:01:54.670> 8<00:01:54.820> will<00:01:55.240> shock<00:01:55.600> your<00:01:55.840> enemies<00:01:56.320> so<00:01:56.950> a

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
level 8 will shock your enemies so a

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.940 
level 8 will shock your enemies so a
nice<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.579> nice<00:01:57.939> art<00:01:58.329> change<00:01:58.750> three<00:01:59.380> kinds<00:01:59.860> of

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
nice a nice art change three kinds of

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.100 
nice a nice art change three kinds of
electrical<00:02:00.430> things<00:02:01.090> at<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.420> top<00:02:01.659> of<00:02:01.689> the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
electrical things at the top of the

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.440 
electrical things at the top of the
Tesla<00:02:02.560> it<00:02:02.770> looks<00:02:03.250> pretty<00:02:03.520> cool<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:04.240> wire

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
Tesla it looks pretty cool the wire

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.069 
Tesla it looks pretty cool the wire
running<00:02:04.810> through<00:02:05.200> it<00:02:05.380> and<00:02:05.530> i<00:02:06.399> think<00:02:06.490> i<00:02:07.090> don't

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.079 
running through it and i think i don't

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:09.919 
running through it and i think i don't
know<00:02:08.140> how<00:02:08.289> i<00:02:08.319> feel<00:02:08.379> about<00:02:08.590> this<00:02:08.799> because<00:02:09.009> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
know how i feel about this because the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.390 
know how i feel about this because the
Pekka<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.590> pec<00:02:11.769> is<00:02:11.919> definitely<00:02:12.219> going<00:02:12.309> to

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
Pekka the pec is definitely going to

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.920 
Pekka the pec is definitely going to
take<00:02:12.549> a<00:02:12.700> lot<00:02:12.939> of<00:02:12.999> damage<00:02:13.299> with<00:02:13.510> this<00:02:13.569> gonna

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
take a lot of damage with this gonna

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.539 
take a lot of damage with this gonna
hurt<00:02:14.139> ballooning<00:02:14.590> strategy<00:02:14.980> as<00:02:15.069> well<00:02:15.249> because

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
hurt ballooning strategy as well because

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:16.470 
hurt ballooning strategy as well because
those<00:02:15.700> level<00:02:15.969> eight

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
those level eight

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.180 
those level eight
or<00:02:16.629> this<00:02:16.870> level<00:02:17.170> eight<00:02:17.290> Tesla's<00:02:17.739> are<00:02:17.890> gonna<00:02:17.980> do

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
or this level eight Tesla's are gonna do

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.899 
or this level eight Tesla's are gonna do
a<00:02:18.220> ton<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.819> damage<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:20.310> hopefully<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.519> build

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
a ton of damage and hopefully the build

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.149 
a ton of damage and hopefully the build
time<00:02:22.120> isn't<00:02:22.390> ridiculous<00:02:23.290> because<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.860> bill

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
time isn't ridiculous because the bill

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.430 
time isn't ridiculous because the bill
time<00:02:24.340> for<00:02:24.489> Tesla's<00:02:24.849> is<00:02:24.970> always<00:02:25.239> crazy<00:02:25.540> so

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
time for Tesla's is always crazy so

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.140 
time for Tesla's is always crazy so
getting<00:02:26.709> them<00:02:26.830> off<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.159> level<00:02:27.430> seven<00:02:27.700> was<00:02:27.849> was

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
getting them off to level seven was was

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.699 
getting them off to level seven was was
a<00:02:28.180> challenge<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:28.959> now<00:02:29.049> getting<00:02:29.230> up<00:02:29.379> to<00:02:29.560> eight

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
a challenge and now getting up to eight

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.740 
a challenge and now getting up to eight
will<00:02:30.190> be<00:02:30.310> very<00:02:30.670> very<00:02:31.000> hard<00:02:31.209> as<00:02:31.360> well<00:02:31.540> so

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
will be very very hard as well so

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.570 
will be very very hard as well so
hopefully<00:02:31.900> they<00:02:32.290> lessen<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.709> build<00:02:32.920> time<00:02:33.099> but

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
hopefully they lessen the build time but

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.130 
hopefully they lessen the build time but
I<00:02:33.610> do<00:02:33.730> like<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.060> art<00:02:34.180> changes<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:34.959> think

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
I do like the art changes and I think

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.229 
I do like the art changes and I think
it's<00:02:35.260> going<00:02:35.349> to<00:02:35.440> be<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.590> cool<00:02:35.830> upgrade<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:37.120> the

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
it's going to be a cool upgrade to the

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.180 
it's going to be a cool upgrade to the
defense<00:02:37.690> so<00:02:38.290> I'm<00:02:38.410> excited<00:02:38.650> about<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.980> late

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
defense so I'm excited about the late

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.830 
defense so I'm excited about the late
Tesla<00:02:39.519> but<00:02:40.000> as<00:02:40.090> soon<00:02:40.180> as<00:02:40.239> I<00:02:40.390> did<00:02:40.569> see<00:02:40.750> the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
Tesla but as soon as I did see the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.630 
Tesla but as soon as I did see the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
we be strategy the Golem wizard which

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.819 
we be strategy the Golem wizard which
strategy<00:02:49.989> is<00:02:50.079> kind<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.349> all<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.650> rage<00:02:50.799> right

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
strategy is kind of all the rage right

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.069 
strategy is kind of all the rage right
now<00:02:51.069> so<00:02:51.790> as<00:02:51.970> soon<00:02:52.060> as<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.360> Tesla<00:02:52.720> came<00:02:52.810> out<00:02:52.989> it

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
now so as soon as the Tesla came out it

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.720 
now so as soon as the Tesla came out it
was<00:02:53.110> like<00:02:53.260> you're<00:02:53.530> just<00:02:53.680> pushing<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.220> push

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
was like you're just pushing the push

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.190 
was like you're just pushing the push
them<00:02:54.879> to<00:02:54.940> go<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.060> strategy<00:02:55.510> even<00:02:55.599> down<00:02:55.900> farther

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
them to go I strategy even down farther

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.740 
them to go I strategy even down farther
it<00:02:56.410> doesn't<00:02:56.650> make<00:02:56.739> sense<00:02:56.799> so<00:02:57.489> then<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:58.000> was<00:02:58.510> kind

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.030 
there's clash gameplay in the background
for<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.180> lot<00:04:10.389> of<00:04:10.569> this<00:04:10.750> and<00:04:11.019> I<00:04:11.440> actually<00:04:11.650> have<00:04:12.010> a

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
for a lot of this and I actually have a

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.159 
for a lot of this and I actually have a
different<00:04:12.430> recorded<00:04:12.879> method<00:04:13.180> so<00:04:13.540> I<00:04:13.569> think<00:04:13.720> it

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
different recorded method so I think it

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.960 
different recorded method so I think it
came<00:04:14.349> out<00:04:14.500> really<00:04:14.560> crystal<00:04:15.280> clear<00:04:15.519> and<00:04:15.549> it's

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
came out really crystal clear and it's

came out really crystal clear and it's
full<00:04:16.209> screen<00:04:16.510> so<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.810> video<00:04:17.019> isn't<00:04:17.380> stretched

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739
