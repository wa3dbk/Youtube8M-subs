00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
in the update video which is how to take

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.460 
in the update video which is how to take
condense<00:00:14.730> notes<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.719> make<00:00:15.870> your<00:00:16.080> overall

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
condense notes to make your overall

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.560 
condense notes to make your overall
studying<00:00:16.980> more<00:00:17.340> efficient<00:00:17.910> more<00:00:18.449> effective

studying more efficient more effective

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.170 
studying more efficient more effective
and<00:00:19.230> really<00:00:20.130> just<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.400> better<00:00:20.670> use<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:20.970> your

did an undergrad which was a very
probably<00:01:05.010> older<00:01:05.460> method<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.750> took<00:01:06.840> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
probably older method and it just took a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.740 
probably older method and it just took a
lot<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.110> time<00:01:07.439> was<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.430> sit<00:01:08.640> there<00:01:08.880> read<00:01:09.479> all<00:01:09.720> of

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.350 
lot of time was to sit there read all of
it<00:01:10.040> think<00:01:11.040> about<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.460> I'm<00:01:11.580> going<00:01:11.610> along<00:01:12.060> try

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
it think about it as I'm going along try

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.330 
it think about it as I'm going along try
to<00:01:12.420> memorize<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.110> make<00:01:13.409> flashcards<00:01:14.159> when<00:01:14.310> I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
to memorize it make flashcards when I

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.789 
to memorize it make flashcards when I
need<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.790> write<00:01:15.180> down<00:01:15.360> some<00:01:15.600> notes<00:01:15.799> mainly

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
need to write down some notes mainly

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.260 
need to write down some notes mainly
just<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> book<00:01:17.460> like<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> Marchant

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
just in the book like in the Marchant

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.899 
just in the book like in the Marchant
and<00:01:18.479> do<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> lot<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.869> highlighting<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.759> would

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
and do a lot of highlighting and I would

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.999 
and do a lot of highlighting and I would
read<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.240> all<00:01:21.360> take<00:01:21.810> my<00:01:21.960> time<00:01:22.170> go<00:01:22.500> Lou<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.920> know

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
read it all take my time go Lou you know

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.880 
read it all take my time go Lou you know
go<00:01:23.460> into<00:01:23.610> detail<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:25.170> look<00:01:25.799> at

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
go into detail and then look at

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.010 
go into detail and then look at
everything<00:01:26.159> again<00:01:26.430> when<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.509> comes<00:01:27.689> time<00:01:27.960> for

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
everything again when it comes time for

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.830 
everything again when it comes time for
the<00:01:28.320> exams<00:01:29.060> obviously<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.329> not<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.540> most

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the exams obviously this is not the most

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.109 
the exams obviously this is not the most
efficient<00:01:31.560> use<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.920> your<00:01:31.979> time<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:32.700> great<00:01:32.909> if

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
efficient use of your time it's great if

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.280 
efficient use of your time it's great if
you<00:01:33.210> want<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.420> spend<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.780> lot<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.170> time

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you want to spend a lot of your time

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.410 
you want to spend a lot of your time
studying<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.100> don't<00:01:35.280> mind<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.329> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
studying and you don't mind but if you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.670 
studying and you don't mind but if you
want<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.689> be<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> little<00:01:36.930> bit<00:01:37.049> more<00:01:37.170> effective

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
want to be a little bit more effective

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.550 
want to be a little bit more effective
the<00:01:38.579> nice<00:01:38.790> thing<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.290> have

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the nice thing to do is to just not have

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.679 
the nice thing to do is to just not have
to<00:01:40.920> go<00:01:41.040> through<00:01:41.220> all<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:42.000> material<00:01:42.150> again

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
to go through all the material again

are going to be on the exam or are key
to<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.790> course<00:02:30.120> there's<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.810> lot<00:02:30.960> of<00:02:31.080> filler

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
to the course there's a lot of filler

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.050 
to the course there's a lot of filler
and<00:02:31.530> text<00:02:31.800> books<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.130> lectures<00:02:32.460> so<00:02:32.910> you'd

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
and text books and lectures so you'd

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.060 
and text books and lectures so you'd
have<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.420> kind<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.630> filter<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.110> out<00:02:34.170> and

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
have to kind of filter that out and

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.860 
have to kind of filter that out and
that's<00:02:35.760> exactly<00:02:35.940> what<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.510> do<00:02:36.630> when<00:02:36.780> you

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
that's exactly what you do when you

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.690 
that's exactly what you do when you
study<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.290> it's<00:02:37.410> nothing<00:02:37.530> new<00:02:38.010> when<00:02:38.550> you're

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
study so it's nothing new when you're

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.890 
study so it's nothing new when you're
studying<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:39.150> learn<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.480> material<00:02:39.810> and

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
studying you learn the material and

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.690 
studying you learn the material and
you're<00:02:40.080> going<00:02:40.350> through<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.740> now<00:02:40.890> instead<00:02:41.580> of

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
you're going through it now instead of

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.580 
you're going through it now instead of
just<00:02:41.880> trying<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.150> memorize<00:02:42.570> all<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:43.050> write

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
just trying to memorize all of it write

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.590 
just trying to memorize all of it write
it<00:02:43.770> down<00:02:44.040> while<00:02:44.400> you're<00:02:44.550> doing<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.420> aids

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
it down while you're doing it that aids

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.670 
it down while you're doing it that aids
you<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:45.900> two<00:02:46.080> ways

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
you in two ways

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.710 
you in two ways
one<00:02:47.100> it's<00:02:47.430> going<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.610> help<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.970> memorize<00:02:48.300> it

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
one it's going to help you memorize it

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.910 
one it's going to help you memorize it
better<00:02:48.900> initially<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.650> you're<00:02:49.770> going<00:02:49.890> to

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
better initially so you're going to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.140 
better initially so you're going to
learn<00:02:50.070> things<00:02:50.310> because<00:02:50.640> you're<00:02:50.760> writing<00:02:51.060> it

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
learn things because you're writing it

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.550 
learn things because you're writing it
down<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.540> you're<00:02:51.690> slowing<00:02:52.110> yourself<00:02:52.230> down

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
down and you're slowing yourself down

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.410 
down and you're slowing yourself down
and<00:02:52.980> second<00:02:53.760> you're<00:02:53.880> going<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.060> have<00:02:54.270> these

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
and second you're going to have these

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.270 
and second you're going to have these
notes<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:55.140> are<00:02:55.260> condensed<00:02:55.800> that<00:02:55.860> contain

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
notes that are condensed that contain

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.220 
notes that are condensed that contain
all<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.610> critical<00:02:57.030> information<00:02:57.210> that<00:02:58.080> you

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
all the critical information that you

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.250 
all the critical information that you
then<00:02:58.530> review<00:02:59.040> later<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.840> that's<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.050> key

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
then review later and that's the key

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.950 
then review later and that's the key
when<00:03:02.070> it<00:03:02.100> comes<00:03:02.190> time<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.880> review<00:03:03.270> for<00:03:03.540> an<00:03:03.600> exam

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
when it comes time to review for an exam

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.740 
when it comes time to review for an exam
most<00:03:04.290> often<00:03:04.730> repetition<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:05.940> key<00:03:06.300> the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
most often repetition is the key the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.960 
most often repetition is the key the
more<00:03:07.020> you<00:03:07.230> review<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:08.220> better<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.610> know<00:03:08.790> it

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
more you review the better you know it

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.699 
more you review the better you know it
so<00:03:09.510> instead<00:03:09.990> of<00:03:10.050> going<00:03:10.260> through<00:03:10.410> and

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
so instead of going through and

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.949 
so instead of going through and
reviewing<00:03:11.010> all<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.820> content<00:03:12.450> again<00:03:12.630> all

notes all the handouts which at some
point<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.150> know<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.300> can<00:03:21.840> do<00:03:21.959> in<00:03:22.080> an

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
point you know you can do in an

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.050 
point you know you can do in an
undergrad<00:03:22.590> but<00:03:22.830> you<00:03:23.160> won't<00:03:23.640> be<00:03:23.730> able<00:03:23.820> to<00:03:23.940> do<00:03:24.000> it

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
undergrad but you won't be able to do it

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.660 
undergrad but you won't be able to do it
later<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:25.170> it's<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.680> really<00:03:25.890> big<00:03:26.220> use<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.580> your

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
later and it's a really big use of your

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.160 
later and it's a really big use of your
time<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.150> instead<00:03:27.330> of<00:03:27.390> going<00:03:27.840> through

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
time so instead of going through

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.800 
time so instead of going through
everything<00:03:28.650> again<00:03:28.980> just<00:03:29.970> all<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:30.390> have<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.660> do

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
everything again just all you have to do

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.270 
everything again just all you have to do
is<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.080> have<00:03:31.230> these<00:03:31.410> like<00:03:31.739> you<00:03:31.950> know<00:03:32.040> five<00:03:32.250> or

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
is you have these like you know five or

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.449 
is you have these like you know five or
six<00:03:32.610> pages<00:03:32.850> of<00:03:33.060> condense<00:03:33.480> notes<00:03:33.750> per<00:03:33.989> lecture

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
six pages of condense notes per lecture

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.650 
six pages of condense notes per lecture
and<00:03:35.459> you<00:03:35.580> just<00:03:35.700> go<00:03:35.880> through<00:03:36.180> those<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.540> you

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
and you just go through those and you

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.350 
and you just go through those and you
just<00:03:36.750> review<00:03:37.170> them<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.440> review<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.940> that

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
just review them and review and that

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.880 
just review them and review and that
repetition<00:03:39.570> is<00:03:39.989> really<00:03:40.410> going<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.680> get<00:03:40.800> the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
repetition is really going to get the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.140 
repetition is really going to get the
information<00:03:41.010> in<00:03:41.520> there<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:41.850> you're<00:03:41.940> going<00:03:42.060> to

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
information in there and you're going to

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.510 
information in there and you're going to
be<00:03:42.209> thinking<00:03:42.540> about<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:43.890> course<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.340> key

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
be thinking about it of course the key

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.810 
be thinking about it of course the key
here<00:03:44.910> is<00:03:44.940> having<00:03:45.330> good<00:03:45.480> notes<00:03:46.040> so<00:03:47.040> one<00:03:47.580> thing

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
here is having good notes so one thing

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.180 
here is having good notes so one thing
that's<00:03:48.000> kind<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.300> somewhat<00:03:49.140> fearful<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.920> well

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
that's kind of somewhat fearful is well

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.650 
that's kind of somewhat fearful is well
what<00:03:50.370> if<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.550> don't<00:03:50.610> have<00:03:50.790> good<00:03:51.030> notes<00:03:51.209> and<00:03:51.510> I'm

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
what if I don't have good notes and I'm

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.240 
what if I don't have good notes and I'm
studying<00:03:52.170> things<00:03:52.650> that<00:03:52.830> aren't<00:03:53.010> really<00:03:53.130> all

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
studying things that aren't really all

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.400 
studying things that aren't really all
that<00:03:53.430> useful<00:03:53.690> well<00:03:54.690> that's<00:03:54.930> something<00:03:55.140> you

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
that useful well that's something you

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.850 
that useful well that's something you
have<00:03:55.770> to<00:03:56.270> figure<00:03:57.270> out<00:03:57.630> because<00:03:58.140> what<00:03:58.680> you're

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
have to figure out because what you're

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.080 
have to figure out because what you're
writing<00:03:59.040> on<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.340> notes<00:03:59.520> is<00:03:59.760> what<00:03:59.910> you're

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
writing on the notes is what you're

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.630 
writing on the notes is what you're
really<00:04:00.239> memorizing<00:04:00.989> when<00:04:01.110> you're<00:04:01.230> reading

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
really memorizing when you're reading

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.700 
really memorizing when you're reading
something<00:04:01.910> over<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:03.080> when<00:04:03.319> you're<00:04:03.440> reviewing

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
something over and when you're reviewing

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.010 
something over and when you're reviewing
it<00:04:04.010> again<00:04:04.220> for<00:04:04.460> an<00:04:04.520> exam<00:04:04.850> so<00:04:05.390> you're<00:04:05.660> you

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
it again for an exam so you're you

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.770 
it again for an exam so you're you
already<00:04:06.440> know<00:04:06.709> what<00:04:07.280> to<00:04:07.459> read<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:08.060> you

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
already know what to read and you

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.420 
already know what to read and you
automatically<00:04:09.650> dis<00:04:09.950> still<00:04:10.190> what's

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
automatically dis still what's

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.830 
automatically dis still what's
information<00:04:11.000> because<00:04:11.209> it<00:04:11.330> gets<00:04:11.480> stored<00:04:11.690> in

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
information because it gets stored in

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.440 
information because it gets stored in
your<00:04:11.930> mind<00:04:12.110> now<00:04:12.830> just<00:04:13.100> instead<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.120> just

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
your mind now just instead of just

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.360 
your mind now just instead of just
storing<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:14.959> write<00:04:15.200> it<00:04:15.380> down<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:15.770> mean<00:04:15.950> that's

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
storing it write it down I mean that's

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.460 
storing it write it down I mean that's
not<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:16.640> best<00:04:16.820> advice<00:04:17.120> but<00:04:17.150> I'm<00:04:17.989> sure<00:04:18.350> you

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
not the best advice but I'm sure you

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.990 
not the best advice but I'm sure you
don't<00:04:18.530> you'll<00:04:18.739> figure<00:04:18.950> that<00:04:19.040> that<00:04:19.579> that's<00:04:19.820> not

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
don't you'll figure that that that's not

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.550 
don't you'll figure that that that's not
the<00:04:20.150> difficult<00:04:20.540> part<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:20.840> difficult<00:04:21.169> part<00:04:21.380> is

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
the difficult part the difficult part is

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.560 
the difficult part the difficult part is
just<00:04:21.980> going<00:04:22.310> through<00:04:22.340> spending<00:04:22.850> investing

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
just going through spending investing

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.300 
just going through spending investing
all<00:04:23.660> that<00:04:23.840> time<00:04:24.080> learning<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:24.650> material<00:04:25.100> and

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
all that time learning the material and

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.330 
all that time learning the material and
writing<00:04:25.970> it<00:04:26.060> down<00:04:26.210> do<00:04:26.930> not<00:04:27.140> write<00:04:27.470> down<00:04:27.500> things

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
writing it down do not write down things

writing it down do not write down things
are<00:04:28.640> easy<00:04:28.820> to<00:04:29.030> remember<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.510> know<00:04:29.600> things

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
are easy to remember you know things

remember it in a week and that's the
whole<00:04:45.740> point<00:04:45.980> of<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.100> notes

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
whole point of the notes

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.280 
whole point of the notes
it<00:04:46.580> keeps<00:04:46.910> repetition<00:04:47.600> going<00:04:47.870> all<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.080> things

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
it keeps repetition going all the things

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.380 
it keeps repetition going all the things
that<00:04:48.530> you<00:04:48.740> won't<00:04:48.919> remember<00:04:49.160> and<00:04:49.640> that<00:04:50.300> are

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
that you won't remember and that are

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.870 
that you won't remember and that are
probably<00:04:50.750> that<00:04:50.930> are<00:04:50.960> obviously<00:04:51.440> important<00:04:51.880> so

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
probably that are obviously important so

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.720 
probably that are obviously important so
that's<00:04:53.060> a<00:04:53.240> new<00:04:53.810> style<00:04:54.200> of<00:04:54.350> studying<00:04:54.830> it's

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
that's a new style of studying it's

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.820 
that's a new style of studying it's
probably<00:04:56.060> an<00:04:56.120> old<00:04:56.450> style<00:04:56.960> of<00:04:57.260> not<00:04:57.470> even<00:04:57.650> sure

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
probably an old style of not even sure

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.830 
probably an old style of not even sure
but<00:04:58.370> it's<00:04:58.490> something<00:04:58.640> that<00:04:58.760> I<00:04:58.880> came<00:04:58.940> across<00:04:59.390> I

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
but it's something that I came across I

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.570 
but it's something that I came across I
wish<00:05:00.320> I<00:05:00.500> would<00:05:00.650> have<00:05:00.680> known<00:05:00.919> that<00:05:00.950> undergrad

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
wish I would have known that undergrad

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.890 
wish I would have known that undergrad
that<00:05:01.669> would<00:05:01.790> have<00:05:01.880> saved<00:05:02.030> me<00:05:02.210> a<00:05:02.240> lot<00:05:02.330> of<00:05:02.570> time

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
that would have saved me a lot of time

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.350 
that would have saved me a lot of time
and<00:05:03.260> I<00:05:04.190> think<00:05:04.430> it's<00:05:04.520> a<00:05:04.580> really<00:05:04.760> effective<00:05:04.940> tool

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
and I think it's a really effective tool

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.600 
and I think it's a really effective tool
because<00:05:05.660> repetition<00:05:06.290> is<00:05:06.470> key<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:07.220> more<00:05:07.430> you

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
because repetition is key the more you

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.550 
because repetition is key the more you
review<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.300> material<00:05:08.720> the<00:05:08.810> more<00:05:08.990> you<00:05:09.169> see<00:05:09.530> it

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
review the material the more you see it

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.710 
review the material the more you see it
the<00:05:09.950> better<00:05:10.310> you're<00:05:10.520> going<00:05:10.640> to<00:05:10.700> be<00:05:10.760> and<00:05:11.150> that

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
the better you're going to be and that

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.990 
the better you're going to be and that
really<00:05:11.990> goes<00:05:12.169> off<00:05:12.380> a<00:05:12.410> principle<00:05:13.070> of<00:05:13.220> a<00:05:13.700> lot<00:05:13.910> of

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
really goes off a principle of a lot of

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.240 
really goes off a principle of a lot of
mistakes<00:05:14.390> people<00:05:14.630> make<00:05:14.780> during<00:05:15.169> tests<00:05:15.650> that

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
mistakes people make during tests that

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.980 
mistakes people make during tests that
they'll<00:05:16.760> get<00:05:16.940> like<00:05:17.090> a<00:05:17.180> test<00:05:17.419> back<00:05:17.630> and<00:05:17.900> they'll

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
they'll get like a test back and they'll

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.120 
they'll get like a test back and they'll
wonder<00:05:18.140> why<00:05:18.380> I<00:05:18.410> didn't<00:05:18.740> do<00:05:18.830> all<00:05:18.950> that<00:05:18.979> well

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
wonder why I didn't do all that well

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.640 
wonder why I didn't do all that well
well<00:05:20.030> then<00:05:20.840> you<00:05:20.960> know<00:05:21.050> you<00:05:21.110> ask<00:05:21.320> that<00:05:21.440> person

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
well then you know you ask that person

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.320 
well then you know you ask that person
well<00:05:21.979> how<00:05:22.100> well<00:05:22.280> did<00:05:22.460> you<00:05:22.520> know<00:05:22.580> the<00:05:22.820> material

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
well how well did you know the material

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.909 
well how well did you know the material
and<00:05:23.600> they'll<00:05:24.169> say<00:05:24.350> well<00:05:24.530> it<00:05:24.620> was<00:05:24.650> pretty

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
and they'll say well it was pretty

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.400 
and they'll say well it was pretty
familiar<00:05:25.360> well<00:05:26.360> they're<00:05:26.540> you<00:05:26.780> know<00:05:26.840> are<00:05:27.080> there
