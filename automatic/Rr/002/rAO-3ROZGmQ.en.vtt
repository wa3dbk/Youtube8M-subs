00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.899 

when<00:00:00.329> when<00:00:00.780> I<00:00:00.810> was<00:00:01.020> studying<00:00:01.140> economics<00:00:01.909> there

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
when when I was studying economics there

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.690 
when when I was studying economics there
was<00:00:03.300> it's<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.110> very<00:00:04.319> funny<00:00:04.470> subject<00:00:05.069> there's

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
was it's a very funny subject there's

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.340 
was it's a very funny subject there's
there's<00:00:05.970> lots<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.210> different<00:00:06.629> areas<00:00:06.779> that<00:00:07.259> we

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
there's lots of different areas that we

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.190 
there's lots of different areas that we
were<00:00:07.470> looking<00:00:07.500> at<00:00:07.890> I<00:00:08.099> really<00:00:09.090> enjoyed<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.960> the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
were looking at I really enjoyed the the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.680 
were looking at I really enjoyed the the
philosophical<00:00:11.070> humanistic<00:00:11.730> side<00:00:12.269> of

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
philosophical humanistic side of

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.330 
philosophical humanistic side of
economics<00:00:13.530> unfortunately<00:00:14.070> there<00:00:14.190> wasn't

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
economics unfortunately there wasn't

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.810 
economics unfortunately there wasn't
actually<00:00:14.700> much<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.859> it<00:00:16.859> started<00:00:17.490> well

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
actually much of that it started well

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.550 
actually much of that it started well
everything<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.690> was<00:00:18.869> learning<00:00:19.020> really

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
everything that I was learning really

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.390 
everything that I was learning really
was<00:00:19.920> how<00:00:20.580> can<00:00:20.820> we<00:00:20.970> mathematically<00:00:22.400> put

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
was how can we mathematically put

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.540 
was how can we mathematically put
together<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.820> formula<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.750> model<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.740> scenario

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
together a formula to model a scenario

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.750 
together a formula to model a scenario
that<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:26.880> we<00:00:27.269> know<00:00:27.480> happens<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.380> try<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.519> come

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
that we we know happens and try and come

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.080 
that we we know happens and try and come
up<00:00:29.789> with<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> reason<00:00:30.890> based<00:00:31.890> upon<00:00:32.160> some

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
up with a reason based upon some

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.030 
up with a reason based upon some
assumptions<00:00:33.719> which<00:00:33.960> just<00:00:34.260> don't<00:00:34.440> really<00:00:34.829> bear

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
assumptions which just don't really bear

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.560 
assumptions which just don't really bear
any<00:00:35.309> reality<00:00:35.880> whatsoever<00:00:36.800> so<00:00:37.800> based<00:00:38.190> upon<00:00:38.570> I

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
any reality whatsoever so based upon I

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.049 
any reality whatsoever so based upon I
found<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.379> really<00:00:40.440> really<00:00:40.800> hard<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.520> relate<00:00:41.850> to

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
found it really really hard to relate to

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.690 
found it really really hard to relate to
this<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.480> as<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.320> mentioned<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.829> really<00:00:44.430> spent

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
this and as I mentioned I really spent

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.630 
this and as I mentioned I really spent
most<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.120> my<00:00:45.180> time<00:00:46.010> getting<00:00:47.010> good<00:00:47.309> at<00:00:47.430> maths

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
most of my time getting good at maths

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.540 
most of my time getting good at maths
and<00:00:48.000> trying<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.300> pass<00:00:48.480> exams<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.550> really

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
and trying to pass exams and really

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.729 
and trying to pass exams and really
building<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.570> lot<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.809> my<00:00:51.989> experience<00:00:52.530> outside

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
building a lot of my experience outside

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.680 
building a lot of my experience outside
of<00:00:53.039> economics<00:00:53.730> which<00:00:53.940> didn't<00:00:54.239> really<00:00:54.420> help<00:00:54.510> me

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
of economics which didn't really help me

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.540 
of economics which didn't really help me
to<00:00:54.840> pass<00:00:55.020> my<00:00:55.260> exams<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:57.109> it<00:00:58.109> just<00:00:58.800> seems<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
to pass my exams so it just seems the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.630 
to pass my exams so it just seems the
economics<00:01:00.300> lost<00:01:01.010> itself<00:01:02.010> from<00:01:02.340> what<00:01:02.550> it

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
economics lost itself from what it

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.750 
economics lost itself from what it
originally<00:01:02.760> was<00:01:03.500> when<00:01:04.500> they<00:01:04.769> seemed<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.369> try

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
originally was when they seemed to try

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.580 
originally was when they seemed to try
and<00:01:05.939> introduce<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.600> lot<00:01:06.720> more<00:01:06.869> mass<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.470> make

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and introduce a lot more mass and make

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.880 
and introduce a lot more mass and make
it<00:01:07.740> more<00:01:07.860> scientific<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.439> it<00:01:10.439> just<00:01:10.650> seemed<00:01:10.799> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
it more scientific and it just seemed to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.250 
it more scientific and it just seemed to
lose<00:01:11.010> itself<00:01:11.340> there<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.030> find<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.659> hard<00:01:12.960> to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
lose itself there and I find it hard to

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.410 
lose itself there and I find it hard to
actually<00:01:13.439> believe<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
actually believe that this is the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.289 
actually believe that this is the
foundation<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.380> how<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:16.979> actually<00:01:17.580> run<00:01:18.000> our

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
foundation for how we actually run our

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.640 
foundation for how we actually run our
economy<00:01:20.090> originally<00:01:21.090> some<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.540> my<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.380> people

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
economy originally some of my the people

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.670 
economy originally some of my the people
that<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.830> became<00:01:23.070> most<00:01:23.400> interested<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.210> was<00:01:24.479> I

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
that I became most interested in was I

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.219 
that I became most interested in was I
admired<00:01:25.680> Milton<00:01:26.100> Friedman's<00:01:26.549> work<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.780> say

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
admired Milton Friedman's work so I say

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.830 
admired Milton Friedman's work so I say
I<00:01:28.259> spent<00:01:28.619> most<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:29.040> my<00:01:29.100> time<00:01:29.189> at<00:01:29.490> University

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
I spent most of my time at University

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.149 
I spent most of my time at University
very<00:01:30.840> much<00:01:31.020> from<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.350> free<00:01:31.590> marketeer<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
very much from a free marketeer a

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.780 
very much from a free marketeer a
capitalist<00:01:33.020> because<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.229> k<00:01:34.290> i<00:01:34.650> was<00:01:35.159> extremely

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
capitalist because I k i was extremely

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.910 
capitalist because I k i was extremely
interested<00:01:36.570> as<00:01:36.689> an<00:01:36.780> entrepreneur<00:01:37.049> myself<00:01:37.470> in

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
interested as an entrepreneur myself in

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.929 
interested as an entrepreneur myself in
business<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:40.140> naturally<00:01:40.640> his<00:01:41.640> his

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
business and so naturally his his

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.080 
business and so naturally his his
philosophy<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.840> gravitated<00:01:43.649> for<00:01:44.430> me<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:44.880> I

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
philosophy just gravitated for me but I

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.539 
philosophy just gravitated for me but I
started<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.990> notice<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.619> few<00:01:46.799> things<00:01:46.860> which<00:01:47.310> are

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
started to notice a few things which are

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.969 
started to notice a few things which are
as<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:48.270> started<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.869> understand<00:01:49.350> economics<00:01:49.860> a

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
as I started to understand economics a

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.830 
as I started to understand economics a
little<00:01:50.189> bit<00:01:50.340> more<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.549> how<00:01:50.880> how<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.450> money

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
little bit more and how how the money

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.020 
little bit more and how how the money
system<00:01:52.140> works<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:53.340> didn't<00:01:53.610> quite<00:01:53.729> add<00:01:54.000> up

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
system works that didn't quite add up

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.660 
system works that didn't quite add up
for<00:01:54.329> me<00:01:54.409> and<00:01:55.409> started<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.009> notice<00:01:56.159> some<00:01:56.640> things

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
for me and started to notice some things

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.420 
for me and started to notice some things
which<00:01:57.469> just<00:01:58.469> seemed<00:01:58.680> completely

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
which just seemed completely

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.370 
which just seemed completely
inappropriate<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.420> be<00:02:00.540> left<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.140> free

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
inappropriate to be left of the free

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.889 
inappropriate to be left of the free
market<00:02:02.149> which<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.299> where<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.479> really

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
market which is where I really

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.310 
market which is where I really
discovered<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:05.040> whole<00:02:05.689> crazy<00:02:06.689> little

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
discovered this this whole crazy little

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.460 
discovered this this whole crazy little
school<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.950> thought

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
school of thought

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.440 
school of thought
in<00:02:08.530> economics<00:02:09.130> that<00:02:09.250> I<00:02:09.729> associate<00:02:10.360> myself

call<00:03:05.709> conspiracy<00:03:06.370> theories<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.959> you<00:03:08.530> have

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
call conspiracy theories and you have

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.010 
call conspiracy theories and you have
people<00:03:09.100> that<00:03:09.400> really<00:03:09.910> look<00:03:10.240> into<00:03:10.660> that<00:03:10.870> the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
serious economics behind it and so I

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.650 
serious economics behind it and so I
naturally<00:03:14.890> wanted<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.580> gravitate<00:03:16.120> towards
