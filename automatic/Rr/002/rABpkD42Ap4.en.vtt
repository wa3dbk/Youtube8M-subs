okay<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:06.270> in<00:00:06.720> this<00:00:06.840> experiment<00:00:07.200> I'm<00:00:07.500> going<00:00:07.529> to

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
okay and in this experiment I'm going to

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.100 
okay and in this experiment I'm going to
show<00:00:07.740> you<00:00:07.770> how<00:00:07.920> to<00:00:07.980> investigate<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:09.570> effect

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
show you how to investigate the effect

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.660 
show you how to investigate the effect
of<00:00:10.260> enzyme<00:00:10.710> concentration<00:00:10.889> on<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.490> rate

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
of enzyme concentration on the rate

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.150 
of enzyme concentration on the rate
depends<00:00:11.969> on<00:00:12.150> control<00:00:12.540> reaction<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:14.070> enzyme

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
depends on control reaction the enzyme

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.589 
depends on control reaction the enzyme
I'm<00:00:14.370> going<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.670> be<00:00:14.760> using<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.090> actually<00:00:15.210> called

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
I'm going to be using is actually called

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.510 
I'm going to be using is actually called
catalase<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.439> you<00:00:16.619> can<00:00:16.740> find<00:00:16.950> it<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.160> potato

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
catalase and you can find it in potato

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.600 
catalase and you can find it in potato
so<00:00:18.240> we're<00:00:18.450> going<00:00:18.599> to<00:00:18.689> use<00:00:18.900> some<00:00:19.349> potato<00:00:20.009> disks

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
so we're going to use some potato disks

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.880 
so we're going to use some potato disks
in<00:00:21.180> order<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.630> change<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.140> enzyme

in order to change the enzyme

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.650 
in order to change the enzyme
concentration<00:00:23.100> we're<00:00:24.090> going<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.300> assume<00:00:24.600> that

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
concentration we're going to assume that

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.019 
concentration we're going to assume that
each<00:00:24.869> disk<00:00:25.279> contains<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.369> same<00:00:26.520> amount<00:00:26.580> of

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
what I'm going to do in this experiment

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.630 
what I'm going to do in this experiment
I'm<00:00:43.860> going<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.100> use<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.250> same<00:00:44.370> volume

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
I'm going to use the same volume

going<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.399> use<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> pH<00:00:47.940> buffer<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.300> control<00:00:48.600> pH

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
going to use a pH buffer to control pH

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.270 
going to use a pH buffer to control pH
and<00:00:49.170> I'm<00:00:49.260> also<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.680> use<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> water<00:00:50.070> bath

and I'm also going to use a water bath

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.040 
and I'm also going to use a water bath
to<00:00:50.430> control<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> temperature<00:00:51.090> it's<00:00:51.870> very

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
to control the temperature it's very

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.330 
to control the temperature it's very
important<00:00:52.530> because<00:00:52.590> those<00:00:52.829> things<00:00:53.100> could

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
important because those things could

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.400 
important because those things could
also<00:00:53.489> affect<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.090> rate<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.480> reaction<00:00:54.600> we

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
also affect the rate of the reaction we

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.810 
also affect the rate of the reaction we
to<00:00:55.469> be<00:00:55.590> very<00:00:55.800> sure<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> enzyme

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
to be very sure that it's the enzyme

millimeter<00:01:47.520> segments<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.630> very<00:01:48.869> important

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
millimeter segments it's very important

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.069 
millimeter segments it's very important
that<00:01:49.500> I've<00:01:49.890> used<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.189> same<00:01:50.220> core<00:01:51.000> size<00:01:51.659> and

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
that I've used the same core size and

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.190 
that I've used the same core size and
the<00:01:52.170> same<00:01:52.430> diameter<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.970> width<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> disks

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
the same diameter and width of the disks

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.749 
the same diameter and width of the disks
because<00:01:55.799> potentially<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.520> different

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
because potentially the different

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.850 
because potentially the different
surface<00:01:57.090> area<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> potato<00:01:57.780> disks<00:01:58.290> could

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
surface area of potato disks could

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.770 
surface area of potato disks could
affect<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.700> amount<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.090> enzyme<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.689> is

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
affect the amount of enzyme that is

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.499 
affect the amount of enzyme that is
actually<00:02:01.079> exposed<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> substrate<00:02:02.509> I'm

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
actually exposed to the substrate I'm

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.420 
actually exposed to the substrate I'm
also<00:02:03.810> going<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.140> cut<00:02:04.290> off<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.590> end<00:02:04.770> bits<00:02:05.070> where

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
also going to cut off the end bits where

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.039 
also going to cut off the end bits where
the<00:02:05.610> skin<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.180> potato<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:07.459> to<00:02:08.459> make<00:02:08.610> it

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
the skin of the potato is to make it

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:13.729 
the skin of the potato is to make it
comparable<00:02:10.049> as<00:02:10.290> well

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.429 

in<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.829> first<00:02:15.069> experiment<00:02:15.370> I'm<00:02:15.640> going<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:15.939> use

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
in the first experiment I'm going to use

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.399 
in the first experiment I'm going to use
25<00:02:17.439> desks<00:02:18.180> after<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.299> I'm<00:02:19.420> going<00:02:19.599> to<00:02:19.810> reduce

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
25 desks after that I'm going to reduce

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.339 
25 desks after that I'm going to reduce
the<00:02:20.769> enzyme<00:02:21.040> concentration<00:02:21.810> by<00:02:22.810> reducing<00:02:23.260> the

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
the enzyme concentration by reducing the

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:44.890 
the enzyme concentration by reducing the
number<00:02:23.439> of<00:02:23.590> desks<00:02:24.689> to<00:02:25.689> 20<00:02:26.879> 15<00:02:28.109> 10<00:02:29.109> and<00:02:29.319> 5

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.660 

okay<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.140> first<00:02:46.590> thing<00:02:46.830> I'm<00:02:46.950> going<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.190> do<00:02:47.370> is

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
okay so first thing I'm going to do is

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.699 
okay so first thing I'm going to do is
to<00:02:47.970> put<00:02:48.150> my<00:02:48.270> substrate<00:02:48.630> into<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.260> boiling

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
to put my substrate into that boiling

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.010 
to put my substrate into that boiling
tube<00:02:50.069> I'm<00:02:50.910> going<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.240> use<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.420> set<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.810> same

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
tube I'm going to use a set the same

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.490 
tube I'm going to use a set the same
volume<00:02:52.319> of<00:02:52.560> concentration<00:02:54.080> which<00:02:55.080> is<00:02:55.110> ten

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
volume of concentration which is ten

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:05.990 
volume of concentration which is ten
milliliters<00:03:01.459> each<00:03:02.459> time<00:03:04.370> also<00:03:05.370> got<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.550> pH

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
milliliters each time also got a pH

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.180 
milliliters each time also got a pH
buffer<00:03:09.260> I'm<00:03:10.260> going<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.560> put<00:03:10.739> two<00:03:10.920> milliliters

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
buffer I'm going to put two milliliters

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.460 
buffer I'm going to put two milliliters
latin<00:03:11.819> girl<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.270> maintain<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.810> same<00:03:13.230> pH

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
latin girl to maintain the same pH

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.280 
latin girl to maintain the same pH
throughout<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:14.330> reaction<00:03:18.200> finally<00:03:19.200> I'm

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
throughout the reaction finally I'm

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.310 
throughout the reaction finally I'm
going<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.560> put<00:03:19.680> my<00:03:19.769> 25<00:03:20.600> potato<00:03:21.600> disks<00:03:22.110> that

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
going to put my 25 potato disks that

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:48.559 
going to put my 25 potato disks that
contain<00:03:22.769> catalase<00:03:23.390> into<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.510> tube

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.630 

and<00:03:49.569> I'm<00:03:49.720> going<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:49.900> start<00:03:50.080> a<00:03:50.140> stopwatch<00:03:50.640> and

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
and I'm going to start a stopwatch and

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.930 
and I'm going to start a stopwatch and
record<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.270> amount<00:03:52.690> option<00:03:53.140> it's<00:03:53.260> evolved

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
record the amount option it's evolved

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.790 
record the amount option it's evolved
every<00:03:54.940> 10<00:03:55.120> seconds<00:03:55.720> you<00:03:56.410> see<00:03:56.590> that<00:03:56.709> the

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
every 10 seconds you see that the

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.040 
every 10 seconds you see that the
gasoline<00:03:57.220> just<00:03:57.310> started<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:57.819> move<00:03:58.020> and<00:03:59.020> you

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
gasoline just started to move and you

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.510 
gasoline just started to move and you
might<00:03:59.290> be<00:03:59.380> able<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.560> see<00:03:59.770> some<00:04:00.130> bubbles<00:04:00.430> of

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
might be able to see some bubbles of

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:10.270 
might be able to see some bubbles of
oxygen<00:04:00.610> being<00:04:00.970> produced<00:04:01.270> within<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.750> tube

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.440 

okay<00:04:11.280> that's<00:04:11.459> been<00:04:11.610> two<00:04:11.790> minutes<00:04:11.940> now<00:04:12.209> you<00:04:12.270> can

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
okay that's been two minutes now you can

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.760 
okay that's been two minutes now you can
see<00:04:12.599> that<00:04:12.720> there's<00:04:13.200> been<00:04:13.319> quite<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.530> lot<00:04:13.739> of

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
see that there's been quite a lot of

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:14.990 
see that there's been quite a lot of
option<00:04:14.099> involved<00:04:14.430> there<00:04:14.610> which<00:04:14.760> you'd<00:04:14.910> expect

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
option involved there which you'd expect

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.090 
option involved there which you'd expect
because<00:04:15.870> that's<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.200> highest<00:04:16.350> concentration

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
because that's the highest concentration

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.930 
because that's the highest concentration
that<00:04:17.190> we're<00:04:17.340> going<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.579> be<00:04:17.669> using<00:04:17.910> for

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
that we're going to be using for

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.060 
that we're going to be using for
catalase<00:04:18.480> I'll<00:04:19.169> now<00:04:19.380> have<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:19.650> repeat<00:04:19.919> that

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
catalase I'll now have to repeat that

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.199 
catalase I'll now have to repeat that
two<00:04:20.310> more<00:04:20.430> times<00:04:20.489> for<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.060> same

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
two more times for the same

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.640 
two more times for the same
concentration<00:04:21.630> using<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.200> same<00:04:22.350> number<00:04:22.590> of

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
concentration using the same number of

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.850 
concentration using the same number of
disks<00:04:23.100> and<00:04:23.310> I<00:04:24.000> will<00:04:24.180> then<00:04:24.360> take<00:04:24.780> an<00:04:24.930> average<00:04:25.050> to

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
disks and I will then take an average to

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.190 
disks and I will then take an average to
improve<00:04:26.100> reliability<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:26.970> then<00:04:27.479> I<00:04:27.570> will<00:04:27.720> also

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
improve reliability and then I will also

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.500 
improve reliability and then I will also
use<00:04:28.229> four<00:04:29.220> more<00:04:29.460> concentrations<00:04:30.120> of<00:04:30.180> catalase

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
use four more concentrations of catalase

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.600 
use four more concentrations of catalase
by<00:04:30.840> lowering<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.740> number<00:04:31.860> of<00:04:32.010> discs<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:32.490> use

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
by lowering the number of discs to use

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:42.839 
by lowering the number of discs to use
each<00:04:32.820> time

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.909
