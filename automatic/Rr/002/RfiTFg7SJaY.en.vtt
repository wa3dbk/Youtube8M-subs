of having trained horses in an earlier
time<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:24.130> I<00:01:24.190> knew<00:01:24.370> these<00:01:24.550> horses<00:01:24.910> could

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
time and I knew these horses could

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.350 
time and I knew these horses could
perform<00:01:25.570> extremely<00:01:26.080> well<00:01:26.320> without<00:01:26.980> it<00:01:27.190> and<00:01:27.360> I

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
perform extremely well without it and I

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.930 
perform extremely well without it and I
I<00:01:29.350> really<00:01:29.710> felt<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.340> was<00:01:30.370> in<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.700> best

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
I really felt it was in the best

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.410 
I really felt it was in the best
interest<00:01:31.420> of<00:01:31.540> our<00:01:31.660> horses<00:01:32.160> and<00:01:33.210> also<00:01:34.210> in<00:01:34.330> the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
interest of our horses and also in the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.060 
interest of our horses and also in the
best<00:01:34.630> interest<00:01:35.020> of<00:01:35.140> our<00:01:35.260> industry<00:01:35.740> but<00:01:35.890> what<00:01:36.040> I

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
best interest of our industry but what I

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.420 
best interest of our industry but what I
found<00:01:36.550> is<00:01:36.910> that<00:01:37.240> these<00:01:37.600> horses<00:01:37.900> run<00:01:38.470> extremely

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
found is that these horses run extremely

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.670 
found is that these horses run extremely
well<00:01:39.760> when<00:01:40.390> they're<00:01:40.540> not<00:01:40.750> medicated<00:01:41.470> they

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
well when they're not medicated they

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.310 
well when they're not medicated they
pull<00:01:42.250> up<00:01:42.430> well<00:01:42.670> they're<00:01:43.570> in<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.840> tub<00:01:44.050> they

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
pull up well they're in the tub they

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.500 
pull up well they're in the tub they
don't<00:01:44.560> have<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.920> extreme<00:01:45.400> weight<00:01:45.729> loss<00:01:45.790> that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
don't have the extreme weight loss that
