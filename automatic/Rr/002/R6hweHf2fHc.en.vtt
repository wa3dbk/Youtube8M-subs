00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
this comes up and if we go over to poly

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.230 
this comes up and if we go over to poly
cylinder<00:01:37.110> one<00:01:37.490> over<00:01:38.490> here<00:01:38.640> it'll<00:01:38.790> show<00:01:38.880> up

cylinder one over here it'll show up
you'll<00:01:39.750> see<00:01:39.810> poly<00:01:40.229> cylinder<00:01:41.009> history<00:01:41.490> there's

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
you'll see poly cylinder history there's

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.050 
you'll see poly cylinder history there's
radius<00:01:42.920> height<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.369> changes<00:01:44.939> all<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.299> stuff

radius height it changes all that stuff

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.060 
radius height it changes all that stuff
subdivision<00:01:48.060> accesses<00:01:48.710> subdivision<00:01:49.710> heights

have<00:05:09.940> a<00:05:09.970> bullet<00:05:10.330> here<00:05:10.570> except<00:05:11.230> there's<00:05:11.680> no

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
have a bullet here except there's no

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.900 
have a bullet here except there's no
bottom<00:05:12.430> piece<00:05:12.700> and<00:05:13.770> how<00:05:14.770> we're<00:05:15.520> gonna<00:05:15.610> fix

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
bottom piece and how we're gonna fix

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.960 
bottom piece and how we're gonna fix
that<00:05:16.210> right<00:05:16.450> now<00:05:17.190> is<00:05:18.190> we're<00:05:18.370> gonna<00:05:18.460> take<00:05:18.700> this

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
that right now is we're gonna take this

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.030 
that right now is we're gonna take this
and<00:05:19.300> if<00:05:20.230> we<00:05:20.290> go<00:05:20.620> up<00:05:20.650> here<00:05:21.070> over<00:05:21.970> into<00:05:22.570> these

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
and if we go up here over into these

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.230 
and if we go up here over into these
attributes<00:05:24.040> again<00:05:24.340> if<00:05:24.640> you<00:05:24.790> can't<00:05:25.000> fire<00:05:25.210> them

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
attributes again if you can't fire them

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.800 
attributes again if you can't fire them
just<00:05:25.600> hit<00:05:25.780> this<00:05:25.900> button<00:05:27.360> come<00:05:28.360> down<00:05:28.540> to<00:05:28.690> this

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
arrow and right here PC cylinder one

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.750 
arrow and right here PC cylinder one
that<00:05:33.400> opens<00:05:33.790> up<00:05:33.940> our<00:05:34.060> transform<00:05:34.690> attributes

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
that opens up our transform attributes

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.740 
that opens up our transform attributes
what<00:05:36.760> we're<00:05:36.850> gonna<00:05:36.940> do<00:05:37.180> is<00:05:37.360> we're<00:05:37.479> gonna<00:05:37.540> take

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna take

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.300 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna take
a<00:05:37.810> rotate<00:05:38.320> and<00:05:38.620> we're<00:05:38.770> going<00:05:38.890> to<00:05:38.979> take<00:05:39.160> this

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
a rotate and we're going to take this

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.230 
a rotate and we're going to take this
first<00:05:39.580> box<00:05:40.290> just<00:05:41.290> type<00:05:41.440> in<00:05:41.650> 90<00:05:42.040> that<00:05:42.910> way<00:05:43.090> it

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
first box just type in 90 that way it

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.740 
first box just type in 90 that way it
rotates<00:05:44.130> sideways<00:05:45.130> and<00:05:45.460> we<00:05:46.390> are<00:05:46.540> actually

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
rotates sideways and we are actually

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.710 
rotates sideways and we are actually
gonna<00:05:46.990> do<00:05:47.229> that<00:05:47.380> with<00:05:47.650> this<00:05:47.830> one<00:05:48.070> as<00:05:48.370> well

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
gonna do that with this one as well

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.350 
gonna do that with this one as well
transform<00:05:49.720> attributes<00:05:50.640> rotate<00:05:51.990> 90<00:05:53.700> now<00:05:54.700> we're

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
transform attributes rotate 90 now we're

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.590 
transform attributes rotate 90 now we're
gonna<00:05:55.540> take<00:05:55.870> this<00:05:56.290> cylinder<00:05:57.070> line<00:05:58.060> it<00:05:58.270> up<00:05:58.390> with

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
gonna take this cylinder line it up with

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.159 
gonna take this cylinder line it up with
this

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
this

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.510 
this
so<00:05:59.830> that<00:06:01.110> and<00:06:02.110> we<00:06:02.440> can<00:06:02.650> use<00:06:02.800> this<00:06:02.979> back<00:06:03.250> piece

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
so that and we can use this back piece

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.780 
so that and we can use this back piece
as<00:06:03.880> this<00:06:04.300> and<00:06:04.600> also<00:06:05.229> be<00:06:05.860> able<00:06:05.950> to<00:06:06.100> extend<00:06:06.580> this

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
as this and also be able to extend this

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.570 
as this and also be able to extend this
out<00:06:07.030> as<00:06:07.240> far<00:06:07.479> as<00:06:07.630> we<00:06:07.810> need<00:06:08.280> so<00:06:09.280> we're<00:06:09.400> going<00:06:09.520> to

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
out as far as we need so we're going to

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.090 
out as far as we need so we're going to
take<00:06:09.760> this<00:06:10.000> if<00:06:10.930> you<00:06:11.080> come<00:06:11.260> up<00:06:11.290> here<00:06:11.650> it's<00:06:11.919> kind

take this if you come up here it's kind

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.450 
take this if you come up here it's kind
of<00:06:12.130> like<00:06:12.190> three<00:06:12.690> cones<00:06:13.690> with<00:06:14.440> an<00:06:14.590> arrow<00:06:14.770> move

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
of like three cones with an arrow move

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.810 
of like three cones with an arrow move
tool<00:06:15.729> click<00:06:16.120> the<00:06:16.810> move<00:06:17.050> tool<00:06:17.350> and<00:06:17.640> once<00:06:18.640> again

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
tool click the move tool and once again

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.560 
tool click the move tool and once again
it<00:06:19.090> has<00:06:19.270> these<00:06:20.220> the<00:06:21.220> green<00:06:21.490> red<00:06:21.910> blue<00:06:22.270> there

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
it has these the green red blue there

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.710 
it has these the green red blue there
arrows<00:06:22.960> this<00:06:23.140> time<00:06:24.030> you<00:06:25.030> can<00:06:25.210> move<00:06:25.390> it<00:06:25.570> on<00:06:25.690> the

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
arrows this time you can move it on the

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.920 
arrows this time you can move it on the
different<00:06:26.169> axes<00:06:27.150> we're<00:06:28.150> gonna<00:06:28.270> move<00:06:28.540> it<00:06:30.930> to

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
different axes we're gonna move it to

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.870 
different axes we're gonna move it to
fit<00:06:33.090> this<00:06:34.090> perfectly

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.490 

now<00:06:37.880> it's<00:06:38.150> already<00:06:38.570> it's<00:06:38.780> already<00:06:38.990> on<00:06:39.350> the

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
now it's already it's already on the

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.659 
now it's already it's already on the
right<00:06:39.740> height<00:06:40.330> on<00:06:41.330> the<00:06:42.020> right<00:06:42.199> height<00:06:42.500> here<00:06:42.889> so

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:43.669 
right height on the right height here so

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.770 
right height on the right height here so
we<00:06:44.000> just<00:06:44.180> got<00:06:44.360> to<00:06:44.389> get<00:06:44.630> it<00:06:44.810> to<00:06:44.990> line<00:06:45.199> up<00:06:46.780> left

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
we just got to get it to line up left

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.879 
we just got to get it to line up left
and<00:06:47.960> right

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:51.889 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:58.060 

I<00:06:52.000> think<00:06:53.000> that's<00:06:53.180> about<00:06:53.389> good<00:06:54.760> and<00:06:56.740> the<00:06:57.740> bullet

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.070 
I think that's about good and the bullet

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.960 
I think that's about good and the bullet
seems<00:06:58.460> a<00:06:58.880> little<00:06:59.240> long<00:06:59.949> if<00:07:00.949> you<00:07:01.130> want<00:07:01.160> to<00:07:01.610> you

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:01.970 
seems a little long if you want to you

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.510 
seems a little long if you want to you
can<00:07:02.180> either<00:07:02.330> take<00:07:02.720> the<00:07:02.900> move<00:07:03.139> tool<00:07:03.440> slide<00:07:04.220> it

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
can either take the move tool slide it

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.600 
can either take the move tool slide it
or<00:07:04.669> not<00:07:04.820> but<00:07:05.090> it<00:07:05.240> might<00:07:05.449> create<00:07:06.340> that<00:07:07.340> might

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
or not but it might create that might

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.390 
or not but it might create that might
create<00:07:07.970> like<00:07:08.300> a<00:07:08.720> little<00:07:08.979> rounded<00:07:09.979> edge<00:07:10.130> right

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
create like a little rounded edge right

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.860 
create like a little rounded edge right
there<00:07:10.460> which<00:07:10.850> we<00:07:11.180> do<00:07:11.450> not<00:07:11.479> want<00:07:11.690> right<00:07:12.169> now

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870 
there which we do not want right now

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:22.629 
there which we do not want right now
what<00:07:14.870> you<00:07:14.990> could<00:07:15.169> do<00:07:17.770> is<00:07:21.040> move<00:07:22.040> it<00:07:22.280> back<00:07:22.610> to

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 
what you could do is move it back to

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:25.210 
what you could do is move it back to
where<00:07:23.120> you<00:07:23.240> want<00:07:23.680> and<00:07:24.680> then<00:07:24.830> if<00:07:24.919> you<00:07:25.010> take<00:07:25.160> a

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:25.220 
where you want and then if you take a

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.360 
where you want and then if you take a
scale<00:07:25.639> tool<00:07:25.940> you<00:07:26.870> can<00:07:26.990> grab<00:07:27.289> the<00:07:27.590> side<00:07:27.889> and<00:07:28.250> to

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:28.370 
scale tool you can grab the side and to

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:40.000 
scale tool you can grab the side and to
scale<00:07:28.669> it<00:07:35.199> and<00:07:38.650> voila

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.010 
scale it and voila

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:45.550 
scale it and voila
there<00:07:40.820> have<00:07:41.150> it<00:07:41.330> a<00:07:41.539> simple<00:07:42.410> bullet<00:07:43.340> in<00:07:43.870> my<00:07:44.870> F<00:07:45.169> I

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560 
there have it a simple bullet in my F I

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.600
