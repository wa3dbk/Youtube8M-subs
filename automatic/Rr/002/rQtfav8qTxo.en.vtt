00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
really it and it's actually the same

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.880 
really it and it's actually the same
size<00:01:06.210> as<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.659> gormer<00:01:06.990> tron<00:01:07.200> box<00:01:07.439> I'm<00:01:07.650> pretty

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
size as the gormer tron box I'm pretty

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.620 
size as the gormer tron box I'm pretty
sure<00:01:08.010> but<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.250> think<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.580> karmatronic<00:01:08.939> box<00:01:09.390> may

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
sure but I think the karmatronic box may

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.960 
sure but I think the karmatronic box may
be<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.780> little<00:01:10.170> bit<00:01:10.320> thicker<00:01:10.580> now<00:01:11.580> let's<00:01:11.760> take<00:01:11.939> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
be a little bit thicker now let's take a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.390 
be a little bit thicker now let's take a
look<00:01:12.180> at<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> actual<00:01:12.830> minifigures<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
look at the actual minifigures so the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.550 
look at the actual minifigures so the
first<00:01:14.610> figure<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.180> Lynette's<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.990> think<00:01:16.439> that's

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
first figure is Lynette's I think that's

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.020 
first figure is Lynette's I think that's
how<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.740> pronounce<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.759> he's<00:01:17.850> probably

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
how you pronounce it and he's probably

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.520 
how you pronounce it and he's probably
my<00:01:18.210> favorite<00:01:18.479> lying<00:01:18.689> figure<00:01:19.080> because<00:01:19.259> he<00:01:19.350> does

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
my favorite lying figure because he does

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.260 
my favorite lying figure because he does
have<00:01:19.560> some<00:01:20.009> nice<00:01:20.159> actual<00:01:20.670> printing<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.150> his

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
from it much more detailed than some of

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.810 
from it much more detailed than some of
the<00:01:23.369> other<00:01:23.490> ones

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820

has<00:03:39.270> some<00:03:39.390> nice<00:03:39.540> printing<00:03:40.260> right<00:03:40.410> there<00:03:40.650> it's

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
has some nice printing right there it's

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.730 
has some nice printing right there it's
kind<00:03:41.100> of<00:03:41.130> like<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.280> pearl<00:03:41.640> silver<00:03:41.940> Levine<00:03:42.420> and

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
kind of like a pearl silver Levine and

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.250 
kind of like a pearl silver Levine and
his<00:03:43.740> does<00:03:44.430> have<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.910> rocket<00:03:45.450> as<00:03:45.600> its<00:03:45.810> engine<00:03:46.140> on

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
his does have a rocket as its engine on

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.600 
his does have a rocket as its engine on
the<00:03:46.380> back<00:03:46.530> which<00:03:46.740> is<00:03:46.860> kind<00:03:47.070> of<00:03:47.100> pointless<00:03:47.340> but

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
the back which is kind of pointless but

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.680 
the back which is kind of pointless but
this<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.880> so<00:03:48.000> pretty<00:03:48.180> cool

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
this is so pretty cool

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.150 
this is so pretty cool
the<00:03:48.930> only<00:03:49.080> thing<00:03:49.320> I<00:03:49.380> don't<00:03:49.440> like<00:03:49.620> about<00:03:49.770> this

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
the only thing I don't like about this

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.790 
the only thing I don't like about this
fear<00:03:50.430> is<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.880> kind<00:03:51.120> of<00:03:51.209> bends<00:03:51.510> escape<00:03:52.020> that's

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
fear is it kind of bends escape that's

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.530 
fear is it kind of bends escape that's
nothing<00:03:53.160> really<00:03:53.310> major

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
nothing really major

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.760 
nothing really major
I'm<00:03:54.720> not<00:03:54.900> going<00:03:55.050> to<00:03:55.080> speed<00:03:55.320> it<00:03:55.350> because<00:03:55.739> I

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
I'm not going to speed it because I

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.830 
I'm not going to speed it because I
don't<00:03:55.950> want<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.160> tires<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.580> get<00:03:56.670> dirty<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:57.750> if

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
don't want the tires to get dirty and if

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.960 
don't want the tires to get dirty and if

you look at Lennox's my necks has like a

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.300 
you look at Lennox's my necks has like a
bright<00:04:00.300> yellow<00:04:00.480> speedor<00:04:01.140> and<00:04:01.410> there's<00:04:02.190> so

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.920 
bright yellow speedor and there's so
much<00:04:02.430> continued<00:04:02.910> on<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.090> side<00:04:03.300> right<00:04:03.660> there

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
much continued on the side right there

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.830 
much continued on the side right there
and<00:04:04.200> on<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.500> other<00:04:04.620> side<00:04:04.770> and<00:04:05.280> his<00:04:06.209> back<00:04:06.480> does

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840

Oh<00:04:08.100> Ninjago<00:04:08.820> like<00:04:09.060> weapons<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:10.170> they<00:04:10.709> were

using<00:04:10.980> in<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.310> job<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.670> booster<00:04:12.030> packs<00:04:12.239> but<00:04:12.510> I

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
using in the job of booster packs but I

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.050 
using in the job of booster packs but I
think<00:04:12.780> they're<00:04:12.930> also<00:04:13.110> using<00:04:13.410> Bionicle<00:04:14.400> and

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
castle and it's not much of a castle

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.820 
castle and it's not much of a castle
like<00:04:36.120> I<00:04:36.360> said<00:04:36.660> it<00:04:36.810> when<00:04:37.020> I<00:04:37.050> first<00:04:37.350> reveal<00:04:37.680> the

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
like I said it when I first reveal the

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.440 
like I said it when I first reveal the
pictures<00:04:38.250> but<00:04:38.490> they<00:04:38.640> still<00:04:38.880> look<00:04:38.970> it<00:04:39.240> still

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
pictures but they still look it still

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.360 
pictures but they still look it still
looks<00:04:39.630> pretty<00:04:39.810> cool<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:41.010> side<00:04:41.220> right

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
looks pretty cool and the side right

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.530 
looks pretty cool and the side right
here<00:04:41.430> is<00:04:41.640> where<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:41.940> speeders

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
here is where the speeders

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.900 
here is where the speeders
do<00:04:42.810> little<00:04:43.050> ramps<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.220> main<00:04:44.370> a<00:04:44.610> feature

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
do little ramps and the main a feature

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.090 
do little ramps and the main a feature
is<00:04:45.150> there's<00:04:45.390> this<00:04:45.510> pillar<00:04:45.840> right<00:04:46.050> here<00:04:46.350> if<00:04:46.860> you

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
is there's this pillar right here if you

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.430 
is there's this pillar right here if you
knock<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.550> pillar<00:04:47.729> over<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.690> wings<00:04:48.900> pop<00:04:49.229> up

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
knock the pillar over the wings pop up

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.480 
knock the pillar over the wings pop up
because<00:04:49.620> it's<00:04:49.770> like<00:04:49.890> this<00:04:50.010> whole<00:04:50.220> mechanism

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
because it's like this whole mechanism

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.520 
because it's like this whole mechanism
so<00:04:51.180> basically<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.690> speeder<00:04:51.990> is<00:04:52.110> game<00:04:52.290> is<00:04:52.320> you

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
so basically the speeder is game is you

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.960 
so basically the speeder is game is you
should<00:04:52.650> put<00:04:52.800> some<00:04:52.950> off<00:04:53.070> to<00:04:53.220> pull<00:04:53.370> it<00:04:53.460> over<00:04:53.640> like

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
should put some off to pull it over like

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.750 
should put some off to pull it over like
that<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.990> so<00:04:55.620> there<00:04:55.770> are<00:04:55.800> some<00:04:56.070> nice<00:04:56.250> actual

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
that and so there are some nice actual

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.540 
that and so there are some nice actual
grass<00:04:57.000> pieces<00:04:57.450> right<00:04:57.630> here<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.280> let<00:04:59.280> me<00:04:59.340> see

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
grass pieces right here and let me see

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.120 
grass pieces right here and let me see
if<00:04:59.580> you<00:04:59.700> didn't<00:05:00.090> see<00:05:00.510> that<00:05:00.540> and<00:05:01.169> there's<00:05:01.890> just

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
if you didn't see that and there's just

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.310 
if you didn't see that and there's just
basically<00:05:02.700> a<00:05:02.760> Technic<00:05:03.210> rock<00:05:03.450> going<00:05:04.140> through

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
basically a Technic rock going through

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.680 
basically a Technic rock going through
here<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:04.800> there's<00:05:05.340> an<00:05:05.520> eagle's<00:05:06.000> talons<00:05:06.060> which

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
here and there's an eagle's talons which

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.920 
here and there's an eagle's talons which
are<00:05:06.840> pearl<00:05:07.260> gold<00:05:07.760> and<00:05:08.760> here's<00:05:09.150> a<00:05:09.240> close-up<00:05:09.510> and

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
are pearl gold and here's a close-up and

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.659 
are pearl gold and here's a close-up and
we<00:05:10.080> can<00:05:10.229> see<00:05:10.350> the<00:05:10.500> talons<00:05:11.010> right<00:05:11.190> there<00:05:11.460> and

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
we can see the talons right there and

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.750 
we can see the talons right there and
the<00:05:12.450> weapon<00:05:12.780> racks<00:05:13.020> then<00:05:14.010> if<00:05:14.130> you<00:05:14.280> move<00:05:14.490> it<00:05:14.610> up

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
the weapon racks then if you move it up

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.750 
the weapon racks then if you move it up
a<00:05:15.030> little<00:05:15.210> bit<00:05:15.390> you<00:05:16.229> could<00:05:16.350> see<00:05:16.620> some<00:05:17.490> the

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
a little bit you could see some the

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.310 
a little bit you could see some the
rubber<00:05:17.940> band<00:05:18.240> we're<00:05:18.450> told<00:05:18.660> some<00:05:18.870> mechanism

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
rubber band we're told some mechanism

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.290 
rubber band we're told some mechanism
together<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:20.370> two<00:05:20.550> wings<00:05:20.880> which<00:05:21.120> I'm

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
together and the two wings which I'm

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.940 
together and the two wings which I'm
pretty<00:05:21.660> sure<00:05:21.840> that's<00:05:21.960> a<00:05:22.110> new<00:05:22.229> piece<00:05:22.500> and<00:05:22.530> it's

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
pretty sure that's a new piece and it's

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.159 
pretty sure that's a new piece and it's
like<00:05:23.100> a<00:05:23.280> light<00:05:23.550> light<00:05:23.820> blue<00:05:24.120> there's<00:05:24.930> other

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
like a light light blue there's other

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.290 
like a light light blue there's other
wing<00:05:25.410> and<00:05:26.100> if<00:05:26.250> you<00:05:26.370> go<00:05:26.490> up<00:05:26.610> a<00:05:26.760> little<00:05:26.940> bit<00:05:27.090> more

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
wing and if you go up a little bit more

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.629 
wing and if you go up a little bit more
there<00:05:27.720> is<00:05:27.960> a<00:05:27.990> top<00:05:28.530> part<00:05:28.800> and<00:05:29.010> the<00:05:29.190> Eagle<00:05:30.030> Queen

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
there is a top part and the Eagle Queen

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.339 
there is a top part and the Eagle Queen
they're<00:05:30.879> pretty<00:05:31.120> well<00:05:31.389> just<00:05:31.719> sticker<00:05:32.139> on

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
they're pretty well just sticker on

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:33.600 
they're pretty well just sticker on
right<00:05:32.500> there<00:05:32.740> and<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:32.919> know<00:05:33.069> she<00:05:33.129> doesn't<00:05:33.310> have

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
right there and I know she doesn't have

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.520 
right there and I know she doesn't have
her<00:05:33.639> arm<00:05:33.939> or<00:05:34.120> anything<00:05:34.240> and<00:05:34.750> there's<00:05:35.409> these

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
her arm or anything and there's these

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.050 
her arm or anything and there's these
awesome<00:05:36.009> two<00:05:36.219> wings<00:05:36.430> right<00:05:36.580> here<00:05:36.789> which<00:05:36.969> were

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
awesome two wings right here which were

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.029 
awesome two wings right here which were
the<00:05:37.150> same<00:05:37.330> ones<00:05:37.479> down<00:05:37.750> here<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.289> that's

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
the same ones down here and that's

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.589 
the same ones down here and that's
really<00:05:39.189> it<00:05:39.490> and<00:05:39.699> if<00:05:39.939> you<00:05:40.030> look<00:05:40.180> on<00:05:40.270> the<00:05:40.419> back

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
really it and if you look on the back

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.969 
really it and if you look on the back
side<00:05:40.900> there's<00:05:41.710> really<00:05:41.979> just<00:05:42.099> some<00:05:42.460> mechanisms

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
side there's really just some mechanisms

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.379 
side there's really just some mechanisms
and<00:05:44.979> that<00:05:45.129> is<00:05:45.280> the<00:05:45.400> same<00:05:45.610> piece<00:05:45.819> from<00:05:46.000> the<00:05:46.180> city

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
and that is the same piece from the city

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:48.149 
and that is the same piece from the city
garage<00:05:46.659> and<00:05:47.080> so<00:05:47.229> that's<00:05:47.379> it<00:05:47.560> for<00:05:47.710> a<00:05:47.770> set<00:05:48.009> and

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:48.159 
garage and so that's it for a set and

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:50.159 
garage and so that's it for a set and
now<00:05:48.280> it's<00:05:48.430> a<00:05:48.550> fun<00:05:48.759> alert<00:05:49.050> overall<00:05:50.050> I<00:05:50.110> think

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
now it's a fun alert overall I think

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:51.749 
now it's a fun alert overall I think
this<00:05:50.469> is<00:05:50.560> probably<00:05:50.860> my<00:05:50.949> favorite<00:05:50.979> speed<00:05:51.639> or

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 
this is probably my favorite speed or

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:52.950 
this is probably my favorite speed or
set<00:05:52.030> and<00:05:52.180> I<00:05:52.240> know<00:05:52.300> it's<00:05:52.509> the<00:05:52.569> most<00:05:52.689> expensive

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
set and I know it's the most expensive

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.899 
set and I know it's the most expensive
of<00:05:53.349> it<00:05:53.500> for<00:05:53.650> you<00:05:53.740> and<00:05:53.949> it<00:05:54.129> is<00:05:54.219> really<00:05:54.580> hard<00:05:54.849> to

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:54.909 
of it for you and it is really hard to

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:57.390 
of it for you and it is really hard to
find<00:05:55.120> but<00:05:55.750> the<00:05:55.870> $40<00:05:56.349> price<00:05:56.590> point<00:05:56.919> is<00:05:57.069> almost

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
find but the $40 price point is almost

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.390 
find but the $40 price point is almost
perfect<00:05:57.879> for<00:05:57.969> an<00:05:58.030> oppressor<00:05:58.330> at<00:05:58.509> peace<00:05:58.689> ratio

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
perfect for an oppressor at peace ratio

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.939 
perfect for an oppressor at peace ratio
369<00:06:00.400> pieces<00:06:00.819> and<00:06:01.780> so<00:06:01.960> I<00:06:01.990> do<00:06:02.080> rate<00:06:02.409> this<00:06:02.590> set<00:06:02.800> in

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
369 pieces and so I do rate this set in

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:06.029 
369 pieces and so I do rate this set in
actual<00:06:03.689> 9.25<00:06:04.689> out<00:06:04.990> of<00:06:05.110> ten<00:06:05.259> because<00:06:05.409> all<00:06:05.800> three

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
actual 9.25 out of ten because all three

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:08.189 
actual 9.25 out of ten because all three
minifigures<00:06:06.460> are<00:06:06.699> just<00:06:06.849> phenomenal<00:06:07.000> and<00:06:07.539> the

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
minifigures are just phenomenal and the

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.570 
minifigures are just phenomenal and the
actual<00:06:08.560> structure<00:06:08.889> itself<00:06:09.159> isn't<00:06:09.400> really

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
actual structure itself isn't really

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.249 
actual structure itself isn't really
that<00:06:09.819> special<00:06:10.210> but<00:06:10.479> I<00:06:10.509> do<00:06:10.569> love<00:06:10.900> the<00:06:11.050> play

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
that special but I do love the play

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:14.040 
that special but I do love the play

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
mechanism and this really cool eagle top

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.469

least put like maybe another speed or

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.430 
least put like maybe another speed or
that<00:06:33.849> would<00:06:34.000> be<00:06:34.120> cool<00:06:34.300> like<00:06:34.360> it<00:06:34.629> was<00:06:34.810> a<00:06:34.839> 4-speed

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440
