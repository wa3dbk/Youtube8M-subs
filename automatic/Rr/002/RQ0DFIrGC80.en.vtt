gaming here today I am reviewing the
shaped<00:00:13.660> building<00:00:14.139> server<00:00:14.410> now<00:00:14.950> second<00:00:15.610> time

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
shaped building server now second time

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.130 
shaped building server now second time
we're<00:00:15.910> recording<00:00:16.119> this<00:00:16.390> the<00:00:16.450> first<00:00:16.810> one<00:00:17.020> was

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
we're recording this the first one was

we're recording this the first one was
kind<00:00:17.320> of<00:00:17.410> a<00:00:17.500> fail<00:00:17.740> if<00:00:18.310> something<00:00:18.640> happen<00:00:18.850> with

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
kind of a fail if something happen with

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.640 
kind of a fail if something happen with
the<00:00:19.060> video<00:00:19.270> corruption<00:00:19.750> I<00:00:19.869> don't<00:00:20.020> know<00:00:20.109> but

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
the video corruption I don't know but

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.130 
the video corruption I don't know but
basically<00:00:20.980> this<00:00:21.400> is<00:00:21.640> a<00:00:21.910> mCP<00:00:22.720> modern<00:00:24.240> town<00:00:25.240> and

basically this is a mCP modern town and

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.870 
basically this is a mCP modern town and
it's<00:00:26.289> very<00:00:26.560> cool<00:00:26.830> built<00:00:27.100> by<00:00:27.220> a<00:00:27.250> bunch<00:00:27.580> of<00:00:27.730> cool

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
it's very cool built by a bunch of cool

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.570 
it's very cool built by a bunch of cool
builders<00:00:28.210> so<00:00:28.420> the<00:00:28.869> explanation<00:00:29.560> is<00:00:29.830> SBS

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
builders so the explanation is SBS

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.820 
builders so the explanation is SBS
counts<00:00:31.000> a<00:00:31.060> few<00:00:31.240> styles<00:00:31.630> based<00:00:31.840> on<00:00:31.990> walk<00:00:32.230> we're

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
counts a few styles based on walk we're

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
builders we try to be as walk like us on

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.420 
builders we try to be as walk like us on
the<00:00:37.480> SBS<00:00:37.780> server<00:00:38.110> to<00:00:38.410> be<00:00:38.530> as<00:00:38.739> realistic<00:00:39.070> as

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
the SBS server to be as realistic as

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.940 
the SBS server to be as realistic as
possible<00:00:39.489> there's<00:00:40.390> a<00:00:40.510> quite<00:00:40.840> a<00:00:40.870> few<00:00:41.170> builders

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950

it looks exactly like a modern city wood
although<00:03:18.769> there<00:03:18.950> is<00:03:19.069> traditional<00:03:19.549> houses<00:03:19.880> -

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
although there is traditional houses -

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.000

of like a straight I think this canal
because<00:04:37.040> it<00:04:37.400> look<00:04:37.790> it's<00:04:37.940> very<00:04:38.150> man-made<00:04:39.140> so

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500
