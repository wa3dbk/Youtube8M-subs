 that with this recipe impacted and these 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.000

 90 grams of wheat flour 90 grams 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.200
 of granulated sugar 10 grams of 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.809
 butter and 3 eggs we start 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.020
 placing the eggs and the sugar in the 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.750
 blender we are going to beat approximately 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.150
 for about 20 minutes if we have a blender 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.580
 manual if we have a blender like that 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.729
 professional let's do it for about 10 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.729
 minutes 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.250
 is ready we see how the point is formed 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.560
 of letter when lifting our beater 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.570
 We passed the flour through a colander 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.240
 we started to mix with a spatula in 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.990
 enveloping form and we finished with the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.990
 melted butter 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.140
 Y 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.260
 We divide the mixture into two molds and 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.990
 we take the oven to 180 degrees by 15 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.170
 minutes 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.560
 four egg yolks which we are going to 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.280
 pasteurize with 100 grams of sugar and 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.159
 60 ml of water will be taken to a fire 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.930
 120 degrees and later I'm going to 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:07.860
 teach the just point apart 250 grams 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.830
 of mascarpone cheese 400 grams of cream 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.800
 whipped which has added 100 grams 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:18.630
 of condensed milk so that the mixture 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.750
 have a consistency of 50 ml of cold water 14 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:25.880
 grams of gelatin powder and our 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.880
 star ingredient strawberries 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.049
 we hydrated the gelatin in the water and 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.439
 we reserve apart the 100 grams of 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.590
 sugar and the 60 ml of water we take to 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.140
 high fire 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.890
 we started to beat the yolks at speed 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.319
 mean after 10 minutes and reached 120 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.750
 degrees immediately we're going to 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.819
 add to our buds that have always 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.040
 been beating in the form of thread 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.459
 once pasteurized our buds 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:02.139
 let's beat the cream with the 100 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.139
 grams of condensed milk 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.080
 already when our cream is well beaten 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.769
 let's add the mascarpone cheese 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.110
 let's change the globe by the palette and 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.260
 we will incorporate by about 3 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.840
 seconds nothing more 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.569
 Melt the gelatin for 20 seconds 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.360
 in the microwave and incorporate it into 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.640
 pasteurized yolks this mixture is the 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.950
 we are going to add to the whipped cream and 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.000
 Mascarpone mixes in an enveloping form 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.640
 and we reserve it 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.190
 here I want to show you a super way 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.160
 easy to make the hoops for our 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.090
 cakes in our homes and without spending 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.460
 a lot of money 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.790
 We are going to use aluminum foil and 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.550
 cardboard we are going to fold a little piece and 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.000
 let's do as a tab we're going to 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:58.540
 paste plastic tape we paste well and 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.510
 let's go back to flip or bend until 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.280
 half we stretch well so you do not 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.370
 make us those wrinkles on paper 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.400
 aluminum and we finish with another 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.980
 little eyelash and so easy and simple 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.840
 we have done the hoop we started with the 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.299
 armed we put it on a base and 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.750
 moistened we place baking paper 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.150
 stick with a plastic tape and you're 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.760
 ready our hoop previously we have 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.030
 done let's put the strawberries 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.480
 cut in half around the hoop 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.090
 in this way glued to each other 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.250
 and we finish with whole strawberries for 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.790
 so that the cut can see the strawberries 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.520
 cream and look spectacular we put the 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.920
 cream and we match perfectly with the 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.470
 help from a spatula and so it will remain 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.870
 add the second layer of sponge cake and 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.300
 to the fridge here I have found white 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.100
 I have a design on a wafer sheet or 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.800
 they can also do it on a sheet of 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.930
 sugar is a design for disk already 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.930
 you put what you like most 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.789
 I've already kneaded it and I'm going to stretch it 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.490
 I have placed cornstarch in my allowance for 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:10.610
 that does not hit us I'm going to do it with 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:14.660
 this roller and in this way stretched 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.880
 until you reach 2 centimeters very thin already 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.330
 I have it ready and with the help of this 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.699
 cutter I do it at the design level for 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.530
 that we stay matched if they do not have 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:27.500
 cut can be done with a knife 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.540
 and polish around 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.660
 ah 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.660
 ah 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.580
 we take the cake out of the fridge we remove 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.060
 the hoop and with the help of a knife 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.010
 let's remove the paper so we're going to 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.250
 smooth and it will not look much better 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.810
 presentation we add marmalade and 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.150
 we paste the fondant 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.370
 and on the other side the fondant we are going to 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.860
 put a little more jam and 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:03.380
 we stick the wafer paper or the paper 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.380
 sugar they have chosen we made 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.659
