00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.900
 ball below the perfect game for 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.059
 spend some time the company is 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.940
 very few things a ball 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.289
 at least six children aged 6 and up is one 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.609
 playing field that can be a lot 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.230
 restricted for example you can play 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.480
 even inside suppose the ugly 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.350
 time we know a ceiling enough 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.300
 high 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.150
 let's see how we arrange we have a 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.199
 volunteer child who is at the center of the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.270
 circle formed by the other children 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.430
 line we put the concept of this 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.340
 like the other children must stay at least 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.950
 three steps away from child to 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.219
 center of the circle that the ball touches 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.480
 amount of the game starts the child 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.610
 throw the ball as high as it can e 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.800
 at the same time says the name of a 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.989
 child who is participating in the game 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.000
 this child who is called must 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.300
 try to go catch the ball 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.309
 before this happens and while everyone 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.829
 the other participants must try to 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.449
 run away when the child came out 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.040
 from the recipe he retrieves the ball 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.320
 here are the other children who are 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.189
 escaping we hypothesize of this child 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.659
 has come this far 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.290
 when I said baby he picked up the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.049
 speaks screams stop shouting stop 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.670
 everyone must absolutely stop and the 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.830
 child who is in the center has the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.990
 possibility to take three steps for 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.810
 then approach and mimic in 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.790
 meanwhile they fled but on this other 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.310
 that he ran away when he left three 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.200
 steps the child can hit one of the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.880
 throwing ball targets 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.610
 the children stopped after the stop 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.020
 they can't move absolutely already 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.240
 they can move the body but they must 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.799
 keep the shots fired if the child 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.140
 which is located in the center that has collected 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.000
 the ball that can take three steps is 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.250
 managed to hit another child of the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.110
 hit child will take the place 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.940
 in the center the formation of will resume 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.100
 circle will throw the ball you are 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.540
 will resume another game turn 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.630
 if instead the child has failed to 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.150
 hit one of his opponents here 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.740
 he will have to go back to the center himself 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.080
 will reform to the circle and recover 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.000
 a high game march the game how much 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.000
 from now to the end until
