should<00:00:44.110> have<00:00:44.140> started<00:00:44.560> the<00:00:44.650> clock<00:00:44.890> I<00:00:45.040> mean<00:00:45.190> I

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
should have started the clock I mean I

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.100 
should have started the clock I mean I
feel<00:00:47.860> like<00:00:51.240> I'm<00:00:52.240> gonna<00:00:52.360> move<00:00:52.600> a<00:00:52.660> couple<00:00:53.020> of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
feel like I'm gonna move a couple of

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.110 
feel like I'm gonna move a couple of
clicks<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:53.590> right<00:00:53.680> I'm<00:00:54.490> gonna<00:00:54.640> open<00:00:54.850> the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
clicks to the right I'm gonna open the

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.010 
clicks to the right I'm gonna open the
face<00:00:56.130> that<00:00:57.130> was<00:00:57.700> my<00:00:57.820> second<00:00:58.240> my<00:00:58.390> hand<00:00:58.600> used<00:00:58.870> my

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
face that was my second my hand used my

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.960 
face that was my second my hand used my
wrench<00:00:59.290> because<00:01:00.040> it's<00:01:00.190> not<00:01:00.310> my<00:01:00.430> life<00:01:00.670> of<00:01:00.850> use

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.569 
wrench because it's not my life of use
the<00:01:01.120> wrench<00:01:01.329> by<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.630> way<00:01:01.980> my<00:01:02.980> walking<00:01:03.400> path

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
the wrench by the way my walking path

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.219 
the wrench by the way my walking path
for<00:01:03.820> that<00:01:04.409> turn<00:01:05.409> until<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:07.450> get<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:07.750> click<00:01:07.990> and

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
for that turn until to get the click and

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.550 
for that turn until to get the click and
see<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.500> light<00:01:09.000> see<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.119> life

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
see the light see the life

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.980 
see the light see the life
here<00:01:12.549> we<00:01:12.610> go<00:01:15.210> well<00:01:16.210> I<00:01:16.240> think<00:01:16.390> this<00:01:16.659> is<00:01:16.869> the

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
here we go well I think this is the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.450 
here we go well I think this is the
interesting<00:01:17.229> part<00:01:17.560> of<00:01:17.680> this<00:01:17.799> technologies

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
interesting part of this technologies

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.230 
interesting part of this technologies

everyday your wakeup feels a little

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.529 
everyday your wakeup feels a little
different<00:01:23.200> you<00:01:24.130> know<00:01:24.280> that's<00:01:25.210> one<00:01:25.390> of<00:01:25.420> the

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
different you know that's one of the

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:26.940 
different you know that's one of the
things<00:01:25.750> that's<00:01:25.930> so<00:01:25.960> frustrating<00:01:26.259> specially

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
things that's so frustrating specially

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.029 
things that's so frustrating specially
for<00:01:27.100> me<00:01:27.189> as<00:01:27.250> a<00:01:27.369> perfectionist<00:01:27.939> is<00:01:28.509> that<00:01:29.039> you

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
for me as a perfectionist is that you

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.999 
for me as a perfectionist is that you
know<00:01:30.159> I<00:01:30.869> expect<00:01:31.869> to<00:01:31.960> hit<00:01:32.080> balls<00:01:32.350> until<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.770> Sun

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
know I expect to hit balls until the Sun

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.740 
know I expect to hit balls until the Sun
Goes<00:01:33.039> Down<00:01:33.250> tonight<00:01:33.610> and<00:01:34.360> then<00:01:34.600> tomorrow

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
Goes Down tonight and then tomorrow

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.389 
Goes Down tonight and then tomorrow
morning<00:01:35.200> when<00:01:35.439> I<00:01:35.470> wake<00:01:35.679> up<00:01:35.860> for<00:01:36.100> it<00:01:36.189> to<00:01:36.280> be

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
morning when I wake up for it to be

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.910 
morning when I wake up for it to be
exactly<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:36.909> same<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:37.270> it<00:01:37.329> never<00:01:37.539> hit<00:01:37.920> 22

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
exactly the same and it never hit 22

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.730 
exactly the same and it never hit 22
years<00:01:39.340> now<00:01:39.549> it's<00:01:39.729> really<00:01:40.000> bugging<00:01:40.390> me<00:01:40.570> but<00:01:41.229> I'm

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
years now it's really bugging me but I'm

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.859 
years now it's really bugging me but I'm
starting<00:01:42.039> to<00:01:42.130> come<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:43.119> realization<00:01:43.720> that

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
starting to come the realization that

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.149 
starting to come the realization that
that's<00:01:44.020> not<00:01:44.259> going<00:01:44.440> to<00:01:44.500> change<00:01:44.740> it's<00:01:45.009> just

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
that's not going to change it's just

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.100 
that's not going to change it's just
unfortunately<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:46.390> way<00:01:46.539> it<00:01:46.659> is<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:46.990> that's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
unfortunately the way it is and that's

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.230 
unfortunately the way it is and that's
why<00:01:47.289> I<00:01:47.319> think<00:01:47.500> with<00:01:48.340> technology<00:01:48.549> like<00:01:49.060> this

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
why I think with technology like this

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.460 
why I think with technology like this
you<00:01:49.360> can<00:01:49.600> tweak<00:01:49.899> it<00:01:50.080> here<00:01:52.350> changes<00:01:53.350> the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
you can tweak it here changes the

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.949 
you can tweak it here changes the
amounts<00:01:53.860> that<00:01:54.100> you're<00:01:54.670> moving<00:01:54.939> in<00:01:55.030> edges<00:01:55.299> plus

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
amounts that you're moving in edges plus

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.080 
amounts that you're moving in edges plus
or<00:01:56.140> minus<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.709> reason<00:01:57.220> all<00:01:57.340> directions<00:01:57.640> so

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
or minus to reason all directions so

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.999 
or minus to reason all directions so
literally<00:01:58.450> four<00:01:58.720> degrees<00:01:59.049> difference<00:01:59.470> yeah

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
literally four degrees difference yeah

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.279 
literally four degrees difference yeah
so<00:02:02.909> yes<00:02:03.909> I<00:02:04.179> do<00:02:04.299> think<00:02:04.450> you<00:02:04.750> can<00:02:04.780> change<00:02:05.049> it<00:02:05.259> a

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
so yes I do think you can change it a

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.410 
so yes I do think you can change it a
little<00:02:05.380> bit<00:02:05.500> here<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:06.640> then<00:02:06.759> depending<00:02:07.299> on

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
little bit here and then depending on

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.509 
little bit here and then depending on
how<00:02:07.509> you<00:02:07.569> feel<00:02:07.840> let's<00:02:08.709> see<00:02:08.830> how<00:02:08.920> this<00:02:09.069> goes<00:02:09.280> now

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
how you feel let's see how this goes now

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.000 
how you feel let's see how this goes now
that<00:02:09.700> I've<00:02:09.789> changed<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.209> position<00:02:10.390> of

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
that I've changed the position of

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.459 
that I've changed the position of
the<00:02:13.310> angles<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:13.760> it

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:18.469 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:03:18.580 

it's<00:02:20.719> all<00:02:21.719> because<00:02:22.079> I<00:02:55.459> so<00:02:56.459> much<00:02:56.609> easier<00:03:16.700> stage

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
it's all because I so much easier stage

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.920 
it's all because I so much easier stage
and<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:20.189> obviously<00:03:21.150> we<00:03:21.299> had<00:03:21.389> so<00:03:21.629> many<00:03:21.690> great

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
and so obviously we had so many great

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.309 
and so obviously we had so many great
results<00:03:22.409> with<00:03:22.530> an<00:03:22.620> eye<00:03:22.709> 1kj<00:03:23.459> one<00:03:23.900> who<00:03:24.900> else<00:03:25.079> one

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
results with an eye 1kj one who else one

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.110 
results with an eye 1kj one who else one
here<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.829> Anthony<00:03:26.310> Kim<00:03:26.519> one<00:03:26.729> couple<00:03:27.060> you
