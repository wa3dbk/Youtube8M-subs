00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.660 
things right now this in mind this is
out<00:01:20.990> of<00:01:21.020> fiberglass<00:01:21.499> but<00:01:21.679> eventually<00:01:21.859> the

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
out of fiberglass but eventually the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.770 
out of fiberglass but eventually the
production<00:01:23.060> car<00:01:23.179> will<00:01:23.329> be<00:01:23.420> out<00:01:23.509> of<00:01:23.539> carbon

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
production car will be out of carbon

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.149 
production car will be out of carbon
fiber<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.229> we've<00:01:24.350> had<00:01:24.380> a<00:01:24.469> couple<00:01:24.619> good<00:01:24.859> people

you<00:01:33.570> know<00:01:33.720> namely<00:01:34.260> the<00:01:34.800> center<00:01:35.610> display<00:01:36.060> which

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
you know namely the center display which

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.930 
you know namely the center display which
is<00:01:36.420> an<00:01:36.720> integral<00:01:37.230> part<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.560> our<00:01:37.710> car<00:01:37.980> we've<00:01:38.700> had

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
is an integral part of our car we've had

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.820 
is an integral part of our car we've had
two<00:01:39.150> manufacturers<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.050> those<00:01:40.200> come<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.740> us

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
two manufacturers and those come to us

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.790 
two manufacturers and those come to us
today<00:01:41.040> they<00:01:42.030> can<00:01:42.090> custom<00:01:42.690> design<00:01:42.720> us<00:01:43.470> our<00:01:43.740> own

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
today they can custom design us our own

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.910 
today they can custom design us our own
discipline<00:01:44.630> therefore<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.350> make<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.830> a

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
discipline therefore we can make it a

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.370 
discipline therefore we can make it a
