select<00:00:54.600> reeds<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.110> think<00:00:55.620> as<00:00:55.829> an<00:00:56.010> artist<00:00:56.250> not

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
select reeds I think as an artist not

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.970 
select reeds I think as an artist not
just<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.390> saxophone<00:00:57.960> player<00:00:57.989> or<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> musician

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
just a saxophone player or a musician

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.860 
just a saxophone player or a musician
but<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.489> an<00:00:59.640> actual<00:00:59.910> artist<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.719> real

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
but as an actual artist it's real

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.369 
but as an actual artist it's real
important<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.379> keep<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.100> sense<00:01:02.449> of<00:01:03.449> your<00:01:04.320> own

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379

little<00:01:40.590> more<00:01:40.920> buzzy<00:01:41.250> than<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.520> wanted<00:01:41.939> um<00:01:42.689> a

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
little more buzzy than I wanted um a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.380 
little more buzzy than I wanted um a
good<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.560> good<00:01:43.799> example<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.729> me<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.299> my

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
good a good example of to me one of my

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.170 
good a good example of to me one of my
favorite<00:01:45.750> saxophone<00:01:46.200> sounds<00:01:46.680> from<00:01:46.920> a

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
favorite saxophone sounds from a

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.760 
favorite saxophone sounds from a
straight-ahead<00:01:48.180> jazz<00:01:48.439> master<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.560> Sonny

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
straight-ahead jazz master is Sonny

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.510 
straight-ahead jazz master is Sonny
Rollins<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.369> he<00:01:50.850> always<00:01:51.000> had<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:52.100> fat<00:01:53.100> sound

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
Rollins and he always had a fat sound

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.600 
Rollins and he always had a fat sound
but<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.299> bite<00:01:55.110> eNOS<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.340> always

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
but a bite eNOS to it and so I always

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:05.090 
but a bite eNOS to it and so I always
like<00:01:56.880> that

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.530 

so<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.160> can<00:02:06.400> like<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:06.880> can<00:02:07.030> still<00:02:07.270> have<00:02:07.420> some

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
so you can like you can still have some

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.359 
so you can like you can still have some
inflection<00:02:08.050> in<00:02:08.140> it<00:02:08.290> but<00:02:08.680> it<00:02:08.800> still<00:02:09.040> pops

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
inflection in it but it still pops

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.760 
inflection in it but it still pops
sometimes<00:02:10.149> people<00:02:10.840> will<00:02:10.990> get<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.140> mushy<00:02:11.470> to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
sometimes people will get a mushy to

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.020 
sometimes people will get a mushy to
kind<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.070> sound<00:02:12.280> if<00:02:12.460> they're<00:02:12.580> trying<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.820> sound

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
kind of sound if they're trying to sound

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.420 
kind of sound if they're trying to sound

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
saxophone sound but I like some

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.370 
saxophone sound but I like some
crispness<00:02:24.220> but<00:02:24.850> just<00:02:25.660> so<00:02:25.780> it's<00:02:25.900> got<00:02:26.050> an<00:02:26.170> edge

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
crispness but just so it's got an edge

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.790 
crispness but just so it's got an edge
but<00:02:26.920> also<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.520> old-school<00:02:30.210> Nespresso<00:02:31.800> when

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
but also the old-school Nespresso when

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.680 
but also the old-school Nespresso when
it<00:02:32.890> comes<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.160> articulating<00:02:33.760> if<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.330> if<00:02:34.540> you

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
it comes to articulating if you if you

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.510 
it comes to articulating if you if you
move<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.080> read<00:02:35.260> up<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.709> little<00:02:35.740> bit<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:36.370> it's

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
move the read up a little bit so it's

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.190 
move the read up a little bit so it's
closer<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.300> actual<00:02:37.570> tip<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.110> the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
closer to the actual tip of the

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.590 
closer to the actual tip of the
mouthpiece<00:02:38.320> so<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:39.370> sits<00:02:39.580> like<00:02:39.820> flush<00:02:40.390> with

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
mouthpiece so it sits like flush with

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.500 
mouthpiece so it sits like flush with
the<00:02:40.720> facing<00:02:41.110> or<00:02:41.230> maybe<00:02:41.380> a<00:02:41.500> smidge<00:02:41.770> above<00:02:42.510> it

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
the facing or maybe a smidge above it

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.390 
the facing or maybe a smidge above it
will<00:02:43.810> make<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.200> read<00:02:44.380> in<00:02:44.560> essence<00:02:44.920> seem<00:02:45.370> a

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
will make the read in essence seem a

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.400 
will make the read in essence seem a
little<00:02:45.640> stiffer<00:02:46.180> it'll<00:02:46.750> keep<00:02:46.900> your<00:02:47.050> your

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
little stiffer it'll keep your your

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.640 
little stiffer it'll keep your your
pitch<00:02:47.650> up<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:48.160> little<00:02:48.400> bit<00:02:48.490> more<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:49.750> will<00:02:50.050> maybe

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
pitch up a little bit more it will maybe

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.080 
pitch up a little bit more it will maybe
add<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:50.950> little<00:02:51.070> more<00:02:51.280> color<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.580> your<00:02:51.790> sound

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
add a little more color to your sound

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.130 
add a little more color to your sound
but<00:02:52.540> articulation<00:02:53.260> wise<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:54.610> might<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.870> can

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
but articulation wise you might it can

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.080 
but articulation wise you might it can
make<00:02:56.380> make<00:02:56.830> make<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.400> suffer<00:02:57.820> a<00:02:57.880> little<00:02:57.970> bit

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
make make make that suffer a little bit

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.820 
make make make that suffer a little bit
Johnny<00:02:58.930> Griffin<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.530> lot<00:02:59.680> of<00:02:59.709> the

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
Johnny Griffin and a lot of the

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.800 
Johnny Griffin and a lot of the
old-school<00:03:00.070> guys<00:03:00.340> like<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.270> were

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
old-school guys like that that were

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.570 
old-school guys like that that were
Chicago<00:03:02.320> players<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.830> used<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.070> let<00:03:03.190> me<00:03:03.370> sit

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
Chicago players that used to let me sit

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.280 
Chicago players that used to let me sit
in<00:03:03.730> with<00:03:03.820> them<00:03:04.030> they<00:03:04.720> would<00:03:04.840> actually<00:03:04.990> play

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
in with them they would actually play

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.840 
in with them they would actually play
like<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:05.470> really<00:03:05.860> soft<00:03:06.040> I<00:03:06.220> think<00:03:06.430> he<00:03:06.519> used<00:03:06.670> like

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
like a really soft I think he used like

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.050 
like a really soft I think he used like
a<00:03:06.880> Rico<00:03:07.800> just<00:03:08.800> like<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.070> red<00:03:09.250> box<00:03:09.459> number<00:03:09.850> two

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
a Rico just like the red box number two

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.910 
a Rico just like the red box number two
it<00:03:10.209> was<00:03:10.239> like<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.420> really<00:03:10.720> soft<00:03:10.900> read<00:03:11.350> because

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
it was like a really soft read because

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.770 
it was like a really soft read because
you<00:03:12.010> wanted<00:03:12.280> that<00:03:12.400> quick<00:03:12.700> articulation<00:03:13.420> you

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
you wanted that quick articulation you

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.509 
you wanted that quick articulation you
can<00:03:13.989> do<00:03:14.140> that<00:03:14.290> I<00:03:14.350> use<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.800> two<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.070> a<00:03:15.100> half<00:03:15.280> if

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
can do that I use the two and a half if

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.100 
can do that I use the two and a half if
I'm<00:03:15.910> feeling<00:03:16.120> like<00:03:16.300> I<00:03:16.450> want<00:03:16.690> that<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.900> little

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
I'm feeling like I want that a little

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.320 
I'm feeling like I want that a little
bit<00:03:17.200> more<00:03:17.350> I<00:03:17.530> can<00:03:17.860> move<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.280> reed<00:03:18.519> down<00:03:18.820> just<00:03:19.239> a

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
bit more I can move the reed down just a

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.570 
bit more I can move the reed down just a
smidge<00:03:19.540> ysou<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.230> so<00:03:20.500> when<00:03:20.950> you<00:03:21.070> when<00:03:21.459> you

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
smidge ysou is so when you when you

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.880 
smidge ysou is so when you when you
press<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.150> read<00:03:22.360> to<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.959> facing<00:03:23.410> you'll<00:03:23.709> see

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
press the read to the facing you'll see

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.680 
press the read to the facing you'll see
like<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.070> little<00:03:24.370> sliver<00:03:24.610> like<00:03:24.940> Halfmoon<00:03:25.480> it

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
like a little sliver like Halfmoon it

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.290 
like a little sliver like Halfmoon it
might<00:03:26.019> only<00:03:26.140> be<00:03:26.260> like<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.500> millimeter<00:03:27.030> lower<00:03:28.030> or

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
might only be like a millimeter lower or

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.520 
might only be like a millimeter lower or
a<00:03:28.330> millimeter<00:03:28.660> higher<00:03:28.900> but<00:03:29.350> it<00:03:29.440> actually

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
a millimeter higher but it actually
