00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.690 

I<00:04:05.530> moved<00:04:05.950> on<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:06.310> something<00:04:06.520> too<00:04:08.070> not<00:04:09.070> really

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
I moved on to something too not really

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.190 
I moved on to something too not really
new<00:04:09.970> in<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.270> sense<00:04:10.450> that<00:04:10.570> we<00:04:10.660> haven't<00:04:10.990> seen

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
new in the sense that we haven't seen

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.360 
new in the sense that we haven't seen
anything<00:04:11.440> like<00:04:11.620> it<00:04:11.680> before<00:04:11.860> because<00:04:12.190> it's

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
anything like it before because it's

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.310 
anything like it before because it's
really<00:04:12.460> going<00:04:12.640> to<00:04:12.700> be<00:04:12.790> more<00:04:13.060> of<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.210> same<00:04:13.320> but

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
really going to be more of the same but

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.190 
really going to be more of the same but
as<00:04:15.100> you<00:04:15.220> can<00:04:15.340> tell<00:04:15.400> he<00:04:15.820> kind<00:04:16.060> of<00:04:16.209> changes<00:04:16.870> forms

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
as you can tell he kind of changes forms

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.990 
as you can tell he kind of changes forms
randomly<00:04:17.709> now<00:04:20.160> plasma<00:04:21.160> beam<00:04:21.370> form<00:04:21.790> is

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
randomly now plasma beam form is

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.130 
randomly now plasma beam form is
probably<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.450> best<00:04:22.600> because<00:04:22.780> it<00:04:22.960> takes

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
probably the best because it takes

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.390 
probably the best because it takes
damage<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.710> fastest<00:04:24.540> and<00:04:25.590> all<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.890> beams<00:04:27.130> are

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
damage the fastest and all the beams are

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.370 
damage the fastest and all the beams are
like<00:04:27.550> equally<00:04:28.060> devastating<00:04:28.300> if<00:04:28.990> they<00:04:29.170> hate

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
like equally devastating if they hate

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.440 
like equally devastating if they hate
you<00:04:29.560> which<00:04:30.160> they<00:04:30.370> shouldn't<00:04:30.790> be<00:04:30.850> if<00:04:31.270> you're

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
you which they shouldn't be if you're

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.470 
you which they shouldn't be if you're
good<00:04:31.630> enough<00:04:31.920> so<00:04:32.940> that's<00:04:33.940> not<00:04:34.180> really<00:04:34.390> Oh<00:04:34.810> God

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
good enough so that's not really Oh God

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.460 
good enough so that's not really Oh God
definitely<00:04:37.480> yeah<00:04:37.750> I'm<00:04:37.870> probably<00:04:38.080> gonna<00:04:38.260> die

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
definitely yeah I'm probably gonna die

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.940 
definitely yeah I'm probably gonna die
here<00:04:38.500> ok<00:04:39.160> maybe<00:04:39.280> not<00:04:40.380> ok<00:04:41.380> a<00:04:41.410> new<00:04:43.650> opinion<00:04:44.650> on

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
here ok maybe not ok a new opinion on

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.130 
here ok maybe not ok a new opinion on
that<00:04:45.210> plasma<00:04:46.210> beam<00:04:46.360> is<00:04:46.480> definitely<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:46.990> worst

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
that plasma beam is definitely the worst

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.690 
that plasma beam is definitely the worst
because<00:04:47.380> it<00:04:47.530> continues<00:04:47.950> to<00:04:48.070> damage<00:04:48.400> you<00:04:48.490> long

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
because it continues to damage you long

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.720 
because it continues to damage you long
after<00:04:48.880> you've<00:04:49.120> been<00:04:49.210> ahead<00:04:49.620> so<00:04:50.620> yeah<00:04:51.370> you<00:04:51.430> kind

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
after you've been ahead so yeah you kind

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.220 
after you've been ahead so yeah you kind
of<00:04:51.760> don't<00:04:51.850> want<00:04:51.940> to<00:04:52.120> get<00:04:52.210> hit<00:04:52.300> by<00:04:52.450> that<00:04:55.230> now

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
of don't want to get hit by that now

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.930 
of don't want to get hit by that now
this<00:04:56.410> guy<00:04:56.560> just<00:04:56.620> changes<00:04:57.190> forms<00:04:57.520> all<00:04:57.640> the<00:04:57.760> time

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
this guy just changes forms all the time

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.120 
this guy just changes forms all the time
is<00:04:58.150> kind<00:04:58.419> of<00:04:58.570> an<00:04:58.660> asshole

don't really have anything better to
call<00:05:08.790> them<00:05:08.970> other<00:05:09.180> than<00:05:09.210> like<00:05:09.449> the<00:05:09.600> glowing

bender<00:05:17.400> said<00:05:17.669> on<00:05:17.790> an<00:05:17.910> episode<00:05:18.150> of<00:05:18.300> futurama<00:05:18.889> it

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
bender said on an episode of futurama it

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.890 
bender said on an episode of futurama it
was<00:05:20.010> just<00:05:20.130> a<00:05:20.280> funny<00:05:20.460> word<00:05:20.699> that<00:05:20.970> came<00:05:21.660> to<00:05:21.720> mind

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
was just a funny word that came to mind

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.990 
was just a funny word that came to mind
when<00:05:22.290> I<00:05:22.410> thought<00:05:22.650> of<00:05:22.800> those<00:05:22.979> things

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.520 

so<00:05:30.000> yeah<00:05:30.120> it's<00:05:30.270> pretty<00:05:30.420> much<00:05:30.630> just<00:05:30.690> shooting

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
so yeah it's pretty much just shooting

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.950 
so yeah it's pretty much just shooting
and<00:05:31.980> changing<00:05:32.700> and<00:05:32.880> shooting<00:05:33.270> and<00:05:33.420> dodging

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
and changing and shooting and dodging

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.750 
and changing and shooting and dodging
and<00:05:34.220> whatnot<00:05:35.220> over<00:05:35.700> and<00:05:35.820> over<00:05:35.910> it's<00:05:37.430> it<00:05:38.430> really

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
and whatnot over and over it's it really

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.520 
and whatnot over and over it's it really
gets<00:05:38.880> quite<00:05:39.240> monotonous<00:05:39.540> after<00:05:40.110> a<00:05:40.140> while<00:05:40.290> but

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
gets quite monotonous after a while but

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.340 
gets quite monotonous after a while but
you<00:05:40.590> can't<00:05:40.860> let<00:05:41.070> your<00:05:41.190> focus<00:05:41.510> slip<00:05:42.510> for<00:05:42.870> very

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
you can't let your focus slip for very

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.470 
you can't let your focus slip for very
well<00:05:43.560> god<00:05:43.860> you<00:05:44.580> can't<00:05:44.790> let<00:05:44.910> your<00:05:44.970> focus<00:05:45.180> look

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
well god you can't let your focus look

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.820 
well god you can't let your focus look
for<00:05:45.630> very<00:05:45.780> long<00:05:45.990> or<00:05:46.230> else<00:05:46.260> you're<00:05:46.620> going<00:05:46.740> to

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
for very long or else you're going to

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.580 
for very long or else you're going to
get<00:05:46.920> on<00:05:48.530> here<00:05:49.530> I'm<00:05:49.680> just<00:05:49.710> I<00:05:50.190> oh<00:05:50.670> god<00:05:51.470> don't<00:05:52.470> know

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
get on here I'm just I oh god don't know

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.560 
get on here I'm just I oh god don't know
how<00:05:52.710> I<00:05:52.740> dodged<00:05:53.070> those<00:05:53.370> I<00:05:56.150> think<00:05:57.150> those<00:05:57.330> things

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
how I dodged those I think those things

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.030 
how I dodged those I think those things
can<00:05:57.750> be<00:05:57.810> an<00:05:57.960> instant<00:05:58.320> kill<00:05:58.500> if<00:05:58.620> they<00:05:58.740> hate<00:05:58.890> you

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
can be an instant kill if they hate you

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:06.490 
can be an instant kill if they hate you
I'm<00:05:59.940> not<00:06:00.120> sure<00:06:00.180> though

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.790 

okay<00:06:07.500> so<00:06:07.560> I<00:06:08.930> think<00:06:09.930> he's<00:06:10.020> about<00:06:10.140> halfway<00:06:10.260> done

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
okay so I think he's about halfway done

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.710 
okay so I think he's about halfway done
I<00:06:10.860> think<00:06:11.190> you<00:06:11.250> have<00:06:11.340> to<00:06:11.460> like<00:06:11.910> get<00:06:12.210> the<00:06:12.360> damage

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
I think you have to like get the damage

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.110 
I think you have to like get the damage
animation<00:06:13.260> on<00:06:13.350> him<00:06:13.470> four<00:06:13.740> times<00:06:16.820> and<00:06:17.820> he<00:06:17.940> does

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
animation on him four times and he does

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.020 
animation on him four times and he does
get<00:06:18.300> more<00:06:18.540> annoying<00:06:18.840> as<00:06:19.400> this<00:06:20.400> part<00:06:20.850> of<00:06:20.970> the

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
get more annoying as this part of the

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.760 
get more annoying as this part of the
battle<00:06:21.210> goes<00:06:21.690> on<00:06:21.900> does<00:06:22.230> eventually<00:06:22.440> he'll

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
battle goes on does eventually he'll

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.230 
battle goes on does eventually he'll
just<00:06:22.980> start<00:06:23.100> charging<00:06:23.640> you<00:06:23.670> with<00:06:23.790> little<00:06:24.150> or

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200 
can't really leave those alone e there

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.160 
can't really leave those alone e there
are<00:06:43.350> else<00:06:43.530> they'll<00:06:43.860> do<00:06:44.400> an<00:06:44.760> instant<00:06:45.390> 99<00:06:45.780> damage

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.170 
are else they'll do an instant 99 damage

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.720 
are else they'll do an instant 99 damage
to<00:06:46.320> you<00:06:46.410> and<00:06:46.560> want<00:06:46.680> to<00:06:46.710> hit<00:06:46.890> and<00:06:47.100> obviously

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.730 
to you and want to hit and obviously

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.060

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.790 

so<00:06:51.610> I<00:06:51.970> guess<00:06:52.510> the<00:06:52.750> lesser<00:06:53.050> of<00:06:53.080> two<00:06:53.170> evils<00:06:53.260> is<00:06:53.680> to

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
so I guess the lesser of two evils is to

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.590 
so I guess the lesser of two evils is to
get<00:06:53.920> hit<00:06:54.070> by<00:06:54.160> the<00:06:54.220> charge<00:06:57.210> luckily<00:06:58.210> I<00:06:58.300> rarely

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600 
get hit by the charge luckily I rarely

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.440 
get hit by the charge luckily I rarely
have<00:06:58.750> to<00:06:58.960> make<00:06:59.110> that<00:06:59.290> choice<00:07:00.150> that<00:07:01.150> was<00:07:01.270> weird

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.450 
have to make that choice that was weird

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.540 
have to make that choice that was weird
see<00:07:02.350> that<00:07:02.500> he<00:07:02.620> lay<00:07:02.740> changed<00:07:03.070> from<00:07:03.160> ice<00:07:03.340> to

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.550

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.820 
see that he lay changed from ice to
plasma<00:07:04.000> switch<00:07:04.270> to<00:07:04.420> plasma<00:07:04.870> they<00:07:05.350> switch<00:07:05.590> back

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830 
plasma switch to plasma they switch back

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.629 
plasma switch to plasma they switch back
to<00:07:05.860> ice<00:07:06.130> as<00:07:06.430> the<00:07:06.460> shot<00:07:06.940> at<00:07:07.180> him
