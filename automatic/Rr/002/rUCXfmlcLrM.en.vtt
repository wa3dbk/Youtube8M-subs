00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
going to do a few examples here and I'd

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.590 
going to do a few examples here and I'd
like<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.129> start<00:00:02.370> out<00:00:02.580> with<00:00:02.610> that<00:00:03.060> taking<00:00:03.360> power

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
like to start out with that taking power

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.749 
like to start out with that taking power
of<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.959> complex<00:00:04.350> number<00:00:04.470> so<00:00:05.069> what<00:00:05.580> we're<00:00:05.670> going

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
of a complex number so what we're going

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.330 
of a complex number so what we're going
to<00:00:05.879> do<00:00:05.940> is<00:00:06.740> we're<00:00:07.740> going<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.010> take<00:00:08.189> this

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
to do is we're going to take this

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.120 
to do is we're going to take this
particular<00:00:08.610> complex<00:00:09.120> number<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:10.469> cubit

write negative one minus I and where you

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.129 
write negative one minus I and where you
use<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.740> monster<00:00:14.160> ins<00:00:14.509> that<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.870> way<00:00:15.990> that

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
use the monster ins that is the way that

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.900 
use the monster ins that is the way that
we<00:00:16.289> find<00:00:16.529> or<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.190> most<00:00:17.369> effective<00:00:17.760> way<00:00:17.880> to

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
we find or the most effective way to

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.580 
we find or the most effective way to
find<00:00:18.210> out<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:19.279> power<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:21.470> complex<00:00:22.470> number

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
find out the power of a complex number

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.700 
find out the power of a complex number
okay<00:00:23.490> now<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.670> our<00:00:23.910> first<00:00:24.119> task<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.410> put

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
okay now that our first task is to put

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.189 
okay now that our first task is to put
this<00:00:25.830> into<00:00:26.070> polar<00:00:26.430> form<00:00:26.820> okay<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.900> i<00:00:28.050> also

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
this into polar form okay and i also

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.230 
this into polar form okay and i also
like<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.380> start<00:00:28.680> out<00:00:28.769> by<00:00:28.890> putting<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.429> diagram

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
like to start out by putting a diagram

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.560 
like to start out by putting a diagram
because<00:00:31.489> it's<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.610> good<00:00:32.730> reference<00:00:32.910> point<00:00:33.120> and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
because it's a good reference point and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.240 
because it's a good reference point and
it<00:00:33.719> just<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.079> don't<00:00:34.230> know<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:34.829> helps<00:00:35.160> you

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
it just I don't know it just helps you

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.040 
it just I don't know it just helps you
see<00:00:35.489> what's<00:00:35.640> going<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.480> let's<00:00:36.690> take<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> look

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
see what's going on so let's take a look

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.340 
see what's going on so let's take a look
at<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.410> know<00:00:38.149> that<00:00:39.149> we're<00:00:39.300> going<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
at this we know that we're going the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.470 
at this we know that we're going the
real<00:00:40.559> part<00:00:40.920> we're<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.100> negative<00:00:41.460> one<00:00:41.879> right

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
real part we're going negative one right

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.440 
real part we're going negative one right
down<00:00:43.280> right<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> real<00:00:44.789> part<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.120> negative

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
down right so the real part is negative

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.569 
down right so the real part is negative
one<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.469> also<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.800> complex<00:00:47.160> part<00:00:47.460> we're

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
one and also the complex part we're

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.069 
one and also the complex part we're
bringing<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.879> down<00:00:48.000> negative<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:48.719> we're

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
bringing it down negative one so we're

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.029 
bringing it down negative one so we're
right<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:49.320> okay<00:00:51.020> so<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.350> then<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.890> is

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
right here okay so this is then this is

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.400 
right here okay so this is then this is
the<00:00:53.070> number<00:00:53.730> right<00:00:53.879> here<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.750> see<00:00:54.960> clearly

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
the number right here so we see clearly

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.209 
the number right here so we see clearly
what<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.120> our<00:01:00.289> 45<00:01:01.289> 45<00:01:01.530> degree

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
what we have is one of our 45 45 degree

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.189 
what we have is one of our 45 45 degree
triangles<00:01:02.670> right<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.570> if<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:03.930> look<00:01:03.960> at<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
triangles right so if we look at the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.500 
triangles right so if we look at the
reference<00:01:04.559> angle<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:05.299> alright<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.450> is

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
reference angle here alright this is

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.340 
reference angle here alright this is
simply<00:01:06.780> going<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.049> 45<00:01:07.500> right<00:01:07.880> right<00:01:08.880> here

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
simply going to be 45 right right here

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.020 
simply going to be 45 right right here
so<00:01:10.350> let's<00:01:10.979> take<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.220> look<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:11.520> what's<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:11.909> on

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
so let's take a look at what's going on

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.969 
so let's take a look at what's going on
so<00:01:12.240> let's<00:01:12.450> start<00:01:12.659> by<00:01:12.840> finding<00:01:13.080> are<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.740> we<00:01:13.830> want

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
so let's start by finding are so we want

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.560 
so let's start by finding are so we want
to<00:01:14.010> find<00:01:14.130> out<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.460> distance<00:01:14.850> here<00:01:14.880> are<00:01:15.210> of

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
to find out this distance here are of

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.450 
to find out this distance here are of
course<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.170> find<00:01:16.350> out<00:01:16.500> any<00:01:17.130> number<00:01:17.430> of

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
course we can find out any number of

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.929 
course we can find out any number of
ways<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.320> use<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.400> use<00:01:20.460> tangent

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
ways but you can use you can use tangent

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.429 
ways but you can use you can use tangent
theta<00:01:20.970> if<00:01:21.330> you'd<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.810> if<00:01:21.990> that's<00:01:22.259> your

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
theta if you'd like it if that's your

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.719 
theta if you'd like it if that's your
preference<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:22.950> was<00:01:23.189> like<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.549> kind<00:01:23.700> of

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
preference but I was like just kind of

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.160 
preference but I was like just kind of
like<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.939> diagram<00:01:24.330> see<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.630> well<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.110> know

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
like the diagram see you well you know

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.440 
like the diagram see you well you know
what<00:01:25.350> what<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.250> simply<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> simple

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
what what we have is a simply a simple

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.999 
what what we have is a simply a simple
triangle<00:01:27.960> here<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.650> simply<00:01:28.829> use

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
triangle here we can simply use

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.929 
triangle here we can simply use
Pythagorean<00:01:29.700> right<00:01:32.210> there<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.360> go<00:01:34.939> negative

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
Pythagorean right there you go negative

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.760 
Pythagorean right there you go negative
1<00:01:36.030> squared<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:37.020> course<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.259> equals<00:01:37.619> root

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
1 squared and of course that equals root

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.399 
1 squared and of course that equals root
2<00:01:37.979> now<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.150> find<00:01:39.329> out<00:01:39.420> theta<00:01:39.630> our<00:01:40.259> next

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
2 now we have to find out theta our next

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.730 
2 now we have to find out theta our next
job<00:01:40.820> so<00:01:41.820> theta<00:01:42.119> again<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.320> know<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.649> use

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
job so theta again you know you can use

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.340 
job so theta again you know you can use
tangent<00:01:44.130> theta<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.119> again<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.869> actually

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
tangent theta but I again I actually

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.530 
tangent theta but I again I actually
like<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.829> look<00:01:46.950> down<00:01:47.430> at<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.670> diagram<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.270> I

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
like to look down at the diagram and I

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.929 
like to look down at the diagram and I
see<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.750> theta<00:01:49.140> simply<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.549> 180

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
see that theta simply is this is 180

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.440 
see that theta simply is this is 180
right<00:01:52.310> 180<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.610> then<00:01:53.759> we're<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.030> an<00:01:54.149> extra

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
right 180 and then we're going an extra

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.280 
right 180 and then we're going an extra
45<00:01:54.780> degrees<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.799> where<00:01:56.009> does<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.189> take<00:01:56.460> us

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
45 degrees so where does that take us

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.160 
45 degrees so where does that take us
225<00:01:58.290> degrees<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.700> theta<00:02:00.000> equals<00:02:01.520> 225<00:02:03.170> degrees

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
225 degrees so theta equals 225 degrees

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.010 
225 degrees so theta equals 225 degrees
okay<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:05.460> now<00:02:06.000> we're<00:02:06.240> ready<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.479> put<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.750> into

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
okay so now we're ready to put it into

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.990 
okay so now we're ready to put it into
polar<00:02:07.259> form<00:02:07.710> here<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.220> let's<00:02:08.580> take<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> look<00:02:08.910> at

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
polar form here and let's take a look at

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.210 
polar form here and let's take a look at
what<00:02:09.030> we<00:02:09.179> have<00:02:09.330> here<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.629> are<00:02:09.929> which<00:02:10.860> are<00:02:11.009> going

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
what we have here we are which are going

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.490 
what we have here we are which are going
to<00:02:11.280> see<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.459> root<00:02:11.640> 2

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
to see is root 2

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.280 
to see is root 2
and<00:02:13.620> then<00:02:14.070> I'm<00:02:14.220> going<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.490> put<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:14.960> this<00:02:15.960> part

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
and then I'm going to put in this part

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:27.280 
and then I'm going to put in this part
the<00:02:16.500> trig<00:02:16.740> form<00:02:17.180> cosine<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.450> 2<00:02:19.020> 25<00:02:22.220> plus<00:02:23.220> i<00:02:24.470> sine

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
the trig form cosine of 2 25 plus i sine

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.150 
the trig form cosine of 2 25 plus i sine
225<00:02:28.290> degrees<00:02:29.420> now<00:02:30.420> what<00:02:30.570> I'm<00:02:30.660> going<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.810> do<00:02:31.160> is

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
225 degrees now what I'm going to do is

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.490 
225 degrees now what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:32.340> going<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.520> cube<00:02:32.820> this<00:02:33.030> whole<00:02:33.270> thing<00:02:33.570> right

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
I'm going to cube this whole thing right

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.340 
I'm going to cube this whole thing right
because<00:02:34.920> we<00:02:35.040> have<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.220> cube<00:02:35.459> this<00:02:36.350> now

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
because we have to cube this now

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.890 
because we have to cube this now
according<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.010> de<00:02:38.190> mom's<00:02:38.370> theorem<00:02:38.820> what<00:02:39.810> we

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
according to de mom's theorem what we

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.720 
according to de mom's theorem what we
can<00:02:40.050> do<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.410> basically<00:02:40.680> bring<00:02:41.130> all<00:02:41.340> these

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
can do is basically bring all these

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.150 
can do is basically bring all these
threes<00:02:42.120> down<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.750> what<00:02:42.930> happens<00:02:43.260> here<00:02:43.350> this

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
threes down so what happens here this

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
threes down so what happens here this
becomes<00:02:44.720> root<00:02:45.720> 2<00:02:48.020> cubed<00:02:49.020> right<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:50.640> we

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
becomes root 2 cubed right this we

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.820 
becomes root 2 cubed right this we
simply<00:02:51.390> pull<00:02:51.959> down<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.410> front<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.739> these

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
simply pull down in front of these

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.510 
simply pull down in front of these
degrees<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.610> this<00:02:53.760> becomes<00:02:54.739> cosine<00:02:55.739> of<00:02:57.140> 3

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
degrees so this becomes cosine of 3

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:07.729 
degrees so this becomes cosine of 3
times<00:02:59.570> 2<00:03:00.570> 25<00:03:02.780> plus<00:03:03.780> i<00:03:04.340> times<00:03:05.340> sine<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:06.739> three

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
times 2 25 plus i times sine of three

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.290 
times 2 25 plus i times sine of three
times<00:03:08.720> 225<00:03:09.739> okay<00:03:10.739> so<00:03:11.430> we<00:03:11.550> see<00:03:11.700> we<00:03:11.790> have<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:11.970> form

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
times 225 okay so we see we have a form

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.580 
times 225 okay so we see we have a form
here<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.900> actually<00:03:13.230> much<00:03:13.350> more

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
here that is actually much more

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.800 
here that is actually much more
digestible<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:14.459> much<00:03:15.270> easier<00:03:15.300> to<00:03:15.630> calculate

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
digestible and much easier to calculate

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.690 
digestible and much easier to calculate
because<00:03:16.230> we<00:03:16.410> can<00:03:16.620> simply<00:03:17.010> plug<00:03:17.160> in<00:03:17.220> 2<00:03:17.370> values

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
because we can simply plug in 2 values

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.210 
because we can simply plug in 2 values
and<00:03:18.380> figure<00:03:19.380> out<00:03:19.440> what<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.799> what<00:03:20.100> these

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
and figure out what the what these

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.910 
and figure out what the what these
particular<00:03:20.489> values<00:03:20.970> are<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:21.989> let's

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
particular values are so this let's

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.380 
particular values are so this let's
simplify<00:03:23.160> this<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.519> little<00:03:23.549> further<00:03:23.760> becomes

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
simplify this a little further becomes

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.729 
simplify this a little further becomes
cosine<00:03:24.630> of<00:03:26.780> 675<00:03:27.780> right<00:03:30.410> simply<00:03:31.410> multiply

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
cosine of 675 right simply multiply

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.600 
cosine of 675 right simply multiply
these<00:03:31.920> together<00:03:32.100> plus<00:03:32.519> i<00:03:33.950> sine<00:03:35.450> this<00:03:36.450> right

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
these together plus i sine this right

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.009 
these together plus i sine this right
675<00:03:39.830> great<00:03:40.830> so<00:03:41.070> this<00:03:41.190> darn<00:03:41.340> look<00:03:41.489> good<00:03:42.019> this

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
675 great so this darn look good this

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.220 
675 great so this darn look good this
root<00:03:43.709> 2<00:03:43.890> cubed<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.660> going<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.720> just<00:03:45.840> give<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.019> 2

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
root 2 cubed is going to just give you 2

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.449 
root 2 cubed is going to just give you 2
root<00:03:46.530> 2<00:03:46.560> okay<00:03:48.049> so<00:03:49.049> now<00:03:49.410> this<00:03:49.950> is<00:03:50.130> starting<00:03:50.400> to

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
root 2 okay so now this is starting to

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.530 
root 2 okay so now this is starting to
look<00:03:50.549> like<00:03:50.700> something<00:03:50.760> we<00:03:51.090> can<00:03:51.239> figure<00:03:51.420> out

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
look like something we can figure out

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.380 
look like something we can figure out
now<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.260> problem<00:03:52.470> is<00:03:52.620> 675<00:03:53.519> okay<00:03:54.060> now<00:03:54.150> we<00:03:54.209> could

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
now the problem is 675 okay now we could

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.030 
now the problem is 675 okay now we could
punch<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:55.049> our<00:03:55.230> calculator<00:03:55.650> but<00:03:55.829> i<00:03:55.890> think

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
punch that to our calculator but i think

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.229 
punch that to our calculator but i think
the<00:03:56.100> smarter<00:03:56.459> way<00:03:56.579> to<00:03:56.610> do<00:03:56.820> it<00:03:56.910> just<00:03:57.060> really

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
the smarter way to do it just really

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.060 
the smarter way to do it just really
figure<00:03:57.510> out<00:03:57.570> where<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:58.170> this<00:03:58.350> exactly<00:03:58.709> on<00:03:58.950> this

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
figure out where is this exactly on this

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.360 
figure out where is this exactly on this
graph<00:03:59.340> okay<00:04:00.269> now<00:04:00.480> 675<00:04:01.110> obviously<00:04:01.799> goes<00:04:01.980> past

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
graph okay now 675 obviously goes past

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.259 
graph okay now 675 obviously goes past
the<00:04:02.989> one<00:04:03.989> full<00:04:04.200> circle<00:04:04.790> so<00:04:05.790> now<00:04:05.940> we<00:04:06.000> have<00:04:06.180> to

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
the one full circle so now we have to

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.630 
the one full circle so now we have to
figure<00:04:06.360> out<00:04:06.510> exactly<00:04:07.079> how<00:04:07.739> far<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.220> is<00:04:08.280> and

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
figure out exactly how far that is and

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.500 
figure out exactly how far that is and
we<00:04:08.700> see<00:04:08.940> that<00:04:09.239> we<00:04:09.450> can<00:04:09.480> go<00:04:09.690> around<00:04:09.840> once<00:04:10.400> okay

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
we see that we can go around once okay

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:19.640 
we see that we can go around once okay
we<00:04:12.510> can<00:04:12.660> go<00:04:12.750> around<00:04:12.840> once<00:04:14.209> 675<00:04:17.060> 360<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.650> what

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
we can go around once 675 360 and what

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.420 
we can go around once 675 360 and what
we<00:04:19.769> have<00:04:19.890> left<00:04:20.100> we<00:04:20.400> have<00:04:21.390> 315<00:04:22.080> degrees<00:04:22.289> okay<00:04:22.710> so

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
we have left we have 315 degrees okay so

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.730 
we have left we have 315 degrees okay so
315<00:04:24.150> degrees<00:04:24.270> brings<00:04:24.840> us<00:04:24.960> right<00:04:24.990> around

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.290 

down<00:04:28.740> to<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:28.949> negative<00:04:29.130> 45<00:04:29.729> so<00:04:30.030> we<00:04:30.090> could<00:04:30.240> do

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
down to the negative 45 so we could do

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.400 
down to the negative 45 so we could do
it<00:04:30.419> this<00:04:30.539> way<00:04:30.750> so<00:04:31.710> let's<00:04:31.860> do<00:04:31.979> this<00:04:32.100> fake<00:04:32.330> cosine

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
it this way so let's do this fake cosine

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.439 
it this way so let's do this fake cosine
will<00:04:34.410> give<00:04:34.620> you<00:04:34.860> roughly<00:04:35.430> 3<00:04:35.729> 15<00:04:36.150> so<00:04:36.330> we're

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
will give you roughly 3 15 so we're

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.670 
will give you roughly 3 15 so we're
going<00:04:36.630> all<00:04:36.780> around<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.320> you<00:04:37.380> could<00:04:37.530> call<00:04:37.650> it

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
going all around and you could call it

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.520 
going all around and you could call it
negative<00:04:38.039> 45<00:04:38.430> degrees<00:04:38.930> okay<00:04:39.930> so<00:04:39.990> this<00:04:40.199> is<00:04:40.320> even

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
negative 45 degrees okay so this is even

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.390 
negative 45 degrees okay so this is even
something<00:04:40.680> you<00:04:40.830> could<00:04:41.009> punch<00:04:41.160> your

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
something you could punch your

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.800 
something you could punch your
calculator<00:04:41.789> if<00:04:41.850> you<00:04:41.910> felt<00:04:42.120> like<00:04:42.150> it<00:04:42.270> or<00:04:42.539> we<00:04:42.660> can

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
calculator if you felt like it or we can

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.029 
calculator if you felt like it or we can
actually<00:04:43.050> look<00:04:43.169> at<00:04:43.320> this<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:43.650> figure<00:04:43.800> out<00:04:43.889> an

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
actually look at this and figure out an

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:49.850 
actually look at this and figure out an
exact<00:04:44.310> value<00:04:44.720> ok<00:04:45.720> so<00:04:45.780> i<00:04:46.910> sine<00:04:47.910> of<00:04:48.300> negative<00:04:49.169> 45

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
exact value ok so i sine of negative 45

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.150 
exact value ok so i sine of negative 45
degrees<00:04:51.020> ok<00:04:52.020> this<00:04:52.320> of<00:04:52.440> course<00:04:52.470> is<00:04:52.740> still<00:04:52.949> 2

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
degrees ok this of course is still 2

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.029 
degrees ok this of course is still 2
root<00:04:53.370> 2<00:04:53.780> ok<00:04:54.780> now<00:04:54.960> my<00:04:55.169> preference<00:04:55.620> here<00:04:55.770> since

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
root 2 ok now my preference here since

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.469 
root 2 ok now my preference here since
we're<00:04:56.160> dealing<00:04:56.250> with<00:04:56.370> 45<00:04:56.789> degrees<00:04:57.090> is<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.360> do

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
we're dealing with 45 degrees is to do

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.270 
we're dealing with 45 degrees is to do
an<00:04:57.570> exact<00:04:57.990> value<00:04:58.380> so<00:04:58.620> let's<00:04:58.830> take<00:04:58.949> a<00:04:58.979> look<00:04:59.160> at

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
an exact value so let's take a look at

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.820 
an exact value so let's take a look at
this<00:04:59.370> so<00:04:59.610> if<00:05:00.060> we're<00:05:00.330> doing<00:05:00.419> an<00:05:00.599> exact<00:05:01.050> value

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
this so if we're doing an exact value

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.600 
this so if we're doing an exact value
right<00:05:02.400> let's<00:05:02.729> take<00:05:02.849> a<00:05:02.910> look<00:05:03.120> at<00:05:03.210> this<00:05:04.610> negative

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
right let's take a look at this negative

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.029 
right let's take a look at this negative
45<00:05:06.000> degrees<00:05:06.389> what<00:05:06.630> do<00:05:06.720> we<00:05:06.780> have<00:05:06.870> going<00:05:06.930> on<00:05:07.320> ok

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
45 degrees what do we have going on ok

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.820 
45 degrees what do we have going on ok
so<00:05:08.099> that<00:05:08.370> means<00:05:08.400> we<00:05:08.880> have<00:05:09.500> this<00:05:10.500> will<00:05:10.680> be<00:05:10.800> a

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
so that means we have this will be a

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.920 
so that means we have this will be a
negative<00:05:11.190> one<00:05:11.400> right<00:05:12.210> and<00:05:12.389> this<00:05:12.660> will<00:05:12.780> be<00:05:12.900> a

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
negative one right and this will be a

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.200 
negative one right and this will be a
positive<00:05:13.110> one<00:05:13.380> right<00:05:14.160> this<00:05:14.759> of<00:05:14.910> course<00:05:14.940> will

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
positive one right this of course will

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.330 
positive one right this of course will
be<00:05:15.270> root<00:05:15.509> 2<00:05:15.720> because<00:05:15.930> of<00:05:16.020> 45<00:05:16.380> 45<00:05:16.800> 90<00:05:17.039> triangle

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
be root 2 because of 45 45 90 triangle

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.150 
be root 2 because of 45 45 90 triangle
right<00:05:17.789> so<00:05:18.630> we<00:05:18.780> see<00:05:18.960> that<00:05:19.430> to<00:05:20.430> route<00:05:20.729> to<00:05:22.160> write

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
right so we see that to route to write

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.350 
right so we see that to route to write
the<00:05:23.940> cosine<00:05:24.479> right<00:05:25.320> of<00:05:25.889> course<00:05:26.130> simply<00:05:27.030> will

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
the cosine right of course simply will

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:35.529 
the cosine right of course simply will
be<00:05:27.630> what<00:05:28.139> it<00:05:28.169> will<00:05:28.650> give<00:05:28.979> you<00:05:32.599> let's<00:05:33.599> do<00:05:33.720> this

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
be what it will give you let's do this

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.430 
be what it will give you let's do this
this<00:05:36.539> will<00:05:36.690> give<00:05:36.780> you<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:36.990> negative<00:05:37.289> one

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
this will give you the negative one

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.580 
this will give you the negative one
route<00:05:37.770> to<00:05:39.500> right<00:05:40.500> and<00:05:41.419> then<00:05:42.419> the<00:05:42.570> sign<00:05:42.870> right

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
route to right and then the sign right

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.770 
route to right and then the sign right
so<00:05:44.159> I'm<00:05:44.400> sorry<00:05:44.639> this<00:05:44.970> should<00:05:45.030> be<00:05:45.240> positive<00:05:45.659> one

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
so I'm sorry this should be positive one

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.200 
so I'm sorry this should be positive one
right<00:05:46.050> so<00:05:46.349> cosine<00:05:46.710> plus<00:05:47.310> 1<00:05:47.580> over<00:05:47.729> root<00:05:47.970> tube

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
right so cosine plus 1 over root tube

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.270 
right so cosine plus 1 over root tube
and<00:05:48.419> then<00:05:49.260> of<00:05:49.349> course<00:05:49.380> the<00:05:49.710> sign<00:05:49.949> becomes

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
and then of course the sign becomes

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.330 
and then of course the sign becomes
minus<00:05:50.690> right<00:05:51.690> minus<00:05:52.470> 1<00:05:52.919> over<00:05:54.110> root<00:05:55.110> 2<00:05:55.380> ok<00:05:56.280> so

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
minus right minus 1 over root 2 ok so

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.610 
minus right minus 1 over root 2 ok so
this<00:05:57.150> becomes<00:05:57.620> minus<00:05:58.620> 1<00:05:59.550> over<00:05:59.729> root<00:06:00.150> 2<00:06:00.620> right

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
this becomes minus 1 over root 2 right

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.800 
this becomes minus 1 over root 2 right
and<00:06:01.830> this<00:06:01.979> is<00:06:02.159> of<00:06:02.280> course<00:06:02.310> I<00:06:02.639> now<00:06:03.479> we<00:06:03.539> multiply

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
and this is of course I now we multiply

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.140 
and this is of course I now we multiply
through<00:06:04.590> and<00:06:04.889> what<00:06:05.039> do<00:06:05.099> we<00:06:05.159> get<00:06:05.370> we<00:06:05.849> get<00:06:06.030> the

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
through and what do we get we get the

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:15.110 
through and what do we get we get the
value<00:06:07.430> to<00:06:08.430> write<00:06:09.740> minus<00:06:11.570> 2i<00:06:13.009> ok<00:06:14.009> so<00:06:14.909> this

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
value to write minus 2i ok so this

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.180 
value to write minus 2i ok so this
becomes<00:06:17.120> this<00:06:18.120> cute<00:06:18.509> ok<00:06:19.080> so<00:06:19.680> it's<00:06:19.800> simply<00:06:20.159> a

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
becomes this cute ok so it's simply a

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.159 
becomes this cute ok so it's simply a
matter<00:06:20.250> of<00:06:21.110> cubing<00:06:22.220> the<00:06:23.220> are<00:06:23.720> bringing<00:06:24.720> this<00:06:24.870> 3

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
matter of cubing the are bringing this 3

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.560 
matter of cubing the are bringing this 3
in<00:06:25.349> front<00:06:25.620> of<00:06:25.680> the<00:06:25.740> degrees<00:06:26.130> and<00:06:26.570> just

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
in front of the degrees and just

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.529 
in front of the degrees and just
simplify<00:06:27.930> it<00:06:28.199> down<00:06:28.590> ok<00:06:29.190> always<00:06:30.060> as<00:06:30.270> I<00:06:30.419> was

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
simplify it down ok always as I was

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:32.629 
simplify it down ok always as I was
saying<00:06:30.780> draw<00:06:31.380> diagrams<00:06:31.800> that<00:06:32.039> you<00:06:32.130> refer<00:06:32.460> back

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 
saying draw diagrams that you refer back

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:33.890 
saying draw diagrams that you refer back
to<00:06:32.699> so<00:06:32.970> you<00:06:33.030> can<00:06:33.120> figure<00:06:33.270> out<00:06:33.360> what's<00:06:33.539> going<00:06:33.599> on

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
to so you can figure out what's going on

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.680 
to so you can figure out what's going on
ok<00:06:34.440> and<00:06:34.680> then<00:06:35.310> of<00:06:35.729> course<00:06:35.760> since<00:06:36.510> these<00:06:36.630> are

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
ok and then of course since these are

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.050 
ok and then of course since these are
this<00:06:37.080> is<00:06:37.139> a<00:06:37.200> 45<00:06:37.560> we're<00:06:38.070> dealing<00:06:38.159> with<00:06:38.279> 45<00:06:38.669> 45

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
this is a 45 we're dealing with 45 45

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.190 
this is a 45 we're dealing with 45 45
triangles<00:06:39.630> we<00:06:39.779> can

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
triangles we can

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.410 
triangles we can
plug<00:06:40.560> in<00:06:40.710> these<00:06:40.830> exact<00:06:41.160> values<00:06:41.550> here<00:06:41.700> multiply

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 
plug in these exact values here multiply

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.760 
plug in these exact values here multiply
it<00:06:42.480> through<00:06:42.540> and<00:06:42.840> we<00:06:42.900> get<00:06:43.020> to<00:06:43.110> our<00:06:43.140> answer<00:06:43.500> two

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
it through and we get to our answer two

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.270 
it through and we get to our answer two
months<00:06:44.070> to<00:06:44.250> I<00:06:44.280> ok<00:06:44.910> so<00:06:45.540> that<00:06:45.720> is<00:06:46.050> de<00:06:46.800> monster

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.540 

okay<00:06:50.280> now<00:06:50.490> that<00:06:51.530> was<00:06:52.530> taking<00:06:53.010> power<00:06:53.190> so<00:06:53.430> what

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
okay now that was taking power so what

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.800 
okay now that was taking power so what
we're<00:06:53.640> gonna<00:06:53.700> do<00:06:53.850> now<00:06:53.970> is<00:06:54.000> we're<00:06:54.270> going<00:06:54.720> to

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
we're gonna do now is we're going to

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.260 
we're gonna do now is we're going to
take<00:06:54.870> cube<00:06:55.320> roots<00:06:55.500> okay<00:06:56.130> so<00:06:56.190> we<00:06:56.370> take<00:06:56.550> roots<00:06:56.970> of

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
take cube roots okay so we take roots of

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.560 
take cube roots okay so we take roots of
a<00:06:57.990> complex<00:06:58.620> number<00:06:58.740> so<00:06:59.130> again<00:06:59.430> I<00:06:59.640> always<00:07:00.390> like

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:00.570 
a complex number so again I always like

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.180 
a complex number so again I always like
to<00:07:00.600> start<00:07:00.930> out<00:07:01.050> by<00:07:01.230> drawing<00:07:01.470> a<00:07:01.560> diagram<00:07:01.710> just

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.190 
to start out by drawing a diagram just

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.820 
to start out by drawing a diagram just
to<00:07:02.280> see<00:07:02.550> what<00:07:02.910> is<00:07:03.060> going<00:07:03.300> on<00:07:03.420> so<00:07:04.080> we<00:07:04.320> have<00:07:04.470> cubes

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
to see what is going on so we have cubes

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.900 
to see what is going on so we have cubes
of<00:07:04.950> eight<00:07:05.400> I<00:07:05.730> ok<00:07:06.630> so<00:07:07.460> let's<00:07:08.460> take<00:07:08.580> a<00:07:08.640> look<00:07:08.850> at

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:08.910 
of eight I ok so let's take a look at

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.240 
of eight I ok so let's take a look at
this<00:07:09.090> so<00:07:09.360> eight<00:07:09.690> I<00:07:09.750> brings<00:07:10.590> us<00:07:10.800> where<00:07:11.010> that

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
this so eight I brings us where that

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:16.820 
this so eight I brings us where that
brings<00:07:12.000> us<00:07:12.300> right<00:07:12.740> here<00:07:13.820> right<00:07:15.410> so<00:07:16.410> this<00:07:16.680> is

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830 
brings us right here right so this is

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.560 
brings us right here right so this is
the<00:07:16.950> complex<00:07:17.400> this<00:07:17.820> is<00:07:17.880> the<00:07:17.940> complex<00:07:18.360> that

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:18.570 
the complex this is the complex that

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.330 
the complex this is the complex that
access<00:07:18.990> right<00:07:19.170> so<00:07:19.320> this<00:07:19.440> becomes<00:07:19.680> a<00:07:19.860> value<00:07:20.250> of

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 
access right so this becomes a value of

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:25.190 
access right so this becomes a value of
eight<00:07:20.900> okay<00:07:22.160> so<00:07:23.160> the<00:07:23.790> question<00:07:24.210> is<00:07:24.420> what<00:07:25.050> is

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.200 
eight okay so the question is what is

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.310 
eight okay so the question is what is
that<00:07:25.410> well<00:07:25.620> you<00:07:26.010> can<00:07:26.190> also
