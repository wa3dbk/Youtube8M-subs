00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
Ireland and he's actually pretty decent

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.630 
Ireland and he's actually pretty decent
he's<00:00:49.590> got<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.800> think<00:00:50.010> he's<00:00:50.100> got<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.309> longshot

rate he's a pretty decent shooter for a
bronze<00:00:52.530> defensive<00:00:53.430> player<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:55.530> we'll

in a formation that he at least likes a
little<00:02:09.300> bit<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.840> thought<00:02:10.289> when<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.440> bought<00:02:10.649> him

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
little bit I thought when I bought him

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.410 
little bit I thought when I bought him
at<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.190> 42<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.760> two<00:02:11.910> he<00:02:12.120> would<00:02:12.239> like

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.960 
information
but<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:14.050> is<00:02:14.170> not<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.380> case<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:14.680> I<00:02:15.190> think<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.910> do

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
but that is not the case so I think I do

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.780 
but that is not the case so I think I do
end<00:02:16.510> up<00:02:16.890> selling<00:02:17.890> him<00:02:18.040> for<00:02:18.220> two<00:02:18.340> hundred<00:02:18.580> and

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
end up selling him for two hundred and

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.550 
end up selling him for two hundred and
then<00:02:18.940> find<00:02:19.120> another<00:02:19.420> one<00:02:19.960> that<00:02:20.170> likes<00:02:20.440> the

I think 83 paste definitely a pretty

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:32.670 
I think 83 paste definitely a pretty
decent<00:04:29.830> player<00:04:30.449> good<00:04:31.449> on<00:04:31.569> the<00:04:31.689> wing<00:04:31.960> is

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
decent player good on the wing is

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.760 
decent player good on the wing is
shooting<00:04:33.249> at<00:04:33.430> 50<00:04:33.849> is<00:04:34.030> not<00:04:34.569> too<00:04:34.840> it's<00:04:35.259> nuts<00:04:35.560> not

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
shooting at 50 is not too it's nuts not

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.559 
shooting at 50 is not too it's nuts not
too<00:04:35.919> great<00:04:36.189> but<00:04:36.249> definitely<00:04:36.939> with<00:04:37.210> this<00:04:37.389> pace

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:37.569 
too great but definitely with this pace

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:39.719 
too great but definitely with this pace
can<00:04:37.840> find<00:04:38.560> some<00:04:38.800> openings<00:04:39.219> and<00:04:39.370> maybe<00:04:39.550> it

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
can find some openings and maybe it

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.779 
can find some openings and maybe it
close<00:04:39.939> to<00:04:39.969> go<00:04:40.300> so<00:04:40.960> put<00:04:41.139> in<00:04:41.229> Peters<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.800> then<00:04:42.729> I

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
close to go so put in Peters and then I

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.129 
close to go so put in Peters and then I
get<00:04:42.939> a<00:04:42.969> goalie<00:04:43.270> I<00:04:43.389> was<00:04:43.539> kind<00:04:43.719> of<00:04:43.749> debating

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
get a goalie I was kind of debating

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.260 
get a goalie I was kind of debating
which<00:04:44.409> goalie<00:04:44.650> I<00:04:44.800> should<00:04:45.009> get<00:04:45.189> but<00:04:45.789> I<00:04:45.879> go<00:04:46.060> with

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
which goalie I should get but I go with

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.989 
which goalie I should get but I go with
the<00:04:46.300> 64<00:04:47.020> overall<00:04:47.469> I<00:04:47.650> think<00:04:48.159> he<00:04:48.819> might<00:04:48.969> be

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:48.999 
the 64 overall I think he might be

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:52.589 
the 64 overall I think he might be
Serbian<00:04:49.599> so<00:04:50.139> I<00:04:50.169> got<00:04:50.469> the<00:04:50.590> whole<00:04:50.740> squad<00:04:51.189> all<00:04:51.599> new

this<00:05:46.360> play<00:05:46.629> I<00:05:47.259> look<00:05:48.219> at<00:05:48.339> that<00:05:48.460> I<00:05:48.669> just<00:05:49.210> knocked

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:49.689 
this play I look at that I just knocked

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:51.629 
this play I look at that I just knocked
on<00:05:49.870> right<00:05:50.080> past<00:05:50.259> the<00:05:50.379> around<00:05:51.099> the<00:05:51.189> defender

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
on right past the around the defender

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.610 
on right past the around the defender
and<00:05:51.789> happens<00:05:52.389> to<00:05:52.449> go<00:05:52.629> to<00:05:52.689> garner<00:05:53.139> which<00:05:53.289> is<00:05:53.469> a

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
and happens to go to garner which is a

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.769 
and happens to go to garner which is a
little<00:05:53.919> unfortunate<00:05:54.399> I<00:05:55.000> wanted<00:05:55.569> to<00:05:55.629> keep

00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:55.779 
little unfortunate I wanted to keep

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:58.170 
little unfortunate I wanted to keep
going<00:05:55.839> with<00:05:56.110> dini<00:05:56.439> but<00:05:56.770> garner<00:05:57.550> does<00:05:57.789> finish

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
going with dini but garner does finish

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.730 
going with dini but garner does finish
so<00:05:58.360> it's<00:05:58.509> definitely<00:05:58.870> going<00:05:59.020> to<00:05:59.080> take<00:05:59.289> that<00:05:59.500> I

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740
