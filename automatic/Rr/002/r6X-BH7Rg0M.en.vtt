pretty similar so like every single
ingredient<00:01:16.500> that's<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.460> one<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.970> in

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000

about<00:02:02.579> ten<00:02:03.119> minutes<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.689> put<00:02:04.020> my<00:02:04.170> shower<00:02:04.439> on

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
about ten minutes I put my shower on

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.730 
about ten minutes I put my shower on
like<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.299> hottest<00:02:06.509> setting<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.590> could

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
like the hottest setting so it could

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.809 
like the hottest setting so it could
also<00:02:07.860> kin<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.819> my<00:02:08.940> hair<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:10.400> yeah<00:02:11.400> my<00:02:11.610> hair

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
also kin to my hair and yeah my hair

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.339 
also kin to my hair and yeah my hair
felt<00:02:12.060> smooth<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.810> good

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.949 

so<00:02:16.349> I<00:02:16.709> think<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.159> is<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.370> pretty<00:02:17.909> good<00:02:18.269> product

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
so I think this is a pretty good product

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.339 
so I think this is a pretty good product
this<00:02:19.349> one<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.859> strong<00:02:20.719> and<00:02:21.719> when<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:21.930> put<00:02:22.170> this

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
this one the strong and when I put this

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:30.979 
this one the strong and when I put this
one<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.769> is<00:02:23.010> when<00:02:23.459> I<00:02:23.489> dye<00:02:23.639> my<00:02:23.760> hair<00:02:24.030> black<00:02:25.849> so<00:02:29.989> it

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
one in is when I dye my hair black so it

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.039 
one in is when I dye my hair black so it
was<00:02:31.290> it's<00:02:31.859> not<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.730> best<00:02:32.909> one<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.359> know<00:02:33.420> these

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
was it's not the best one I know these

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.199 
was it's not the best one I know these
are<00:02:34.260> like<00:02:34.290> similar<00:02:34.920> but<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.400> think<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:36.000> one

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
are like similar but I think this one

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.940 
are like similar but I think this one
since<00:02:36.719> it<00:02:36.840> has<00:02:36.959> more<00:02:37.170> ingredients<00:02:37.799> it's

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
since it has more ingredients it's

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.619 
since it has more ingredients it's
somewhat<00:02:38.280> better<00:02:38.489> for<00:02:38.849> some<00:02:39.030> reason<00:02:39.359> maybe

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
somewhat better for some reason maybe

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:40.970 
somewhat better for some reason maybe
there's<00:02:39.959> something<00:02:40.169> than<00:02:40.469> this<00:02:40.620> one<00:02:40.829> that

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
there's something than this one that

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.569 
there's something than this one that
this<00:02:41.099> one<00:02:41.280> does<00:02:41.430> not<00:02:41.459> have<00:02:41.719> but<00:02:42.719> I<00:02:43.249> put<00:02:44.249> this<00:02:44.370> in

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
does felt you know dry it didn't feel

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.520 
does felt you know dry it didn't feel
like<00:03:04.909> didn't<00:03:05.909> feel<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.329> great<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:07.019> felt

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
like didn't feel that great it felt

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.689 
like didn't feel that great it felt
really<00:03:07.799> dry<00:03:08.129> and<00:03:08.159> um<00:03:09.019> pretty<00:03:10.019> gross

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:11.699 
really dry and um pretty gross

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.030 
really dry and um pretty gross
this<00:03:12.239> is<00:03:12.449> ten<00:03:12.719> times<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.230> protection<00:03:13.799> in

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
this is ten times the protection in

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.990 
this is ten times the protection in
three<00:03:14.340> minutes

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
three minutes

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.140 
three minutes
for<00:03:15.540> color-treated<00:03:16.079> hair<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:17.150> conditioning

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
for color-treated hair a conditioning

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.969 
for color-treated hair a conditioning
treatment<00:03:18.599> um<00:03:19.639> so<00:03:20.639> basically<00:03:20.939> I<00:03:21.689> think<00:03:22.560> that

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:22.979 
treatment um so basically I think that

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.729 
treatment um so basically I think that
this<00:03:23.790> one<00:03:24.060> was<00:03:24.239> kind<00:03:24.870> of<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:25.019> waste<00:03:25.229> of<00:03:25.439> money

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
this one was kind of a waste of money

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.610 
this one was kind of a waste of money
why<00:03:26.489> so<00:03:27.359> I<00:03:27.389> might<00:03:27.659> be<00:03:27.780> returning<00:03:28.169> this<00:03:28.439> one

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
why so I might be returning this one

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.289 
why so I might be returning this one
just<00:03:28.889> because<00:03:29.189> I<00:03:29.220> hate<00:03:29.430> buying<00:03:29.639> products<00:03:30.180> that

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
just because I hate buying products that

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.149 
just because I hate buying products that
I'm<00:03:30.569> never<00:03:30.840> gonna<00:03:31.019> use<00:03:31.109> just<00:03:31.349> cause<00:03:31.889> it's<00:03:32.040> a

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
I'm never gonna use just cause it's a

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.909 
I'm never gonna use just cause it's a
soft<00:03:32.540> so<00:03:33.540> I'm<00:03:33.989> probably<00:03:34.290> gonna<00:03:34.500> keep<00:03:34.680> this<00:03:34.859> one

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
soft so I'm probably gonna keep this one

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.259 
soft so I'm probably gonna keep this one
because<00:03:35.879> this<00:03:36.150> one<00:03:37.459> this<00:03:38.459> one's<00:03:38.729> pretty<00:03:38.939> good

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
because this one this one's pretty good

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:45.530 
because this one this one's pretty good
and<00:03:40.189> this<00:03:41.189> one's<00:03:41.459> not<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.599> best<00:03:43.729> I'm<00:03:44.729> going<00:03:45.359> to

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
and this one's not the best I'm going to

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.349 
and this one's not the best I'm going to
be<00:03:45.689> trying<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.169> shine<00:03:46.439> one<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.919> smooth<00:03:47.359> maybe

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
be trying the shine one and smooth maybe

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.539 
be trying the shine one and smooth maybe
but<00:03:49.049> probably<00:03:49.079> not

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
but probably not

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.729 
but probably not
so<00:03:51.269> I<00:03:51.299> think<00:03:51.509> the<00:03:51.810> best<00:03:52.019> out<00:03:52.319> of<00:03:52.500> this

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
so I think the best out of this

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.069 
so I think the best out of this
collection<00:03:53.069> is<00:03:53.430> this<00:03:53.609> this<00:03:53.849> one<00:03:53.909> and<00:03:54.419> the

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
collection is this this one and the

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.249 
collection is this this one and the
original<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.859> moist<00:03:56.099> one<00:03:56.569> so<00:03:57.569> yeah<00:03:57.989> this

00:03:58.249 --> 00:03:58.259 
original the moist one so yeah this

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:01.580 
original the moist one so yeah this
one's<00:03:58.469> just<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.799> waste<00:03:58.979> of<00:03:59.129> money<00:03:59.250> if<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.590> color

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
one's just a waste of money if you color

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.559 
one's just a waste of money if you color
your<00:04:01.680> hair<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:02.340> see<00:04:02.519> Oh<00:04:02.729> 3<00:04:03.299> minute
