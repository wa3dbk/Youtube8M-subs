 thank you how you feel here in san luis 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.910
 very good very comfortable I have not had the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.170
 opportunity to know so many things but 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.840
 what can you know the truth that is 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.850
 very nice I like it a lot and about 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.840
 I'm all in wait for the night 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.090
 because I'm sure I 'm going to 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.879
 have a good time in some bad place 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.139
 death here I am surely I am very 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.469
 sure how it will be very good 

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:40.350
 ryan tell us what inspires you always 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.159
 do your ideas inspire me to people like 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.109
 you because I see beautiful women and 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:49.229
 I say I have to make videos in 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:52.260
 youtube for those men who say how 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:55.379
 I have that woman as I get it I want 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.239
 show that then it's an inspire to 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.899
 people like you 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.699
 Ryan because they say you are the most 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.220
 crazy does not bust me who says it 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.340
 to get started 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.170
 He read it out there or how good I do not know who 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.240
 say that I am the craziest of teeth 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.490
 but I want to assume that I am because 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.790
 I do the most irreverent strange things 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.310
 in my videos I like to check a 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.710
 point in my videos how to get to say 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.290
 ok i'm doing this to check 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.810
 this point you know how I do this madness 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.000
 to get to this resolution then 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.360
 I like how to do experiments 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.090
 social so if I tell them go or jokes 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.280
 or check some point then why 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.130
 is that he went to extremes of doing things 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.080
 strange then I am the craziest in that 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.310
 aspect is fine in real life me 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.590
 I really like the party and live with 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.630
 a lot of strange people then it's part of 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.270
 my personality I like to take with me 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.820
 all kinds of people and talk to me like that 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.440
 I do not know I like being extroverted and 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.820
 meeting new people all the time is 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.860
 for nothing you have to pretend in your 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.990
 videos are just as you are and I think 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.820
 that what gives lis the essence of everything 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.770
 because there are many who do the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.130
 videos for making them and they are something else not 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.130
 I say names 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.720
 i 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.319
 but look like San Luis Potosi because 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.569
 I do not hate it, it's just not what 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.160
 many people were waiting and I'm not talking about 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.440
 I mean, I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about other 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.500
 people 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.870
 because it's nothing or nothing to me but 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.840
 Many people did feel it very 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.120
 different because they expected a 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.270
 I treat more fun more fun with pepe 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.370
 how it looks but did not get the 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.450
 you wanted to leave several results 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.450
 wet pages here 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.810
 good 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:02.520
 what a pity, I do not know how crazy 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:09.160
 the normal 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:13.770
 not normal it was possible to have fun 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:17.250
 I do not know how to get drunk 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.970
 not anything out of the ordinary really 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.970
 oh 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.640
 I thought they were all like me drunk and 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.640
 now what do you do 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.000
 nothing 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.520
 nothing scratches anything out of the ordinary just 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.090
 laugh with stupid mobiles she 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.960
 shut up how you want the 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.960
 bullshit that he wants 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.209
 ryan 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.209
 because you are so alcoholic 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:00.349
 ryan because I'm not an alcoholic this is enough 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.269
 enough I do not know alcoholic no offense 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.069
 good to eat is alcoholic does not fit in 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.120

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.769
