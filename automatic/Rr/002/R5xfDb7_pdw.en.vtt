00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Welcome to the market 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.879
 So if today's citizens talk about us 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.529
 the body types of the body too 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.580
 rate but have already heard 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.380
 ektomorf mesum on ndr.de ektomorf like that 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.420
 will be extreme of the girls and 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.869
 meantime and the endo he is such a 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.640
 a bit quieter and what often stops with that 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.590
 is connected is the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.570
 metabolism so the ektomorf one has 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.789
 very fast metabolism visa 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.580
 normal and andrew morton in a lot 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.980
 bad so there is this metabolism 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.550
 guys really that the question we can 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.260
 the whole relatively easy to solve and was 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.989
 franke was written something cool then 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.860
 and though it is these three metabolisms 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.940
 types would then give acd romero hands 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.620
 If you have a study, you would have to 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.930
 Of course you would also have to do that 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.180
 can make three clouds what do I mean 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.370
 So that's what you're supposed to do 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.050
 study and so on and then 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.840
 come out more practical here 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.600
 then accumulate a few points 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.550
 Here are a few results 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.799
 accumulate and can, for example 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.260
 can also say a few berlin 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.110
 collects so and now I could quite 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.630
 just say okay that's natural 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.390
 more criticism and that and that 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.580
 that means I have one here 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.250
 matching nanni specific factor 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.470
 here and here 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.350
 okay three gold that is that is the eco 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:32.460
 What do I want to write here now 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.549
 Do that is the hmi and that is the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.799
 endo and thus you would have three 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.720
 Metabolism types if you look now 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.280
 but not to look at her 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.979
 you will never get three of these clouds 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.320
 can create because it does not exist 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.380
 a result that you only get here 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.270
 have a point result here and here 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.340
 and otherwise can bend from each other 3, 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.710
 it does not exist that is always like that 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.200
 you lie everywhere 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.240
 one has two points one can never say okay 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.170
 There are exactly three wanted 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.470
 that is the one that these body types meso 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.880
 transfer endo to the metabolism 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.500
 fast what is growing there slower 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.750
 metabolism median metabolism 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.000
 that is absolute bullshit and also 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.280
 professionals is not at all moving this 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.239
 Substances can these types come from yes 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.989
 sheldon so if you have this one 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.360
 these three terms for anything 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.720
 would like to apply if then then could 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.300
 this is based on the body of 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.360
 Build a bit of integration now 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.209
 that's what I mean by that 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.100
 now for example he bones high like 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.370
 already the hip bone and how wide 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.380
 is my shoulder clavicle so 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.330
 the length of the clavicle 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.340
 you can not change that either 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.080
 by training nothing at all that is 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.150
 specified euro per year 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.709
 how long is my clavicle that 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.630
 Of course, for bodybuilding purposes 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.610
 for example even relatively modest because so 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.769
 best man had relatively narrow 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.420
 waist and wide shoulders were typical 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.019
 this foul 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.269
 moderate so if you have this 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.000
 body types for above what could use 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.250
 then it would probably be more for the 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.890
 But I am never happy 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.650
 for the film material firmly then I can 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.720
 say okay factory sandersdorf change 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.360
 okay you are you are an end 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.730
 you are because you are the eco to the 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.079
 theme and weight loss friends each 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.209
 human if the fault with the 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.299
 thyroid everything is ok can 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.220
 everyone just like any human being with me 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.740
 provided the thyroid bittersweet 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.290
 can everything is in order so slimming 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.300
 if no problems anyway can have 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.080
 every person you take and lose weight you take 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.690
 not too 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.550
 and you think you're net then eats 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.080
 you just too few calories then poses 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.690
 Now ask two how many calories 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.670
 I need and how many calories lead 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.950
 me to me and if you have always been so far 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.510
 can not lose weight then you stand exactly 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.310
 the same questions only ask how much 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.230
 calories are needed and those calories for 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.110
 I enter into myself and you will see 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.000
 the endo people probably do not lose weight 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.280
 The food can damn many calories 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.560
 and probably burn a little yes 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.900
 or she burns a lot but still eat 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.840
 need more than you do not 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.630
 fat from sorry that I said fat 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.340
 but that is often more 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.650
 so you can often connect the end 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.480
 You do not look good when you see the 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.880
 all day only an apple would eat yes 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.690
 if you are 20 years old then apple 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.910
 Do not you look like that, but then you 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.620
 you are calorie- dense accordingly 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.340
 otherwise you would be at home in exactly 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.380
 like the eco 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.720
 it may be that you eat a lot of you 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.730
 I also feel that as four yes yes me 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.110
 it full of how many times I hear that then 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.350
 the people write down the calories 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.320
 there are 2400 calories we have in 2004 and 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.880
 calories because I'm still not there 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.600
 It is clear that you that there is nothing there 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.930
 draufpacken 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.060
 write down your calories on how much 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.520
 calories you only need to see what that 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.500
 because a difference arises and if you 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.320
 It can eat more calories than it does 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.169
 you also need you to believe it 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.880
 Please believe me I was 16 years old 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.770
 none have played and football 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.800
 parallel I had to run school 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.060
 six kilometers 60 to 64 people white 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.070
 Not but I had to walk to school 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.580
 run and I'm pretty long 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.350
 So it went and I thought that 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.960
 I can never take 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.150
 yes but I also consumed like one 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.760
 Asshole thought over in the morning 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.550
 then school run as a player-coach 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.460
 two times a week 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.090
 45 times football the week I was so much 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.490
 and and clock is my consumption was enormous 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.450
 I ate that I'm after 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.240
 come home 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.380
 school anxiety peppered in the corner 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.060
 when sat at a table 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.400
 ab tried within a minute 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:55.270
 thirty times with my meal to rhine 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.920
 fillets that were 56 cubes then had 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.960
 I eat no more bock was white 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.670
 boring and I was not happy because 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.080
 you do something cool and then I am 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.760
 I went up 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.940
 that means I probably do not have 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.960
 times 2000 calories taken to me and 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.400
 have loosely 3500 needed as yes and 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.270
 then I am surprised I do not need me 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.090
 can take 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.310
 and then the phenomenon came from me 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.930
 I did not stop with tennis 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.030
 more so football has played and has 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.830
 drove the scooter to school 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.590
 suddenly I have a little more 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.540
 eaten on the teas and sweets 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.030
 Look, there was one upstairs with me 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.650
 small bacon roller timpani formed and 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.710
 I thought something like this should go 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.330
 I can not take this and this 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.880
 Phenomenon if you are with many 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.800
 Determine people and everyone 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.810
 really intense with the topic 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.790
 busy those calories you need 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.560
 I'm leading calories to you 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.620
 He will notice that here is a discrepancy 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.240
 There is that there are these three 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.490
 to say the metabolic types 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.920
 they could take something back though 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.020
 informative if yes before
