00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
 has always fascinated the human yes 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.720
 the idea of immortality 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.730
 the myths of antiquity were where the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.710
 gods immortal apart from 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.139
 individual unhappy people like 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.990
 Sisyphus you with eternal qual 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.449
 punished on later was in literature 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.570
 and film the immortal keeps mostly 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.640
 not be very happy with his eternal 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.980
 how it lives when you live forever 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.380
 is meanwhile no 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.349
 theoretically philosophical question more 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.570
 because serious scientists say pure 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.809
 Biologically, the human body could 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.399
 100 even thousands of years old if 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.440
 our stem cells succeed 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.200
 to reprogram accordingly 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.820
 permanent self-healing what that 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.469
 our pension system would mean or 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.550
 for the divisional statistics we want 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.950
 I would rather not ask now 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.780
 look at the medical page 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.149
 this cool forecasts 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.149
 christian cherry about the eternal youth 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.989
 england university cambridge such 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.119
 places are called justifiably venerable 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.689
 mister all the gray has a good one here 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.570
 job 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:13.990
 he may think full time about 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:15.580
 if people live the future 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.619
 we completely abolish aging 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.330
 we can calculate in theory how 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.430
 long an average person 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.170
 would be laying 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.340
 Other risks, such as 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.929
 car accidents remain unchanged 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.729
 with such a bill, we come on 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.280
 few thousand years of life 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.950
 depending on how you expect some come 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.810
 theorist on 500 years others on 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.140
 5000 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.439
 Please live for hundreds of thousands of years 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.229
 Does that want to be that who is young 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.200
 old who is old will die that were 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.289
 the laws but the medicine is much 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.850
 further university ulm professor geiger 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.220
 and his team work here 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.380
 so-called adult stem cells the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.450
 every adult carries them 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.460
 Cells have rejuvenation potential 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.119
 responsible for damage repair in 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.460
 tissue 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.720
 they could help keep you young and longer 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.479
 to be healthy 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.040
 they are essential for that 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.350
 tissue regeneration 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.730
 but no direct function in the tissue 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.350
 that's what makes them so unique 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.440
 sometimes a bit hard 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.580
 understandable in their function 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.739
 Stem cells work better 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.049
 you tidier they are similar over 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.730
 Data on a hard disk at boy 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.750
 Adult stem cells are all data 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.500
 sorted in your place 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.790
 the human being develops the disorder 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.160
 Functionality of the stem cell new 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.099
 forming cells decreases if now 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.549
 like to understand what mechanisms 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:44.890
 molecular is the name of our field 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.549
 the stem cells cause old 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.190
 become 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.950
 when I understand why the old 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.720
 I can develop the therapies 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.400
 even trying this would be older 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.110
 to undo 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.659
 Young stem cells ensure constant 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.489
 Innovations in the body make it possible 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.769
 that we are also over 80 years old 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.540
 mountains can climb long life white 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.299
 one is also genetically conditioned 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.340
 so-called foxo three go up about 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.890
 the life expectancy that already the 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.489
 Researcher Medical College 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.829
 Hanover 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.900
 In these aquariums swim bizarre 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.659
 you go with fantastic skills 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.239
 the axolotl from mexico a tail lurch 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.340
 the larval stage does not leave that 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.709
 animal has incredible 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.139
 self-healing powers of axolotl is for 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.409
 us a fascinating research object 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.940
 because he is free by his food 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:35.859
 Wound healing may bring us to it 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.620
 can that be human and human too 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:41.500
 one day cure scarring and 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.659
 faster passes parts of his heart 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.010
 his brain can his spine 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.170
 renew yourself 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.599
 also grow full limbs 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.700
 At the axolotl after that helps a long time too 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.849
 Of course, the long term would be the life 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.200
 great dream that we are on humans exactly 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.840
 that can achieve what the axolotl 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.780
 can in fact be completely limbed 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.400
 regenerate the lost ones 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.620
 stay young and healthy for a long time 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.250
 by infirmity and age to torment a 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.769
 dream 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.370
 hybris professor de bray sees it 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.010
 calmly 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.989
 He keeps thinking about our chances 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.989
 for centuries long life
