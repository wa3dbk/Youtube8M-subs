00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
alright this is how you change modes on

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.600 
alright this is how you change modes on
the<00:00:07.569> invert<00:00:07.990> mini<00:00:08.200> first<00:00:09.160> you're<00:00:09.370> going<00:00:09.520> to

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
the invert mini first you're going to

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.830 
the invert mini first you're going to
want<00:00:09.700> to<00:00:09.790> take<00:00:10.030> off<00:00:10.240> any<00:00:10.570> air<00:00:10.780> sources<00:00:11.789> see<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
want to take off any air sources see the

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.449 
want to take off any air sources see the
gauge<00:00:14.110> you<00:00:14.440> can't<00:00:14.680> really<00:00:14.830> see<00:00:15.039> it<00:00:15.070> but<00:00:15.190> its

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:15.459 
gauge you can't really see it but its

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.939 
gauge you can't really see it but its

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.790 
so now semi-auto and then full auto up
twice<00:02:34.110> one<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:35.160> wait<00:02:36.120> for<00:02:36.360> once<00:02:36.930> one<00:02:37.170> two<00:02:37.440> three

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
twice one to wait for once one two three

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.990 
twice one to wait for once one two three
times<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:40.739> then<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:43.560> first<00:02:44.069> is<00:02:44.280> three<00:02:44.700> shots

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
times and then it first is three shots

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.990 
times and then it first is three shots
three<00:02:45.620> shots<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.830> semi<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.550> then<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.790> goes<00:02:47.970> to

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
three shots and semi and then it goes to

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.870 
three shots and semi and then it goes to
full<00:02:48.270> automatic<00:02:49.040> so<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.100> can<00:02:50.459> see<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.760> then

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
full automatic so you can see and then

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.430 
full automatic so you can see and then
it<00:02:51.000> resets<00:02:51.390> after<00:02:51.690> one<00:02:51.900> second<00:02:52.349> so<00:02:52.610> 1<00:02:53.610> 2<00:02:54.060> 3<00:02:54.440> full

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
it resets after one second so 1 2 3 full

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.059 
it resets after one second so 1 2 3 full
auto<00:02:55.680> wait<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.459> second<00:02:57.380> 1230<00:02:58.380> auto<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.569> then

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
auto wait a second 1230 auto and then

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.699 
auto wait a second 1230 auto and then
back<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.790> go<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.000> millennium<00:03:03.630> ramp<00:03:03.900> hold<00:03:04.470> it

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
back to go to millennium ramp hold it

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.789 
back to go to millennium ramp hold it
when<00:03:04.980> it's<00:03:05.100> solid<00:03:05.510> only<00:03:06.510> go<00:03:06.660> up<00:03:06.690> once<00:03:07.049> wait

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
when it's solid only go up once wait

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:14.260 
when it's solid only go up once wait
four<00:03:08.069> one<00:03:08.310> two<00:03:08.489> three<00:03:08.610> four<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:10.100> then

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.000 

see<00:03:15.020> to<00:03:16.240> millennium<00:03:17.240> eight<00:03:18.110> balls<00:03:18.440> per<00:03:18.620> second

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
see to millennium eight balls per second

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.570 
see to millennium eight balls per second
and<00:03:19.940> then<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.210> is<00:03:20.420> 20<00:03:21.350> BPS<00:03:21.470> ramp<00:03:21.980> that's<00:03:22.430> what<00:03:22.550> I

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
and then it is 20 BPS ramp that's what I

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.960 
and then it is 20 BPS ramp that's what I
have<00:03:22.730> my<00:03:22.850> gun<00:03:23.030> setup<00:03:23.360> but<00:03:24.430> alright<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.760> then

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
have my gun setup but alright and then

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.400 
have my gun setup but alright and then
so<00:03:26.690> that's<00:03:27.620> how<00:03:27.710> you<00:03:27.800> change<00:03:27.890> modes
