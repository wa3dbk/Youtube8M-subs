shifted your baseline and you actually

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
do remember this shifting baselines is a

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.590 
do remember this shifting baselines is a
serious<00:01:10.400> problem<00:01:10.640> because<00:01:10.850> it's<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.360> process

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
serious problem because it's the process

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.660 
serious problem because it's the process
that's<00:01:12.080> behind<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:12.590> slow<00:01:12.920> incremental

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
that's behind the slow incremental

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.820 
that's behind the slow incremental
degradation<00:01:14.030> of<00:01:14.390> our<00:01:14.510> environment<00:01:15.110> you<00:01:15.650> can

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
degradation of our environment you can

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.250 
degradation of our environment you can
call<00:01:16.040> it<00:01:16.159> slow<00:01:16.400> change<00:01:16.760> creeping<00:01:17.600> decline<00:01:17.960> or

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
call it slow change creeping decline or

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.720 
call it slow change creeping decline or
slow-motion<00:01:18.920> disaster<00:01:19.510> in<00:01:20.510> times<00:01:20.869> that

slow-motion disaster in times that
at<00:01:23.730> times<00:01:24.300> like<00:01:29.930> so<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:39.030> answer<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.630> almost

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
at times like so the answer is almost

as much as things can change for the
worse<00:03:37.560> like<00:03:38.370> this<00:03:38.550> photo<00:03:38.790> showing<00:03:39.120> what<00:03:39.330> a

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
worse like this photo showing what a

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.300 
worse like this photo showing what a
mess<00:03:39.690> Huntington<00:03:40.170> Beach<00:03:40.320> California<00:03:40.380> was<00:03:41.160> in

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
mess Huntington Beach California was in

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.790 
mess Huntington Beach California was in
1928<00:03:42.060> with<00:03:42.510> enough<00:03:42.720> concerted<00:03:43.230> effort<00:03:43.500> things

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
1928 with enough concerted effort things

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.770 
1928 with enough concerted effort things
can<00:03:43.980> also<00:03:44.160> change<00:03:44.490> for<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.790> better<00:03:44.940> see<00:03:45.690> how

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
can also change for the better see how

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.000 
can also change for the better see how
the<00:03:45.840> same<00:03:46.080> stretch<00:03:46.410> of<00:03:46.440> Huntington<00:03:46.920> Beach

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
the same stretch of Huntington Beach

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.700 
the same stretch of Huntington Beach
looks<00:03:47.310> today<00:03:47.900> change<00:03:48.900> is<00:03:49.050> possible<00:03:49.260> in<00:03:49.680> both

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
looks today change is possible in both

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.890 
looks today change is possible in both
directions<00:03:50.280> but<00:03:50.790> only<00:03:51.030> if<00:03:51.240> we<00:03:51.360> stay<00:03:51.570> clear<00:03:51.840> of

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
directions but only if we stay clear of

00:03:51.900 --> 00:04:04.580 
directions but only if we stay clear of
the<00:03:52.050> problem<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.710> shifting<00:03:53.160> baselines

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.650
