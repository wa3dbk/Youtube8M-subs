00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
world it lands it's creating a plopping

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
when you're moving it around it's also a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.799 
when you're moving it around it's also a
great<00:00:55.980> idea<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.640> add<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> little<00:00:57.329> bit<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.539> sound

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
great idea to add a little bit of sound

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.799 
great idea to add a little bit of sound
to<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.859> purpose<00:00:59.100> we<00:00:59.520> have

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
to it and for that purpose we have

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.539 
to it and for that purpose we have
rattles<00:01:01.879> now<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.180> actually<00:01:03.619> use<00:01:04.619> rattles

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
rattles now you can actually use rattles

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.660 
rattles now you can actually use rattles
from<00:01:05.880> an<00:01:06.390> old<00:01:06.600> jig<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.350> may<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:08.000> been

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
into the to the underbelly of the Frog

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.280 
into the to the underbelly of the Frog
I've<00:02:30.090> seen<00:02:30.420> videos<00:02:30.780> where<00:02:31.110> they've<00:02:31.260> actually

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
I've seen videos where they've actually

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.720

inserted<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:33.140> jig<00:02:34.140> rattles<00:02:35.100> into<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.430> frogs

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
inserted the jig rattles into the frogs

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.220
