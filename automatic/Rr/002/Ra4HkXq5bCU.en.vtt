00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.260 
I remember when they used to sell these
things<00:02:37.110> without<00:02:37.560> those<00:02:37.860> stupid<00:02:38.459> condoms<00:02:39.060> on

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
green condom already put on it and the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.290 
green condom already put on it and the
controller<00:02:50.040> itself<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.610> already<00:02:50.970> assembled

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
controller itself is already assembled

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.180 
controller itself is already assembled
when<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.260> buy<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.470> straight<00:02:52.950> out<00:02:52.980> of<00:02:53.100> the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
when you buy it straight out of the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.110 
when you buy it straight out of the
package

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
package

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.229 
package
overall<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.620> reason<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.220> purchased<00:02:56.280> this<00:02:57.000> is

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
overall the reason I purchased this is

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.479 
overall the reason I purchased this is
because<00:02:57.660> it's<00:02:57.840> been<00:02:57.989> some<00:02:58.350> years<00:02:58.980> since<00:02:59.100> I

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
because it's been some years since I

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.960 
because it's been some years since I
needed<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:00.030> purchase<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.630> Wii<00:03:01.020> controller

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
needed to purchase a Wii controller

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.930 
needed to purchase a Wii controller
about<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.360> know<00:03:03.510> five<00:03:04.070> almost<00:03:05.070> six<00:03:05.400> years

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
about you know five almost six years

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.820 
about you know five almost six years
since<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:06.450> had<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.780> purchase<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.260> Wii<00:03:07.410> controller

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
since I had to purchase a Wii controller

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
since I had to purchase a Wii controller
actually<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:09.180> my<00:03:10.080> Wii<00:03:10.530> mote<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:11.220> an<00:03:11.550> old

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
actually so my Wii mote is an old

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.360 
actually so my Wii mote is an old
version<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:13.050> means<00:03:13.350> it<00:03:13.709> has<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:13.950> Wii

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
version and that means it has the Wii

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.210 
version and that means it has the Wii
MotionPlus<00:03:15.019> accessory<00:03:16.019> with<00:03:16.350> it<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:17.130> you

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
MotionPlus accessory with it that you

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.920 
MotionPlus accessory with it that you
have<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.519> plug<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:17.940> on<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.209> bottom<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.660> sticks

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
have to plug in on the bottom it sticks

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.800 
have to plug in on the bottom it sticks
out<00:03:19.080> like<00:03:19.110> this<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.970> doesn't<00:03:21.239> work<00:03:21.540> with

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
out like this so it doesn't work with

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.640 
out like this so it doesn't work with
certain<00:03:22.200> games<00:03:22.470> like<00:03:22.920> babysitting<00:03:23.670> mama<00:03:24.000> and

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
certain games like babysitting mama and

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.870 
certain games like babysitting mama and
when<00:03:25.650> you're<00:03:25.769> trying<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.160> hold<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.489> controller

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
when you're trying to hold a controller

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.900 
when you're trying to hold a controller
sideways<00:03:27.540> like<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:28.320> makes<00:03:28.920> your<00:03:29.130> hand

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
sideways like this it makes your hand

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.509 
sideways like this it makes your hand
jut<00:03:30.239> out<00:03:30.269> like<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.440> that's<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.160> problem

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
jut out like that and that's a problem

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.990 
jut out like that and that's a problem
so<00:03:33.090> this<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:34.230> why<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.680> picked<00:03:35.370> up<00:03:35.549> this

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
so this is why I picked up this

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.440 
so this is why I picked up this
controller<00:03:36.570> and<00:03:37.280> as<00:03:38.280> for<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.940> much<00:03:39.420> needed

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
controller and as for the much needed

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.420 
controller and as for the much needed
upgrade<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:41.150> without<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.799> extra<00:03:43.799> peripheral

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
upgrade the without the extra peripheral

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.789 
upgrade the without the extra peripheral
on<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.790> other<00:03:44.940> one<00:03:45.209> there<00:03:45.989> is<00:03:46.170> definitely<00:03:46.769> a

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
on the other one there is definitely a

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.130 
on the other one there is definitely a
huge<00:03:47.060> noticeable<00:03:48.060> difference<00:03:48.510> in<00:03:48.660> the

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
huge noticeable difference in the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.979 
huge noticeable difference in the
detection<00:03:49.560> my<00:03:50.040> daughter<00:03:50.400> is<00:03:50.910> quite<00:03:51.299> impatient

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
detection my daughter is quite impatient

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.920 
detection my daughter is quite impatient
and<00:03:52.590> she<00:03:52.980> swings<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.640> remote<00:03:53.970> like<00:03:54.150> this<00:03:54.570> real

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
and she swings a remote like this real

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.710 
and she swings a remote like this real
crazy<00:03:55.380> and<00:03:55.769> so<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.519> Wii<00:03:56.670> you<00:03:57.150> know<00:03:57.330> without

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
crazy and so the Wii you know without

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.979 
crazy and so the Wii you know without
the<00:03:57.959> Motion<00:03:58.410> Plus<00:03:58.620> inside<00:03:59.220> of<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.750> it<00:04:00.750> doesn't

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
the Motion Plus inside of it it doesn't

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.920 
the Motion Plus inside of it it doesn't
detect<00:04:01.500> that<00:04:01.739> stuff<00:04:02.130> too<00:04:02.760> well<00:04:03.030> so<00:04:03.390> it's<00:04:03.840> a

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
detect that stuff too well so it's a

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.580 
detect that stuff too well so it's a
little<00:04:04.110> bit<00:04:04.350> of<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.590> problem<00:04:04.920> and<00:04:05.750> if<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:07.350> don't

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
little bit of a problem and if you don't

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.130 
little bit of a problem and if you don't
have<00:04:07.920> a<00:04:07.950> newer<00:04:08.340> version<00:04:08.640> of<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.120> Wii<00:04:09.329> mote<00:04:09.570> you

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
have a newer version of a Wii mote you

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.840 
have a newer version of a Wii mote you
might<00:04:10.320> be<00:04:10.470> surprised<00:04:10.980> with<00:04:11.430> how<00:04:11.640> much

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
might be surprised with how much

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.690 
might be surprised with how much
detection<00:04:12.630> that<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:12.989> will<00:04:13.140> get<00:04:13.380> with<00:04:13.590> this<00:04:13.860> on

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
detection that you will get with this on

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.000 
detection that you will get with this on
top<00:04:15.090> of<00:04:15.329> that<00:04:15.480> my<00:04:16.320> daughter<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:16.979> have

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:20.330 
tested it extensively over the last few
days

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340
