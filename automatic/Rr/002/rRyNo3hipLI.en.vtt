they're gonna be similar and I actually

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.560 
they're gonna be similar and I actually
would<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:46.890> put<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.189> back<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.610> first<00:01:48.090> had<00:01:48.540> I

pull it up if you have anything like
that<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:22.290> was<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.620> little<00:03:22.859> scared<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:23.459> was<00:03:23.579> kind

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
that I was a little scared it was kind

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.670 
that I was a little scared it was kind
of<00:03:23.880> crispy<00:03:24.359> and<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:25.079> didn't<00:03:25.350> think<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.560> was

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
of crispy and I didn't think it was

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.349 
of crispy and I didn't think it was
gonna<00:03:25.769> work<00:03:25.829> out<00:03:26.190> but<00:03:26.670> everything<00:03:27.030> worked<00:03:27.239> out

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
gonna work out but everything worked out

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.970 
gonna work out but everything worked out
just<00:03:27.420> fine<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.840> heated<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.320> up<00:03:28.440> again<00:03:28.769> and

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
just fine I heated it up again and

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.740 
just fine I heated it up again and
you'll<00:03:29.340> see<00:03:29.549> later<00:03:29.700> it's<00:03:30.000> perfectly<00:03:30.390> smooth

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
you'll see later it's perfectly smooth

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.170 
you'll see later it's perfectly smooth
so<00:03:31.680> here<00:03:31.890> we<00:03:32.010> are<00:03:32.040> installing<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.790> camera

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
so here we are installing the camera

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.289 
so here we are installing the camera
pieces<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.840> if<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.530> take<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.709> look<00:03:34.980> here

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
pieces and if you take a look here

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.729 
pieces and if you take a look here
everything<00:03:36.299> fits<00:03:36.630> perfectly

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
everything fits perfectly

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.949 
everything fits perfectly
I<00:03:37.769> cannot<00:03:38.609> line<00:03:38.850> up<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.120> screen<00:03:39.390> saver<00:03:39.569> to<00:03:39.750> save

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
I cannot line up a screen saver to save

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.110 
I cannot line up a screen saver to save
my<00:03:40.170> life<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:40.920> I<00:03:40.950> did<00:03:41.310> not<00:03:41.340> think<00:03:41.850> I<00:03:42.030> was

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
my life and so I did not think I was

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.780 
my life and so I did not think I was
gonna<00:03:42.239> be<00:03:42.450> able<00:03:42.569> to<00:03:42.690> do<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.049> screen<00:03:43.410> saver

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
gonna be able to do the screen saver

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.900 
gonna be able to do the screen saver

I<00:03:45.060> obviously<00:03:45.930> meant<00:03:46.200> screen<00:03:46.530> protector<00:03:47.130> but

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
I obviously meant screen protector but

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.879 
I obviously meant screen protector but
it<00:03:48.090> wasn't<00:03:48.450> near<00:03:48.630> as<00:03:48.750> intimidating<00:03:49.079> as<00:03:49.530> I

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
it wasn't near as intimidating as I

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.970 
it wasn't near as intimidating as I
expected<00:03:50.730> now<00:03:51.450> if<00:03:51.690> we<00:03:51.900> take<00:03:52.109> a<00:03:52.170> look<00:03:52.470> at<00:03:52.680> the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
expected now if we take a look at the

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.160 
expected now if we take a look at the
device<00:03:53.310> with<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:53.970> all<00:03:54.150> done<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.780> everything

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
device with it all done and everything

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.830 
device with it all done and everything
smooth<00:03:55.530> out<00:03:55.859> you<00:03:56.340> can<00:03:56.519> see<00:03:56.670> that<00:03:56.940> you<00:03:57.239> can<00:03:57.480> tell

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
smooth out you can see that you can tell

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.870 
smooth out you can see that you can tell
that<00:03:57.989> there<00:03:58.170> is<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.319> pattern<00:03:58.709> underneath<00:03:59.250> but

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
that there is a pattern underneath but

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.150 
that there is a pattern underneath but
mostly<00:04:00.600> it's<00:04:00.959> whenever<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.650> light<00:04:01.829> hits<00:04:02.069> it

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
mostly it's whenever the light hits it

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.949 
mostly it's whenever the light hits it
just<00:04:02.220> right<00:04:02.549> or<00:04:02.910> you<00:04:03.060> hold<00:04:03.269> it<00:04:03.420> at<00:04:03.540> certain

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
just right or you hold it at certain

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.259 
just right or you hold it at certain
angles<00:04:04.410> in<00:04:04.650> fact<00:04:05.190> in<00:04:05.430> some<00:04:05.459> angles<00:04:06.060> it's

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
angles in fact in some angles it's

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.720 
angles in fact in some angles it's
hardly<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.840> notice<00:04:07.139> at<00:04:07.319> all<00:04:07.380> that<00:04:07.920> there<00:04:08.220> is<00:04:08.250> a

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
hardly to notice at all that there is a

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.580 
hardly to notice at all that there is a
pattern<00:04:09.180> underneath<00:04:09.450> that's<00:04:10.109> something<00:04:10.470> you

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
pattern underneath that's something you

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.379 
pattern underneath that's something you
feel<00:04:10.799> you're<00:04:11.010> going<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.430> be<00:04:11.579> worried<00:04:11.910> about<00:04:12.000> I

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
feel you're going to be worried about I

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:13.879 
feel you're going to be worried about I
would<00:04:12.480> go<00:04:12.720> ahead<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:12.959> check<00:04:13.260> out<00:04:13.440> maybe<00:04:13.620> their

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
would go ahead and check out maybe their

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.710 
would go ahead and check out maybe their
carbon<00:04:14.310> fiber<00:04:14.639> line<00:04:14.910> I<00:04:15.150> think<00:04:15.359> that<00:04:15.510> would

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
carbon fiber line I think that would

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.020 
carbon fiber line I think that would
tend<00:04:16.019> to<00:04:16.079> hide<00:04:16.289> it<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.530> little<00:04:16.560> bit<00:04:16.889> better<00:04:17.039> so

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
tend to hide it a little bit better so

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.759 
tend to hide it a little bit better so
taking<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.389> look<00:04:18.539> at<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.780> cutouts<00:04:19.139> everything

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
taking a look at the cutouts everything

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.250 
taking a look at the cutouts everything
about<00:04:20.010> this<00:04:20.310> fits<00:04:20.729> perfectly<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:21.630> just<00:04:21.989> can't

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
about this fits perfectly I just can't

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.070 
about this fits perfectly I just can't
stress<00:04:22.500> enough<00:04:22.800> how<00:04:22.979> well<00:04:23.700> it<00:04:23.849> fits<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.390> if

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
stress enough how well it fits and if

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.990 
stress enough how well it fits and if
you<00:04:25.229> do<00:04:25.409> have<00:04:25.620> any<00:04:25.800> issues<00:04:26.250> you<00:04:26.430> can

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
you do have any issues you can

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.550 
you do have any issues you can
eat<00:04:27.120> up<00:04:27.240> some<00:04:27.480> of<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.630> edges<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.140> move<00:04:28.320> those

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
eat up some of the edges and move those

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.520 
eat up some of the edges and move those
around<00:04:28.740> as<00:04:29.130> needed<00:04:29.160> as<00:04:29.640> well<00:04:29.880> and<00:04:30.630> as<00:04:31.200> you<00:04:31.350> guys

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
around as needed as well and as you guys

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.830 
around as needed as well and as you guys
know<00:04:31.860> I<00:04:32.130> tend<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.460> drop<00:04:32.700> a<00:04:32.730> lot<00:04:33.030> of<00:04:33.090> phones<00:04:33.450> and

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
know I tend to drop a lot of phones and

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.190 
know I tend to drop a lot of phones and
break<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:34.770> lot<00:04:35.040> of<00:04:35.130> screens<00:04:35.460> as<00:04:35.730> well<00:04:35.790> and<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:37.140> do

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
break a lot of screens as well and I do

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.170 
break a lot of screens as well and I do
feel<00:04:37.530> a<00:04:37.560> little<00:04:37.710> safer<00:04:38.130> with<00:04:38.490> this<00:04:38.640> on<00:04:38.850> here<00:04:39.150> I

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
feel a little safer with this on here I

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.060 
feel a little safer with this on here I
do<00:04:39.300> feel<00:04:39.600> like<00:04:39.720> it<00:04:39.930> gives<00:04:40.110> a<00:04:40.320> little<00:04:40.500> more<00:04:40.590> grip

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
do feel like it gives a little more grip

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.250 
do feel like it gives a little more grip
and<00:04:41.250> better<00:04:41.820> protection<00:04:42.240> on<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.810> back<00:04:42.840> I

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
and better protection on the back I

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.600 
and better protection on the back I
don't<00:04:43.320> think<00:04:43.470> it's<00:04:43.710> gonna<00:04:43.830> necessarily<00:04:44.490> keep

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
don't think it's gonna necessarily keep

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.580 
don't think it's gonna necessarily keep
it<00:04:44.730> from<00:04:44.880> breaking<00:04:45.150> but<00:04:45.960> I<00:04:45.990> do<00:04:46.080> think<00:04:46.350> it'll

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
it from breaking but I do think it'll

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.950 
it from breaking but I do think it'll
keep<00:04:46.740> it<00:04:46.890> from<00:04:47.040> scratching<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:47.760> scuffing<00:04:48.330> the

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
keep it from scratching and scuffing the

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.920 
keep it from scratching and scuffing the
edges<00:04:49.350> of<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.650> LG<00:04:50.100> g4<00:04:50.610> have<00:04:51.090> a<00:04:51.330> mirrored

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
edges of the LG g4 have a mirrored

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.290 
edges of the LG g4 have a mirrored
glossy<00:04:52.500> finish<00:04:52.950> and<00:04:53.160> I<00:04:53.280> think<00:04:53.580> that<00:04:53.790> things

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
glossy finish and I think that things

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.210 
glossy finish and I think that things
like<00:04:54.390> your<00:04:54.630> purse<00:04:54.960> or<00:04:55.320> anything<00:04:55.800> in<00:04:56.100> your

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
like your purse or anything in your

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.280 
like your purse or anything in your
