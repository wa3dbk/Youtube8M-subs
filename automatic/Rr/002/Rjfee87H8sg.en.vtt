00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.990
 Hi, I'm Eugenie. 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.930
 Today I am making ttokbokki. 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.330
 This hot snack is the most popular street food in Korea, 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.330
 I used to eat a lot of ttokbokki after school when I was small. 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.290
 In a pan, add all ingredients to the sauce: 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.210
 garlic, 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.130
 Red pepper flakes, 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.630
 Light brown sugar, 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.630
 soy sauce, 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.950
 Corn syrup, 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.950
 Alcohol cooking white, I used the Korean Mihyang today. 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.160
 Korean red pepper paste. 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.580
 Then finally pour into the anchovy stock. 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.240
 On medium high heat, 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.450
 Heat the sauce for 3 minutes, sometimes stirring. 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.450
 Add in rice cakes, 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.370
 Onions, 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.700
 Fish cakes. 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.120
 Then simmer for 10 minutes, 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.120
 Or even sauce is cut to half. 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.540
 Taste to see if you like. 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.170
 Add tomato sauce or red pepper paste more, 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.080
 Sugar, 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.000
 Or corn syrup as you like. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.920
 Finally add the green onions 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.910
 And boiled eggs 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.910
 Leave on low heat for 2 more minutes. 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.960
 Voila! 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.660
 Rubber ricecake in a hot red pepper sauce. 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.490
 Sprinkle with roasted sesame seeds and serve them. 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.490
 It's sweet, savory, and spicy all at once. 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.290
 Bon appetite! 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.290
 It's hot. Hahah .. 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.040
 Today was ddokbokki. 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.330
 And tomorrow it is not - bread orio cheese. 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.280
 I get a Weekly Calendar on Facebook and Instagram. 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.280
