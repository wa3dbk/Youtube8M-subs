 well, in fact, every week , sing two 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.420
 hours because it's a school that 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.800
 accompanies it's also a school of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.329
 singing singers at the wooden cross 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.469
 it's not just training with 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.059
 children who come and who are 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.149
 find from time to time a form 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.189
 and that's more than that it's they're in 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.520
 a school and inside the school 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.740
 there is a curriculum that allows children 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.549
 on their school time to have twelve 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.020
 hours of musical practice then and they 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.130
 have all their school classes also 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.500
 So they are working children 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.729
 even more than the others and who in 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.009
 more go on a concert tour 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.600
 yeah so they are trained to sing to 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.140
 give concerts and they have they have 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.670
 how old are his children from 8 to 14 years old 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.850
 since it is currently ending in 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.060
 third they come in third to the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.060
 time 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.189
 it's crazy sailing and seeing that they 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.140
 did not put so yes that's it 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.180
 precisely and boy stamp is 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.659
 very different from the girl stamp but 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.210
 would have happened if he is more beautiful 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.860
 I like both I like dramas and 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.090
 brayden go both tables and the 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.829
 two colors were still sleeping 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.899
 but the singing candidates at the cross 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.490
 of wood they are only small 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.060
 wii boys who are finally singing 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.990
 little ones from primary to and they are 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.850
 that a directory 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.770
 then the own repertoire of small 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.000
 singers it's not just clean 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.310
 in the directory but in the message 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.019
 the little singers are first and foremost 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.880
 children who announce peace in the 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.680
 world through singing so the 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.319
 repertoire is as sacred as 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.900
 profane than folk songs of 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.830
 all countries in all languages 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.599
 the important thing is to carry this message 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.130
 of peace around the world 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.720
 so the christmas message and is it 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.280
 are there some of the children 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.140
 it may be his desire elsewhere 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.450
 they made career behind you would have 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.730
 want to sing all my life I do not know 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.200

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.069
 do my job finally I do not know 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.069
 still in force 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.120
 it's a beautiful job galley life on 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.310
 plan again what do you prefer 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.100

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.290
 well i like singing of all i like 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.549
 just like that of music and games 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.470

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.470
 sacred or such rock road also a 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.280
 Briefly doubt here 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.840

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.340

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.660

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.370

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.130
 varieties also here is the repertoire 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.139
 is very broad and as long as he is carrying 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.540
