the<00:00:52.420> Ennis<00:00:52.690> TV<00:00:52.900> is<00:00:53.140> stuff<00:00:53.350> that<00:00:53.380> we<00:00:53.650> had<00:00:53.950> used

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
the Ennis TV is stuff that we had used

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.070 
the Ennis TV is stuff that we had used
before<00:00:54.400> so<00:00:54.640> because<00:00:55.240> it's<00:00:55.420> been<00:00:55.600> safe<00:00:55.870> with

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
before so because it's been safe with

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.390 
before so because it's been safe with
the<00:00:56.200> other<00:00:56.320> Red<00:00:56.530> Wolves<00:00:56.770> that's<00:00:57.040> why<00:00:57.190> we've

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
the other Red Wolves that's why we've

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.850 
the other Red Wolves that's why we've
used<00:00:57.610> it<00:00:57.820> on<00:00:57.880> this<00:00:58.090> particular<00:00:58.270> one<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:59.140> other

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
used it on this particular one the other

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.430 
used it on this particular one the other
thing<00:01:00.250> is<00:01:00.330> you<00:01:01.330> know<00:01:01.390> with<00:01:01.540> stress<00:01:01.930> sometimes

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
thing is you know with stress sometimes

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.900 
thing is you know with stress sometimes
they<00:01:02.620> need<00:01:02.650> a<00:01:02.800> little<00:01:03.070> different<00:01:03.370> dosing

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
they need a little different dosing

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.369 
they need a little different dosing
because<00:01:04.180> they<00:01:04.269> get<00:01:04.449> more<00:01:04.570> stress<00:01:04.900> than<00:01:05.140> like<00:01:05.350> a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
because they get more stress than like a

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.710 
because they get more stress than like a
domestic<00:01:06.010> dog<00:01:06.190> would<00:01:06.490> when<00:01:06.670> it<00:01:06.790> comes<00:01:07.000> to<00:01:07.300> the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
domestic dog would when it comes to the

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.350 
domestic dog would when it comes to the
anesthesia<00:01:08.140> but<00:01:08.440> she<00:01:08.680> has<00:01:09.550> gone<00:01:09.790> under<00:01:10.090> they
