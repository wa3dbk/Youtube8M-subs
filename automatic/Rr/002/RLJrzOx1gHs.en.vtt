00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
beating wise and there's been when we

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.650 
beating wise and there's been when we
look<00:00:13.799> at<00:00:13.920> either<00:00:14.429> DVD<00:00:15.030> or<00:00:15.179> blu-ray<00:00:15.420> technology

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
look at either DVD or blu-ray technology

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.500 
look at either DVD or blu-ray technology
has<00:00:16.230> always<00:00:16.379> been<00:00:16.619> an<00:00:16.740> argument<00:00:16.949> as<00:00:17.369> to

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
has always been an argument as to

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.000 
has always been an argument as to
upconversion<00:00:18.510> technology<00:00:19.230> where<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.890> it

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
upconversion technology where is it

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.380 
upconversion technology where is it
better<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.340> do<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> up<00:00:20.640> conversion<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.240> it

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
better to do the up conversion is it

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.000 
better to do the up conversion is it
better<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.720> do<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.320> player<00:00:22.529> or<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.920> it

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
better to do in the player or is it

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.740 
better to do in the player or is it
better<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.220> do<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.580> TV<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.269> generally

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
better to do in the TV and generally

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.750 
better to do in the TV and generally
speaking<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.199> television<00:00:25.710> has<00:00:25.920> better<00:00:26.519> up

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
speaking the television has better up

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.120 
speaking the television has better up
conversion<00:00:27.300> technology<00:00:27.869> than<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.650> exterior

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
conversion technology than the exterior

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.759 
conversion technology than the exterior
device<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.300> what<00:00:30.449> BT<00:00:30.660> wise<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.619> new

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
device so what BT wise is it's a new

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.110 
device so what BT wise is it's a new
technology<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.309> we've<00:00:32.520> been<00:00:32.700> tradition<00:00:33.059> to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
technology that we've been tradition to

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.970 
technology that we've been tradition to
our<00:00:33.210> televisions<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:34.170> senses<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.770> there's

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
our televisions that senses that there's

is being sold it's a matter of how the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.190 
is being sold it's a matter of how the
disc<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.680> mastered<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.780> when<00:01:36.780> you're<00:01:36.960> looking

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
disc is mastered so when you're looking

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.170 
disc is mastered so when you're looking
at<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.500> interlacing<00:01:38.130> technology<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.030> then

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
at the interlacing technology and then

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.330 
at the interlacing technology and then
