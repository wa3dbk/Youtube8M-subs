why is this important well for a number

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.920 
why is this important well for a number
of<00:01:22.020> reasons<00:01:22.549> one<00:01:23.549> being<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.390> allows<00:01:24.689> the

drain better in your garden now you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.410 
drain better in your garden now you
might<00:01:34.650> be<00:01:34.829> thinking<00:01:34.860> well<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.490> till<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.240> that

might be thinking well I till is that
not<00:01:36.630> good<00:01:36.840> enough<00:01:37.049> I'm<00:01:37.470> not<00:01:37.740> saying<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.130> not

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
not good enough I'm not saying it's not

not good enough I'm not saying it's not
good<00:01:38.610> enough<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:38.970> if<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> opportunity

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
good enough but if the opportunity

good enough but if the opportunity
presents<00:01:40.290> itself<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:41.159> should<00:01:41.729> consider

presents itself you should consider

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.600 
presents itself you should consider
double<00:01:42.509> digging<00:01:43.280> because<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.399> some

another way to look at double digging is
with<00:02:47.380> an<00:02:47.500> example<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.040> have<00:02:48.070> over<00:02:48.670> here<00:02:50.430> with

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.290 
with an example I have over here with
these<00:02:51.600> bottles<00:02:52.600> of<00:02:52.780> us<00:02:53.460> now<00:02:54.460> in<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:54.910> example

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
very nicely the year before okay so what

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.000 
very nicely the year before okay so what
are<00:03:16.840> we<00:03:16.930> going<00:03:17.050> to<00:03:17.140> do<00:03:17.260> we're<00:03:17.530> going<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.680> loosen

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
are we going to do we're going to loosen

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.850 
are we going to do we're going to loosen
the<00:03:18.130> topsoil<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:18.990> just<00:03:19.990> flip<00:03:20.230> it's<00:03:20.440> paid<00:03:20.709> it

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
the topsoil and just flip it's paid it

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.420 
the topsoil and just flip it's paid it
till<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.370> under<00:03:21.760> well<00:03:22.690> okay<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:24.040> here's<00:03:24.340> the

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
till it under well okay so here's the

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.060 
till it under well okay so here's the
plant<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:24.970> as<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:25.330> grows<00:03:25.450> as<00:03:26.020> of<00:03:26.770> the<00:03:26.860> roots

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.070 
plant and as it grows as of the roots
develop<00:03:27.490> it'll<00:03:28.120> go<00:03:28.240> all<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.660> way<00:03:28.690> down<00:03:28.750> until

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
develop it'll go all the way down until

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.680 
develop it'll go all the way down until
it<00:03:29.320> hits<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.650> subsoil<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:31.209> hasn't<00:03:31.660> been

losing the disadvantage to this is the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.710 
losing the disadvantage to this is the
route<00:03:34.959> will<00:03:35.320> begin<00:03:35.800> to<00:03:36.130> expand<00:03:36.760> outward<00:03:37.390> and

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
route will begin to expand outward and

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.100 
route will begin to expand outward and
try<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.530> penetrate<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:39.220> subsoil<00:03:40.120> because<00:03:40.959> it

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
try to penetrate that subsoil because it

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.530 
try to penetrate that subsoil because it
needs<00:03:41.320> more<00:03:41.590> root<00:03:41.890> development<00:03:42.250> that<00:03:43.180> puts<00:03:43.450> a

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
of the plant where you see it okay so

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.949 
of the plant where you see it okay so
we're<00:03:51.670> going<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.880> go<00:03:51.910> in<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:52.209> double<00:03:52.420> dig<00:03:52.780> it

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
we're going to go in and double dig it

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.050 
we're going to go in and double dig it
so<00:03:53.410> we've<00:03:53.560> got<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:53.830> subsoil<00:03:54.370> here<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:54.880> we've

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
so we've got the subsoil here that we've

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.100 
so we've got the subsoil here that we've
flipped<00:03:56.050> and<00:03:56.380> flipped<00:03:57.150> over<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.300> aerated<00:03:58.959> in

flipped and flipped over and aerated in
the<00:03:59.590> trench<00:03:59.920> so<00:04:00.790> we've<00:04:00.970> got<00:04:01.150> our<00:04:01.180> topsoil<00:04:01.780> hero

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.800 
can penetrate all the way down to the
subsoil<00:04:11.890> and<00:04:12.100> below<00:04:13.030> where<00:04:13.330> we've<00:04:13.510> loosened

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
subsoil and below where we've loosened

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.860 
subsoil and below where we've loosened
the<00:04:14.050> soil<00:04:14.320> at<00:04:14.620> a<00:04:14.980> couple<00:04:15.910> advantages<00:04:16.480> to<00:04:16.660> this

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
the soil at a couple advantages to this

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.020 
the soil at a couple advantages to this
is<00:04:17.080> one<00:04:17.680> there's<00:04:17.890> more<00:04:18.040> oxygen<00:04:18.190> in<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.730> soil

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
is one there's more oxygen in the soil

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.599 
is one there's more oxygen in the soil
and<00:04:19.060> that's<00:04:19.299> what<00:04:19.480> plant<00:04:19.870> roots<00:04:20.320> one<00:04:20.830> it's

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
and that's what plant roots one it's

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.090 
and that's what plant roots one it's
better<00:04:21.880> drainage<00:04:22.240> to<00:04:22.690> where<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.350> soil<00:04:23.620> the

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
better drainage to where the soil the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.280 
better drainage to where the soil the
water<00:04:24.280> doesn't

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
water doesn't

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.790 
water doesn't
hits<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:26.250> subsoil<00:04:26.850> and<00:04:27.210> just<00:04:28.080> sit<00:04:28.320> there<00:04:28.560> and

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
hits the subsoil and just sit there and

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.450 
hits the subsoil and just sit there and
begin<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:30.000> pull<00:04:30.270> up<00:04:30.540> and<00:04:30.840> it<00:04:31.740> takes<00:04:32.220> a<00:04:32.340> while

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
begin to pull up and it takes a while

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.200 
begin to pull up and it takes a while
for<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.820> water<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.180> drain<00:04:33.630> to<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:33.900> subsoil

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
for the water to drain to the subsoil

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.420 
for the water to drain to the subsoil
for<00:04:36.210> example<00:04:36.690> here<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:37.560> allows<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:38.100> water<00:04:38.250> to

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
for example here it allows the water to

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.730 
for example here it allows the water to
go<00:04:38.670> through<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.120> topsoil<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:40.080> drain<00:04:40.500> through

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
go through the topsoil and drain through

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.370 
go through the topsoil and drain through
the<00:04:40.860> subsoil<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:41.760> another<00:04:42.600> advantage<00:04:43.020> is<00:04:43.170> you

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
the subsoil and another advantage is you

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.020 
the subsoil and another advantage is you
can<00:04:43.590> plant<00:04:43.830> your<00:04:43.920> plants<00:04:44.220> a<00:04:44.460> little<00:04:44.490> tighter

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
can plant your plants a little tighter

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.450 
can plant your plants a little tighter
because<00:04:45.330> of<00:04:45.750> disadvantage<00:04:46.410> whenever<00:04:47.340> the

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
because of disadvantage whenever the

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.130 
because of disadvantage whenever the
plants<00:04:47.760> hit<00:04:47.910> that<00:04:48.060> subsoil<00:04:48.660> they<00:04:48.780> want<00:04:49.020> to

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
plants hit that subsoil they want to

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.440 
plants hit that subsoil they want to
expand<00:04:49.680> outward<00:04:50.190> if<00:04:50.370> you<00:04:50.610> haven't<00:04:50.850> double<00:04:51.240> dug

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
expand outward if you haven't double dug

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.540
