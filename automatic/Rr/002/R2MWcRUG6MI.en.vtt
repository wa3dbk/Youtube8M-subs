00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.609
 we prepare our ingredients 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.510
 we click on a little the butter and for 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:09.510
 make it run 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.670
 a few months will be precisely 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.930
 let's take though 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.980
 we add mix of the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.980
 form lumps 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.129
 we believe with milk 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.350
 always to get a nice and dough 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.350
 good 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.290
 we always accept cornstarch 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.290
 stirring 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.790
 we continue to improve those made 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.310
 add the vanillin 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.609
 we aim at boiling when we see 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:46.719
 form these bubbles on the edge 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:50.009
 we can lower the gap we release 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.009
 boil for 10 minutes 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.280
 you will see that we begin to think 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.220
 after ten minutes we can 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.550
 wait with the form to cool 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.610
 for in a ballet 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.610
 no
