out<00:02:47.660> I<00:02:48.310> started<00:02:49.310> doing<00:02:49.640> chrome<00:02:50.150> repairs<00:02:50.600> in

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
out I started doing chrome repairs in

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.770 
out I started doing chrome repairs in
1974<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.840> found<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.990> had<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.260> touch<00:02:54.650> for<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:56.750> I

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
1974 and found I had a touch for it so I

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.170 
1974 and found I had a touch for it so I
kept<00:02:57.200> on<00:02:57.530> doing<00:02:57.860> chrome<00:02:58.340> work<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:58.940> brass

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
kept on doing chrome work and brass

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.140 
kept on doing chrome work and brass
lamps<00:02:59.750> and<00:03:00.430> ended<00:03:01.430> up<00:03:01.550> doing<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:01.940> lot<00:03:02.090> of

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
lamps and ended up doing a lot of

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.470 
lamps and ended up doing a lot of
polished<00:03:02.950> work<00:03:03.950> which<00:03:04.370> which<00:03:05.000> is<00:03:05.030> another

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
polished work which which is another

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.350 
polished work which which is another
higher<00:03:05.810> level<00:03:06.380> because<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:07.100> can<00:03:07.700> actually<00:03:07.910> use

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
higher level because I can actually use

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.260 
higher level because I can actually use
a<00:03:08.390> little<00:03:08.690> bit<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:08.960> filler<00:03:09.320> with<00:03:09.620> chrome<00:03:09.950> and

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
a little bit of filler with chrome and

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.910 
a little bit of filler with chrome and
there's<00:03:11.270> some<00:03:11.480> tricks<00:03:11.780> with<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.140> brass<00:03:12.380> lamps

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
there's some tricks with the brass lamps

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.190 
there's some tricks with the brass lamps
as<00:03:13.100> well<00:03:14.560> so

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
as well so

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.890 
as well so
I'm<00:03:17.739> just<00:03:18.010> flowing<00:03:18.489> this<00:03:18.640> on<00:03:18.910> it<00:03:19.270> just<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:19.690> just

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
I'm just flowing this on it just it just

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.220 
I'm just flowing this on it just it just
flows<00:03:20.170> beautifully<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:22.090> material<00:03:22.930> member

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
flows beautifully the material member

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.729 
flows beautifully the material member
the<00:03:23.440> trim<00:03:24.220> is<00:03:24.430> very<00:03:24.790> clean<00:03:25.680> no<00:03:26.680> oxides<00:03:28.739> it

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
the trim is very clean no oxides it

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.900 
the trim is very clean no oxides it
should<00:03:29.980> be<00:03:30.129> a<00:03:30.160> beautiful<00:03:30.400> job

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
should be a beautiful job

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.190 
should be a beautiful job
and<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.540> just<00:03:33.690> takes<00:03:33.990> a<00:03:34.170> minute<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:36.780> get<00:03:36.960> this

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
and it just takes a minute to get this

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.550 
and it just takes a minute to get this
to<00:03:37.470> flow<00:03:37.710> on<00:03:37.740> there

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.730 

and<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.370> flux<00:03:41.640> is<00:03:41.850> non-corrosive<00:03:42.709> so<00:03:43.709> I

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
and this flux is non-corrosive so I

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.860 
and this flux is non-corrosive so I
don't<00:03:44.040> have<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.400> worry<00:03:44.670> so<00:03:44.760> much<00:03:45.030> if<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.540> if

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
don't have to worry so much if it if

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.080 
don't have to worry so much if it if
it's<00:03:46.170> not<00:03:46.590> fully<00:03:47.010> cleaned<00:03:47.430> off<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:47.940> part

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
it's not fully cleaned off of the part

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.210 
it's not fully cleaned off of the part
so<00:03:51.090> just<00:03:51.180> do<00:03:51.569> it<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:51.840> little<00:03:52.050> dabs<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.980> not

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
so just do it in little dabs to not

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.150 
so just do it in little dabs to not
overheat<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.910> part<00:03:54.180> we're<00:03:54.990> only<00:03:55.230> 50<00:03:55.800> degrees

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
overheat the part we're only 50 degrees

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.080 
overheat the part we're only 50 degrees
below<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.550> melting<00:03:56.880> point<00:03:57.360> of<00:03:57.480> this<00:03:57.630> trim

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
below the melting point of this trim

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.940 
below the melting point of this trim
this<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.330> really<00:04:00.900> worn<00:04:01.200> down<00:04:01.500> quite<00:04:01.830> a<00:04:01.860> bit

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
this is really worn down quite a bit

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.800 
this is really worn down quite a bit
this<00:04:02.370> is<00:04:02.580> where<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:02.880> really<00:04:02.910> collided<00:04:03.780> with

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
this is where it really collided with

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.860 
this is where it really collided with
the<00:04:04.020> asphalt<00:04:04.950> on<00:04:05.630> landing<00:04:06.630> so<00:04:07.110> it's<00:04:07.800> down<00:04:08.190> a

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
the asphalt on landing so it's down a

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.410 
the asphalt on landing so it's down a
bit<00:04:09.870> so<00:04:10.200> it's<00:04:10.380> it's<00:04:11.069> all<00:04:11.250> built<00:04:11.520> up<00:04:11.760> looks<00:04:12.150> good

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
bit so it's it's all built up looks good

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.590 
bit so it's it's all built up looks good
we'll<00:04:12.840> let<00:04:12.989> her<00:04:13.110> cool<00:04:13.290> off<00:04:14.269> turn<00:04:15.269> off<00:04:15.390> the

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
we'll let her cool off turn off the

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:26.030 
we'll let her cool off turn off the
torch<00:04:16.519> it's<00:04:17.519> going<00:04:17.790> in<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.000> water<00:04:18.030> wash<00:04:25.040> and

torch it's going in the water wash and

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.600 
torch it's going in the water wash and
I'll<00:04:26.220> get<00:04:26.460> after<00:04:26.669> it<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:31.070> we'll<00:04:32.070> come<00:04:32.310> up<00:04:32.340> and

I'll get after it and we'll come up and

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.250 
I'll get after it and we'll come up and
we'll<00:04:32.790> get<00:04:33.060> after<00:04:33.300> it<00:04:33.570> with<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.900> stainless

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
we'll get after it with the stainless

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.340 
we'll get after it with the stainless
steel<00:04:34.440> brush<00:04:34.950> again<00:04:35.810> because<00:04:36.810> I<00:04:36.930> just<00:04:36.960> don't

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
steel brush again because I just don't

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.750 
steel brush again because I just don't
want<00:04:37.500> to<00:04:37.560> have<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.860> flux<00:04:38.130> blowing<00:04:38.580> all<00:04:38.729> over

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
want to have the flux blowing all over

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.000 
want to have the flux blowing all over

build<00:04:51.210> up<00:04:51.860> I've<00:04:52.860> got<00:04:53.100> just<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.580> welders<00:04:54.860> grinder

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
build up I've got just a welders grinder

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.640 
build up I've got just a welders grinder
here<00:04:56.580> it's<00:04:56.789> an<00:04:56.970> air<00:04:57.240> tool<00:04:57.510> but<00:04:58.289> I've<00:04:58.440> made

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
here it's an air tool but I've made

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.320 
here it's an air tool but I've made
machine<00:04:59.190> these<00:04:59.370> fittings<00:04:59.850> so<00:05:00.000> you<00:05:00.090> can<00:05:00.180> put<00:05:00.300> a

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
machine these fittings so you can put a
