00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.180
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.910
 This theme is 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.580
 Here is footwork practice 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.220
 In terms of the three points we always want to be aware of 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.310
 When I usually practice footwork 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.869
 As six points that we always keep conscious 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.640
 The usual footwork practice that I put out 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.189
 I'm just doing it all the same 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.149
 I'm just doing it in the same way 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.579
 Those who have become a little bit nervous 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.070
 I want you to become aware of six points 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.429
 Level up to higher quality practice 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:48.769
 I think that I want to improve the effect of practice with one conscious 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.129
 The quality of the practice changes when the menu of practice changes 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.269
 I always do footwork practice and I wonder if I'm doing it for that 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.100
 I think I want you to think 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.280
 Then I would like to explain those six points 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.920
 First of all in the range that can be done as the first point 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.280
 It is to continue doing this In other words 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.390
 It feels like driving in, and the range where you can afford 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.420
 I feel like I keep doing with bread 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.360
 It feels like the ability does not improve much 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.460
 I think that there is, so I can do it or not 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.450
 If you keep track of the last-minute range in yourself 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.930
 It is to say that by doing so 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.360
 I'll have some room next time 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.600
 The footwork power to the extent you can carry it 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.770
 The bigger the better the better 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.610
 Switching to higher quality practice 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.930
 The second point is that I can 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.980
 The second point is that you can continue to bang for a long time 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.190
 Of course I just keep going 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.590
 Say that they will be loose to continue practicing 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.840
 It is good if there is a purpose but I myself have a fairly strong ball 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.729
 That you will be able to hit continuously 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.110
 I'm always aware of it, so I'll do my best 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.880
 Be aware that you can keep hitting with a strong ball 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.990
 This depends on the menu 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.260
 It also depends on the task at that time 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.770
 If you can refer to it as one of the consciousness you should have 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.090
 I think next is the third 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.170
 The third point is if you can make the pitch faster 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.370
 I am doing now 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.650
 Make footwork practice pitch as fast as possible 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.230
 I will make it in time with a faster pitch 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.069
 It is said that it moves and strikes back 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.650
 The whole series of movements gets smoother and faster 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.880
 I'm getting faster I'm talking about raising the pitch 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.620
 Because it will be able to respond so quickly 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.040
 Be sure to raise the pitch and practice little by little 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.720
 I think I want you to be able to raise 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.600
 Next, if we can increase the moving distance as the fourth consciousness 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.650
 For example, now from here to here 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.830
 I can do one by one forehand 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.180
 If it feels like it is fine 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.020
 Little by little I can not move my limit 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.849
 Please spread it. The limit that can move at once 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.099
 Please spread it, of course 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.660
 That's right, not only for all-forefootwork 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.560
 Among the various movements that limit 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.510
 It feels like it's going to stretch that moving distance 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.910
 Please make it bigger Next is the fifth consciousness 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.870
 The fifth consideration is to reduce mistakes 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.160
 If I can continue to bang at the second place 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.970
 I said, but I will not make a mistake while smashing 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.270
 Especially in the case of one-ball practice you have to continue with your opponent 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.530
 As mistakes don't go down 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.840
 I think, but when doing multi-ball practice etc 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.060
 Isn't it just moving? 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.580
 In terms of just not hitting 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.709
 Be sure to hit and reduce mistakes 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.540
 As a way to keep conscious 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.529
 If you count the number of mistakes, or how many consecutive in your head 

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.379
 In the form of saying if you count what is contained 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:23.069
 It's a mistake to get it done 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:26.710
 Accurately and surely even while moving 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.120
 I wonder if I will be able to strike 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.650
 I think as the last sixth consciousness 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.759
 I aim for a course I aim for a call 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.479
 When you are practicing footwork practice 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.240
 I'm pretty crazy about moving and hitting myself 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.520
 There are so many, but in the actual game 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.639
 How does the other party move in a moving and hitting situation 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.460
 While seeing where the other party is 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.710
 I have to break the call 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.490
 So I feel that I move and strike 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.740
 I can keep aiming the course firmly 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.939
 I think it's really important 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:07.419
 I am usually conscious about it 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.339
 We introduced six points 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:17.479
 In the form of just doing when doing footwork practice 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.960
 I hope you always keep in mind that you 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.680
 Even if you can not be aware of everything at once 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.210
 You will be able to move larger from now on according to the menu 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.999
 I will be able to move faster than usual now 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:34.300
 So one by one while having the problem 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.439
 If you are conscious of the quality of practice 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:42.659
 I think it will go up, so please try it 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:43.499
 Thank you very much
