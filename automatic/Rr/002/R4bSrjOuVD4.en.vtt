a long way you can either use your

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.080 
a long way you can either use your
mirror<00:03:35.120> look<00:03:36.120> out<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.390> window<00:03:37.969> but<00:03:38.969> when

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
mirror look out the window but when

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.759 
mirror look out the window but when
you're<00:03:39.269> using<00:03:39.540> when<00:03:39.810> you're<00:03:39.989> working<00:03:40.709> the

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
you're using when you're working the

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.470 
you're using when you're working the
steering<00:03:40.920> wheel<00:03:41.189> just<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.640> little<00:03:42.000> bit<00:03:42.120> goes<00:03:42.299> a

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
steering wheel just a little bit goes a

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.690 
steering wheel just a little bit goes a
long<00:03:42.599> way<00:03:42.810> like<00:03:42.989> so<00:03:43.680> we<00:03:43.799> turn<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:44.220> wheel<00:03:44.400> just

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
long way like so we turn the wheel just

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.789 
long way like so we turn the wheel just
use<00:03:46.459> minor<00:03:47.459> motions<00:03:48.060> because<00:03:48.439> the<00:03:49.439> back<00:03:49.620> of

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
use minor motions because the back of

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.410 
use minor motions because the back of
the<00:03:49.889> truck<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.459> going<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.790> swing<00:03:50.939> the<00:03:51.090> trailer

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
the truck is going to swing the trailer

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.050 
the truck is going to swing the trailer
a<00:03:51.450> little<00:03:51.689> more<00:03:51.840> than<00:03:52.019> you

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060
