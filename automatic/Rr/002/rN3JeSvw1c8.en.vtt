00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
 what kind of food 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.280
 We advise people who have a 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.380
 diabetes because we would basically advise 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.780
 the same as a person who does not have 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.840
 a diabetes but eating well 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.340
 and that is to eat well I guess it will be the 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:25.630
 next question then eat well is 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.640
 eat of all varied eating is to share 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.620
 in a manner appropriate to food as 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.060
 long day 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.760
 Y 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.390
 follow a Mediterranean diet that 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.450
 implies that groups are present 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.840
 of fruits and vegetables that what they're going to 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.510
 do is 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.780
 and can help us control appetite 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.840
 because they are food that has 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.480
 chew 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.090
 that on the other hand they are going to contribute 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.510
 many vitamins in many minerals 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.390
 water and little caloric value and fiber that 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.950
 they are the very important element at the time 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.200
 to calculate also the levels of 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.360
 glycemia and cholesterol 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.530
 not only fruit and vegetables to the 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:17.090
 man also has to take legumes 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.420
 and bread potatoes rice and pasta and these 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.950
 food many times 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.560
 and even induced by their own 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.579
 professionals worth 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.939
 sometimes these are too cropped 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.200
 Foods have been the basis of cooking 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:36.229
 traditional mediterranean 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.509
 and they are necessary because also apart 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.180
 to be the best energy source the 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.460
 better without discussion we could say that 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.700
 they are organic food for the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.170
 organism since they do not leave waste and 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.920
 all the cells of our body the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.340
 can use as energy source 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.630
 besides that they help us to control the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:02.049
 fats and protein foods meats 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.360
 fish eggs we need but 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.970
 we need in small quantity and that 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.590
 we need to enhance the quality of 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:15.000
 the food tastes color but in small 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.000
 we need a lot of quantities
