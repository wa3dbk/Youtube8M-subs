00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:15.630
 many car drivers my sustainability 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.190
 and driving pleasure exclude each other 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.110
 Stephan Wahl is with his team 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.920
 responsible for the development of the 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.660
 drive and megacity vehicle bmw i3 den 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.960
 first test drives until the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.310
 serial electric vehicle so me 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.930
 feel very connected because of it 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.210
 easy you can almost call it that 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.590
 such a little baby with a big one 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.090
 will that we ourselves develop here 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.680
 if it even bring here in series 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.480
 that means I am there myself 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.120
 fully with it also with heart blood thereby 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.489
 as well as the colleagues the plug in 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.360
 hybrid sports car bmw i8 on heart and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.309
 kidney test 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.740
 he combines the advantages of a 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.840
 emission-free electric drive with those 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.240
 a highly efficient combustion engine 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.830
 the sports car of the future with one 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.830
 breathtaking acceleration 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.290
 if an e car among these 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.970
 extreme conditions in heat 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.350
 or cold in lapland the 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.390
 then we can 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.040
 be sure that the driver easily 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.590
 driving in the megacities of this world 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.660
 can that be true 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.440
 checked for safety again 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.060
 georg bonus as a test engineer tests 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.800
 he prototypes with all those 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.530
 Expectations and requirements of a 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.450
 Customers even include one for the 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.770
 megacity designed car im 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.650
 high mountains to drive 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.240
 Who should provide for driving pleasure in the 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.470
 be unselfish even if that 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.119
 vehicle apparently not in this world 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.820
 fits in which we are moving right now 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.600
 It should still be able to do it all 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.820
 to overcome difficulties 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.990
 go anywhere in the customer like that 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.270
 also have fun 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.580
 to give our safe feeling 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.710
 sustainable emission-free driving of the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.860
 Electric car with a range of 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.920
 about 160 kilometers may not be rolling 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.869
 his waiver declaration 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.000
 my biggest fun is that people do that 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.950
 vehicle underestimate the others 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.330
 road users and then at the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.929
 green traffic light mostly the look 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.929
 to have 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.210
 Electromobility must always and everywhere 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.830
 Sustainability is about driving fun 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.830
 could necessarily be together
