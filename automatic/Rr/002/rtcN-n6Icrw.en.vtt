 let's start with this creepy doll 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.380
 of porcelain what I'm going to first that 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.450
 do is going to be plugging in my eyebrows I'm going 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.860
 to use wax but you can use 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.780
 glue stick what you want and 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.670
 then we're going to seal for the base 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.800
 I will use a base in your tics is 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.590
 very common because I want this effect 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.750
 very artificial plastic coating all over 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.130
 I will apply the face for all pink 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.050
 and also by the neck on top of 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.120
 eyebrows and mel to apply on the strips and 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.100
 in the eyelids then I'm going to replicate a 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.540
 little bit with a brush the area of 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.610
 eyebrows so it's pretty good 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.100
 covered medium-sized touches like 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.180
 porcelain they carry some dolls in 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.100
 reddish tone 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.470
 above the cheekbones of the forehead of the 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.990
 nose and also the chin and a little bit 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.450
 clarito in the front area of ​​all the 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.979
 face we are going to seal the eyelids 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.900
 mobile company start creating this 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.690
 depth effect I'm going to apply a 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.550
 dark green dark color in the area 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.530
 lower the eyebrow to want that effect 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.729
 as volume that I'll take towards 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.729
 the lateral of the nose 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.370
 I'm going to intensify this a little bit with 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.290
 the upper cut with black and then on 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.810
 the edge on bottom edge with some 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.090
 powders iron a few compact powders a 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.560
 skin color to make it a shadow 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.980
 brown so that you try to make the skin 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.750
 after going on to create the effect of the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.040
 ball joints I'm going to do it with some colors and 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.049
 some colors more colors 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.260
 fatty I will create what is the center 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.810
 of the break and I'm creating 'cracks' or 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.670
 breakages or just cracks that go to 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.150
 leave from this area and they will take 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.980
 especially an outward direction of 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.440
 the break but also some other 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.610
 is going to be cutting you one hour to 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.470
 create a more realistic effect of 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.129
 porcelain and will do the same too 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.129
 on the forehead 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.650
 as you see we have created different sizes 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.359
 smaller or thicker mothers 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.670
 we are happy the messenger creates the 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.260
 volume of the central break we're going to 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.359
 blur towards the center to create 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.280
 volume and in some of the thickest 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.680
 let's also create a volume with the 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.849
 black blurring on the sides and 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.120
 let's start creating to give 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:34.040
 luminosity giving white dots in 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.139
 some of the areas not in all one 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.420
 way a little to the rectory but not 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.549
 widespread and let's fading for 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.180
 create this from the point of light of an effect 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.180
 more than 13 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.210
 ah 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.740
 for the central area of ​​the forehead that is 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.110
 a little wider I will apply also 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.030
 a little bit of brown on the edges from 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.710
 the black then to brown and then to 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.960
 blank center to create this effect 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.760
 let's do the same thing in the other break 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.110
 and for the lips I'm going to catch silvio in 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.730
 the orange color and apply it in the 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.970
 center of lip and outer edges 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.550
 very slightly false eyelashes and 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.160
 the final touch is going to be part of the 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.070
 mask on the lower lashes is going to 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.780
 remove a touch of plastic to the face 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.970
 for that I'm going to mix glycerin that 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.980
 purchase in pharmacies with an illuminator 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.200
 clear liquid and applying it throughout 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.780
 the face area a bit a bit 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.240
 widespread to give this effect 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.830
 artificial we have a nice dress already 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.130
 we have finished this doll of why the 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.130

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.449
 effect as you have seen is an effect 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.130
 who carries his touch cited a bit of 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.139
 mystery but we can add 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.750
 as much mystery as you want with the 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:51.150
 costume contact lenses can add one 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.130
 little more creepy and good and by itself 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.930
 A broken doll gives me a little bit of 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.220
 yuyu and I hope you liked me 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.990
