going<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.730> game-changing<00:00:53.730> at<00:00:53.910> least<00:00:54.180> not

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
going to be game-changing at least not

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.040 
going to be game-changing at least not
in<00:00:54.570> regular<00:00:54.899> PvP<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.460> reason<00:00:56.840> it<00:00:57.840> was

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
in regular PvP for that reason it was

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.049 
in regular PvP for that reason it was
gonna<00:00:58.289> go<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:59.070> gonna<00:00:59.190> kind<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.550> go<00:00:59.640> inside

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
gonna go to it's gonna kind of go inside

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.939 
gonna go to it's gonna kind of go inside
with<00:01:00.510> reason<00:01:01.199> number<00:01:01.320> three<00:01:01.410> reason<00:01:01.859> number

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
with reason number three reason number

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.579 
with reason number three reason number
three<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.629> there<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:03.870> not<00:01:04.080> all<00:01:04.260> your<00:01:04.379> better

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
three is there it's not all your better

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.740 
three is there it's not all your better
so<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.369> invited<00:01:05.700> only<00:01:05.880> comes<00:01:06.150> around<00:01:06.299> every

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
so I invited only comes around every

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.899 
so I invited only comes around every
once<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.439> while<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.860> when<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.460> not<00:01:08.580> around

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
once a while and when it's not around

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.149 
once a while and when it's not around
the<00:01:09.540> damage<00:01:10.049> output<00:01:10.229> really<00:01:10.590> does<00:01:10.740> not<00:01:10.920> matter

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
the damage output really does not matter

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.590 
the damage output really does not matter
at<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.520> point<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:11.850> that's<00:01:12.180> where<00:01:12.360> solar

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
at that point so that's where solar

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.960 
at that point so that's where solar
surgeon<00:01:12.960> really<00:01:13.229> shines<00:01:13.740> because<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.760> already

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
surgeon really shines because it already

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.690 
surgeon really shines because it already
has<00:01:15.180> or<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.860> know<00:01:16.950> there<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.159> no<00:01:17.460> damage

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
has or you you know there is no damage

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.520 
has or you you know there is no damage
difference<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.630> there's<00:01:18.990> no<00:01:19.110> reason<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.500> you

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
difference so there's no reason for you

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.530 
difference so there's no reason for you
to<00:01:19.619> put<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.920> perk<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.369> perk<00:01:20.610> only<00:01:21.150> allows

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
to put that perk that perk only allows

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.840 
to put that perk that perk only allows
it<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.750> shoot<00:01:22.049> less<00:01:23.450> bullets<00:01:24.450> at<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.960> time<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:26.009> of

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
it to shoot less bullets at a time so of

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.760 
it to shoot less bullets at a time so of
course<00:01:27.090> if<00:01:27.509> you're<00:01:27.720> if<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.350> using<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
course if you're if you like using the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.069 
course if you're if you like using the

recommend<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.560> going<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.490> know<00:02:24.780> PvE<00:02:25.780> and

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
recommend you going to you know PvE and

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.510 
recommend you going to you know PvE and
use<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.590> there<00:02:26.740> because<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:27.280> know<00:02:27.400> the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
use it there because you know the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.830 
use it there because you know the
enemies<00:02:27.910> are<00:02:27.970> going<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.210> be<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.300> lot<00:02:28.510> stronger

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
enemies are going to be a lot stronger

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.710 
enemies are going to be a lot stronger
than<00:02:29.490> people<00:02:30.490> in<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.700> crucible<00:02:31.000> crucible

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
than people in the crucible crucible

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.870 
than people in the crucible crucible
there's<00:02:31.960> like<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.110> base<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:33.400> know<00:02:33.550> based

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
there's like a base you know based

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.970 
there's like a base you know based
health<00:02:34.210> bar<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.630> stuff<00:02:34.840> like<00:02:34.990> that<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.350> so

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
health bar and stuff like that and so

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.560 
health bar and stuff like that and so
you<00:02:36.280> will<00:02:36.790> be<00:02:36.910> able<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.150> eat<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.330> will<00:02:37.510> be

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
you will be able to eat it will be

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.420 
you will be able to eat it will be
easier<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:37.990> take<00:02:38.230> down<00:02:38.440> enemy<00:02:38.860> shields<00:02:39.130> and

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
easier to take down enemy shields and

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.560 
easier to take down enemy shields and
their<00:02:40.240> health<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.600> lot<00:02:40.750> quicker<00:02:41.160> so<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:43.270> fourth

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
their health a lot quicker so the fourth

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.140 
their health a lot quicker so the fourth
reason<00:02:43.990> is<00:02:44.350> or<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.160> just<00:02:45.430> basically<00:02:45.730> named<00:02:46.000> the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
reason is or I just basically named the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.400 
reason is or I just basically named the
fourth<00:02:46.360> reason<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.720> don't<00:02:46.840> really<00:02:47.020> need<00:02:47.260> it

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
fourth reason you don't really need it

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.070 
fourth reason you don't really need it
in<00:02:47.500> PvP<00:02:48.070> because<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.240> damage<00:02:49.480> output<00:02:49.780> is

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
in PvP because the damage output is

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.870 
in PvP because the damage output is
basically<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.650> same<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.220> there<00:02:51.550> is<00:02:51.700> no

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
basically the same and there is no

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.360 
basically the same and there is no
reason<00:02:52.330> to<00:02:52.510> have<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.110> higher<00:02:53.500> damage<00:02:53.770> rate<00:02:54.160> in

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
reason to have a higher damage rate in

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.940 
reason to have a higher damage rate in
PvP<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.090> get<00:02:55.270> me<00:02:55.420> because<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:55.960> extra<00:02:56.770> damage

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
PvP you get me because that extra damage

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.620 
PvP you get me because that extra damage
doesn't<00:02:57.370> actually<00:02:57.670> make<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.030> difference<00:02:58.120> I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
doesn't actually make a difference I

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.270 
doesn't actually make a difference I
understand<00:02:59.320> that<00:02:59.650> you<00:02:59.830> can<00:03:00.010> kind<00:03:00.220> of

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
understand that you can kind of

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.650 
understand that you can kind of
customize<00:03:00.460> your<00:03:00.790> character<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:01.210> the<00:03:01.420> point

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
customize your character to the point

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.450 
customize your character to the point
where<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:01.900> have<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:02.110> little<00:03:02.440> bit<00:03:02.530> more<00:03:02.740> defense

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
where you have a little bit more defense

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.620 
where you have a little bit more defense
and<00:03:03.700> have<00:03:04.450> like<00:03:04.630> a<00:03:04.690> lower<00:03:05.530> damage<00:03:06.310> intake<00:03:06.940> but

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
and have like a lower damage intake but

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.690 
and have like a lower damage intake but
it<00:03:07.990> still<00:03:08.380> does<00:03:08.650> not<00:03:08.800> make<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.070> difference<00:03:09.160> you

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
it still does not make a difference you

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.610 
it still does not make a difference you
can<00:03:09.790> still<00:03:10.150> take<00:03:10.360> people<00:03:10.660> out<00:03:10.780> very<00:03:11.410> quickly

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
can still take people out very quickly

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.380 
can still take people out very quickly
it<00:03:12.010> just<00:03:12.190> take<00:03:12.370> it's<00:03:12.550> like<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.880> one<00:03:13.090> or<00:03:13.270> two

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
it just take it's like a one or two

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.890 
it just take it's like a one or two
bullet<00:03:13.750> difference<00:03:14.350> now<00:03:14.680> reads<00:03:14.920> number<00:03:15.190> five

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
bullet difference now reads number five

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.420 
bullet difference now reads number five
so<00:03:16.900> those<00:03:17.020> regimes<00:03:17.140> I<00:03:17.650> don't<00:03:18.100> know<00:03:18.160> in<00:03:18.280> my

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
so those regimes I don't know in my

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.280 
so those regimes I don't know in my
opinion<00:03:18.760> are<00:03:18.970> very<00:03:19.180> easy<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.480> come<00:03:19.690> by<00:03:19.720> I<00:03:20.020> have

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290
