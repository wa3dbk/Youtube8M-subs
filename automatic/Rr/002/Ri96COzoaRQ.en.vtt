00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
and I've always found that I call mode

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.500 
and I've always found that I call mode
get<00:00:39.280> your<00:00:39.430> skill<00:00:39.640> level<00:00:39.670> up<00:00:40.030> and<00:00:40.210> stuff<00:00:40.390> like

get your skill level up and stuff like
that<00:00:40.570> so<00:00:40.750> that's<00:00:41.020> why<00:00:41.200> I'm<00:00:41.290> here<00:00:41.440> using<00:00:41.890> it<00:00:41.980> on

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
that so that's why I'm here using it on

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.420 
that so that's why I'm here using it on
a<00:00:42.219> hard<00:00:42.850> court<00:00:43.090> map<00:00:43.359> hardcore<00:00:44.079> server<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:45.129> 338

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
a hard court map hardcore server the 338

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.310 
a hard court map hardcore server the 338
is<00:00:45.730> grateful<00:00:46.210> range<00:00:46.449> sniping<00:00:46.989> and<00:00:47.170> it's

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
is grateful range sniping and it's

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.840 
is grateful range sniping and it's
generally<00:00:47.620> not<00:00:47.680> used<00:00:47.829> for<00:00:48.160> crowd<00:00:48.489> control<00:00:48.579> and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
generally not used for crowd control and

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.910 
generally not used for crowd control and
close<00:00:49.390> quarter<00:00:49.690> engagements<00:00:50.350> even<00:00:50.800> though<00:00:50.890> I

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
close quarter engagements even though I

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.560 
close quarter engagements even though I
kind<00:00:51.190> of<00:00:51.219> have<00:00:51.340> planted<00:00:51.760> iron<00:00:52.000> sights<00:00:52.239> put<00:00:52.449> on

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
kind of have planted iron sights put on

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.869 
kind of have planted iron sights put on
the<00:00:53.230> bolt<00:00:53.410> action<00:00:53.739> is<00:00:53.829> rather<00:00:54.010> slow<00:00:54.340> to<00:00:54.670> pull

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
the bolt action is rather slow to pull

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.689 
the bolt action is rather slow to pull
so<00:00:55.120> having<00:00:55.420> ranges<00:00:55.989> is<00:00:56.260> essential<00:00:56.920> to<00:00:57.160> avoid

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
so having ranges is essential to avoid

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.090 
so having ranges is essential to avoid
taking<00:00:57.969> damage<00:00:58.179> while<00:00:58.750> pulling<00:00:59.109> the<00:00:59.230> bolt<00:00:59.440> you

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
taking damage while pulling the bolt you

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.650 
taking damage while pulling the bolt you
also<00:01:00.340> do<00:01:00.489> not<00:01:00.519> want<00:01:00.850> to<00:01:00.910> rapid<00:01:01.329> fire<00:01:01.510> this

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
also do not want to rapid fire this

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.479 
also do not want to rapid fire this
weapon<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:02.199> bullet<00:01:02.440> deviation<00:01:02.980> can<00:01:03.160> go<00:01:03.280> all

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
weapon the bullet deviation can go all

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.970 
weapon the bullet deviation can go all
over<00:01:03.609> the<00:01:03.760> place<00:01:03.969> and<00:01:04.269> of<00:01:04.930> course<00:01:04.960> just<00:01:05.530> like

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
over the place and of course just like

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.980 
over the place and of course just like

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
absolutely certain it will actually be

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.069 
absolutely certain it will actually be

aggressive recon close cord and the bolt
pull<00:01:18.280> out<00:01:18.400> is<00:01:18.579> just<00:01:18.759> too<00:01:18.970> slow<00:01:19.329> to<00:01:19.689> be<00:01:19.840> an

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
pull out is just too slow to be an
