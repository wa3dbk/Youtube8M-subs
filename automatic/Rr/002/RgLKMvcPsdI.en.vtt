00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
and in the blushes you have a nice mix

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.810 
and in the blushes you have a nice mix
of<00:01:44.399> pinks<00:01:45.240> berries<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.140> peach<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.820> really

that's it for the most part there is

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.770 
that's it for the most part there is
also<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.250> mix<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.670> textures<00:01:50.939> image<00:01:51.329> do<00:01:51.570> that

sort of highlight these as well have

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.600 
sort of highlight these as well have
really<00:02:10.929> great<00:02:11.170> consistencies<00:02:11.950> across<00:02:12.340> the

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
really great consistencies across the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.400 
really great consistencies across the
board<00:02:12.819> they're<00:02:13.060> not<00:02:13.240> super<00:02:13.959> powdery<00:02:14.170> or

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
board they're not super powdery or

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.350

chalky some of the highlight powders can

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.880 
chalky some of the highlight powders can
get<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:16.780> point<00:02:16.990> if<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.260> really<00:02:17.530> try<00:02:17.740> and

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
get to that point if you really try and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.290 
get to that point if you really try and
layer<00:02:18.040> them<00:02:18.250> on<00:02:18.400> but<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.760> am<00:02:18.880> wearing<00:02:19.090> the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
layer them on but I am wearing the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.300 
layer them on but I am wearing the
champagne<00:02:19.750> on<00:02:19.780> my<00:02:20.020> cheeks<00:02:20.260> today<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:21.069> think

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
champagne on my cheeks today and I think

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.070 
champagne on my cheeks today and I think
it<00:02:21.370> gives<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.670> really<00:02:21.910> nice<00:02:22.150> sort<00:02:22.390> of<00:02:22.480> ethereal

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
it gives a really nice sort of ethereal

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.500 
it gives a really nice sort of ethereal
glow<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.740> despite<00:02:24.400> being<00:02:24.640> able<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:25.060> see<00:02:25.300> a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
glow and despite being able to see a

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.150 
glow and despite being able to see a
little<00:02:26.050> bit<00:02:26.170> of<00:02:26.260> chunky<00:02:26.530> shimmer<00:02:26.739> in<00:02:26.950> there<00:02:27.130> I

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
little bit of chunky shimmer in there I

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.860 
little bit of chunky shimmer in there I
don't<00:02:27.370> think<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.819> comes<00:02:28.030> across<00:02:28.270> on<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.690> face

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
don't think it comes across on the face

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.840 
don't think it comes across on the face
at<00:02:29.080> all<00:02:29.230> not<00:02:29.590> even<00:02:29.739> if<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.040> get<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.760> know

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
at all not even if you get you know

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.309 
at all not even if you get you know
pretty<00:02:31.090> up<00:02:31.330> close<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.870> don't<00:02:32.020> think<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.200> can

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
pretty up close I don't think you can

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.870 
pretty up close I don't think you can
even<00:02:32.470> see<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.770> on<00:02:33.040> my<00:02:33.130> cheeks<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.550> just<00:02:33.730> is

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
even see that on my cheeks it just is

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.390 
even see that on my cheeks it just is
very<00:02:33.910> light<00:02:34.810> subtle<00:02:35.560> sort<00:02:35.770> of<00:02:35.890> highlight<00:02:36.250> that

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
very light subtle sort of highlight that

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.640 
very light subtle sort of highlight that
these<00:02:36.550> create<00:02:37.030> like<00:02:37.720> why<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.200> blush<00:02:38.410> as<00:02:38.560> I

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
these create like why is the blush as I

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.140 
these create like why is the blush as I
think<00:02:38.860> are<00:02:38.950> very<00:02:38.980> comparable<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.760> singles

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
think are very comparable to the singles

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.030 
think are very comparable to the singles
that<00:02:40.209> you<00:02:40.360> can<00:02:40.570> buy<00:02:40.750> in<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.320> consistency<00:02:42.010> the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
that you can buy in the consistency the

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.650 
that you can buy in the consistency the
overall<00:02:42.519> quality<00:02:42.760> everyone<00:02:43.330> raves<00:02:43.510> about

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
overall quality everyone raves about

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.210 
overall quality everyone raves about
them<00:02:43.930> because<00:02:44.140> they<00:02:44.260> are<00:02:44.410> so<00:02:44.620> affordable<00:02:44.920> and

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
them because they are so affordable and

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.800 
them because they are so affordable and
that's<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.580> kind<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.790> quality<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.209> think<00:02:46.300> is<00:02:46.660> in

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
that's the kind of quality I think is in

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.050 
that's the kind of quality I think is in
these<00:02:47.019> my<00:02:47.860> overall<00:02:48.220> thoughts<00:02:48.489> on<00:02:48.670> this<00:02:48.790> are

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
these my overall thoughts on this are

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.759 
these my overall thoughts on this are
that<00:02:49.269> for<00:02:49.480> twenty-five<00:02:49.840> dollars<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.350> cannot

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
that for twenty-five dollars you cannot

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.770 
that for twenty-five dollars you cannot
beat<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.250> quality<00:02:51.670> that<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:51.940> get<00:02:52.120> in<00:02:52.330> here<00:02:52.630> as

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
beat the quality that you get in here as

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.290 
beat the quality that you get in here as
well<00:02:53.290> as<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.920> versatility<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:54.610> mean<00:02:54.970> the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
well as the versatility I mean the

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.630 
well as the versatility I mean the

only thing you're missing is a bronzer

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.880

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
really does provide like I said

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.600 
really does provide like I said
middle-of-the-road<00:03:11.080> sort<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:11.799> universally

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
middle-of-the-road sort of universally

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.850 
middle-of-the-road sort of universally
flattering<00:03:12.790> shades<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:14.290> contrast<00:03:14.799> that

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
flattering shades to contrast that

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.340 
flattering shades to contrast that
however<00:03:15.130> is<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:15.820> original<00:03:16.360> but<00:03:16.720> naked<00:03:17.140> eyes

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
however is the original but naked eyes

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.170 
however is the original but naked eyes
palette<00:03:17.709> which<00:03:18.040> in<00:03:18.250> retrospect<00:03:18.850> I<00:03:18.940> think<00:03:18.970> is

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
palette which in retrospect I think is

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.550 
palette which in retrospect I think is
kind<00:03:19.299> of<00:03:19.420> interesting<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:19.989> they<00:03:20.110> came<00:03:20.350> out

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
kind of interesting that they came out

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.620 
kind of interesting that they came out
with<00:03:20.799> more<00:03:21.040> of<00:03:21.160> a<00:03:21.280> hardcore<00:03:21.820> neutral<00:03:22.239> palette

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
with more of a hardcore neutral palette

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.250 
with more of a hardcore neutral palette
second<00:03:23.320> and<00:03:23.500> what<00:03:24.400> is<00:03:24.519> more<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:25.090> cooler<00:03:25.900> tone

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
second and what is more of a cooler tone

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.949 
second and what is more of a cooler tone
palette<00:03:26.769> first<00:03:27.130> so<00:03:27.910> here<00:03:28.060> again<00:03:28.180> you<00:03:28.329> have<00:03:28.570> 15

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
palette first so here again you have 15

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.240 
palette first so here again you have 15
shadows<00:03:29.350> and<00:03:29.470> I<00:03:29.500> really<00:03:29.709> don't<00:03:29.860> think<00:03:29.920> I<00:03:30.100> need

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
shadows and I really don't think I need

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.800 
shadows and I really don't think I need
to<00:03:30.280> hold<00:03:30.579> them<00:03:30.670> up<00:03:30.760> side-by-side<00:03:31.030> although<00:03:31.780> I

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
to hold them up side-by-side although I

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.870 
to hold them up side-by-side although I
will<00:03:32.019> for<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.769> see<00:03:32.980> that<00:03:33.160> they<00:03:33.340> are<00:03:33.370> very

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
will for you to see that they are very

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.300 
will for you to see that they are very
obviously<00:03:34.480> cool<00:03:35.110> toned<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:35.739> even<00:03:35.950> have<00:03:36.130> some

blushes and face powders the blushes are
slightly<00:04:05.140> different<00:04:05.739> I<00:04:05.890> think<00:04:06.489> there<00:04:07.359> are

don't in my original video review that I
have<00:04:45.159> of<00:04:45.430> this<00:04:45.610> I<00:04:45.819> mentioned<00:04:46.599> that<00:04:46.810> these<00:04:47.169> just

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
have of this I mentioned that these just

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.960 
have of this I mentioned that these just
missed<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.800> mark<00:04:47.919> in<00:04:48.129> terms<00:04:48.250> of<00:04:48.430> texture<00:04:48.849> they

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
missed the mark in terms of texture they

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.089 
missed the mark in terms of texture they
were<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.090> chalky<00:04:49.509> you<00:04:49.810> try<00:04:50.050> and<00:04:50.229> layer<00:04:50.770> them<00:04:51.009> up

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
were a chalky you try and layer them up

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:52.529 
were a chalky you try and layer them up
to<00:04:51.280> build<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.550> same<00:04:51.759> kind<00:04:51.789> of<00:04:52.090> highlight<00:04:52.419> I

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
to build the same kind of highlight I

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.510 
to build the same kind of highlight I
have<00:04:52.720> today<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.259> it<00:04:53.349> just<00:04:53.590> Falls<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.430> little

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
have today and it just Falls a little

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.249 
have today and it just Falls a little
flat<00:04:54.669> with<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.210> texture<00:04:55.750> that<00:04:55.840> they<00:04:55.960> have<00:04:56.139> it

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
flat with the texture that they have it

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.080 
flat with the texture that they have it
so<00:04:56.349> they<00:04:56.469> come<00:04:56.680> off<00:04:56.830> more<00:04:57.039> as<00:04:57.159> powdery<00:04:57.580> less<00:04:57.909> as

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
so they come off more as powdery less as

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.409 
so they come off more as powdery less as
this<00:04:58.750> shimmery<00:04:59.349> kind<00:04:59.949> of<00:05:00.159> thing<00:05:01.060> you<00:05:01.300> want

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
this shimmery kind of thing you want

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:02.700 
this shimmery kind of thing you want
going<00:05:01.629> on<00:05:01.870> on<00:05:01.990> your<00:05:02.050> cheeks<00:05:02.319> that<00:05:02.530> just

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
going on on your cheeks that just

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.469 
going on on your cheeks that just
doesn't<00:05:02.860> happen<00:05:03.129> with<00:05:03.430> these<00:05:03.610> so<00:05:03.879> I<00:05:03.909> will<00:05:04.240> have

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
doesn't happen with these so I will have

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.709 
doesn't happen with these so I will have
to<00:05:04.599> say<00:05:04.810> that<00:05:04.840> between<00:05:05.469> the<00:05:06.099> original<00:05:06.789> and<00:05:07.000> the

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:07.719 
to say that between the original and the

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:10.080 
to say that between the original and the
new<00:05:07.750> these<00:05:08.620> face<00:05:08.889> powders<00:05:09.310> halved<00:05:09.639> up<00:05:09.879> to

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
new these face powders halved up to

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.809 
new these face powders halved up to
their<00:05:10.360> quality<00:05:10.750> that<00:05:11.500> being<00:05:11.770> said<00:05:12.099> I<00:05:12.370> would

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
their quality that being said I would

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:15.330 
their quality that being said I would
have<00:05:13.000> loved<00:05:13.270> to<00:05:13.389> see<00:05:13.870> them<00:05:14.139> swap<00:05:14.560> out<00:05:14.800> one<00:05:14.860> of

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
have loved to see them swap out one of

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.249 
have loved to see them swap out one of
these<00:05:15.729> because<00:05:16.150> they<00:05:16.240> look<00:05:16.419> so<00:05:16.449> similar<00:05:16.780> for

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
these because they look so similar for

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:18.899 
these because they look so similar for
the<00:05:17.379> bronzer<00:05:17.770> because<00:05:18.009> as<00:05:18.129> you<00:05:18.250> can<00:05:18.370> see<00:05:18.430> today

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
the bronzer because as you can see today

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.059 
the bronzer because as you can see today
I<00:05:19.090> think<00:05:19.900> the<00:05:19.990> bronzer<00:05:20.530> that<00:05:20.680> comes<00:05:20.860> in<00:05:20.979> the

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
I think the bronzer that comes in the

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:22.589 
I think the bronzer that comes in the
original<00:05:21.430> palette<00:05:21.610> applies<00:05:22.120> really

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599 
original palette applies really

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:24.719 
original palette applies really
beautifully<00:05:23.259> and<00:05:23.500> think<00:05:23.979> that<00:05:24.159> I<00:05:24.190> could<00:05:24.639> have

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
beautifully and think that I could have

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.969 
beautifully and think that I could have
done<00:05:24.909> without<00:05:25.120> one<00:05:25.449> of<00:05:25.479> these<00:05:25.690> too<00:05:26.020> even<00:05:26.740> still

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
done without one of these too even still

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.950 
done without one of these too even still
is<00:05:27.219> that<00:05:27.370> any<00:05:27.550> reason<00:05:28.060> if<00:05:28.270> you<00:05:28.419> have<00:05:28.630> the

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
is that any reason if you have the

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.629 
is that any reason if you have the
second<00:05:29.500> edition<00:05:29.800> of<00:05:29.889> this<00:05:30.039> to<00:05:30.190> go<00:05:30.279> out<00:05:30.430> and<00:05:30.550> buy

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
second edition of this to go out and buy

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:31.769 
second edition of this to go out and buy
the<00:05:30.699> original<00:05:31.210> because<00:05:31.300> you<00:05:31.419> don't<00:05:31.599> have<00:05:31.690> that

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:31.779 
the original because you don't have that

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:33.719 
the original because you don't have that
bronzer<00:05:32.199> no<00:05:32.590> not<00:05:33.069> at<00:05:33.190> all<00:05:33.310> it's<00:05:33.520> just<00:05:33.580> a

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
bronzer no not at all it's just a

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.029 
bronzer no not at all it's just a
critique<00:05:34.080> likewise<00:05:35.080> I<00:05:35.500> don't<00:05:35.830> think<00:05:35.979> you

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
critique likewise I don't think you

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:37.350 
critique likewise I don't think you
should<00:05:36.190> go<00:05:36.279> out<00:05:36.310> and<00:05:36.460> buy<00:05:36.639> the<00:05:37.090> second

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
should go out and buy the second

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.850 
should go out and buy the second
iteration<00:05:37.690> if<00:05:37.960> you<00:05:38.080> don't<00:05:38.259> like<00:05:38.440> the<00:05:38.680> other

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
iteration if you don't like the other

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.769 
iteration if you don't like the other
shimmery<00:05:39.400> face<00:05:39.610> powders<00:05:40.000> in<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:40.270> first<00:05:40.509> one

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:40.779 
shimmery face powders in the first one

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.170 
shimmery face powders in the first one
it's<00:05:40.990> just<00:05:41.229> something<00:05:42.099> to<00:05:42.219> note<00:05:42.400> that<00:05:42.699> being

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
it's just something to note that being

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.879 
it's just something to note that being
said<00:05:43.479> I<00:05:43.539> do<00:05:43.779> think<00:05:43.990> that<00:05:44.319> if<00:05:44.469> you<00:05:44.590> have<00:05:44.740> the

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
said I do think that if you have the

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.709 
said I do think that if you have the
first<00:05:45.069> one<00:05:45.250> and<00:05:45.729> you<00:05:45.880> are<00:05:46.029> thinking<00:05:46.210> this<00:05:46.539> is

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:46.719 
first one and you are thinking this is

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:49.050 
first one and you are thinking this is
just<00:05:46.990> really<00:05:47.409> cool<00:05:47.770> had<00:05:48.370> I<00:05:48.400> know<00:05:48.550> that<00:05:48.969> they

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
just really cool had I know that they

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.399 
just really cool had I know that they
were<00:05:49.150> going<00:05:49.360> to<00:05:49.539> come<00:05:49.750> out<00:05:49.960> with<00:05:50.199> something

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.409 
were going to come out with something

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:52.619 
were going to come out with something
that<00:05:50.560> was<00:05:50.770> a<00:05:50.800> little<00:05:50.979> warmer<00:05:51.849> but<00:05:51.879> still<00:05:52.090> sort

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:52.629 
that was a little warmer but still sort

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:54.059 
that was a little warmer but still sort
of<00:05:52.779> neutral<00:05:53.199> I<00:05:53.379> would<00:05:53.650> have<00:05:53.740> gone<00:05:53.860> with<00:05:53.919> that

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:54.069 
of neutral I would have gone with that

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:55.950 
of neutral I would have gone with that
then<00:05:54.520> I<00:05:54.550> would<00:05:54.909> say<00:05:55.090> I<00:05:55.330> would<00:05:55.389> recommend<00:05:55.900> that

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
then I would say I would recommend that

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.990 
then I would say I would recommend that
you<00:05:56.050> buy<00:05:56.259> the<00:05:56.319> turn-the-other-cheek<00:05:57.099> palette

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
you buy the turn-the-other-cheek palette

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.149 
you buy the turn-the-other-cheek palette
just<00:05:58.029> because<00:05:58.509> the<00:05:58.930> shadows<00:05:59.289> are<00:05:59.469> drastically

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 
just because the shadows are drastically

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:01.830 
just because the shadows are drastically
different<00:06:00.520> the<00:06:00.879> blushes<00:06:01.270> are<00:06:01.389> different<00:06:01.750> the

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
different the blushes are different the

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.330 
different the blushes are different the
face<00:06:02.020> powders<00:06:02.379> are<00:06:02.529> different<00:06:02.860> it<00:06:02.949> really<00:06:03.190> is

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
face powders are different it really is

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.189 
face powders are different it really is
a<00:06:03.370> an<00:06:03.969> entirely<00:06:04.300> different<00:06:04.479> palette<00:06:05.050> and<00:06:05.139> you

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 
a an entirely different palette and you

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.860 
a an entirely different palette and you
can<00:06:05.440> have<00:06:05.650> two<00:06:05.979> without<00:06:06.610> having<00:06:07.029> any<00:06:07.210> overlap

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
can have two without having any overlap

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.869 
can have two without having any overlap
amongst<00:06:08.289> the<00:06:08.409> shadows<00:06:08.620> if<00:06:09.039> you<00:06:09.490> don't<00:06:09.669> have

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:09.879 
amongst the shadows if you don't have

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:11.790 
amongst the shadows if you don't have
either<00:06:10.180> of<00:06:10.449> these<00:06:10.659> palettes<00:06:11.169> I<00:06:11.319> would

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
either of these palettes I would

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.769 
either of these palettes I would
definitely<00:06:12.099> recommend<00:06:12.219> the<00:06:12.969> cooler<00:06:13.569> tone

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:13.779 
definitely recommend the cooler tone

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:15.300
