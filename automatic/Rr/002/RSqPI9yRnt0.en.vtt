00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
never had like structure to every

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.319

chapter<00:04:19.799> all<00:04:20.190> I<00:04:20.220> had<00:04:20.519> were<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.789> stories<00:04:21.180> I

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
chapter all I had were the stories I

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.029 
chapter all I had were the stories I

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
knew that exemplified it and then I

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.620 
knew that exemplified it and then I
think<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.460> spirit<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.060> book<00:04:24.240> is<00:04:24.419> very

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
think the spirit of the book is very

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.469

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
much that I write the way that I talk so

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.180 
much that I write the way that I talk so
I'm<00:04:27.780> more<00:04:27.990> of<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.169> storyteller<00:04:28.770> than<00:04:29.010> like<00:04:29.160> a

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
I'm more of a storyteller than like a

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.189 
I'm more of a storyteller than like a
technical<00:04:29.760> writer<00:04:29.910> and<00:04:30.660> I<00:04:30.750> was<00:04:30.870> just<00:04:30.990> like

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
technical writer and I was just like

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.750 
technical writer and I was just like
what<00:04:31.650> is<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:31.889> illest<00:04:32.190> way<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:32.370> tell<00:04:32.610> these

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
what is the illest way to tell these

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.580 
what is the illest way to tell these
stories<00:04:34.729> and<00:04:35.729> so<00:04:36.330> each<00:04:36.509> chapter<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:37.320> a

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
stories and so each chapter is a

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.320 
stories and so each chapter is a
collection<00:04:38.009> of<00:04:38.220> stories<00:04:38.400> that<00:04:38.639> exemplify<00:04:39.180> an

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
collection of stories that exemplify an

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.740
