00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.500
 avid of on excited wheels 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:09.059
 again because flower groups doing 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.920
 the difference by making different 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.179
 driving tests in this case has 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.549
 invited to several media 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.890
 that we come to prove what is the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.000
 new ecosport vehicle that although it is 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.800
 true we have seen the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.990
 presentation we have already handled it 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.689
 It is worth trying a vehicle with so much 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.539
 and with so much technology and try it 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.029
 in a place in a safe environment and 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.070
 I can make the most out of it 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.420
 I meet Erick Rodriguez coming 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.339
 being the instructor within the group 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.870
 flowers of almost all vehicles in 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.670
 this case with our that the eco sport 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.650
 spoke a little about this vehicle the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.059
 evolution that it has had even though 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.409
 It is a relatively new vehicle and 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.390
 obviously this model that is 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.070
 completely new again this time 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.070
 we are presenting what the eco sport 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.479
 2015 a vehicle that since 2012 that 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.150
 was launched in the savior of Bahia Brazil 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.979
 It has created a high impact on what 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.510
 It is selling vehicles form by 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:59.400
 what because it is one of seve compact or 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.710
 as the people who seek it 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.269
 tourism high the goodness of a whole sedan 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.880
 but with the characteristics of one is 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.940
 see metamonos where it has features 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.980
 techniques was a 1.5-liter engine 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.380
 double camshaft with technology 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.780
 tv etc very similar to the technologies that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.720
 they drive another vehicle type bite equipment 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.890
 baby and what is coyote we have a 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.810
 automatic gearhift gearbox 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.790
 that the main characteristic is that 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.470
 it's all building a box 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.390
 mechanics only with the activation of 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.280
 an automatic gearbox does that mean 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.950
 that gives us strength in another power with 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.410
 the assurance that we can manipulate the 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.390
 controls is the xxiv you can do the 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.490
 manual control if you want or handle it in 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.370
 drive abs system in what are the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.480
 brakes and airbags in everything 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.100
 It is the vehicle 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.220
 we have two versions the trend version 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.020
 that the version not so very not so austere 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.400
 and we have the titanium version that already 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.979
 comes with air leather seats 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.479
 digital conditioning like in this 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.800
 vehicle on warranty issues 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.170
 we know that outside has improved a lot 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.310
 the guarantee of their vehicles and good that 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.930
 tell me a little about the guarantee of 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.640
 this car because this vehicle has 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.190
 the bumper pump warranties that is 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.510
 of three years the guarantee of six thousand 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.970
 kilometers or three years in the part of 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.400
 powertrain or the back of massa 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.330
 for then what groups flowers is it 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.040
 and always gives an endorsement of 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.530
 how to tell you that you always have 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.720
 spare parts and has trained personnel 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.010
 certified directly the last time 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.720
 they were asking in fort and 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.700
 lately he has taken some colors well 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.780
 interesting and good we see it on skype and 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.910
 we see it in others in other models 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.980
 tell a little bit of the colors that 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.720
 we can count the color for the ecosport 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.780
 characteristic of lay people because the color 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.240
 orange a highly striking color what 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.700
 we also find in the ranger 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.650
 wildtrak a vehicle that is that inspires 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.150
 to the sporty air that does not stop being 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.460
 categorical from the luxury then it is a 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.110
 new color we have silver colors 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.870
 January color of the color that you like 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.240
 good one of the characteristics that you 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.510
 what you said at the outset is that it's almost 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.820
 almost a high tourism or ideal for 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.550
 our ideal market for our country 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.280
 and driving is so smooth and 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.170
 the action is as spacious as a 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.940
 This is how we are going to do the 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.040
 test drive everything you will be able to feel 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.410
 that the vehicle gives you the comfort of a 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.209
 sedan vehicle and that you behave 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.610
 as one of ups does not feel bump not 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.730
 you feel the tilt in the curves 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.489
 due to his suspension 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.140
 or an ideal car for users 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.909
 good what do you think my dear eric if 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.019
 let's go for a spin here on the track 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.830
 that has floral groups covered by 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.830
 we are going 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.710
 and in one of the things that has always 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.810
 liked of folk is futuristic that are his 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.090
 vehicles its finished obviously now 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.890
 of very high quality not only the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.780
 plastics but also in the 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.780
 moldings and we can notice 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.720
 almost all last vehicles 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.160
 generation I talked a little bit about what it is 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.480
 the interior equal the comfort that 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.840
 we are in heat and also as only 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.970
 there is a board ready lines that 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.050
 enhances same electric vehicle 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.540
 details formed 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.910
 black color piano blÃ¡zquez solitude la 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.380
 cornea in what is the vehicle or rudder 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:25.970
 and economical with what it is with 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.970
 to be better 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.770
 Performance 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.390
 radio 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.370
 serial 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.490
 also a keyboard where you can dial 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.310
 phone numbers here or use 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.670
 the voice command developed by itself 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.770
 they make good was thinking about everything 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.140
 this we already have a cell phone has a 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.550
 part and that is precisely so that of 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.320
 there but do not move it gives cam to be 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.360
 maneuvers together with fast grays 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.340
 sounds moved because I thought 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.780
 very interesting and obviously things 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.580
 series we love security 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.020
 as they think is a security we see that 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.990
 has the air bag air bag 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.449
 side air bag curtain bag 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.340
 air 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:32.389
 we are in the 26 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.860
 and good very interesting 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.600
 really is not the same see for 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.870
 television that you have been watching 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.850
 right now I really feel like 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.350
 full of inspiration to be able to handle a 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.840
 vehicle that although it is true is not 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.940
 designed for the sport really 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.650
 have fun many times so good 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.280
 invitation for our friends to

 they are watching us 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.600
 correct all of our advisors 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.740
 sales as they are to the discussion about 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.180
 the program age and in the desire to have 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.520
 well you heard it we'll see 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.870
 possibly in another country in another place 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.200
 with another vehicle as interesting as 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.200
 this
