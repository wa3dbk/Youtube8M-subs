00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 moin moin you are looking for the super 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.740
 service with the here what it here to 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.150
 Fine in the super searches the editorial 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.759
 stormed if my god cordially 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.219
 retold so sure I have new me 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.490
 brought cooler because there are so many 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.189
 alternatives and here is another one 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.609
 after the arctic now follows the old 5 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.980
 beta 7 xxx Indian specially for the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.840
 7900 series of the series 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.359
 as is customary 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.489
 we are just our current heat sink of 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.710
 solve the graphics card and that's how it looks 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.899
 whole then without your thick heat sink 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.180
 then how do you remove the existing one 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.670
 heatsink of your chipsets and 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.890
 start with it the left over 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.140
 remove thermal compound 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.690
 I use speed and fire gasoline around 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.550
 the residues of thermal grease 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.250
 remove and order the gpu yourself from the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.329
 thermal paste to free the arms and 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.800
 old movie finally brings one 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.590
 reasonable glue and not one 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.660
 two components mission like active though 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.659
 what is the heat sink for the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.630
 bastille's rear place at all 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.280
 graphics the holes just do not fit 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.830
 what's going on there 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.760
 but no problem with me anyway 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.850
 legally secure 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.060
 Well, let's start with the core problem 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.820
 to sprinkle glue on the chipsets 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.070
 He holds about ten seconds long pressure 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.020
 So let everyone on the heatsink 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.390
 Body is on it now and you can see it 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.479
 Silver are from the anti generation 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.710
 you take me in the place of fat 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.450
 misguided heatsink used because 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.390
 the screw holes just do not 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.549
 fit good solution i know in the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.950
 description is what hole slice 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.450
 you need this for your graphics card 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.850
 could replace the already existing 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.220
 hole slices on your peter now 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.140
 do not look what holes needed and 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.250
 then with the enclosed 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.259
 just wrench these little ones 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.259
 screws can turn in 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.910
 the superminister of german that 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.980
 Grease lump on it 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.180
 takes you too much wants to try now 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.720
 we still have the kag backplate 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.280
 out could easily get out of 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.590
 Fear that you botched that illegally 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.270
 in my room until is the backplate 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.450
 just with the black side behind 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.100
 on the bottom of the graphics card would be at the 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.380
 sticking out just screw the 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.860
 lie down small distance tiles and 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.470
 then write all this with this 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.060
 simply prescribe simple simple 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.540
 well and now comes the device 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.790
 on which my two how quite 140 mm 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.890
 Fans we find the installation is 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.020
 I do not need that easily anymore 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.730
 to make video that explains everything 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.190
 not even that needs it 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.440
 fucking instructions for this yes this part 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.170
 needs another card slot and 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.630
 so it is then mounted and promptly the 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.690
 air out of your peter insight into that 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.450
 most holy well missing German 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.400
 so the graphics card is now in there 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.080
 I'll start deep two 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.200
 to install fan 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.880
 you have two slot blind the right one 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.730
 with the three small holes located 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.580
 inside your stars and those with 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.190
 big and small hole comes 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.560
 outside your stars for stabilization 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.090
 the big hole is there for them to be the 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.190
 downtown dazzle yours already 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.930
 device could screw and this 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.720
 outside slotblende in retrospect 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.239
 can install that now comes the 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.850
 Ventilation device pushed into the slot 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.519
 and the second slotblende outside to 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.620
 stabilization screwed on it jaja 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.700
 that comes a bit sparkle work 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.820
 young it should all look like that then 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.890
 now only the fans with yours 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.799
 connect fan control or on the 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.280
 slots new mainboard is stuck 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.590
 that was my guide for the old 5 peter 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.209
 I hope it was fun 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.970
 everyone else is super looking for the videos 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:02.060
 sends in a p channel and I am 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.060
 mister german I'm really cool
