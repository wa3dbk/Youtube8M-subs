two<00:01:01.789> of<00:01:02.789> their<00:01:03.510> plaques<00:01:04.260> instead<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.280> eight

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
two of their plaques instead of eight

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.539 
two of their plaques instead of eight
like<00:01:06.450> most<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.840> them<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.369> see<00:01:08.520> you

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
like most of them have so you see you

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.109 
like most of them have so you see you
can<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.180> put<00:01:09.780> one<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.979> ice<00:01:11.580> one<00:01:11.850> I

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
can just put one in here and ice one I

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.490 
can just put one in here and ice one I
don't<00:01:12.450> know<00:01:12.510> how<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.720> get<00:01:12.840> ice<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.320> don't<00:01:13.439> know

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
don't know how you get ice I don't know

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.980 
don't know how you get ice I don't know
if<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.650> can't<00:01:13.860> get<00:01:13.950> ice<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:15.030> regular

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
if you can't get ice and just regular

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.499 
if you can't get ice and just regular
minecraft<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.430> guess<00:01:18.000> there<00:01:18.210> might<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.390> a

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
minecraft but I guess there might be a

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.130 
minecraft but I guess there might be a
way<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.920> get<00:01:19.920> ice<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:21.090> if<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.990> somehow

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
way to get ice but if you can somehow

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.510 
way to get ice but if you can somehow
got<00:01:22.439> ice<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.710> just<00:01:22.860> put<00:01:22.979> one<00:01:23.100> nice<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.430> you

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
got ice you just put one nice and you

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.190 
got ice you just put one nice and you
get<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> ice<00:01:23.850> one<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.750> that's<00:01:24.900> how<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.080> make

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
get the ice one and that's how you make

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.550 
get the ice one and that's how you make
the<00:01:25.710> most<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> plaques<00:01:27.080> there's<00:01:28.080> also<00:01:28.350> an

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
the most of the plaques there's also an

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.230 
the most of the plaques there's also an
item<00:01:28.799> called<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:29.070> char<00:01:29.400> near<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> don't<00:01:30.060> know<00:01:30.150> if

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
item called a char near I don't know if

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.910 
item called a char near I don't know if
I'm<00:01:30.329> pronouncing<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.689> correctly<00:01:30.920> but

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
I'm pronouncing that correctly but

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.890 
I'm pronouncing that correctly but
basically<00:01:32.520> what<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.700> does<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.540> will<00:01:33.659> all<00:01:33.780> show

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
basically what it does it will all show

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.969 
basically what it does it will all show
you<00:01:33.990> what<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.170> does<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.409> second<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:34.799> that's

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
you what it does in a second but that's

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.770 
you what it does in a second but that's
how<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.130> create<00:01:35.400> with<00:01:35.640> two<00:01:35.759> iron<00:01:35.970> one<00:01:36.540> above

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
how you create with two iron one above

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.920 
how you create with two iron one above
the<00:01:36.840> other<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.950> get<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:39.000> if<00:01:39.810> you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
the other and you get it and then if you

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.020 
the other and you get it and then if you
put<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> plate<00:01:40.560> down<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.520> pick<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.790> side

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
put a plate down you pick a side

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.490 
put a plate down you pick a side
whatever<00:01:42.270> side<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.540> want<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.899> turn<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.350> then

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
whatever side you want to turn and then

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.100 
whatever side you want to turn and then
you<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.770> place<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:45.570> put<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.899> and

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
you can place it so I just put it on and

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.090 
you can place it so I just put it on and
if<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.680> right<00:01:46.890> click<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.280> oh<00:01:47.460> whoops<00:01:48.979> if<00:01:49.979> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
if you right click it oh whoops if you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.179 
if you right click it oh whoops if you
right<00:01:50.340> click<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.060> make<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.570> move<00:01:51.780> but

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
right click it you can make it move but

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.410 
right click it you can make it move but
for<00:01:53.189> some<00:01:53.310> reason<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.670> plates<00:01:53.939> take<00:01:54.180> up<00:01:54.299> like

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
for some reason the plates take up like

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.100 
for some reason the plates take up like
a<00:01:54.450> whole<00:01:54.750> block<00:01:55.110> space<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.600> you<00:01:57.600> can't<00:01:57.899> like

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
a whole block space so you can't like

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.490 
a whole block space so you can't like
have<00:01:58.320> them<00:01:58.500> but<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.579> go<00:01:59.700> like<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.500> can

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
have them but if you go like this I can

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.039 
have them but if you go like this I can
just<00:02:01.619> make<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.920> spin<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.180> it's<00:02:03.299> really<00:02:03.689> weird

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
just make it spin but it's really weird

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.249 
just make it spin but it's really weird
sometimes<00:02:04.380> because<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:06.030> when<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.049> hit

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
sometimes because this the when you hit

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.729 
sometimes because this the when you hit
it<00:02:07.380> certain<00:02:08.959> hits<00:02:09.959> like<00:02:10.289> if<00:02:10.440> you've<00:02:10.560> left

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
it certain hits like if you've left

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.930 
it certain hits like if you've left
click<00:02:10.979> or<00:02:11.099> right<00:02:11.129> click<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.430> certain<00:02:11.849> things

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
click or right click to certain things

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.309 
click or right click to certain things
so<00:02:12.150> if<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.270> right<00:02:12.480> click<00:02:12.510> it

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
so if I right click it

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.259 
so if I right click it
sometimes<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:13.829> goes<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.129> way<00:02:14.159> and<00:02:14.519> then<00:02:14.939> I

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
sometimes it goes that way and then I

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.440 
sometimes it goes that way and then I
don't<00:02:15.689> even<00:02:15.780> know<00:02:15.930> how<00:02:16.049> to<00:02:16.079> like<00:02:16.439> understand

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
don't even know how to like understand

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.080 
don't even know how to like understand
how<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.510> do<00:02:19.379> it<00:02:19.530> like<00:02:19.709> oh<00:02:19.950> no<00:02:20.579> it's<00:02:20.700> confusing

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719 
but you might master it understand how

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
just place it in a different block space

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.489 
just place it in a different block space
which<00:02:42.239> is<00:02:42.269> alright<00:02:42.689> but<00:02:42.719> that<00:02:43.319> might<00:02:43.469> be

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:43.499 
which is alright but that might be

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.949

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:49.919 
there's also another I called the rails

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.280 
there's also another I called the rails
and<00:02:50.250> that's<00:02:50.849> just<00:02:50.969> with<00:02:51.120> forearm<00:02:51.599> in<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.959> square

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
and that's just with forearm in a square

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.619 
and that's just with forearm in a square
and<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.650> get<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.889> rails<00:02:53.099> now<00:02:53.819> these<00:02:54.060> are<00:02:54.389> sort

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
and you get the rails now these are sort

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.530 
and you get the rails now these are sort
of<00:02:54.719> like<00:02:54.780> those<00:02:55.530> except<00:02:56.400> what<00:02:56.669> they<00:02:56.819> do<00:02:56.879> is

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
of like those except what they do is

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.640 
of like those except what they do is
when<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.650> place<00:02:58.919> it<00:02:59.659> it<00:03:00.659> just<00:03:01.199> makes<00:03:01.439> it<00:03:01.590> so

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
when you place it it just makes it so

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.289 
when you place it it just makes it so
can<00:03:01.889> only<00:03:02.069> have<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.549> only<00:03:02.669> but<00:03:02.909> it<00:03:02.939> has<00:03:03.090> two

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
can only have it only but it has two

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.069 
can only have it only but it has two
options<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:04.049> guess<00:03:04.739> it's<00:03:04.889> for<00:03:05.069> sliding<00:03:06.079> but

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
options I guess it's for sliding but

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.619 
options I guess it's for sliding but
this<00:03:07.230> can<00:03:07.439> be<00:03:07.590> clicked<00:03:07.859> with<00:03:07.980> anything<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.510> now

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629
