00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.710 

basically<00:00:32.520> when<00:00:32.759> we<00:00:32.880> started<00:00:33.180> working<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.570> it

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
basically when we started working on it

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.500 
basically when we started working on it
we<00:00:34.050> didn't<00:00:34.320> want<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.530> make<00:00:34.829> another<00:00:34.950> sequel<00:00:35.609> so

started<00:00:38.460> from<00:00:38.730> scratch<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.649> just<00:00:40.649> built<00:00:40.949> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
started from scratch and just built a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.439

thing to note about all this stuff is we

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.830 
thing to note about all this stuff is we
have<00:05:23.930> two<00:05:24.470> basic<00:05:24.740> philosophies<00:05:25.400> that<00:05:25.430> we

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
have two basic philosophies that we

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.580 
have two basic philosophies that we
incorporate<00:05:26.840> that<00:05:26.960> everything<00:05:27.260> we're<00:05:27.380> adding

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
incorporate that everything we're adding

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.230 
incorporate that everything we're adding
to<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:27.770> game<00:05:27.979> we<00:05:28.729> have<00:05:28.849> to<00:05:28.910> make<00:05:29.030> sure<00:05:29.060> it's

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
to the game we have to make sure it's

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.050 
to the game we have to make sure it's
fun<00:05:29.449> it's<00:05:29.780> obvious<00:05:30.229> and<00:05:31.070> we<00:05:31.639> also<00:05:31.789> make<00:05:32.030> sure

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
fun it's obvious and we also make sure

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.530 
fun it's obvious and we also make sure
that<00:05:32.210> it's<00:05:32.510> balanced
