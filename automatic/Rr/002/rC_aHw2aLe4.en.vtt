00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
why are you not allowed to explore or

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:45.460 
why are you not allowed to explore or
even<00:03:28.290> fly<00:03:28.500> over<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.860> North<00:03:29.040> or<00:03:29.220> South<00:03:29.250> Pole

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.810 

why<00:03:46.470> did<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.799> Sun<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.130> Moon<00:03:47.310> appear<00:03:47.670> about

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
why did the Sun and Moon appear about

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.759 
why did the Sun and Moon appear about
the<00:03:48.000> same<00:03:48.209> size<00:03:48.480> in<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.810> sky<00:03:50.360> 400<00:03:51.360> big<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.290> 400

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
the same size in the sky 400 big and 400

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.160 
the same size in the sky 400 big and 400
times<00:03:53.010> forever<00:03:53.370> away

everyone<00:03:55.170> knows<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.910> eclipse<00:03:56.910> is<00:03:57.269> pure

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
everyone knows that eclipse is pure

everyone knows that eclipse is pure
coincidence<00:03:59.450> my<00:04:00.450> physics<00:04:00.840> teacher<00:04:00.989> told<00:04:01.320> me

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
coincidence my physics teacher told me

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.780 
coincidence my physics teacher told me
that<00:04:01.590> yeah<00:04:02.750> he<00:04:03.750> was<00:04:03.900> clever<00:04:04.430> see<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:05.519> ready<00:04:05.670> to

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
that yeah he was clever see you ready to

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.050 
that yeah he was clever see you ready to
teach<00:04:05.970> training<00:04:06.510> school<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.320> told<00:04:08.060> me

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
teach training school and told me

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.620 
teach training school and told me
everything<00:04:09.390> they<00:04:09.630> told<00:04:09.840> him<00:04:11.450> right<00:04:12.450> along

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
everything they told him right along

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.810 
everything they told him right along
railways<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.709> roads<00:04:14.190> like<00:04:14.790> in<00:04:15.000> India<00:04:15.360> have<00:04:16.229> no

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
railways and roads like in India have no

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.370 
railways and roads like in India have no
technology<00:04:17.820> for<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.090> Earth's<00:04:18.209> curvature<00:04:18.540> we

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
technology for the Earth's curvature we

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.680 
technology for the Earth's curvature we
should<00:04:19.650> show<00:04:19.950> some<00:04:20.729> sort<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:20.970> code<00:04:21.180> for<00:04:21.270> every

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
should show some sort of code for every

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:29.020 
should show some sort of code for every
20<00:04:22.109> miles<00:04:22.320> or<00:04:22.560> so

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.730 

hmm<00:04:30.030> why<00:04:30.450> can<00:04:30.630> you<00:04:30.690> not<00:04:30.810> fly<00:04:31.080> directly<00:04:31.530> from

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
hmm why can you not fly directly from

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.470 
hmm why can you not fly directly from
South<00:04:31.920> Africa<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:32.460> Australia<00:04:32.520> you<00:04:33.180> have<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.360> go

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
South Africa to Australia you have to go

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.790 
South Africa to Australia you have to go
through<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.750> Middle<00:04:33.990> East<00:04:34.110> or<00:04:34.350> Asia

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
through the Middle East or Asia

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:51.860 
through the Middle East or Asia
I<00:04:36.470> don't<00:04:37.470> fly<00:04:37.800> swinging<00:04:49.340> anywhere<00:04:50.660> it's<00:04:51.660> very

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
I don't fly swinging anywhere it's very

00:04:51.870 --> 00:05:09.220 
I don't fly swinging anywhere it's very
strange

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.890 

okay<00:05:10.820> why<00:05:11.820> are<00:05:11.880> there<00:05:12.180> not<00:05:12.330> thousands<00:05:12.780> and

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
okay why are there not thousands and

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.180 
okay why are there not thousands and
thousands<00:05:13.200> of<00:05:13.260> picture<00:05:13.590> of<00:05:13.680> Earth<00:05:13.830> from<00:05:14.040> all

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
thousands of picture of Earth from all

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.159 
thousands of picture of Earth from all
the<00:05:14.310> satellites<00:05:14.760> up<00:05:14.970> there<00:05:15.000> why<00:05:15.870> do<00:05:15.930> you<00:05:16.050> have

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
the satellites up there why do you have

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.130 
the satellites up there why do you have
the<00:05:16.290> same<00:05:16.530> for<00:05:16.919> you<00:05:17.010> graphically<00:05:17.730> enhance

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
the same for you graphically enhance

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.210 
the same for you graphically enhance
self-admitted<00:05:19.140> composites<00:05:19.710> from<00:05:19.890> NASA<00:05:20.100> all

self-admitted composites from NASA all
the<00:05:20.340> time<00:05:27.169> hmm<00:05:28.169> it's<00:05:28.919> a<00:05:28.980> bit<00:05:29.130> weird

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
the time hmm it's a bit weird

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.290 
the time hmm it's a bit weird
why<00:05:31.500> are<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:31.830> photos<00:05:32.160> of<00:05:32.490> Earth<00:05:32.640> perfectly

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
why are the photos of Earth perfectly

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.690 
why are the photos of Earth perfectly
round<00:05:33.510> when<00:05:33.750> there's<00:05:33.870> supposed<00:05:34.110> to<00:05:34.230> be<00:05:34.320> a<00:05:34.740> like

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
round when there's supposed to be a like

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:41.500 
round when there's supposed to be a like
bulge<00:05:36.450> at<00:05:36.720> the<00:05:36.840> equator

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.840 

why<00:05:42.510> are<00:05:42.570> you<00:05:43.110> so<00:05:43.620> resistant<00:05:44.220> to<00:05:44.340> the<00:05:44.430> idea<00:05:44.460> the

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
why are you so resistant to the idea the

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.490 
why are you so resistant to the idea the
earth<00:05:44.940> might<00:05:45.240> not<00:05:45.270> be<00:05:45.540> spinning<00:05:45.960> not<00:05:46.320> be<00:05:46.470> a

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
earth might not be spinning not be a

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.350 
earth might not be spinning not be a
globe<00:05:46.830> and<00:05:47.310> actually<00:05:47.640> be<00:05:47.729> the<00:05:47.850> center<00:05:48.180> of<00:05:48.270> the

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
universe that is a lot smaller and

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.280 
universe that is a lot smaller and
closer<00:05:50.070> than<00:05:50.400> we've<00:05:50.520> been<00:05:50.550> led<00:05:50.790> to<00:05:50.940> believe

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
closer than we've been led to believe

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.630 
closer than we've been led to believe
does<00:05:52.290> it<00:05:52.410> feel<00:05:52.530> like<00:05:52.590> a<00:05:52.680> religious<00:05:53.190> view<00:05:53.430> that

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
does it feel like a religious view that

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.909 
does it feel like a religious view that
you<00:05:53.729> refuse<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:54.120> examine<00:05:54.630> how<00:05:55.620> is<00:05:55.770> this

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
you refuse to examine how is this

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.050 
you refuse to examine how is this
different<00:05:56.100> to<00:05:56.400> knowing<00:05:56.610> about<00:05:56.700> the<00:05:56.880> New<00:05:57.030> World

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
curved do you think the Pacific Ocean is

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.790 
curved do you think the Pacific Ocean is
a<00:06:11.190> big<00:06:11.430> bulging<00:06:12.060> ball<00:06:12.300> of<00:06:12.479> water<00:06:12.660> and<00:06:13.380> if<00:06:13.560> so

a big bulging ball of water and if so

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.830 
a big bulging ball of water and if so
can<00:06:14.130> you<00:06:14.280> show<00:06:14.610> video<00:06:15.000> or<00:06:15.150> even<00:06:15.300> a<00:06:15.360> photo<00:06:15.630> of
