00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.020
 Y 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.549
 let's talk about chemical peels the 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.710
 chemical peels are one of the 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.200
 procedures most required by the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.750
 patients and one of the procedures 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.060
 most used by dermatologists to the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.170
 time to quickly improve the quality 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.510
 of skin 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.000
 What does a peel consist of? 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.500
 the application of a product an acid or 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.680
 an enzyme to exfoliate to peel bone 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.300
 remove different layers of skin 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.900
 returning a smooth smooth skin 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.170
 hydrated and regenerated the peeling can 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.690
 be superficial medium or deep 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.239
 according to the acid that we are going to use and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.519
 to the skin color phototype of 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.850
 patient is the professional who 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:56.580
 determines what type of peeling we are going to 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.920
 use in each type of patient is a 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.570
 method that combined with others 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.790
 aesthetic procedures as they can 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.790
 become the facial mesotherapy of 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.100
 same lifting and toxin placement 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.700
 botulinum or acid-filled 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.250
 hyaluronic provide great changes and 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.290
 Cutaneous splendor when and in what is 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.030
 indicated a peel was the first 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.700
 indication of peeling is in the photo 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.830
 chrono aging that this translates 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.000
 with stains 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.870
 Opacity is firmly elasticity 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.120
 dehydration of the skin that is 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.580
 product of the combined passage of time 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.210
 also with sun damage we can use 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.850
 the acne peel in roses and the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.950
 melasma melasma is a coloration a 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.070
 pigment acquired during a verse of 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.700
 hormonal order or also during the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.680
 pregnancy in scars and in marks for 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.260
 understand a little the products that 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.660
 we are going to use there are four big 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.420
 groups of acids or substances that 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.270
 we use we have the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.510
 AHAs hydroxyacids bt 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.700
 retinoic acid and tricolor acid 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.640
 acetic 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.830
 the alpha hydroxy acids are divided like this 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.720
 because they are a great family of acids 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.629
 who share a chemical structure and 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.060
 more or less similar molecular and 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:20.120
 they get from natural substances like 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.390
 are the cereals the milk and the fruit 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.390
 to name a little some of the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.080
 most used alpha hydroxy acids and more 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.330
 known 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.940
 we have acid ico man acid 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.610
 Kojic acid lactic acid 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.190
 glycolic and azelaic acid this 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.849
 family also share properties 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.329
 common are moisturizing softeners 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.130
 they provide the cutaneous splendor are 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:50.030
 exfoliants and they also have an effect 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.959
 beta hydroxy acids anti age is another 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.849
 group of acids the best known is the 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:00.080
 salicylic acid that you also get 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:03.760
 in a natural way it is a derivative of 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.210
 the willow leaf the salicylic acid 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.280
 It has great bactericidal power 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.970
 anti-inflammatory antiseptic and has 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.920
 affinity for lipid substances or 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.600
 be that quickly between the unit 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.940
 pilot was emptied directly to the 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.560
 sebaceous gland that is that this type of 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.450
 acid does not serve more than everything to 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.600
 Acne treatment for treatment 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.240
 of very oily skin and also for 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.610
 some spots other acid the acid 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.770
 retinoic acid with a very used in 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.390
 aesthetic dermatology to my liking is one 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:41.440
 of the most of my favorites the acid 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.790
 retinoic acid is derived from vitamin a 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.200
 has an effect that none has 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.840
 that stimulates cell production the 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.060
 be not see cellular the cell replacement and 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.600
 also directly stimulates the synthesis 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.480
 of collagen 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:01.050
 It has an important exfoliation power 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.970
 but also closes the pores or either the 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:08.040
 private partners leaving us a skin 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:11.220
 soft bone healthy and urgent when 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.550
 we are going to use a retinoic acid in 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.660
 acne in photo chrono aging by 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.450
 the characteristics that we said 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.690
 previously and in spots 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.720
 and the last acid is tricolor acid 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.030
 acetic acid derivative is a 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.950
 very powerful acid that you need to know 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.260
 use them the professional who decides 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.780
 when will you use it and whoever loses it 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.730
 will use because it acts by chemo 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.710
 coagulation of the proteins of the 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.160
 dermis of the most internal proteins of 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:44.910
 the dermis quickly passes the layer more 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.610
 external skin and you can only 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.249
 Use on light skins and very skins 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.349
 damaged photos 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:54.679
 if you meet those requirements is a 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:57.199
 excellent acid to combat the photo 

00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:59.809
 chrono aging because it leaves us a 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.899
 Pink skin, smooth skin and skin 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:05.539
 thinner and more elastic in all these cases 

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:08.059
 we are always the dermatologists the 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.339
 that we decided what kind of acids to what 

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:12.139
 type of peeling we are going to use and in 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:14.299
 what patients and how often 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:18.379
 because according to the acid we can 

00:05:14.299 --> 00:05:21.019
 do every 7 days every 15 days once 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:24.439
 per month or once a year also from 

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:29.179
 according to the depth that we are going to 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:31.129
 Directions are also indicated procedures 

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:33.679
 prior to peeling and indications 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:36.669
 Subsequent to the peeling for 

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:38.929
 be able to achieve better results 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:42.249
 any questions do not hesitate in 

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:42.249
 contact us thanks
