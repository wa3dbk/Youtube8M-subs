 he pays attention although in the 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.240
 more recent episodes of the future will 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.820
 shows that they will marry and have 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.530
 a beloved daughter was making her first girlfriend 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.060
 real was that tidal blanket that arrived 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.680
 as a new student to the fourth grade and 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.930
 interposed between the friendship of milk house 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.490
 and bart thanks to this last shaman is 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.009
 finishing a college of nuns and never 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.390
 reappeared in the series despite 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.039
 that my daughter kissed several times with 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.840
 she this fact is contradicted in another 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.460
 episode in which milhouse affirms that 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.590
 the menso with homero was his first 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.150
 also came out for a specific time web 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.460
 castle after it ended 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.200
 share later I would decide to 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.850
 publicly declare his love to liza 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.040
 but he was rejected in front of all the 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.870
 school and house starts to come out with a 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.130
 fifth year girl called tafí who 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.470
 he believes that what he did was very romantic 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.750
 the relationship goes well but smooth believes that 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.340
 tafi has other intentions in the end its 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.710
 new girlfriend abandons him because he believes 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.450
 this will never cease to generalize though 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.640
 it ruins his relationship liza admits that 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.520
 maybe he likes it and kisses him all 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.290
 goes well to milk house 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.030
 his combat friendship has brought him 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.500
 frequent problems on one occasion 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.270
 part sent his photo to crimes and 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.890
 solve what it did activate activate what 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.410
 chase up a waterfall in a 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.820
 parody of the movie the furtive in a 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.990
 occasion my daughter's mother forbade you 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.490
 that the boys were still watching 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.170
 because I knew that bart was a bad 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.340
 influence on him but more the finished 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.950
 convincing that my daughter will not be 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.420
 really the only friend that kept 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.160
 despite your loyalty for bart in 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.720
 Sometimes he has betrayed him like that 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.670
 who revealed that it was he who changed the 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.050
 songs of the mass the times that accused him 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.120
 falsely with his mom so that what 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.740
 take away from home or that episode in which 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.540
 he revealed to Jenny that Brown was the boy 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.980
 good what he said do of course 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.570
 how to forget that time he refused to 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.670
 sell him his soul back unless 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.500
 pay an exorbitant price 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.360
 although var says that they are only friends by 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.989
 geographic conveniences actually what 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.010
 I appreciate your parents pretty much 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.480
 suspiciously similar what has 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.250
 fact that for years rumors circulate 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.480
 among fans who say that they in 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.190
 they are actually relatives 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.260
 in fact var pointed that amazing 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.330
 similarity in the episode in which they 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.860
 they want to remarry in an episode 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.080
 most recent milhouse and revealed them to 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.760
 bart that his parents were cousins ​​the 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.110
 divorce kirk and luan shared the 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.430
 custody of mill house what the 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.500
 a principle advantage anticipated 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.950
 I would like them to meet, which 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.080
 made 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.910
 among many things my house is allergic 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.709
 to honey to his own tears in the 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.540
 Real milk is also constant 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.580
 victim of nelson jimbo's thrashing and 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.230
 your friends which is probably a 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.770
 of the reasons why he still wets 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.660
 bed 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.490
 despite all this has had its 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.080
 brief moments of popularity was 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.640
 chosen against his will to do the 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.680
 fiction child role in the movie 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.239
 of the radioactive man but the routines 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.130
 of recording and the attention received 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.500
 they located and they stopped the 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.120
 production of the film also when 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.680
 his parents were lost on a cruise the 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.270
 my daughter's melancholy made you all 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.340
 the girls at school will fall in love 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.380
 of him also when he moved to town 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.030
 capital took a tough guy attitude and 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.640
 he got the acceptance of his new friends 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.170
 making fun of bad and if that was not enough, 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.120
 daughter has transcended to the same series 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.120
 appearing in the lego movie as 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.440
 one of the master builders as well 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.360
