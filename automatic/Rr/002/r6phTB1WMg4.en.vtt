I<00:00:27.699> don't<00:00:28.699> have<00:00:28.820> to<00:00:28.939> tell<00:00:29.150> you<00:00:29.360> that<00:00:29.539> wrenches

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
I don't have to tell you that wrenches

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.929 
I don't have to tell you that wrenches
are<00:00:30.410> one<00:00:30.590> of<00:00:30.680> the<00:00:30.740> most<00:00:30.860> commonly<00:00:31.340> used<00:00:31.610> tools

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
are one of the most commonly used tools

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.240 
are one of the most commonly used tools
on<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:32.360> job<00:00:32.599> but<00:00:33.260> that<00:00:33.650> means<00:00:33.890> they're<00:00:34.100> also

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
on the job but that means they're also

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.790 
on the job but that means they're also
one<00:00:34.700> of<00:00:34.730> the<00:00:34.910> most<00:00:35.090> misused<00:00:35.620> let's<00:00:36.620> take<00:00:36.770> a

one of the most misused let's take a
look<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:37.100> see<00:00:37.250> what<00:00:37.340> I<00:00:37.400> mean<00:00:37.629> now<00:00:38.629> you<00:00:38.809> know

what kind of wrench you're using it's

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.820 
what kind of wrench you're using it's
important<00:00:50.449> to<00:00:50.540> remember<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:51.019> always<00:00:51.050> pull<00:00:51.800> the

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
important to remember to always pull the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.829 
important to remember to always pull the
wrench<00:00:52.309> toward<00:00:52.850> you<00:00:53.030> since<00:00:53.449> your<00:00:53.720> body

wrench toward you since your body

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.200 
wrench toward you since your body
generates<00:00:54.170> more<00:00:54.559> power<00:00:54.800> that<00:00:55.039> way<00:00:55.219> more<00:00:55.969> power

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
generates more power that way more power

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.119 
generates more power that way more power
means<00:00:56.480> more<00:00:56.750> control<00:00:57.200> and<00:00:57.469> more<00:00:57.680> control

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
means more control and more control

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.479 
means more control and more control
makes<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:58.610> job<00:00:58.789> safer<00:00:59.360> and<00:00:59.600> easier<00:00:59.930> but

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
makes the job safer and easier but

a loose faster now if you can use the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.600 
a loose faster now if you can use the
combo<00:01:29.990> wrench<00:01:30.290> to<00:01:30.500> break<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.890> fastener<00:01:31.369> loose

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
a ratchet and do your final tightening

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.890 
a ratchet and do your final tightening
with<00:01:37.549> the<00:01:37.670> Box<00:01:37.880> end<00:01:38.150> of<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.329> combination

with the Box end of the combination

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.789 
with the Box end of the combination
wrench<00:01:39.110> you'll<00:01:39.290> get<00:01:39.530> a<00:01:39.560> little<00:01:39.710> more

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
wrench you'll get a little more

wrench you'll get a little more
precision<00:01:40.400> and<00:01:40.520> control<00:01:40.640> if<00:01:41.210> you've<00:01:41.840> got<00:01:42.020> a

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
precision and control if you've got a

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.170 
precision and control if you've got a
really<00:01:42.380> tight<00:01:42.710> fastener<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:43.610> can<00:01:43.790> use<00:01:44.000> a

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
really tight fastener you can use a

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.630 
really tight fastener you can use a
