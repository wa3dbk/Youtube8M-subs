00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.149 
train himself from a very early age and
I<00:01:11.909> call<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:13.080> know<00:01:13.170> they<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> concept

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
I call it you know they have a concept

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.030 
I call it you know they have a concept
in<00:01:14.460> called<00:01:14.880> deliberate<00:01:15.390> practice<00:01:15.860> where<00:01:16.860> you

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
in called deliberate practice where you

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.370 
in called deliberate practice where you
learn<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.939> practice<00:01:18.270> what<00:01:18.720> you're<00:01:18.840> not<00:01:18.990> good

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
learn to practice what you're not good

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.560 
learn to practice what you're not good
at<00:01:19.409> because<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:20.070> often<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.729> we're<00:01:21.210> taking<00:01:21.330> up

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
at because we often if we're taking up

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.200 
at because we often if we're taking up
archery<00:01:22.020> or<00:01:22.110> basketball<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:23.340> find<00:01:23.640> something

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
archery or basketball we find something

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.429 
archery or basketball we find something
that<00:01:24.330> we're<00:01:24.479> good<00:01:24.630> at<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.020> tend<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.290> just

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
that we're good at and we tend to just

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.530 
that we're good at and we tend to just
repeat<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.250> then<00:01:26.340> our<00:01:26.540> practice

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
repeat that and then our practice

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.590 
repeat that and then our practice
becomes<00:01:27.869> very<00:01:28.080> one-sided<00:01:29.600> deliberate

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
becomes very one-sided deliberate

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.149 
becomes very one-sided deliberate
practices<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.200> practice<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.710> what<00:01:31.860> you're<00:01:32.009> not

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
practices to practice on what you're not

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.740 
practices to practice on what you're not

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
good at I call it

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.859 
good at I call it
resistance<00:01:34.680> practice<00:01:35.280> actually<00:01:36.210> practicing

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
resistance practice actually practicing

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.800 
resistance practice actually practicing
at<00:01:36.990> what<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.229> painful<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.270> enjoying<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.540> pain

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
at what is painful in enjoying the pain

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.190 
at what is painful in enjoying the pain
and<00:01:40.140> that's<00:01:40.590> Bill<00:01:40.920> Bradley<00:01:41.329> he<00:01:42.329> put<00:01:43.020> these

and that's Bill Bradley he put these

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.380
