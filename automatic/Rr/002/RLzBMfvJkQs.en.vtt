00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
cool so my club was at random like Spike

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.380 
cool so my club was at random like Spike
right<00:00:24.960> there<00:00:25.230> but<00:00:25.410> my<00:00:25.529> claw<00:00:25.769> was<00:00:26.070> at<00:00:26.279> UM<00:00:26.519> eight

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.140 
right there but my claw was at UM eight
stars<00:00:27.900> i<00:00:28.260> believe<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.920> i<00:00:29.220> got<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.760> 12

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
stars i believe and i got it up to 12

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:38.299 
stars i believe and i got it up to 12
and<00:00:31.700> so<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:33.030> went<00:00:33.149> from<00:00:35.450> 222<00:00:36.450> attacked<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.500> 242

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
and so it went from 222 attacked to 242

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.639 
and so it went from 222 attacked to 242
so<00:00:38.640> that's<00:00:38.850> pretty<00:00:39.090> dope<00:00:39.300> more<00:00:39.600> attack<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.230> know

these other Clips like let's say a claw

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.110 
these other Clips like let's say a claw
is<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:43.140> get<00:01:43.560> things<00:01:43.830> to<00:01:44.190> 15<00:01:44.700> stars

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
is that you can get things to 15 stars

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.440 
is that you can get things to 15 stars
so<00:01:46.110> look<00:01:46.440> right<00:01:46.620> here<00:01:46.820> getting<00:01:47.820> my<00:01:47.940> claw<00:01:48.210> from

so look right here getting my claw from
12<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.380> 13<00:01:49.800> stars<00:01:50.360> has<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> chance<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:52.160> booming

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
12 to 13 stars has a chance of booming

my<00:01:53.640> item<00:01:54.350> with<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> point<00:01:55.800> seven<00:01:56.040> percent

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
my item with a point seven percent

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.280 
my item with a point seven percent
chance<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:57.180> was<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.330> good<00:01:57.570> part<00:01:57.870> about<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.110> is

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
chance it was a good part about it is

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.100 
chance it was a good part about it is
that<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:59.160> can<00:01:59.340> actually<00:01:59.370> keep<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.570> item<00:02:00.780> i

called<00:02:09.060> as<00:02:09.869> long<00:02:10.050> as<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.259> get<00:02:10.350> a<00:02:10.410> clean

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
called as long as you get a clean

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.740 
called as long as you get a clean
version<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.670> item<00:02:12.060> then<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.600> can

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
version of the item then you can

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.330 
version of the item then you can
actually<00:02:12.870> kind<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.260> like<00:02:13.410> transfer<00:02:13.980> over<00:02:14.220> the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
actually kind of like transfer over the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.240 
actually kind of like transfer over the
stats<00:02:14.850> on<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.320> clean<00:02:16.560> item<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.100> you'll

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
stats on to that clean item so you'll

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.610 
stats on to that clean item so you'll
basically<00:02:17.430> have<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.540> same<00:02:18.870> claw<00:02:19.320> that<00:02:19.500> you

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
basically have the same claw that you

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.600 
basically have the same claw that you
