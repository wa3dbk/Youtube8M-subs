one lasted me a good amount of time but
still<00:02:17.810> when<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.200> know<00:02:18.410> it<00:02:19.130> just<00:02:19.190> now<00:02:19.490> looks

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
dollars and I thought to myself what

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.940 
dollars and I thought to myself what
would<00:02:26.300> have<00:02:26.510> happened<00:02:26.930> if<00:02:26.990> I<00:02:27.140> had<00:02:27.290> saved<00:02:27.620> that

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
would have happened if I had saved that

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.010 
would have happened if I had saved that
twenty<00:02:28.250> dollars<00:02:28.610> put<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:29.270> in<00:02:29.360> like<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:29.600> jar<00:02:29.990> or

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
twenty dollars put it in like a jar or

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.570 
twenty dollars put it in like a jar or
savings<00:02:30.650> account<00:02:30.740> or<00:02:31.040> something<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.490> just

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
savings account or something and just

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.670 
savings account or something and just
waited<00:02:32.120> until<00:02:32.390> I<00:02:32.570> had<00:02:32.750> enough<00:02:32.959> money<00:02:32.990> to<00:02:33.470> buy<00:02:33.650> a

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
waited until I had enough money to buy a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.890 
waited until I had enough money to buy a
high-quality<00:02:34.070> equivalent<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.570> would<00:02:35.780> be

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
high-quality equivalent that would be

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.140 
high-quality equivalent that would be
more<00:02:36.080> eco-friendly<00:02:36.440> come<00:02:37.340> from<00:02:37.550> better<00:02:37.850> place

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
more eco-friendly come from better place

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.780 
more eco-friendly come from better place
maybe<00:02:38.480> was<00:02:38.720> made<00:02:38.930> in<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.170> USA<00:02:39.680> made<00:02:40.459> from

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
maybe was made in the USA made from

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.210 
maybe was made in the USA made from
sustainable<00:02:40.970> materials<00:02:41.959> come<00:02:42.380> from<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:42.680> better

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
sustainable materials come from a better

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.880 
sustainable materials come from a better
smaller<00:02:43.790> company<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:45.140> product<00:02:45.470> rather<00:02:45.590> would

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
smaller company the product rather would

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.650 
smaller company the product rather would
have<00:02:45.980> lasted<00:02:46.280> me<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.430> lot<00:02:46.760> longer<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.239> would<00:02:47.570> have

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
have lasted me a lot longer I would have

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.449 
have lasted me a lot longer I would have
felt<00:02:48.110> more<00:02:48.290> proud<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.890> wanted<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.250> use<00:02:49.430> it

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
felt more proud and wanted to use it

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.000 
felt more proud and wanted to use it
more<00:02:49.760> often<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.360> I<00:02:51.200> just<00:02:51.380> would<00:02:51.800> have<00:02:51.860> known

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
more often and I just would have known

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.310 
more often and I just would have known
would<00:02:52.250> have<00:02:52.280> had<00:02:52.489> a<00:02:52.520> lesser<00:02:52.880> impact<00:02:53.239> so<00:02:53.989> that

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
would have had a lesser impact so that

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.930 
would have had a lesser impact so that
actually<00:02:54.530> just<00:02:55.100> occurred<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.430> me<00:02:55.580> today<00:02:55.790> so

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
actually just occurred to me today so

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.729 
actually just occurred to me today so
one<00:02:56.209> of<00:02:56.239> my<00:02:56.300> new<00:02:56.510> goals<00:02:56.750> is<00:02:56.930> just<00:02:57.230> put<00:02:57.530> money

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
one of my new goals is just put money

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.650 
one of my new goals is just put money
aside<00:02:57.890> instead<00:02:58.550> of<00:02:58.670> going<00:02:58.910> for<00:02:58.940> like<00:02:59.269> the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
aside instead of going for like the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.590 
aside instead of going for like the
inexpensive<00:03:00.170> quick<00:03:00.800> fixes<00:03:01.360> just<00:03:02.360> because<00:03:02.510> I

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
inexpensive quick fixes just because I

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.210 
inexpensive quick fixes just because I
want<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:02.900> right<00:03:03.080> now<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:03.650> I<00:03:03.950> think<00:03:04.130> it's

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
want it right now and I think it's

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.380 
want it right now and I think it's
really<00:03:04.280> important<00:03:04.850> to<00:03:04.910> get<00:03:05.120> into<00:03:05.300> that

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
really important to get into that

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.170 
really important to get into that
mindset<00:03:05.739> same<00:03:06.739> thing<00:03:06.950> can<00:03:07.100> go<00:03:07.130> for<00:03:07.489> food<00:03:07.730> you

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
mindset same thing can go for food you

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.360 
mindset same thing can go for food you
know<00:03:08.330> yes<00:03:08.720> organic<00:03:09.500> food<00:03:09.769> can<00:03:10.010> be<00:03:10.040> expensive

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
know yes organic food can be expensive

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.240 
know yes organic food can be expensive
local<00:03:11.060> food<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:12.230> actually<00:03:12.620> sometimes<00:03:12.890> be

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
local food and actually sometimes be

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.490 
local food and actually sometimes be
less<00:03:13.430> expensive<00:03:13.610> than<00:03:14.090> you<00:03:14.480> know<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:15.170> super

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
less expensive than you know the super

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.990 
less expensive than you know the super
processed<00:03:16.010> food<00:03:16.220> that<00:03:16.430> comes<00:03:16.549> from<00:03:16.730> across

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
processed food that comes from across

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.020 
processed food that comes from across
the<00:03:17.060> world<00:03:17.540> but<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:19.340> know<00:03:19.459> we<00:03:19.580> just<00:03:19.790> kind<00:03:19.970> of

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
the world but you know we just kind of

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.620 
the world but you know we just kind of
have<00:03:20.299> this<00:03:20.540> opinion<00:03:20.930> of<00:03:21.370> high<00:03:22.370> quality<00:03:22.630> things

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
have this opinion of high quality things

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.930 
have this opinion of high quality things
that<00:03:23.930> are<00:03:24.019> good<00:03:24.260> for<00:03:24.290> us<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.890> be<00:03:24.920> too<00:03:25.700> expensive

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
that are good for us to be too expensive

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.630 
that are good for us to be too expensive
so<00:03:26.540> if<00:03:26.900> we<00:03:27.110> look<00:03:27.140> at<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.500> long-term<00:03:27.769> benefits

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
so if we look at the long-term benefits

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.830 
so if we look at the long-term benefits
this<00:03:28.880> is<00:03:29.000> something<00:03:29.150> you<00:03:29.420> probably<00:03:29.630> already

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
this is something you probably already

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.170 
this is something you probably already
know<00:03:30.140> you<00:03:30.769> invest<00:03:31.100> money<00:03:31.370> now<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:31.670> you<00:03:32.090> have

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
know you invest money now and you have

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.510 
know you invest money now and you have
to<00:03:32.269> look<00:03:32.360> spend<00:03:32.660> less<00:03:32.840> money<00:03:32.900> later

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
to look spend less money later

food<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:44.260> course<00:03:44.470> there's<00:03:44.830> always<00:03:44.950> just

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
food and of course there's always just

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.060 
food and of course there's always just
that<00:03:45.550> ethical<00:03:46.180> impact<00:03:46.720> of<00:03:47.050> supporting<00:03:47.680> good

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
that ethical impact of supporting good

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.100 
that ethical impact of supporting good
businesses<00:03:48.760> as<00:03:49.000> opposed<00:03:49.300> to<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.540> bigger<00:03:49.780> ones

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
businesses as opposed to the bigger ones

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.920 
businesses as opposed to the bigger ones
that<00:03:50.380> are<00:03:50.500> really<00:03:50.770> just<00:03:50.920> there<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.160> make<00:03:51.400> money

that are really just there to make money

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.880 
that are really just there to make money
so<00:03:52.930> it's<00:03:53.110> just<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.350> matter<00:03:53.380> of<00:03:53.650> changing

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
so it's just a matter of changing

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.120 
so it's just a matter of changing
opinion<00:03:54.580> and<00:03:54.850> I<00:03:55.090> think<00:03:55.390> that<00:03:55.600> it's<00:03:55.900> also<00:03:56.130> takes

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
opinion and I think that it's also takes

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.150 
opinion and I think that it's also takes
a<00:03:57.400> change<00:03:58.120> in<00:03:58.270> lifestyle<00:03:58.750> at<00:03:59.050> all<00:03:59.170> I<00:03:59.410> know<00:03:59.830> that
