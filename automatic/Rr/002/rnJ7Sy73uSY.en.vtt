00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
you so that you can see if there's

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.410 
you so that you can see if there's
anything<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.719> you're<00:00:37.020> interested<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.770> and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
let's get started so the first shade is

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.600 
let's get started so the first shade is
called<00:00:41.399> snow<00:00:42.120> peach<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.040> what<00:00:44.280> snow

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
is watched and this is icy violate on my

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
is watched and this is icy violate on my
lips

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.960 

so<00:02:14.570> again<00:02:14.870> Revlon<00:02:15.350> released<00:02:15.800> five<00:02:16.340> lipsticks

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
so again Revlon released five lipsticks

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.090 
so again Revlon released five lipsticks
I<00:02:17.150> picked<00:02:17.390> up<00:02:17.510> four<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:18.020> five<00:02:18.230> as<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.530> stated

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
I picked up four of the five as I stated

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.880 
I picked up four of the five as I stated
and<00:02:19.460> I<00:02:19.520> think<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.090> red<00:02:20.330> was<00:02:20.630> called<00:02:20.990> Fifth

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
and I think the red was called Fifth

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.860 
and I think the red was called Fifth
Avenue<00:02:22.400> red<00:02:22.670> or<00:02:22.940> something<00:02:23.240> along<00:02:23.810> those

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
Avenue red or something along those

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.710 
Avenue red or something along those
lines<00:02:24.170> but<00:02:24.530> I'm<00:02:24.740> not<00:02:24.890> exactly<00:02:25.310> sure<00:02:25.690> again<00:02:26.690> I

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
lines but I'm not exactly sure again I

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.260 
lines but I'm not exactly sure again I
found<00:02:27.080> them<00:02:27.380> in<00:02:27.590> CVS<00:02:28.160> not<00:02:28.700> sure<00:02:28.970> where<00:02:29.150> else
