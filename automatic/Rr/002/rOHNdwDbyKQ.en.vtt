let's<00:00:37.980> begin

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
let's begin

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.959

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
motorcycle the first two LEDs are on the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.540 
motorcycle the first two LEDs are on the
front<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.680> don't<00:01:01.890> know<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.309> really<00:01:02.399> see

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
when I I hid this switch underneath this

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.320 
when I I hid this switch underneath this
plastic<00:02:22.170> piece<00:02:22.560> right<00:02:22.770> here<00:02:23.130> right<00:02:24.030> up

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
plastic piece right here right up

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.650 
plastic piece right here right up

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
tube in the front there's a one inside

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:10.750 
tube in the front there's a one inside
there<00:03:03.180> inside<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.660> fair<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:09.570> other<00:03:09.690> side

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
there inside the fair the other side

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.120 
there inside the fair the other side
inside<00:03:11.760> there<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:13.470> one<00:03:13.680> underneath<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.310> bike

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
inside there the one underneath the bike

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:24.170 
inside there the one underneath the bike
and<00:03:17.240> one<00:03:18.560> two<00:03:19.560> in<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.740> back<00:03:20.270> so<00:03:21.270> it<00:03:23.180> eliminates
