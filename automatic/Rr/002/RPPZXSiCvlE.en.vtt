to this type of performance with a new
MacBook<00:05:13.420> Pro<00:05:13.750> we<00:05:14.530> set<00:05:14.890> out<00:05:15.130> to<00:05:15.490> design

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
MacBook Pro we set out to design

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.010 
MacBook Pro we set out to design
something<00:05:16.450> extreme

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
something extreme

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.980 
something extreme
and<00:05:18.620> this<00:05:18.949> led<00:05:19.280> us<00:05:19.460> to<00:05:19.729> rethink<00:05:20.479> everything

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
and this led us to rethink everything

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.469 
and this led us to rethink everything
about<00:05:21.590> our<00:05:21.800> process<00:05:22.300> everything<00:05:23.300> about

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
about our process everything about

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.660 
about our process everything about
what's<00:05:23.720> essential<00:05:24.379> to<00:05:24.680> a<00:05:24.710> notebook

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
what's essential to a notebook

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.060 
what's essential to a notebook
and<00:05:26.910> that<00:05:27.270> meant<00:05:27.540> that<00:05:28.260> we<00:05:28.380> could<00:05:28.410> design<00:05:28.890> the

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
and that meant that we could design the

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.090 
and that meant that we could design the
very<00:05:29.430> best<00:05:29.760> computer<00:05:30.330> for<00:05:30.510> today<00:05:30.840> and<00:05:31.170> for<00:05:32.070> the

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
very best computer for today and for the

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.190 
very best computer for today and for the
future
