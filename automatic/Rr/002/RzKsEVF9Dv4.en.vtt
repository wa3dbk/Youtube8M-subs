00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.669 

and<00:00:51.699> then<00:00:51.820> you<00:00:51.879> want<00:00:52.059> to<00:00:52.149> pull<00:00:52.870> off<00:00:53.109> on<00:00:53.589> the

and<00:01:02.030> then<00:01:02.240> this<00:01:02.450> goes<00:01:02.690> on<00:01:03.129> probably<00:01:04.129> about

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
and then this goes on probably about

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.130 
and then this goes on probably about
three<00:01:04.640> times<00:01:04.879> and<00:01:05.449> then<00:01:05.570> you're<00:01:05.720> coming<00:01:05.900> into

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
three times and then you're coming into

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.480 
three times and then you're coming into
little<00:01:07.060> fast<00:01:08.060> part<00:01:08.440> it's<00:01:09.440> down<00:01:09.620> here<00:01:09.890> starts

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
little fast part it's down here starts

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.170 
little fast part it's down here starts
on<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:10.670> C<00:01:10.850> string<00:01:11.090> so<00:01:11.540> third<00:01:11.750> string<00:01:12.080> down

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
on the C string so third string down

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.750 
on the C string so third string down
sixth<00:01:14.180> fret<00:01:14.979> to<00:01:15.979> seventh<00:01:16.870> both<00:01:17.870> Paul<00:01:18.140> muted

then<00:01:19.760> you<00:01:19.850> want<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.090> go<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:20.210> nine<00:01:20.479> on<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.410> next

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
then you want to go to nine on the next

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.570 
then you want to go to nine on the next
string<00:01:21.860> go<00:01:23.200> twice<00:01:26.560> then<00:01:27.560> down<00:01:27.770> here<00:01:28.070> third

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
string go twice then down here third

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.910

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.490 
off from six or seven nine back up one
more<00:01:38.869> stir

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.889 

see

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.910 

and<00:01:49.469> then<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.680> go<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.860> nine<00:01:50.100> or<00:01:50.909> five<00:01:51.740> on<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
and then you go to nine or five on the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.539 
and then you go to nine or five on the
next<00:01:53.159> tree

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
next tree

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.969 
next tree
whatever<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.000> think<00:01:54.450> sounds<00:01:54.689> better<00:01:55.110> I

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.240 

personally<00:01:58.979> think<00:01:59.130> five

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
personally think five

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.430 
personally think five
that's<00:02:01.550> going<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:01.940> go<00:02:02.090> on<00:02:02.540> for<00:02:03.050> a<00:02:03.080> few<00:02:03.260> more

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
that's going to go on for a few more

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.170 
that's going to go on for a few more
times<00:02:03.710> I<00:02:04.070> think<00:02:04.190> you<00:02:04.400> do<00:02:04.550> that<00:02:04.580> two<00:02:05.030> or<00:02:05.150> three

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
times I think you do that two or three

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.960 
times I think you do that two or three
times<00:02:05.570> and<00:02:06.350> on<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:06.680> last<00:02:07.040> one<00:02:07.340> that<00:02:07.580> kind<00:02:07.880> of

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
times and on the last one that kind of

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.870 
times and on the last one that kind of
ends<00:02:08.210> that<00:02:08.390> riff<00:02:08.630> for<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.500> beginning<00:02:09.880> it's

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
ends that riff for the beginning it's

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.530 
ends that riff for the beginning it's
basically<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.810> same<00:02:11.990> thing<00:02:16.240> except<00:02:17.240> you

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
basically the same thing except you

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.640 
basically the same thing except you
don't<00:02:17.690> hit<00:02:17.960> five

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
don't hit five

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.990 
don't hit five
you're<00:02:18.770> gonna<00:02:18.860> hit<00:02:19.070> nine

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.059 

and<00:02:22.480> then<00:02:22.629> you're<00:02:22.780> gonna<00:02:23.019> do<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.379> same<00:02:23.620> little

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
and then you're gonna do the same little

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.830 
and then you're gonna do the same little
riff<00:02:24.250> but<00:02:24.879> instead<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.209> doing<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.540> on<00:02:25.689> the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
riff but instead of doing it on the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.210 
riff but instead of doing it on the
third<00:02:26.019> string<00:02:26.349> up<00:02:26.530> if<00:02:26.680> you're<00:02:26.799> gonna<00:02:26.920> do<00:02:27.069> all

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
third string up if you're gonna do all

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.000 
third string up if you're gonna do all
the<00:02:27.310> forward

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.470 

and<00:02:33.010> then<00:02:33.159> wherever<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.760> want<00:02:33.939> to<00:02:34.030> slide<00:02:34.450> down

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
and then wherever you want to slide down

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.900 
and then wherever you want to slide down
to<00:02:35.099> doesn't<00:02:36.099> really

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.620 

for<00:02:41.910> sounds<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.570> sonography

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.910 

and<00:02:48.630> then<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> next<00:02:49.110> part<00:02:49.290> gets<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.740> little

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
and then the next part gets a little

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.070 
and then the next part gets a little
fast<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.520> little<00:02:50.670> tricky<00:02:51.090> but<00:02:51.570> it<00:02:51.690> starts<00:02:51.960> on

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
fast a little tricky but it starts on

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.110 
fast a little tricky but it starts on
the<00:02:52.110> fourth<00:02:52.410> again<00:02:52.760> you're<00:02:53.760> gonna<00:02:53.850> do<00:02:54.030> it

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
the fourth again you're gonna do it

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.230 
the fourth again you're gonna do it
three<00:02:54.360> times<00:02:55.400> down<00:02:56.400> here<00:02:56.670> on<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.850> next<00:02:57.120> C

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
three times down here on the next C

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.560 
three times down here on the next C
string<00:02:57.570> third<00:02:57.930> string<00:02:57.960> down<00:02:58.760> seven<00:02:59.760> six<00:03:00.720> seven

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
string third string down seven six seven

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:09.190 
string third string down seven six seven
there's<00:03:03.570> also<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.960> palm<00:03:04.230> mute<00:03:04.260> in<00:03:04.590> between<00:03:04.890> them

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.530 

which<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.740> kind<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:11.070> tricky<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:11.730> learn<00:03:11.760> if
