00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.690
 with a special guest great journalist 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.820
 a guy a character from among the media 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.010
 of communication but a cute character 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.630
 nice it's very good to hear it the 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.089
 another day I learned by watching it in teis 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.100
 sports and palace makes him crazy and he 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.810
 it always comes out there I see it with pagan 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.949
 and so then welcome horacio 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.949
 thanks for being here on the mobile 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.460
 no thanks to you for inviting me and a 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.980
 very big greeting germÃ¡n the one we chose 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.379
 the most serious colleague the rest of the 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.699
 wives there are some women every 200 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.680
 journalists approximately in this 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.610
 scene behind are the brothers justin 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.610
 Bieber but do not give him a ball 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.940
 the comments tomorrow are now the 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.920
 they 're going to write I do not know what they're going to 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.690
 say it 's dangerous that we know by 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.979
 won the match against Iran will not is not 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.100
 dangerous because if they do not win the game 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:52.690
 by a landslide for difficulties I think 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.390
 that there are five the difference that they are going to 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.280
 translate mornings of results beyond 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.619
 of what that candle said they are 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.509
 strong mentally and physically there is a 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:03.339
 difference we have seen there is a 

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:06.040
 very big difference I suppose with 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.049
 any system wins but I do not 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.030
 like to be told what is being 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.040
 saying that the team that plays 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.920
 like Messi is the titular team of the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.479
 Argentina six months ago this did 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.460
 a shabelle test and it came out more nothing 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.290
 more but then the owner's team 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.509
 it's not the team that likes messi is the 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.950
 Argentine team that is the holder now 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.990
 now I do agree with you with those of 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.140
 will go that there is a difference of 45 goals 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.090
 now with what you are seeing today 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.920
 costa rica won italy qualifies 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.540
 like there are some surprises do not you think 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.370
 that you can get to equate something is 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.740
 impossible today with this Argentine team 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.540
 you can not surprise me as it is in 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.020
 all but already costa rica we had 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.119
 seen in the first game is that already the 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.220
 well match he announced what he could do 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.619
 when he won Uruguay and then he won 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.479
 Italy is a surprise but good 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.850
 is embodied will you saw the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.890
 party will go with him was terrible the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.350
 party is good unless react 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.539
 and that mental strength and strength 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.680
 physical do not do your word I think that 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:06.300
 also Argentina has the opportunity to 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.160
 show off and I guess this time it 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.259
 will take advantage if we are not all lost 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.050
 german this listens horacio pagani not to 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.000
 I like it because horacio and divides to 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.110
 the coaches among those who are the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 side of the good and those on the side 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.330
 of evil about how those games play 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.850
 equipment I want to ask you where they sell 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.790
 we set sail 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.700
 tacticista first time of the match 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.860
 another day of the extractivist this crisis 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.510
 is extreme but the other day from the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.530
 first time he was on the wrong side 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.370
 without any doubt that it was better in 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.440
 the borders 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.710
 now let's go let's see in this crisis 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.360
 is in a crisis is and has the 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.850
 misfortune to have the four these that 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.830
 they were imposed on the team then 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.270
 they have to stop them because the 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.370
 power that the Argentine team has 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.740
 there is not another one you saw when 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.560
 you have something to say I'm not so 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.390
 sure but this makes me win what you have 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.510
 He wanted to try something out of doubt and 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.980
 it went awful, how are you leaving today? 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.980
 miguel bossio como anda cuchi 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.840
 it's good 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.560
 a little while it was clear if sir how 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.750
 you are going to see tomorrow he meets a hundred matches 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.210
 Mascherano and celebrates 49 matches Sergio 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.430
 rosemary the archer think that mascherano 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.650
 is the 5 who has to play as you see 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.510
 and if the arch is well taken care of 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.510
 rosemary is your archer rosemary also 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.720
 I do not say that archers are other 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.090
 species of players to me it seems to me that 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.740
 any archer who is well in the 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.510
 Argentine football in any team 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.850
 the big ones who are well can 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.590
 playing in the selection is another position and 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.690
 it's okay for the coach when he chooses 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.090
 three archers keep them all the 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.650
 time more gray hair do all the 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.200
 archers in all matches one 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.240
 so it 's good to keep the 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.050
 Archers do not truly interested 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.850
 is that they change to rosemary it seems good and 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.890
 about Mascherano is fine a long time ago 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.910
 time you are playing in another position 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.680
 in Barcelona but it is useful in is for 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.260
 this team in the position that plays 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.670
 it's fine it's fine and besides it already has 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.340
 much experience yes from so many 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.770
 parties have experience and it's fine 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.130
 in the position that is and now I gag that 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.890
 it seems that he reacted 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.270
 master the team always and with this 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.850
 team you have to play it because this 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.350
 team can win matches with the 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.950
 power that you have and if you do some 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:40.020
 some goal that two little golitos make 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.400
 this to close and dismiss me 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.560
 I want to thank and I'm going to take these 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.940
 sayings of pagani grace to say that 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.500
 in journalism there are also people who 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.510
 is on the side of the evil that they are justly 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:54.590
 the two dolls that you have standing 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.590
 side one of clearly are from evil 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:04.310
 companionship health is something of all the 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.310
 Argentine press all the newsrooms 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.750
 people want to see me a great match 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.750
 people want to be me more scream for 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.750
 me clearly but good let's leave those 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:26.280
 times on television stretch not told 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.280
 never
