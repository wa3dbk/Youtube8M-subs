00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.160
 hello to all we find ourselves 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.660
 today for a new tutorial then 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.070
 in fact we do not often have the time to 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.930
 to wear makeup in the morning because we are 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.360
 in a hurry that's why I 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.250
 present today a little tutorial on 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.180
 how to make up the eyes in three 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.489
 small minutes 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.410
 so it's about putting on makeup disappointed my 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.149
 parents to remove their makeup and have a 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.160
 pretty look and to actually have 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.700
 the impression that we spent hours 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.559
 make up 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.649
 when it took us three 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.840
 small so I hope this look will go 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.750
 and if we appreciate more makeup 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.450
 you tie a little scarf like that 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.640
 on the head it will give you super bowl 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.500
 or African queen with her wearing 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.030
 altier then resume I have a whole 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.500
 small blow the trials that have very 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.720
 big it will be even more 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.060
 beautiful on her then me I you 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.950
 see you soon for a new studio is 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.430
 offline and most importantly do not forget to 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.300
 vote 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.300
 see you soon 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.650
 I always use the same lighthouse for the 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.450
 light touch it's really my 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.970
 prefer 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.350
 so I apply them on the set of 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.350
 the skin of the arcade 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.689
 2 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.060
 Then I will use a lighthouse Mary 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.530
 then the brown is good effect of 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.659
 find a maroci they are a 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.429
 little clearer than your skin or so 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.679
 a little darker so it does not get 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.869
 confuse with the color of your skin 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.149
 I like this one you have a lighthouse 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.420
 more round macopharma concept and I the 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.009
 is really very pretty so you 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.259
 apply it on the whole of the 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.270
 eyelid but without getting too high 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.429
 because then we will blur the top 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.880
 so apply it well but without them 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.880
 put to rest 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.030
 but 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.950
 now I'm going to blur the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.810
 brown lighthouse so I'll let you down 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.000
 so they can blend well with 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.070
 the light touch 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.070
 so here we fade on the top 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.330
 I will then used to a yellow lighthouse 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.790
 you have to be very good at taking anything 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.370
 what other color of the blue of the green of the 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.980
 red fluo then with this makeup 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.510
 can really let you down on the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.930
 under the colors there really is no 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.580
 worry 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.739
 because in the end you will only have one 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.170
 very small line on the arcade on the 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.760
 mobile eyelid that will be colored so 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.010
 do not hesitate to put block colors 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.849
 well flashy to very bright it will be 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.849
 even prettier 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.280
 so the device do not hesitate 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.660
 it is eyeliner of the same mucosa 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.310
 if it does not overflow a little bit it does not 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.290
 will not matter it rowing and doing a little 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.570
 little crazy it will always be nice so 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.430
 do not hesitate to charge well with the 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.290
 mark cream for this makeup there because 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.520
 that everything is really very light and that 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.790
 will allow the eyes to really better 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.790
 stand out 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.320
 I now apply the feature 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.050
 eyeliner on the eyelid 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.630
 so I always start with the middle 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.900
 and then I go back to the corner 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.180
 internally and then I go year from the corner 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.500
 external to the outer corner for a vale 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.500
 attracted the comma 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.370
 so for the little comma you 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.320
 going to do could get treatment from 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.120
 wisches if you go out if you want 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.410
 or it was to go to work that 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.079
 you want something here enough 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.750
 sober that just and pull it slightly 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.630
 trait so I opted for a trait 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.400
 quite long and its effects because 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.290
 I like that I find here but 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.150
 much better worth this way there 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.440
 but for you here according to your 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.080
 eyes according to the wolf you 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.080
 looking for you will adapt this feature 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.040
 and 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:03.060
 I have recourse but if he with a curl 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:09.120
 eyelashes 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.120
 and then I will put the mascara 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.169
 we 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:23.560
 I put it on the top wires and also 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.699
 on the bottom eyelashes 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.770
 so that's not because we have 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.629
 little sylla not very long knows 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.490
 obliged to my fossils months the 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.930
 false lille it's not too much my thing 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.000
 I do not like to put things that 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.330
 here is to buy fake stuff on me 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.430
 so that's not very serious 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.909
 so now I'm taking I'm going 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.069
 redraw the lips with a pencil 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:47.870
 raspberry rose who will be who has 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:49.819
 practically the same color as the 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.069
 lipstick I'm going to use so 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:55.250
 we just redraw the mouth 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:56.750
 and as it is an abscess lipstick 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.259
 creamy so to prevent it from 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.029
 overflowing 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:01.930
 that's why I really have contours 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:01.930
 and the mouth 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.170
 then I will also fill up so 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.540
 completed this fill lips with 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.820
 pencil that will allow the color of good 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.530
