00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
need some aluminium tip and we tend to

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.330 
need some aluminium tip and we tend to
find<00:00:37.110> these<00:00:37.260> electronics<00:00:38.219> stores<00:00:39.110> and<00:00:40.340> that's

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
find these electronics stores and that's

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.220 
find these electronics stores and that's
really<00:00:41.640> up<00:00:41.760> also<00:00:42.329> we<00:00:42.390> need<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.570> good<00:00:42.750> fetuses

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
really up also we need a good fetuses

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.400 
really up also we need a good fetuses
was<00:00:43.379> /<00:00:44.040> Oh<00:00:44.329> however<00:00:45.329> we've<00:00:45.899> already<00:00:46.079> done

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
that and my friend has used as

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.979 
that and my friend has used as
Leatherman<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.460> another<00:00:51.300> good<00:00:51.539> reason<00:00:51.690> why<00:00:51.930> to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
Leatherman so another good reason why to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.760 
Leatherman so another good reason why to
bring<00:00:52.320> multi-tools<00:00:53.010> with<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> handy

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
bring multi-tools with if is a handy

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.520 
bring multi-tools with if is a handy
okay<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.550> already<00:00:56.699> pre-cut<00:00:57.329> we've<00:00:58.289> got<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
okay so it's already pre-cut we've got a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.900 
okay so it's already pre-cut we've got a
top<00:00:59.390> scorer<00:01:00.390> piece<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.800> large<00:01:02.039> rectangle

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
top scorer piece and the large rectangle

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.660 
top scorer piece and the large rectangle
piece<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.359> going<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> be<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> sides<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.740> just

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
piece is going to be the sides so just

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.170 
piece is going to be the sides so just
move<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.000> camera<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:10.700> for<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.729> visit<00:01:11.909> of

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
move the camera for you for the visit of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.230 
move the camera for you for the visit of
fractions<00:01:12.830> that's<00:01:13.830> training<00:01:14.580> stuff<00:01:14.760> if<00:01:14.970> not

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
fractions that's training stuff if not

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:25.030 
fractions that's training stuff if not
support<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:16.400> so<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.729> going<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.090> go<00:01:18.210> on

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.160 

is<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.250> very<00:01:26.640> handy<00:01:27.000> reason<00:01:27.360> why<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.720> good

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
is that very handy reason why that good

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.740 
is that very handy reason why that good
to<00:01:28.320> have<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.770> because<00:01:29.189> if<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.360> boil<00:01:30.570> your

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
to have is because if you boil your

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.830 
to have is because if you boil your
water<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.880> but<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.150> need<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> cooks<00:01:33.659> here

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
water and but you so need the cooks here

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.109 
water and but you so need the cooks here
cooking<00:01:34.200> pasta<00:01:34.430> there's<00:01:35.430> an<00:01:35.520> example<00:01:35.970> is

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
cooking pasta there's an example is

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.870 
cooking pasta there's an example is
heating<00:01:36.720> up<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.170> put<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.799> bag<00:01:38.040> meals<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
heating up and put on the bag meals and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.359 
heating up and put on the bag meals and
they<00:01:39.840> tend<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.110> want<00:01:40.350> more<00:01:40.530> time<00:01:40.770> than<00:01:41.130> just

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
they tend to want more time than just

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.520 
they tend to want more time than just
bringing<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.909> boil<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.600> what<00:01:43.409> these

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
bringing it to the boil and what these

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.520 
bringing it to the boil and what these
allow<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.610> do<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.970> preserve<00:01:45.930> your<00:01:46.259> field

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
allow you to do is preserve your field

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.109

them one of our analysis because the
heat<00:02:52.440> males<00:02:52.680> would<00:02:53.510> eventually<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:56.299> so<00:02:57.299> this

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:53.890 
almost complete that's that's the base

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:59.730 
almost complete that's that's the base
on<00:06:55.170> and<00:06:56.250> the<00:06:57.250> stage<00:06:57.930> so<00:06:58.930> all<00:06:59.050> we<00:06:59.140> need<00:06:59.170> to<00:06:59.320> do<00:06:59.560> is

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:09.700 
down you may not even want to put it on

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.790 
down you may not even want to put it on
a<00:07:09.760> pal<00:07:10.060> and<00:07:10.270> you<00:07:11.050> can<00:07:11.170> just<00:07:11.320> place<00:07:11.560> it<00:07:11.590> on<00:07:11.770> top

after the first taping it slightly at

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.500 
after the first taping it slightly at
one<00:07:21.130> end<00:07:21.250> together<00:07:21.520> just<00:07:21.880> to<00:07:21.940> give<00:07:22.150> you<00:07:22.270> a<00:07:22.300> sort

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:22.510 
one end together just to give you a sort
