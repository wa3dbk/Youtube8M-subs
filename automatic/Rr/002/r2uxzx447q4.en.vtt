00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.109 
Brady obviously had great chemistry over
the<00:01:37.680> years<00:01:37.890> you've<00:01:38.070> had<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> lot<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.430> success

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the years you've had a lot of success

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.569 
the years you've had a lot of success
what<00:01:39.540> makes<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.170> relationship<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.100> special

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
what makes that relationship so special

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.429 
what makes that relationship so special
I<00:01:41.759> think<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> bond<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:42.930> off<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
I think the bond that we have off the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.960 
I think the bond that we have off the
field<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.250> know<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.399> think<00:01:44.460> everybody<00:01:44.909> just

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
field you know I think everybody just

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.630 
field you know I think everybody just
you<00:01:45.360> know<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.009> you<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.189> only<00:01:47.369> talk<00:01:47.610> about

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
you know you you can only talk about

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.700 
you know you you can only talk about
what<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.119> see<00:01:48.329> but<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> stuff<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.470> you

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
what you see but the stuff that you

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.990 
what you see but the stuff that you
don't<00:01:49.860> see<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.250> pretty<00:01:50.399> much<00:01:50.520> that's<00:01:50.850> what

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
don't see it's pretty much that's what

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.609 
don't see it's pretty much that's what
we<00:01:51.090> kind<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.390> bond<00:01:51.600> that's<00:01:52.350> what<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
we kind of bond that's what the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.990 
we kind of bond that's what the
relationship<00:01:53.070> has<00:01:53.189> been<00:01:53.310> built<00:01:53.640> off<00:01:53.939> the

than<00:04:22.950> in<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.160> past<00:04:23.340> because<00:04:23.610> this<00:04:24.000> league

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
than in the past because this league

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.909 
than in the past because this league
moves<00:04:24.510> more<00:04:24.720> towards<00:04:24.780> an<00:04:25.169> offensive<00:04:25.680> type
