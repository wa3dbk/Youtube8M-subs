zoom<00:01:32.130> back<00:01:32.159> out<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:33.960> little<00:01:34.380> LED<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.950> there<00:01:35.130> and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
zoom back out so little LED in there and

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
zoom back out so little LED in there and
a<00:01:35.520> pretty<00:01:35.729> small<00:01:35.970> reflector<00:01:36.479> not<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.140> this

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
a pretty small reflector not that this

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.600 
a pretty small reflector not that this
thing<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.500> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.650> give<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.950> massive<00:01:38.159> throw

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
thing is going to give you massive throw

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.219 
thing is going to give you massive throw
you'll<00:01:38.820> see<00:01:38.939> better<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.299> go<00:01:39.450> outside<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:40.049> is

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
you'll see better we go outside this is

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.630 
you'll see better we go outside this is
going<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> be<00:01:40.530> more<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.920> shorter<00:01:41.310> medium

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
going to be more of a shorter medium

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.940 
going to be more of a shorter medium

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
triple-a light as always I recommend

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.149 
triple-a light as always I recommend
that<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.079> use<00:01:52.229> nickel<00:01:52.920> metal<00:01:53.009> hydride

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
that you use nickel metal hydride

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.480 
that you use nickel metal hydride
rechargeable<00:01:53.820> batteries<00:01:54.630> instead<00:01:55.020> of

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
rechargeable batteries instead of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.700 
rechargeable batteries instead of
instead<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.549> alkaline<00:01:57.000> batteries<00:01:57.420> because

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
instead of alkaline batteries because

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.690 
instead of alkaline batteries because
rechargeable<00:01:58.710> ones<00:01:58.740> will<00:01:59.100> not<00:01:59.280> leak<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.579> your

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
rechargeable ones will not leak in your

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.580 
rechargeable ones will not leak in your
light<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.030> ruin<00:02:00.270> your<00:02:00.299> light<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.750> make<00:02:01.500> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
light and ruin your light and make you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.310 
light and ruin your light and make you
cry<00:02:02.630> all<00:02:03.630> right<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.780> got<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> zoomed<00:02:04.200> out<00:02:04.259> a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
cry all right I got a zoomed out a

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
cry all right I got a zoomed out a
little<00:02:04.500> bit<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.070> see<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
little bit just so you can see the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.980 
little bit just so you can see the
interface<00:02:05.670> better<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.390> way<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.570> turn<00:02:06.840> on

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
interface better so the way to turn on

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.510 
interface better so the way to turn on
the<00:02:07.110> light<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.710> tighten<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.069> head<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
the light is just tighten the head and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.150 
the light is just tighten the head and
it'll<00:02:09.000> turn<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.679> loosen<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.770> tighten<00:02:10.830> it

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
it'll turn it on loosen and tighten it

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.670 
it'll turn it on loosen and tighten it
and<00:02:11.370> it'll<00:02:11.580> switch<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.030> next<00:02:12.239> mode<00:02:12.620> so<00:02:13.620> you

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
and it'll switch to the next mode so you

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.370 
and it'll switch to the next mode so you
have<00:02:13.800> three<00:02:14.040> different

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
have three different

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.200 
have three different
outputs<00:02:14.740> and<00:02:14.980> then<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:15.160> warning<00:02:15.610> flashing<00:02:16.060> mode

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
outputs and then a warning flashing mode

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.730 
outputs and then a warning flashing mode
where<00:02:16.450> flashes<00:02:16.840> between<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.170> couple<00:02:17.470> different

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
where flashes between a couple different

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.590 
where flashes between a couple different
outputs<00:02:18.070> so<00:02:18.580> it's<00:02:18.700> good<00:02:18.850> for<00:02:18.880> signaling<00:02:19.480> you

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
outputs so it's good for signaling you

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.880 
outputs so it's good for signaling you
know<00:02:19.720> attach<00:02:19.990> this<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.230> your<00:02:20.350> pack<00:02:20.620> or<00:02:20.830> if

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
know attach this to your pack or if

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:21.630 
know attach this to your pack or if
you're<00:02:20.980> trying<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.190> get<00:02:21.310> somebody's

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
you're trying to get somebody's

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.460 
you're trying to get somebody's
attention<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:22.570> is<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.810> great<00:02:23.080> little<00:02:23.260> mode

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
attention this is a great little mode

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.140 
attention this is a great little mode
for<00:02:23.710> that<00:02:23.860> it's<00:02:24.370> not<00:02:24.430> going<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.700> be<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:24.790> rapid

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
for that it's not going to be a rapid

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.700 
for that it's not going to be a rapid
strobe<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.540> going<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.750> disorient<00:02:26.110> somebody

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
strobe is going to disorient somebody

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.070 
strobe is going to disorient somebody
but<00:02:27.040> it's<00:02:27.760> good<00:02:27.970> for<00:02:28.150> basic<00:02:28.450> purposes<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.050> you

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
but it's good for basic purposes so you

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.340 
but it's good for basic purposes so you
can<00:02:29.200> see<00:02:29.410> three<00:02:30.130> different<00:02:30.310> outputs<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.350> then

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
can see three different outputs and then

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.540 
can see three different outputs and then
that<00:02:32.530> warning<00:02:32.890> strobe<00:02:33.130> that<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.370> have<00:02:33.460> to

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
that warning strobe that you have to

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.370 
that warning strobe that you have to
choose<00:02:33.760> between<00:02:33.880> so<00:02:34.390> super<00:02:34.690> simple<00:02:34.990> interface

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
choose between so super simple interface

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.710 
choose between so super simple interface
nice<00:02:36.100> rugged<00:02:36.460> body<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.210> great<00:02:37.450> pocket
