00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
know kind of stuck I mean it the kids

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.589 
know kind of stuck I mean it the kids
would<00:02:27.609> have<00:02:27.700> kept<00:02:27.849> the<00:02:27.909> cars<00:02:28.090> anyway<00:02:28.390> just

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
would have kept the cars anyway just

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.479 
would have kept the cars anyway just
would<00:02:28.750> have<00:02:28.810> got<00:02:28.959> destroyed<00:02:29.349> and<00:02:29.769> damaged<00:02:30.189> I

would have got destroyed and damaged I

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.789 
would have got destroyed and damaged I
guess<00:02:31.329> that's<00:02:31.450> no<00:02:31.900> one<00:02:32.079> way<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.290> can<00:02:32.469> look<00:02:32.650> at

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
guess that's no one way you can look at

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.649 
guess that's no one way you can look at
it<00:02:32.829> another<00:02:32.980> way<00:02:33.159> it's<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.609> know<00:02:33.730> I<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:34.090> ripped

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
it another way it's you know I I ripped

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.990 
it another way it's you know I I ripped
these<00:02:34.780> kids<00:02:35.019> off<00:02:35.170> for<00:02:35.200> their<00:02:35.500> cards<00:02:35.859> but<00:02:36.640> I

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
these kids off for their cards but I

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.149 
these kids off for their cards but I
guess<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.870> real<00:02:38.019> question<00:02:38.049> becomes<00:02:38.530> down<00:02:38.950> to

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
guess the real question becomes down to

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.190 
guess the real question becomes down to
you<00:02:40.000> know<00:02:40.120> when<00:02:40.329> your<00:02:40.420> face<00:02:40.599> in<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.930> kind<00:02:41.170> of

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
you know when your face in that kind of

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.920 
you know when your face in that kind of
situation<00:02:41.290> do<00:02:41.859> you<00:02:41.920> think<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:42.519> right<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.689> go

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
situation do you think is right to go

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:44.910 
situation do you think is right to go
