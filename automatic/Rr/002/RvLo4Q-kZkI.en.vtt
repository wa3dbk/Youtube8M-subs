00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hi everyone with you keyboard and this 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.400
 probably a pilot issue of a new category 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.150
 where I will show custom cards for 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.250
 dota 2 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.099
 I will begin of course with those in which you can 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.850
 play alone and not need to collect 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.810
 lobby and either look for a bunch of friends because 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.390
 well, not all of them are not always there 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.630
 opportunity to collect 10 people is 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.170
 actually, well, 123 I understand it therefore 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.480
 let's start with a smaller fashion 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.140
 free roaming where we can choose any 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.190
 character and chose with dealers 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:45.600
 it is natural to pass the map here 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.059
 other bots but there will be different 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.250
 creeps let's say 1 we meet a wolf 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.410
 but it comes out 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:57.109
 ambush barely cobalt end 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.520
 Stiller them now for Masha if you 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.559
 like this heading write about it 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.019
 in the comment I will do then 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.360
 with montage the best moment and 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.750
 show exactly the passage of the cards will 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.360
 complete passing it separately and 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.020
 course will be like some advice in 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:23.909
 The card is worth playing which one is not on x 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:24.180
 grand cobalt soldier zabem 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.220
 him 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.400
 all of you remember in the third varika were 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.270
 cards on different passing here and 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.270
 as she points 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.570
 Naturally there will be both a shop and a purchase 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.550
 items but on this map unfortunately 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:50.630
 countersunk shops do not have go ka I better 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.630
 shop buy something 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:59.000
 naturally and turned off cheats in order 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.890
 to show you all the same 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.950
 The possibilities of this card are quick in 5 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.710
 minutes 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.240
 Firstly, this is a shop for a start. 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.500
 need a liftstiller 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.709
 from what can be bought without secret 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.260
 stalls it is natural hatchet it 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.660
 naturally bashir is naturally not 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.620
 I know halberd 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:33.209
 which gives us a miss and it's natural 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:41.750
 Sasha Yasha pt is now something a little and myself 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:41.750
 gold gave sasha yasha de sol pt 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.170
 you can arm years but I think the diode will be 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.930
 better okay now we are complete and 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.940
 I can show you some of the moment 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.240
 here as you see on the map on the lower left 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.520
 there are a lot of different zones but not all zones 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.280
 open until we pass some 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.670
 bosses are allowed to open one of 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.280
 Zones need to say kill the red one. 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:16.500
 here let's say we kill it right away 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:21.930
 we open up practically rumors of any 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:24.690
 monster could be bought 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.050
 additional jord but we have it and so 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.050
 enough 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.020
 cheats are not interesting to pass this 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.360
 the map is understandable, but I already have it 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:42.240
 passed therefore I advise you to try 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:44.010
 years one of the bosses by the way in the usual 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.880
 passing we would have to farm 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:53.220
 spawns are very long to achieve and 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:55.380
 kill this boss but we don't usually 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.410
 pass, I show you how it looks 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:02.840
 This card 4 will spawn every 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.840
 in cons as in a normal map 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:13.400
 and now the most interesting moment for me 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.120
 This card seems to be very good 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.420
 idea though its not fully realized 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:24.490
 completely managed it to include with action 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:29.090
 camera let's say we turn on now 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.950
 we turn and now we have from the third 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.750
 dessert faces but when we click on 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.840
 creep he's chosen so we 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.660
 active skills we cannot use plus 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:46.220
 here on this map the ceiling is therefore 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:48.080
 looks like going through the exit and naturally 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.180
 Now let's score on these creeps and show 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.620
 you now one more boss without which 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.910
 no cost access 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.450
 Roshana even have a rashan here you can 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:05.860
 add naturally authors fashion 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:07.130
 then add yours so here's this boss 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.620
 called 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:15.620
 but still not called but such 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:19.669
 we made 3 sides for them 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:22.430
 how about myself we get a bunch of it 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.790
 cursing it recently the update was up 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:30.110
 that he was red alim well so what 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:32.150
 Looks like adventure mod advise you 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.150
 at the request of him to play how to install 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.550

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:53.020

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.020
