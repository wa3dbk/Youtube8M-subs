00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
experience at this level the fact that

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.730 
experience at this level the fact that
she<00:01:11.760> has<00:01:12.030> meddled<00:01:12.420> before<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:13.049> thought<00:01:13.500> she'd

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
she has meddled before I thought she'd

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.280 
she has meddled before I thought she'd

be so much more relaxed coming to the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.020 
be so much more relaxed coming to the
board<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:16.740> clearly<00:01:17.040> there<00:01:17.369> was<00:01:17.460> tension<00:01:17.759> in

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
board but clearly there was tension in

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.730

the<00:01:18.090> body<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.140> first<00:01:19.380> dive<00:01:21.409> this<00:01:22.409> inward

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the body for that first dive this inward

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.060 
the body for that first dive this inward
two<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> half<00:01:23.340> somersault<00:01:23.850> spike

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
two and a half somersault spike

two and a half somersault spike
she's<00:01:27.070> cut<00:01:27.340> that<00:01:27.490> one<00:01:27.700> off<00:01:27.729> as<00:01:27.969> well<00:01:28.149> she's

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
she's cut that one off as well she's

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.679 
she's cut that one off as well she's
really<00:01:29.259> struggling<00:01:29.530> that<00:01:29.829> take<00:01:30.100> off<00:01:30.340> I<00:01:30.689> mean

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
really struggling that take off I mean

really struggling that take off I mean
normally<00:01:32.020> this<00:01:32.140> is<00:01:32.320> a<00:01:32.350> reasonably<00:01:33.340> easy<00:01:33.369> dive

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
normally this is a reasonably easy dive

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.090 
normally this is a reasonably easy dive
you<00:01:34.030> just<00:01:34.210> have<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.509> stay<00:01:34.689> in<00:01:34.960> balance<00:01:35.170> let<00:01:35.979> the

points behind her first you wouldn't

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.610 
points behind her first you wouldn't
think<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.599> you<00:04:15.900> should<00:04:16.100> chase<00:04:17.100> in<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.430> pack

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620

jump<00:04:25.100> she<00:04:26.100> misses<00:04:26.340> again<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:26.970> just<00:04:27.360> think<00:04:27.570> that

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
jump she misses again I just think that

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.120 
jump she misses again I just think that
everything<00:04:28.139> but<00:04:28.260> she<00:04:28.380> just<00:04:28.530> feels<00:04:28.740> like<00:04:28.889> the

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
everything but she just feels like the

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.710 
everything but she just feels like the
the<00:04:29.370> stuffings<00:04:29.729> been<00:04:29.910> knocked<00:04:30.120> out<00:04:30.330> of<00:04:30.570> her

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
the stuffings been knocked out of her

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.140 
the stuffings been knocked out of her
and<00:04:31.500> you<00:04:31.620> can<00:04:31.770> see<00:04:32.010> no<00:04:32.400> matter<00:04:32.580> how<00:04:32.790> much<00:04:32.940> she

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
and you can see no matter how much she

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.020 
and you can see no matter how much she
tries<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.690> just<00:04:34.080> doesn't<00:04:34.500> go<00:04:34.650> right<00:04:35.040> and<00:04:35.790> she

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
tries it just doesn't go right and she

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.219 
tries it just doesn't go right and she
would<00:04:36.150> have<00:04:36.210> been<00:04:36.270> trying<00:04:36.660> really<00:04:36.870> hard<00:04:36.990> to

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
would have been trying really hard to

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.260 
would have been trying really hard to
put<00:04:37.530> in<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.710> good<00:04:37.919> glass<00:04:38.190> dive<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:38.910> she<00:04:39.060> never

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270
