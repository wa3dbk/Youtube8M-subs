just<00:01:34.200> trying<00:01:34.439> because<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:35.100> guy<00:01:35.280> had<00:01:35.460> not

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
just trying because this guy had not

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.460 
just trying because this guy had not
very<00:01:35.820> much<00:01:35.970> chemistry<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.900> know<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.049> could<00:01:37.290> sit

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
very much chemistry you know I could sit

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.380 
very much chemistry you know I could sit
there<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.100> know<00:01:38.220> run<00:01:38.430> rings<00:01:38.700> around<00:01:38.939> him

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
there and you know run rings around him

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.420 
there and you know run rings around him
and<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.750> try<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.350> shoot<00:01:40.650> from<00:01:40.799> distance<00:01:40.860> and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and and try and shoot from distance and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.789 
and and try and shoot from distance and
stuff<00:01:41.640> which<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.840> what<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> was<00:01:43.320> doing<00:01:43.649> like

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
stuff which is what I was doing like

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.280 
stuff which is what I was doing like
like<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.270> try<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.630> score<00:01:45.869> some<00:01:45.930> great

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
like that and try to score some great

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.460 
like that and try to score some great
goals<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.060> but<00:01:48.060> once<00:01:48.210> I've<00:01:48.360> done<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.259> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
goals and but once I've done this for a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.080 
goals and but once I've done this for a
little<00:01:49.649> while<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.920> just<00:01:50.250> kept<00:01:50.399> trying<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.759> do<00:01:50.939> it

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
little while I just kept trying to do it

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.789 
little while I just kept trying to do it
and<00:01:51.240> what<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.869> found<00:01:52.110> was<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.560> wasn't

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
and what I found was that I wasn't

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.530 
and what I found was that I wasn't
scoring<00:01:53.130> all<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.369> time<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.880> actually<00:01:54.240> he<00:01:54.420> was

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
scoring all the time and actually he was

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.240 
scoring all the time and actually he was
breaking<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.990> little<00:01:55.200> bit<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.680> he<00:01:55.799> put<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> goal

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
breaking a little bit and he put a goal

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.920 
breaking a little bit and he put a goal
into<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.729> back<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.180> net<00:01:57.450> which<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.869> a

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
into the back of the net which is a

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.569 
into the back of the net which is a
little<00:01:58.229> bit<00:01:58.439> embarrassing<00:01:59.040> because<00:01:59.189> he<00:01:59.460> has

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
little bit embarrassing because he has

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.300 
little bit embarrassing because he has
such<00:01:59.850> low<00:02:00.119> chemistry<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.869> but<00:02:01.710> going<00:02:02.159> into

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
such low chemistry and but going into

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.709 
such low chemistry and but going into
halftime<00:02:02.549> as<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.149> can<00:02:03.270> see<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.570> guy

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
halftime as you can see this guy

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.090 
halftime as you can see this guy
actually<00:02:03.840> had<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.140> majority<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.560> possession

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
actually had the majority of possession

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.839 
actually had the majority of possession
but<00:02:05.460> we<00:02:05.579> had<00:02:05.670> loads<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.119> shot<00:02:06.360> chances<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.409> goal

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
but we had loads of shot chances on goal

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.430 
but we had loads of shot chances on goal

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
and I wasn't particularly happy about

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.220 
and I wasn't particularly happy about
that<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.240> continue<00:02:19.690> doing<00:02:19.930> what<00:02:20.080> I<00:02:20.110> was

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
doing I felt pretty comfortable that I

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.910 
doing I felt pretty comfortable that I
was<00:02:21.910> gonna<00:02:22.120> win<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.540> game<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.800> would<00:02:23.890> be

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
was gonna win the game and it would be

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.560 
was gonna win the game and it would be
nice<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.370> score<00:02:24.550> some<00:02:24.730> good<00:02:24.910> goals<00:02:25.120> for<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.420> so

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
as you can see all my shots are from

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.190 
as you can see all my shots are from
distance<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:28.120> we<00:02:28.240> just<00:02:28.510> managing<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.080> not

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
distance and we just managing to not

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.110 
distance and we just managing to not
quite<00:02:29.680> score<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.370> make<00:02:30.520> it<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.910> little

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
quite score it so to make it a little

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.210 
quite score it so to make it a little
bit<00:02:31.360> more<00:02:31.540> concrete<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.650> we<00:02:32.770> were<00:02:32.920> going<00:02:33.130> to

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
bit more concrete that we were going to

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.440 
bit more concrete that we were going to
win<00:02:33.340> we<00:02:33.520> stick<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.820> in<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:33.970> back<00:02:34.090> of<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.300> net

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
win we stick it in the back of the net

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.240 
win we stick it in the back of the net
with<00:02:34.570> Lucas<00:02:34.960> was<00:02:35.350> actually<00:02:35.710> quite<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:36.010> nice

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
with Lucas was actually quite a nice

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.430 
with Lucas was actually quite a nice
strike<00:02:36.670> in<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:36.940> end<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.240> it<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.990> we<00:02:38.110> win<00:02:38.260> the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
strike in the end of it and we win the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.620 
strike in the end of it and we win the
game<00:02:38.680> for<00:02:38.980> two<00:02:39.580> could<00:02:40.030> have<00:02:40.150> been<00:02:40.240> a<00:02:40.270> lot<00:02:40.570> more

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
game for two could have been a lot more

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.630 
game for two could have been a lot more
I<00:02:40.900> reckon<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.530> we<00:02:41.620> didn't<00:02:41.920> we<00:02:42.400> unfortunately

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
I reckon and we didn't we unfortunately

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.610 
I reckon and we didn't we unfortunately
didn't<00:02:43.180> get<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.360> hat<00:02:43.510> trick<00:02:43.630> with<00:02:43.840> ebro<00:02:44.230> which

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
didn't get the hat trick with ebro which

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.350 
didn't get the hat trick with ebro which
would<00:02:44.800> have<00:02:44.860> got<00:02:45.010> an<00:02:45.220> extra<00:02:45.580> thousand<00:02:46.150> coins

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
would have got an extra thousand coins

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.690 
would have got an extra thousand coins
but<00:02:46.840> we<00:02:47.560> will<00:02:47.740> learn<00:02:47.830> ourselves<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.400> fair

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
but we will learn ourselves a fair

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.790 
but we will learn ourselves a fair
amount<00:02:48.880> from<00:02:49.300> that<00:02:49.510> particular<00:02:49.660> game<00:02:50.230> which

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
amount from that particular game which

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.110 
amount from that particular game which
I'll<00:02:50.950> show<00:02:51.130> you<00:02:51.160> in<00:02:51.280> just<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.580> moment<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.910> can't

I'll show you in just a moment I can't

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.060 
I'll show you in just a moment I can't
remember<00:02:52.360> exactly<00:02:52.720> how<00:02:52.960> much<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.320> is<00:02:53.350> about

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
remember exactly how much it is about

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.650 
remember exactly how much it is about
what<00:02:54.280> we're<00:02:54.460> doing<00:02:54.490> at<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:54.970> moment<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.600> a

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
what we're doing at the moment is a

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.560 
what we're doing at the moment is a
bro's<00:02:56.620> rocking<00:02:56.980> 14<00:02:57.460> goals<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.000> two<00:02:58.150> assists

to get him one consolation goal back but

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.400 
to get him one consolation goal back but
pretty<00:04:04.390> much<00:04:04.450> straight<00:04:04.810> from<00:04:04.990> kickoff<00:04:05.140> I

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
pretty much straight from kickoff I

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.840 
pretty much straight from kickoff I
don't<00:04:05.590> know<00:04:05.709> why<00:04:05.890> I<00:04:05.950> did<00:04:06.190> a<00:04:06.220> kickoff<00:04:06.580> glitch

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
don't know why I did a kickoff glitch

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.790 
don't know why I did a kickoff glitch
but<00:04:07.660> we<00:04:07.780> played<00:04:07.959> it<00:04:08.080> through<00:04:08.200> too<00:04:08.380> many<00:04:08.500> as<00:04:08.650> we

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
but we played it through too many as we

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.229 
but we played it through too many as we
took<00:04:08.920> on<00:04:09.100> a<00:04:09.130> couple<00:04:09.459> of<00:04:09.550> players<00:04:09.730> so<00:04:10.000> I<00:04:10.030> guess

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
took on a couple of players so I guess

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.449 
took on a couple of players so I guess
that<00:04:10.420> counts<00:04:10.570> as<00:04:10.870> something<00:04:11.530> and<00:04:12.070> we<00:04:12.160> make<00:04:12.340> it

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
that counts as something and we make it

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.970 
that counts as something and we make it
4-1<00:04:12.910> then<00:04:13.330> e<00:04:13.570> briquets<00:04:13.989> a<00:04:14.200> few<00:04:14.410> players<00:04:14.620> around

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
4-1 then e briquets a few players around

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.830 
4-1 then e briquets a few players around
him<00:04:15.130> he<00:04:15.250> just<00:04:15.280> he<00:04:15.640> just<00:04:15.850> skills<00:04:16.359> around<00:04:16.510> them

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840

do really wats get back in it because he

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.480 
do really wats get back in it because he
started<00:04:33.139> running<00:04:33.740> down<00:04:33.979> the<00:04:34.070> wings<00:04:34.220> and

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
started running down the wings and

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.490 
started running down the wings and
crossing<00:04:34.759> it<00:04:34.850> in<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.330> quite<00:04:35.870> early<00:04:36.020> on<00:04:36.169> he<00:04:36.380> got

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
crossing it in and quite early on he got

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.900 
crossing it in and quite early on he got
two<00:04:36.710> girls<00:04:36.979> back<00:04:37.250> and<00:04:37.430> I<00:04:37.490> wasn't<00:04:37.669> really

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
two girls back and I wasn't really

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.760 
two girls back and I wasn't really
having<00:04:38.090> any<00:04:38.300> of<00:04:38.479> that<00:04:38.509> as<00:04:38.870> we<00:04:39.350> play<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:39.620> rest

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
having any of that as we play the rest

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.900

of<00:04:39.889> the<00:04:39.979> second<00:04:40.280> half<00:04:40.370> out<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:40.729> I<00:04:40.759> was<00:04:40.880> just

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
of the second half out and I was just

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.370 
of the second half out and I was just
making<00:04:41.330> sure<00:04:41.360> he<00:04:41.570> didn't<00:04:41.780> get<00:04:41.870> down<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.199> wings
