rather be seananners or Superman and he

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.650 
rather be seananners or Superman and he
claims<00:00:07.620> that<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.919> answer<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.400> obvious<00:00:09.120> both

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
claims that the answer is obvious both

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.169 
claims that the answer is obvious both
people<00:00:10.050> have<00:00:10.080> superpowers<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.340> at<00:00:11.700> first<00:00:11.910> I

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
people have superpowers and at first I

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.430 
people have superpowers and at first I
was<00:00:12.300> like<00:00:12.360> well<00:00:12.690> obviously<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.139> picked

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
was like well obviously I picked

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.140 
was like well obviously I picked
Superman<00:00:13.980> because<00:00:14.250> he<00:00:14.400> has<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.639> ability<00:00:14.790> to

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
Superman because he has the ability to

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.990 
Superman because he has the ability to
fly<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.870> super<00:00:16.500> strength<00:00:16.830> but<00:00:17.609> then<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.789> saw

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
fly and super strength but then I saw

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.700 
fly and super strength but then I saw
this<00:00:18.150> video<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.600> seananners<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.500> kind<00:00:19.680> of

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
this video of seananners and it kind of

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:29.330 
this video of seananners and it kind of
changed<00:00:20.010> my<00:00:20.130> mind<00:00:27.769> so<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.800> think<00:00:28.980> it's<00:00:29.220> pretty

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
changed my mind so I think it's pretty

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.589 
changed my mind so I think it's pretty
obvious<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.789> I'd<00:00:30.119> have<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.449> go<00:00:30.570> with

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
obvious that I'd have to go with

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.959 
obvious that I'd have to go with
seananners<00:00:31.219> make<00:00:32.219> sure<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.399> post<00:00:32.669> your<00:00:32.880> own

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
domination ground war personally is my

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.060 
domination ground war personally is my
favorite<00:00:51.870> playlist<00:00:52.260> but<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.440> noticed<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.920> not

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
favorite playlist but I noticed that not

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.670 
favorite playlist but I noticed that not
that<00:00:53.340> many<00:00:53.399> other<00:00:53.789> commentators<00:00:54.530> like<00:00:55.530> to

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
that many other commentators like to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.229 
that many other commentators like to
play<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.100> playlist<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.730> guess<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.090> because

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
play this playlist I guess it's because

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.090 
play this playlist I guess it's because
since<00:00:57.899> there's<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.140> many<00:00:58.320> people<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.949> game

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
since there's so many people in the game

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.760 
since there's so many people in the game
it's<00:00:59.340> very<00:00:59.520> hard<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.910> have<00:01:00.329> only<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.590> know<00:01:01.710> two

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
it's very hard to have only you know two

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.189 
it's very hard to have only you know two
or<00:01:02.070> three<00:01:02.399> dots<00:01:02.690> throughout<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> course<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.110> a

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
or three dots throughout the course of a

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.780 
or three dots throughout the course of a
whole<00:01:04.350> game<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:05.010> me<00:01:05.189> personally<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.729> don't

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
whole game but me personally I don't

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.190 
whole game but me personally I don't
really<00:01:05.970> care<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.270> much<00:01:06.390> about<00:01:06.540> debt<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.170> I

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
really care that much about debt so I

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.740

right here where I'm able to get myself

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.429 
right here where I'm able to get myself
right<00:01:51.060> next<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.479> bus<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.079> good<00:01:52.320> example

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
right next to this bus is a good example

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.460 
right next to this bus is a good example
of<00:01:52.860> me<00:01:53.040> doing<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.700> was<00:01:54.450> able<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.869> figure

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
of me doing that I was able to figure

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.560 
of me doing that I was able to figure
out<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.860> direction<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.640> enemy<00:01:57.030> movement

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
out the direction of the enemy movement

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.179 
out the direction of the enemy movement
they<00:01:57.810> were<00:01:57.869> all<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.290> rushing<00:01:58.680> up<00:01:58.799> over<00:01:59.040> here

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
they were all just rushing up over here

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.130 
they were all just rushing up over here
to<00:01:59.340> be<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.759> I<00:02:00.149> was<00:02:00.329> able<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.570> position<00:02:00.840> myself

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
to be and I was able to position myself

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.740 
to be and I was able to position myself
in<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:02.189> position<00:02:02.390> perpendicular<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.630> their

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
in a position perpendicular to their

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.870 
in a position perpendicular to their
movements<00:02:04.250> this<00:02:05.250> way<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:05.610> they're<00:02:05.759> all

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
movements this way as they're all

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.880 
movements this way as they're all
sprinting<00:02:06.360> right<00:02:06.540> past<00:02:06.780> me<00:02:06.990> I'm<00:02:07.170> able<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.649> just

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
sprinting right past me I'm able to just

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.169 
sprinting right past me I'm able to just
pick<00:02:08.069> them<00:02:08.190> off<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.640> then

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
pick them off and then

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.029 
pick them off and then
aren't<00:02:09.390> even<00:02:09.420> able<00:02:09.719> to<00:02:09.929> retaliate<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.829> I'm

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
aren't even able to retaliate and I'm

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.770 
aren't even able to retaliate and I'm
able<00:02:11.219> to<00:02:11.370> do<00:02:11.549> that<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.760> get<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.269> chopper<00:02:12.599> gunner

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
able to do that and get a chopper gunner

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.199 
able to do that and get a chopper gunner
very<00:02:13.170> early<00:02:13.500> in<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.709> game<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.819> this<00:02:15.060> is

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
very early in the game and this is

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.880 
very early in the game and this is
obviously<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.719> lot<00:02:15.930> easier<00:02:16.140> said<00:02:16.560> than<00:02:16.680> done

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
obviously a lot easier said than done

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.979 
obviously a lot easier said than done
it's<00:02:17.159> very<00:02:17.340> hard<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.849> figure<00:02:18.390> out<00:02:18.599> which<00:02:18.810> way

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
it's very hard to figure out which way

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.660 
it's very hard to figure out which way
the<00:02:19.109> enemy<00:02:19.349> is<00:02:19.500> going<00:02:19.890> at<00:02:20.099> a<00:02:20.159> certain<00:02:20.400> time

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
the enemy is going at a certain time

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.089 
the enemy is going at a certain time
because<00:02:21.000> it's<00:02:21.180> always<00:02:21.450> changing<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.829> got<00:02:22.980> to

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
because it's always changing you got to

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.890 
because it's always changing you got to
be<00:02:23.189> able<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.489> predict<00:02:23.909> which<00:02:24.239> way<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.599> enemy

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
be able to predict which way the enemy

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.420 
be able to predict which way the enemy
is<00:02:25.019> going<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.260> start<00:02:25.439> moving<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.950> know<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.250> the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
is going to start moving you know in the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.849 
is going to start moving you know in the
near<00:02:26.639> future<00:02:26.689> and<00:02:27.689> also<00:02:27.989> recognize<00:02:28.620> certain

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
near future and also recognize certain

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.009 
near future and also recognize certain
patterns<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.549> movements<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.120> cracked

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
patterns of movements on cracked

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.869 
patterns of movements on cracked
everyone<00:02:31.530> basically<00:02:31.709> likes<00:02:32.189> to<00:02:32.340> rush<00:02:32.579> into

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
everyone basically likes to rush into

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.369 
everyone basically likes to rush into
the<00:02:33.060> middle<00:02:33.359> of<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.569> map<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.019> if<00:02:34.139> you're<00:02:34.260> able

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
the middle of the map so if you're able

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.410 
the middle of the map so if you're able
to<00:02:34.560> position<00:02:34.829> yourself<00:02:35.340> towards<00:02:35.909> the<00:02:36.090> sides

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
to position yourself towards the sides

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.990 
to position yourself towards the sides
you<00:02:37.349> can<00:02:37.500> pick<00:02:37.680> off<00:02:37.829> a<00:02:38.069> lot<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.400> enemy<00:02:38.790> just

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
you can pick off a lot of enemy just

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.300 
you can pick off a lot of enemy just
running<00:02:39.299> right<00:02:39.480> past<00:02:39.689> you<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:40.200> obviously<00:02:41.189> if

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
running right past you and obviously if

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.860 
running right past you and obviously if
you're<00:02:41.430> coming<00:02:41.609> up<00:02:41.790> behind<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.329> enemy<00:02:42.480> or

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
you're coming up behind the enemy or

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.140 
you're coming up behind the enemy or
even<00:02:43.319> to<00:02:43.439> the<00:02:43.560> side<00:02:43.799> of<00:02:43.980> them<00:02:44.159> they're<00:02:44.970> going

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
even to the side of them they're going

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.360 
even to the side of them they're going
to<00:02:45.209> have<00:02:45.359> a<00:02:45.389> lot<00:02:45.599> harder<00:02:46.349> time<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.919> killing<00:02:47.280> you

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
to have a lot harder time of killing you

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.740 
to have a lot harder time of killing you
then<00:02:47.609> if<00:02:47.730> you're<00:02:47.849> just<00:02:48.060> coming<00:02:48.239> up<00:02:48.419> straight

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
then if you're just coming up straight

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.080 
then if you're just coming up straight
at<00:02:48.930> them<00:02:49.079> if<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.829> an<00:02:49.980> enemy<00:02:50.459> are<00:02:50.669> running<00:02:51.000> up

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
at them if you an enemy are running up

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.210 
at them if you an enemy are running up
to<00:02:51.120> each<00:02:51.299> other<00:02:51.510> face<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.840> face<00:02:52.230> then<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.950> have

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
to each other face to face then you have

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.979 
to each other face to face then you have
a<00:02:53.250> basically<00:02:53.700> fifty<00:02:54.180> percent<00:02:54.510> chance<00:02:54.719> of

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
a basically fifty percent chance of

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.929 
a basically fifty percent chance of
being<00:02:55.829> able<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.040> kill<00:02:56.250> him<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.579> a<00:02:56.639> fifty

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
being able to kill him and a fifty

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.670 
being able to kill him and a fifty
percent<00:02:57.209> chance<00:02:57.419> of<00:02:57.569> dying<00:02:57.810> if<00:02:58.079> both<00:02:58.439> of<00:02:58.469> you

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
percent chance of dying if both of you

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.190 
percent chance of dying if both of you
have<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.919> same<00:02:59.430> skill<00:02:59.939> of<00:03:00.120> shooting<00:03:00.510> but<00:03:01.109> if

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
have the same skill of shooting but if

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.809 
have the same skill of shooting but if
you're<00:03:01.290> coming<00:03:01.530> up<00:03:01.650> behind<00:03:01.799> someone<00:03:02.370> then

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
you're coming up behind someone then

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.520 
you're coming up behind someone then
it's<00:03:03.329> almost<00:03:03.629> like<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.840> ninety<00:03:04.230> nine<00:03:04.379> percent

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
it's almost like a ninety nine percent

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.379 
it's almost like a ninety nine percent
chance<00:03:04.859> of<00:03:05.069> you<00:03:05.189> shooting<00:03:05.400> them<00:03:05.700> unless

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
chance of you shooting them unless

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.059 
chance of you shooting them unless
you're<00:03:06.599> out<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.780> ammo<00:03:07.049> or<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.680> just<00:03:07.919> like

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
you're out of ammo or you just like

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.550 
you're out of ammo or you just like
epically<00:03:08.459> fail<00:03:08.790> or<00:03:08.969> something<00:03:09.409> obviously<00:03:10.409> the

especially<00:03:19.560> if<00:03:19.919> it's<00:03:20.129> the<00:03:20.280> middle<00:03:20.459> flag<00:03:20.819> the<00:03:21.060> B

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
especially if it's the middle flag the B

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.509 
especially if it's the middle flag the B
flag<00:03:21.569> if<00:03:22.349> your<00:03:22.500> team<00:03:22.680> is<00:03:22.709> holding<00:03:23.129> down<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.430> B

flag if your team is holding down the B

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.219 
flag if your team is holding down the B
flag<00:03:23.790> then<00:03:24.030> it's<00:03:24.209> a<00:03:24.299> pretty<00:03:24.479> sure<00:03:24.720> fire<00:03:24.959> guess

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:25.229 
flag then it's a pretty sure fire guess

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:26.929 
flag then it's a pretty sure fire guess
that<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.530> lot<00:03:25.799> of<00:03:25.919> your<00:03:26.010> enemy<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.489> going<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.849> be

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:26.939 
that a lot of your enemy is going to be

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.360 
that a lot of your enemy is going to be
rushing<00:03:27.329> towards<00:03:27.659> it<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.560> basically<00:03:29.040> let<00:03:29.310> me

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
rushing towards it so basically let me

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.610 
rushing towards it so basically let me
boil<00:03:29.579> it<00:03:29.790> down<00:03:29.819> to<00:03:30.269> three<00:03:30.419> simple<00:03:31.079> steps<00:03:31.139> for

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
boil it down to three simple steps for

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.119 
boil it down to three simple steps for
you<00:03:31.739> step<00:03:32.699> one<00:03:32.939> is<00:03:33.260> find<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.439> location<00:03:34.769> on<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
you step one is find a location on the

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.309 
you step one is find a location on the
map<00:03:35.159> or<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.579> lot<00:03:35.849> of<00:03:36.000> people<00:03:36.269> like<00:03:36.569> to<00:03:36.599> run<00:03:37.019> in

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
map or a lot of people like to run in

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.890 
map or a lot of people like to run in
this<00:03:38.310> case<00:03:38.549> it<00:03:38.759> would<00:03:38.849> be<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.120> bee<00:03:39.269> flag<00:03:39.569> on

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
this case it would be the bee flag on

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.439 
this case it would be the bee flag on
cracked<00:03:40.530> in<00:03:41.280> this<00:03:41.430> particular<00:03:41.729> game<00:03:42.060> anyway

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
cracked in this particular game anyway

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.289 
cracked in this particular game anyway
step<00:03:43.259> two<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.739> figure<00:03:44.250> out<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.759> most

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
step two is to figure out the most

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.990 
step two is to figure out the most
popular<00:03:45.900> routes<00:03:46.159> that<00:03:47.159> your<00:03:47.340> enemies<00:03:47.639> like<00:03:47.819> to

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
popular routes that your enemies like to

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.020 
popular routes that your enemies like to
take<00:03:48.209> while<00:03:48.509> going<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.049> this<00:03:49.169> popular<00:03:49.709> spot

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
take while going to this popular spot

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.699 
take while going to this popular spot
step<00:03:51.030> three<00:03:51.329> is<00:03:51.359> to<00:03:51.599> position<00:03:52.199> yourself

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
step three is to position yourself

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.039 
step three is to position yourself
either<00:03:53.040> going<00:03:53.849> coming<00:03:54.209> up<00:03:54.359> behind<00:03:54.479> the<00:03:54.780> enemy

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
either going coming up behind the enemy

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.110 
either going coming up behind the enemy
as<00:03:55.139> they're<00:03:55.319> going<00:03:55.439> there<00:03:55.709> or<00:03:55.979> to<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.370> side<00:03:56.729> so

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
as they're going there or to the side so

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.300 
as they're going there or to the side so
they<00:03:57.299> run<00:03:57.509> right<00:03:57.689> past<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:58.169> and<00:03:58.349> you<00:03:59.009> pone

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
they run right past you and you pone

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.550 
they run right past you and you pone
them<00:03:59.519> now<00:04:00.389> once<00:04:00.659> you<00:04:00.810> are<00:04:00.959> in<00:04:01.109> this<00:04:01.229> location

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
them now once you are in this location

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.619 
them now once you are in this location
you're<00:04:01.919> setting<00:04:02.189> up<00:04:02.340> yourself<00:04:02.729> to<00:04:02.939> get<00:04:03.269> a<00:04:03.299> lot

you're setting up yourself to get a lot

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.749 
you're setting up yourself to get a lot

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
that's because these guys suck and don't

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.330 
that's because these guys suck and don't
know<00:05:02.140> what<00:05:02.290> they're<00:05:02.440> doing<00:05:02.770> and<00:05:02.920> these

started playing call of duty with the

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.750 
started playing call of duty with the
release<00:05:23.020> of<00:05:23.170> black<00:05:23.290> ops<00:05:23.560> before<00:05:24.100> that<00:05:24.490> I<00:05:24.520> was

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
release of black ops before that I was

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.960 
release of black ops before that I was
basically<00:05:25.440> 99%<00:05:26.440> a<00:05:26.620> halo<00:05:26.920> player<00:05:27.160> and<00:05:27.520> I

basically 99% a halo player and I

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.550 
basically 99% a halo player and I
occasionally<00:05:28.330> played<00:05:28.780> some<00:05:28.960> game<00:05:29.140> boy<00:05:29.290> games

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390
