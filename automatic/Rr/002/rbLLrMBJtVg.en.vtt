00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.960
 good morning good afternoon good evening 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.069
 today we are here with course 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.630
 statistic 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.650
 once again the subject to be dealt with in 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.210
 numbers 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.699
 let's calculate the number in simple to 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.789
 who knows lula said let's go here 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.939
 a concept called the index number 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.779
 is a skimming the variable value at the date 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.000
 of the value of this variable on another date 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.070
 that reason owned by dividing the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.620
 variable from the current platform by 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.170
 base date win 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.170
 the result is after x being 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.200
 the result is after x 100 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:01:00.480
 therefore we are going to calculate the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.670
 number of spam is to have many years to 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.009
 economics and physical and chemical sciences 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.159
 social 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:13.289
 the calculation formula is the formula of 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:16.590
 calculation is the value of the variable was 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:18.990
 considered a drawing on the value of 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:26.569
 variable on the base date 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:34.409
 let's go here 10 when you remembered the 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:37.560
 hill on the right let's just Brazil 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.149
 meet a board at the party was in the delta 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.020
 I live in Brazil 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:56.450
 Let's put the perfect year here and here. 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:59.700
 when activated the new Sunday I thee 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:06.509
 I love to fly the news here. 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:08.470
 where 2 thousand were sold 1 million 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.440
 all 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.240
 make a formatting of iran so that the 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.310
 people could visualize 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:22.060
 already the man of 2001 the total of one million 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.060
 for example 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:37.620
 pulls out the formatting with the brush 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:40.940
 work of two worlds the partner of zatz 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.940
 pull other years 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:03:02.109
 it is not blind Funa Ã£ lion 433 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.660
 millions and sex 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.000
 one million seven hundred 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:21.160
 siblings I am the 52 million 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.380
 so let's pick up the child not table 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:32.620
 work in the favela 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.620
 the time of numbers together in the team 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.660
 Let's see what to do only 21 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:51.630
 here's the hat to ride a little 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:53.610
 number one is perfect and change the 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.780
 first number to tender your own blood 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:04.560
 called the 100 jets score with two 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:09.350
 these images will know about the same as 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.460
 this value is divided by this type of 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.280
 exhibition 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.560
 Look how I felt the weather, too. 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.900
 means that it was very hard 33 marlim 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.980
 said while seating people call Bruno 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.860
 senna for the right study effect 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.580
 then our president that way in 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.920
 funchal or pull or sexual minor 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.800
 Let's say this formula is equal to having 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.870
 16 We also want to hear from you 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.810
 It's good, you're nothing. Actually. 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.640
 accident happens as long as they have to 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.540
 save 200 when you pull this formula already 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.300
 what a fatah 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.880
 it also increases from now it comes out okay 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.760
 lets here to listen to fix your 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.930
 six pack here that greeted 14 that 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.210
 profile 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.880
 so I have to study ways of such 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.240
 There are 14 people here. 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.810
 central 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:05.380
 my sense of saving myself from the first 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.169
 Here we would pull O 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.440
 now that it was in relation to 1,400 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.340
 and if you lie down, this is it. 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.349
 decision 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.020
 so let's take the formula of this 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:19.750
 here with the staff of the saints and tested 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.880
 91 67 was less than 100 to be made 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.539
 is that this value is better than a 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.090
 That value then he had of the party the 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:31.240
 bond is better than none of this 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.130
 note here is negative for this 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.289
 inventing too pulled 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.069
 and here we have several benefits here 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.919
 huh 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:41.470
 we observed that the Olympus that was 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:44.650
 basically below 200 bandits without 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.830
 this is not just this line that underneath 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.430
 of heaven and the one here 2 million in relation 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.900
 to 2010 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.090
 for example because if a simple 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.160
 consumer is the first one to be a 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.220
 million, let's get the best out of here 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.130
 this exact balance 232 million versus 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.210
 always always up to a million 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.419
 sky god 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.100
 or 200 large is personal 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.040
 It was what I had about improvements then 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.169
 I really appreciate your attention. 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:18.169
 continue to evaluate our channel maintains 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:21.169
 if that means we are until the next 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.169
 thankful
