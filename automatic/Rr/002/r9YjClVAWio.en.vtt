you move the focus ring the back element
moves<00:01:27.460> it<00:01:28.299> doesn't<00:01:28.420> protrude<00:01:29.700> too<00:01:30.700> much<00:01:30.939> so

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
moves it doesn't protrude too much so

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.719 
moves it doesn't protrude too much so
you<00:01:31.240> don't<00:01:31.360> have<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:31.570> worry<00:01:31.780> about<00:01:32.729> damaging

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
you don't have to worry about damaging

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.510 
you don't have to worry about damaging
it<00:01:34.149> when<00:01:34.450> you're<00:01:34.600> taking<00:01:34.930> on<00:01:35.110> off<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.409> camera

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.090 

the<00:01:39.520> front<00:01:39.820> element<00:01:40.090> also<00:01:40.509> protrudes<00:01:41.439> goes<00:01:41.649> up

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
the front element also protrudes goes up

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.840 
the front element also protrudes goes up
and<00:01:42.729> down<00:01:42.880> as<00:01:43.149> you<00:01:43.570> move<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.840> focus<00:01:44.200> ring<00:01:44.850> it

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
and down as you move the focus ring it

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.690 
and down as you move the focus ring it
doesn't<00:01:46.149> rotate<00:01:46.270> really<00:01:46.840> so<00:01:47.110> so<00:01:47.829> it's<00:01:48.250> not<00:01:48.490> big

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
doesn't rotate really so so it's not big

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.170 
doesn't rotate really so so it's not big
deal<00:01:48.729> and<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:50.140> auto<00:01:50.740> focus<00:01:51.159> manual<00:01:51.790> focus

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
deal and the auto focus manual focus

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.120 
deal and the auto focus manual focus
which<00:01:52.420> is<00:01:52.600> solid<00:01:53.170> enough<00:01:53.409> again<00:01:53.740> it's<00:01:53.890> not<00:01:53.979> a

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
which is solid enough again it's not a

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.620 
which is solid enough again it's not a
metal<00:01:54.750> lens<00:01:55.750> so<00:01:56.430> it's<00:01:57.430> not<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.850> best<00:01:58.030> but<00:01:58.149> it's

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
metal lens so it's not the best but it's

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.440 
metal lens so it's not the best but it's
actually<00:01:59.130> very<00:02:00.130> very<00:02:00.280> good<00:02:00.610> good<00:02:01.270> enough

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
actually very very good good enough

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.200 
actually very very good good enough
it<00:02:04.829> feels<00:02:05.829> really<00:02:06.189> light<00:02:06.490> in<00:02:06.700> your<00:02:06.789> hand<00:02:07.030> it's

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
it feels really light in your hand it's

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.810 
it feels really light in your hand it's
not<00:02:07.539> too<00:02:07.869> having<00:02:08.259> it's<00:02:08.950> just<00:02:09.070> the<00:02:09.430> right<00:02:09.610> size

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
not too having it's just the right size

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.000 
not too having it's just the right size
