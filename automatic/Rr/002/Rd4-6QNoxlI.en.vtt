00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
thing I will note just before I start

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.389 
thing I will note just before I start
scrolling<00:01:51.659> through<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.930> pages<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
scrolling through the pages is that the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.850 
scrolling through the pages is that the
screen<00:01:53.850> dimensions<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.720> smart<00:01:54.960> tab<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.290> seem

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
screen dimensions of a smart tab to seem

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.520 
screen dimensions of a smart tab to seem
a<00:01:56.009> little<00:01:56.219> different<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.180> nexus<00:01:57.509> 7<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
a little different of a nexus 7 the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.440 
a little different of a nexus 7 the
screen<00:01:58.860> length<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> little<00:01:59.790> bit<00:01:59.880> longer<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
screen length is a little bit longer and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.060 
screen length is a little bit longer and
the<00:02:00.719> screen<00:02:00.960> width<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.439> little<00:02:01.770> bit<00:02:01.860> shorter

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
the screen width is a little bit shorter

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.429 
the screen width is a little bit shorter
so<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.000> does<00:02:03.180> give<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> little<00:02:03.930> bit<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.350> a

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
so it does give you a little bit of a

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.620 
so it does give you a little bit of a
different<00:02:04.890> feel<00:02:05.159> if<00:02:05.460> you're<00:02:05.969> comparing<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.600> to

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
different feel if you're comparing it to

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.350 
different feel if you're comparing it to
another<00:02:07.079> tablet<00:02:07.380> but<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.770> probably<00:02:08.009> all

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
another tablet but you probably all

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.089 
another tablet but you probably all
recognize<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.539> if<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.440> own<00:02:10.619> one

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
recognize this if you just own one

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.880 
recognize this if you just own one
tablet<00:02:11.780> now<00:02:12.780> as<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.080> can<00:02:13.200> see<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.530> king

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
much to play with so I'm trying to

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.400 
much to play with so I'm trying to
insert<00:05:52.040> a<00:05:52.210> card<00:05:53.210> in<00:05:53.450> the<00:05:53.540> back<00:05:53.720> of<00:05:53.870> a<00:05:53.930> tablet<00:05:54.290> I

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
insert a card in the back of a tablet I

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.170 
insert a card in the back of a tablet I
realized<00:05:54.950> that<00:05:55.010> there's<00:05:55.220> no<00:05:55.340> air<00:05:55.520> spring<00:05:55.970> out

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
realized that there's no air spring out

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.880 
realized that there's no air spring out
here<00:05:56.390> so<00:05:56.510> you've<00:05:56.570> kind<00:05:56.990> of<00:05:57.110> got<00:05:57.410> to<00:05:57.530> put<00:05:57.740> it<00:05:57.830> in

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
here so you've kind of got to put it in

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.740 
here so you've kind of got to put it in
a<00:05:57.979> top<00:05:58.340> part<00:05:58.700> of<00:05:58.910> a<00:05:59.000> slot<00:05:59.210> and<00:05:59.330> then<00:05:59.360> slide<00:05:59.720> it

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750

down and
then<00:06:01.849> it's<00:06:02.449> in<00:06:02.749> there<00:06:03.110> now<00:06:03.710> I'm<00:06:03.860> doing<00:06:04.129> all

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:04.279 
then it's in there now I'm doing all

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:06.339 
then it's in there now I'm doing all
this<00:06:04.460> with<00:06:04.759> a<00:06:04.789> tablet<00:06:05.120> still<00:06:05.479> on<00:06:05.689> so<00:06:06.229> you<00:06:06.319> don't

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:06.349 
this with a tablet still on so you don't

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:07.719 
this with a tablet still on so you don't
have<00:06:06.559> to<00:06:06.680> turn<00:06:06.800> the<00:06:06.949> tablet<00:06:07.249> off<00:06:07.309> or<00:06:07.520> anything

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
have to turn the tablet off or anything

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.730 
have to turn the tablet off or anything
which<00:06:08.029> is<00:06:08.180> it<00:06:08.300> another<00:06:08.509> positive<00:06:08.749> so<00:06:09.529> I<00:06:09.559> can

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
which is it another positive so I can

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.279 
which is it another positive so I can
just<00:06:09.889> unlock<00:06:10.099> it<00:06:10.460> and<00:06:10.550> the<00:06:10.969> SD<00:06:11.779> card<00:06:11.809> should

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289 
just unlock it and the SD card should

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:15.959 
just unlock it and the SD card should
now<00:06:12.439> be<00:06:12.469> detected<00:06:13.159> and<00:06:13.699> if<00:06:13.999> I<00:06:14.150> check<00:06:14.599> in<00:06:15.469> the
