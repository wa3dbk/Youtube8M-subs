00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.200
 well that's everyone from his 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.270
 scores I hope you are well 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.310
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.110
 new type of video that I'm calling is 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.810
 a problem three solutions is the 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.150
 today's problem cmaj aspic he is 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.739
 currently being tested in india reused for 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.600
 whether or not he can stay in the 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.960
 third he had been banned very quickly 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.309
 and right now there are suspects is 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.580
 to know so as I say if he 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:45.309
 can stay in n2 laughing so why 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.960
 maj aspic has become so powerful 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.900
 recently it's thanks to his talent 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.920
 contestation of which here is the 7 or so 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.140
 which makes that maje aspic got into 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.269
 a new galaxy contestation that 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.260
 is his dreary talent he's got 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:04.150
 very recently 2015 which reverses the 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.909
 stats boosts so let's take the example 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.560
 of green storm that drops by two 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.260
 notches the special tax is fine with 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.020
 green storm dispute will increase 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.640
 2 notches the special tax and the 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.040
 advantage of green storm compared to 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.180
 machination for example is that 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.979
 storm towards testa ba132 power and not 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.259
 can not be blocked by causes so 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.270
 maj aspic can be very fascinating 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.899
 especially since the latter has when 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.880
 even a very good speed of 113 and 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.670
 exceeds a lot of pokemon this 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.159
 third then for the rest of the set 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.619
 we have dragon pulse gigas in super these 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.210
 fires for gigas steels not included for 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.999
 recover a little life also 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.939
 can see the pca hills for the ruffles 

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:50.950
 so the flight types and finally the last 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.289
 cloning motion to move 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.880
 behind a clown and typing with a 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.859
 green storm get even more 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.679
 easily puzzling look for 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:02.950
 paralyze the opponent and finally causes 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.600
 especially for the states in so the 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.899
 distribution for people wishing 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.590
 play maj aspic challenge his 252 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.720
 towards ax p200 its v-shape 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.120
 tess and four in peace shy nature 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.250
 and concerning the obligated either the remains 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.170
 to regain some peace but each 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.569
 turn either their life to always tap 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:27.030
 stronger so to counter or check 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.510
 maj aspic I propose you three 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.519
 solutions 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.830
 we will start with better claude hocus 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.650
 the number one solution of the pack cus 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.239
 combat jacket that has a huge defense 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:42.090
 special and herbivorous 250 and talent 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.980
 herbivores will increase the mu attacked 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.890
 claude hocus if the latter undergoes a 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.319
 attack plant is just storm 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.019
 green is a plant attack so you 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.930
 bring mu claude christ on the storm 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.379
 green and maje aspic is not going to receive 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.069
 the green storm boosts since that 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.870
 it will be canceled by herbivores and thanks 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.349
 to a fight gesture you can even 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.140
 send your cus lawn on the 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:13.620
 field even if my application is more 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.440
 of cars has more taste sheet rank of maj 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.670
 aspic halt junk life on dragon 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.730
 pulse between 40 and 1.4 percent and 48.6 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.190
 % so it's more than we call a 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.260
 against but maja this cop up and done 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.389
 still big holes and that's 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.540
 relatively correct is behind you 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:36.180
 can make a big blast 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.250
 to destroy this mage aspic so here 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.410
 the first solution that I propose to you 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.299
 of the plÃ´ d'augustin pokÃ©mon under used and 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.720
 for me it is a solution quite 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.700
 viable 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.919
 we will now move to the second 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.609
 solution who is gaulle gaulle and who 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:55.859
 will integrate news 2 and who has access to 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.620
 governed strong so that allows particular to 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.840
 each this switch to recover 33% of his 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.049
 life but which especially has a double type 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.470
 which allows you to take almost nothing 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.200
 green storm 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.050
 of the poison multiple and concerning the 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.850
 distribution here is the distribution of 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.230
 Gaulle is used as a racing car 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.970
 laughing redon ie nature 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.709
 insured 252nd seniors 252 v defense and 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.360
 four in special attack so 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.710
 usually plays golay with sport but 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.720
 that it will not work on my 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.000
 cap since it is of the plant type 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.710
 similarly for per aspord but you 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.210
 can always be toxic but this 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.930
 which is interesting with gaulle and his 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.090
 smog baths that cancels the boosts of 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.670
 the opponent so you do one of this 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:43.530
 mag on an aspic mage that's up to over 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:46.660
 it will go down to + 0 and over 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:51.640
 gaulle and always takes majestic 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:53.620
 except on dragon pulse between 46 and 54 % 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.690
 so yes it's a lot I agree 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:00.550
 but maj aspic is still more than 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:02.410
 is behind you put majestic to 0 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.720
 with 20 smaug and you inflict on him 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.880
 a lot of damage I will put all the 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.080
 calculations in the description of that under 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.550
 or the door 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.030
 all this will be in detail in the 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.370
 description but if you really want 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.620
 even better in which six aspic matches 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:22.450
 contestation you can calm the toy 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:24.490
 with a 252e distribution of the 250 pv's of 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.250
 v special and four defense 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.280
 last in special attack ela has more 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:33.280
 de gaulle and will only take 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.860
 always on the mage aspic life orb on 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.740
 dragon's pulse between 32.1 percent the 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.750
 38% which is a lot less so there 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:44.650
 would be it's really a tale and 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.810
 effective of majestic contestation and 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.850
 finally the last pokemon that I you 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.460
 propose it's nostang then do this 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:55.000
 is not a counter in the sense that it 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.370
 can not come on a dragon pulse to 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.840
 even at most 1 it seems to me of any 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.930
 way the calculation are in the description 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.229
 but he can allow after that maje 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.700
 asp issued a chaos pokemon or even if 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.650
 you feel that maje what he will do 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.930
 a green storm because thanks to the double 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.560
 poison flight type it does not take absolutely 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.620
 nothing on a green storm to +0 sent a 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.720
 moment to do 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.360
 and behind this one is faster 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.060
 majestic even stiff challenge and 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.620
 with the headband choice whether with 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.639
 half turn it's the rock traps are 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.840
 present and with rapacious or poison cross 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.419
 you put that a tribute to this pic 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.010
 contestation if it came to stay 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.050
 in the field but usually 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:39.650
 the opponent does not leave his image 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.699
 aspic on hell dust so this is this 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.620
 video ends 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:44.930
 I hope it scares you more 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.150
 that this video is out of the ordinary 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.550
 on the channel you liked if it is the case 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.440
 do not hesitate to put 1 inch blue one 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.030
 comment do not hesitate to tell me what 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.940
 do you think of maj aspic is this 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:59.960
 that he must stay in n2 or not if you 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:02.180
 also have bencheikh counters that 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.560
 I do not have to propose among these 3 6 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.740
 do not hesitate to talk about it in 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.150
 comments I'm really interested 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.930
 I really like discussing with you in 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.850
 comments area 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:14.090
 so do not hesitate to let go 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:16.820
 comments here and if it has you more 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.270
 down I can redo a problem three 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.100
 solutions 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.490
 Come on that's what are you dead this warrant 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.490
 the next
