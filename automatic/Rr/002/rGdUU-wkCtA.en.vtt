00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.360
 hello girls welcome this channel another 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.190
 time and first of all again and what 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.280
 true forgive me for the nails vases 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:29.600
 I paint or record them and I prefer to record 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.520
 mb a little are and do not be good I do not have 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.890
 I want to have hair on my face and 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.449
 well I bring you the favorites of this 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.489
 month are a bit strange I do not know I do not know by 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.499
 what this time seems a bit weird and 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.149
 as always we will start with that more 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:46.579
 one because I always put five more 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.010
 one and that one because it has something special 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.819
 so nothing was left to watch the video if 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.699
 you are interested 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:55.639
 Well, that manu do not think that any 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.420
 I suppose you will have it 

00:00:55.639 --> 00:01:02.239
 planned I do not know good are the rings and 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.840
 for the ring applicator of the 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.100
 extensions I have fixed them good 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.130
 you just have to have a few 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.110
 care with her that she does not know 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.850
 make dreadlocks that when I go 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.850
 growing your hair you have to be careful 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.630
 with the hair that is hooked to the 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.119
 same extension does not mean not to untangle 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.369
 the strong so you do not lose hair and 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.380
 things like that apart from dehydration like 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.679
 your normal hair to wash it because no 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.210
 rubbing yourself too much and good stuff like that 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:34.310
 another good part is that I'm 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.969
 delighted with having a little more hair 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.420
 long really the extension is this not 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:43.340
 it's a bit much but to me then I 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.189
 like it a lot and it gives me much more body 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.079
 to the hair that I take away from mine before 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.450
 put on the extensions so that they do not 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.670
 will notice so much but let me know 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.579
 love it so nothing that would be the most 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.609
 one for that reason that I carry them in 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:01.009
 my that is nothing to say eat it in addition 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:03.079
 there are three makeup products other than 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.079
 hair and one of treatment if you think 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.800
 I will continue with my hair and although I do not 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.160
 look like bullshit 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.950
 It's a lacquer and it's the nelly that a lot 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.470
 People hate because the sack because 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.170
 It seems I'm not sure if he has 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.740
 been now but it seems that they have 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.870
 taken different ranges I did not know what 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.930
 discovered now or has left now not 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.850
 I know but I love this especially 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.790
 which is the anti-curl between 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.000
 frizz effect anti humidity and 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.590
 anti frizz that is the green band 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.140
 It's worth a lot of people that I know do not 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.470
 I like cinnamon, I liked it very much 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.060
 there are people who do not smell and there is 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.620
 truth is that it does not smell like nelly of all 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.010
 life in fact I have a boat of the 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.690
 big of the normal there 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.900
 I've tried the fiction can I've already tried 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.520
 several at the institute I test brands 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.010
 of hairdressing and honestly for me 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.290
 for every day for example today that 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.480
 I have taken a tail I have collected the 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.000
 hairs and things like that 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.920
 for me it's great I brush him but 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.080
 I do not know any people 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.120
 that says it will not be your hair type 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.220
 I have no idea what is going to me is great 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.920
 baratita is the one of a lifetime and 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.049
 located anywhere and good 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.840
 This particular anti - frizz because yes 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.849
 it's true that it holds pretty well 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.319
 the hairs I have many hairs 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.620
 little man I'm not going to expect that 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:32.220
 I took them all away because I did not either 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.930
 is so much needed but but good not 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.239
 I know I like I will continue with the product 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.950
 of treatment and this I think it's not going to 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.160
 it's no news that you follow me 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.849
 per instagram and it's tree oil 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.430
 tea 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:47.940
 I have this one, it cost me about eight 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.630
 euros and good comes as in pipette 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.630
 OK 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.739
 Well, it 's true that it smells strong to me 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.290
 the truth that bothers me I like it a lot 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.060
 how it smells and I explain it in a wet 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.370
 a little bit of a stick with a couple of 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.250
 drops and applying in the area for example 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:09.510
 here today and good today 2 days ago 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.189
 I have a considerable granite and I have 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.540
 been giving a couple of days and the truth 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:16.560
 is that good because it has disappeared 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.169
 quite and I love this pure oil 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.919
 I know they sell it also in hypercor in 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:25.100
 the English cut but I already bought it in 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:28.070
 an herbalist here in my neighborhood 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.340
 and good lasts 12 months open and brings 15 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.870
 milliliters and the animal cruelty free 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.570
 I do not know I like it a lot and the truth is 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.240
 which takes effect if at 2 days or 3 already 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.280
 the granite almost disappears is great 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.980
 because it's also a disinfectant 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.920
 a couple of droplets in the good tonic I 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.140
 I have here this little boat that I have 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.570
 it filled almost finished with my tonic 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.700
 of the normal one that I use in the morning 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.290
 the night and I made a couple of droplets 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.060
 I mix it every time I go to 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.840
 apply and apply sprays well 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.700
 and I really like it, I do not know how it has 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.430
 controlled a little bit more the fat of the 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.990
 skin and I'm delighted and we're going now with 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.390
 the three makeup products I'm going to 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.970
 start with a brush this brush has 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.100
 come out in the hall of the month and it's this 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.680
 Costal sense brush I have no idea 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.440
 how much does it really cost me 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.020
 I bought in beauty expo and it came out to six 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.690
 euros and neither is the number because 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.430
 it came unnumbered but it 's like a 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.729
 small skunk 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.610
 it's worth as well as crushed 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:34.430
 and I love it because in the end I am 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.400
 using my skin for the green concealer 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.939
 Well, it's clarita, because I have enough 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.319
 redness and with the same green concealer 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.309
 from cryo land that you know is my 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.870
 Favourite 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:47.150
 well here I have clarito then 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.490
 imagine that it is the green I give 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.339
 small touches and I apply in the area 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.830
 central which is where I have then the 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:56.539
 redness and it's great I do not have to be 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.180
 little by little with a brush more 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:01.099
 little one not for nothing and with this 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.949
 then in a second , each 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:07.639
 taste and for the base I would also like 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:10.039
 I'm sure but I will not use it to 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.689
 that but for the green corrector if 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.580
 at some point sell come here 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:16.620
 constants and I find out the number that is 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.330
 I understand to buy one for the 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.729
 base you leave it great even though it 's that 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.129
 women love for base and 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:26.150
 speaking of base my base par excellence 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:28.220
 that the infinite more than castriz 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.040
 You see, it's going through here, this is the third 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.260
 boat that spending it is the first time 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.660
 that I spend so many cans of something the 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:39.380
 third boat and I have two to replace 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:41.060
 these of the old I took advantage when the 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.980
 descatalogación to reformulate the 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.260
 take advantage, tell me with a few 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.450
 but anyway they say that the 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.510
 new quite the same so why 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.730
 that I take is great is 20 days and 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.280
 it leaves me the perfect skin there are people that 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.550
 does not like me yes the truth is that my 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.770
 skin does not need too much coverage 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:03.689
 but I am not provided with coverage 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.669
 provides more notification 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:08.279
 I do not know yet so I always nuanced it 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:10.080
 with dust and I do not know is that everything lasts 

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:12.119
 the day maybe it is true that in 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.499
 some areas more in others less but it's 

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:15.719
 that lasts me all day I'm delighted 

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:17.879
 with her and you know patrick a brand 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:19.529
 low cost and it goes great to me personally 

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:21.769
 I love and good the last product 

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:26.369
 that I come to teach is an eyeliner 

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:29.789
 this here of eses I use it a lot 

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:33.239
 but quite especially in class or for 

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:36.689
 go to class and it's the simple liquid 

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:40.860
 eyeliner of month is the simplest that 

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:43.699
 has with the sponge applicator not 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.699
 I'm going to teach it 

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:49.590
 is sponge applicator is not an applicator 

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:52.320
 of brush to me I love I made myself 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:54.810
 brush and point and nothing I'm seeing 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.600
 very dark the clouds I will have to 

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.860
 edit a lot of the light of this video but 

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.960
 Well I hope you liked me 

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.360
