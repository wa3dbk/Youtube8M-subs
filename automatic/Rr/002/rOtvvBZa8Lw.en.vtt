00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.400
 There are already 5000 commercial cars 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.200
 They changed to gas only in Santiago 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.600
 and they did it completely 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.940
 free a system that installs this 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.720
 company and with which many buses taxis 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.060
 and groups manage to save up to 40% 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.970
 compared to 95 gasoline 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.380
 octane helps decontaminate so that 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.610
 we are things because today 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.920
 then the gas pollutes 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.230
 for us it is also not going to have 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.390
 restriction the fact of using gas not 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.730
 we have restriction in change even if 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.590
 catalytic like we have restriction in 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.090
 change with gas saved us the 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.370
 distinctions and we can work without 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.050
 No problem though not many 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.720
 people have opted for this 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.210
 technology is impossible to massify 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.670
 while the distribution companies of 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.700
 gas do not have an appropriate network for 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.650
 load the vehicles at this time in 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.930
 natural gas I think there are three points of 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.220
 santiago and liquefied gas may have 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.410
 10 but located all in part where 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.320
 they cater to taxi lines not 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.659
 private vehicles 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.220
 are two of the stations available in 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.770
 the peripheral districts of the capital 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.470
 although they are mainly for cars 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.479
 commercials however executives of 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.180
 suppliers ensure that the 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.400
 possibility of development exists in the 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.170
 industry is prepared coverage of 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.420
 its headquarters in santiago already from two 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.900
 stations those two stations are 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.310
 operational there are five operational workshops 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.619
 and there are several more workshops throughout 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.330
 all chile and supply ports by 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.100
 So I think the conditions of the 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.509
 point of view of the private ones for 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.539
 develop this industry are given 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.750
 will only sell the signals and the 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.580
 regulations or regulations that are defined 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.070
 on the part of the authority signs that 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.410
 for many have not yet reached a system 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.630
 it could become a real solution 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.180
 upward of the fuels that both 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.979
 pocket affects all Chileans 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.979
