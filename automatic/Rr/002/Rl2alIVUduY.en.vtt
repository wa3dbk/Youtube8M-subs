literature<00:01:50.630> I<00:01:50.840> did<00:01:51.020> it<00:01:51.109> on<00:01:51.139> my<00:01:51.319> fifth<00:01:51.649> try

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
maybe it's really annoying so you might

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.809

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
want to consider saving right before the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.870 
want to consider saving right before the
checkpoint<00:01:56.299> to<00:01:57.429> minimize<00:01:58.429> the<00:01:58.579> time<00:01:58.729> will

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
checkpoint to minimize the time will

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.769 
checkpoint to minimize the time will
take<00:01:59.090> to<00:01:59.599> reload<00:02:00.109> but<00:02:00.679> um<00:02:01.209> yeah<00:02:02.209> it's<00:02:02.359> very<00:02:02.509> fun

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:02.779
