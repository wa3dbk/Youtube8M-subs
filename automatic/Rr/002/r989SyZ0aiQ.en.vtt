00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
little bit about the app and then how

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.149 
little bit about the app and then how
this<00:01:15.150> technology<00:01:15.570> works<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.650> app<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.979> pretty

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
this technology works the app is pretty

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.530 
this technology works the app is pretty
straight<00:01:17.490> forward<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.000> does<00:01:18.210> allow<00:01:18.479> you
