buns<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.640> can<00:00:32.820> just<00:00:33.030> insert<00:00:33.809> on<00:00:34.140> your

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.020 
buns that you can just insert on your
hair<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.829> really<00:00:35.309> thought<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.820> balance

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
hair I really thought that this balance

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.790 
hair I really thought that this balance
would<00:00:36.360> look<00:00:36.510> so<00:00:37.160> cray<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.960> so<00:00:39.960> unnatural<00:00:40.620> but

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
would look so cray and so unnatural but

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.790 
would look so cray and so unnatural but
the<00:00:40.950> hair<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.460> 1%<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.750> human<00:00:43.050> hair<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.620> it

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the hair is 1% of human hair so it

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.580 
the hair is 1% of human hair so it
really<00:00:44.070> blended<00:00:44.789> with<00:00:45.059> mine<00:00:45.510> here<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.440> guys

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
really blended with mine here you guys

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.459 
really blended with mine here you guys
can<00:00:46.890> see<00:00:47.190> there<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:48.000> has<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.480> line<00:00:48.899> right<00:00:49.170> here

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
can see there it has a line right here

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.740 
can see there it has a line right here
but<00:00:49.829> that's<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.520> thing<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.329> either<00:00:51.539> you

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
but that's the thing it's either you

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.819 
but that's the thing it's either you
cover<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.410> your<00:00:52.440> hair<00:00:52.829> or<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:54.300> use<00:00:54.899> like

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
cover it with your hair or you use like

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.920 
cover it with your hair or you use like
a<00:00:55.860> headband<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.340> usually<00:00:56.760> use<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.239> head<00:00:57.750> bent

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
a headband I usually use a head bent

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.229 
a headband I usually use a head bent
cover<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:58.770> no<00:00:58.920> longer<00:00:58.949> see<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.789> edging

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
cover you can no longer see the edging

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.720 
cover you can no longer see the edging
because<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.690> covered<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.109> up<00:01:01.199> with<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:02.160> I

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
because I covered it up with this but I

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.820 
because I covered it up with this but I
think<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.359> pretty<00:01:03.480> much<00:01:03.600> okay<00:01:04.019> if<00:01:04.290> your<00:01:04.559> hair

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
think it's pretty much okay if your hair

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.920 
think it's pretty much okay if your hair
can<00:01:05.010> fully<00:01:05.280> cover<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.790> edging<00:01:06.600> that'd<00:01:06.750> be

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
can fully cover the edging that'd be

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.240 
can fully cover the edging that'd be
really<00:01:07.049> great<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.470> don't<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.920> won't<00:01:08.040> be

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
really great you don't you won't be

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.910 
really great you don't you won't be
really<00:01:08.580> needing<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.380> safety

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
really needing this but just for safety

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.310 
really needing this but just for safety
purposes<00:01:11.159> too<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.909> know<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.869> supposedly

a side bangs but I find it's so weird on
my<00:01:17.460> face<00:01:17.880> shape<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.869> kind<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.350> did<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.009> just

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
my face shape so I kind of did and just

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
like trimmed some and made it to a full

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.630 
like trimmed some and made it to a full
bangs<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.330> guess<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.720> really<00:01:25.080> wanted<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.640> test

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
bangs I guess I really wanted to test

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.149 
bangs I guess I really wanted to test
and<00:01:26.850> see<00:01:27.060> how<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.330> look<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:28.259> full<00:01:28.740> bangs

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
and see how I look like with full bangs

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.149 
and see how I look like with full bangs
on<00:01:29.610> when<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> was<00:01:30.720> using<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> full

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
on when I was using this with the full

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.520 
on when I was using this with the full
side<00:01:32.520> bangs<00:01:32.790> when<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.329> wasn't<00:01:33.479> TRADOC<00:01:34.110> trimmed

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
side bangs when it wasn't TRADOC trimmed

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.609 
side bangs when it wasn't TRADOC trimmed
because<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.329> couldn't<00:01:36.329> fit<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.810> onto<00:01:37.049> my<00:01:37.320> face

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
because I couldn't fit it onto my face

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.460 
because I couldn't fit it onto my face
shape<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.909> like<00:01:39.570> cutting<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.229> making

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
shape so this like cutting it and making

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.990 
shape so this like cutting it and making
it<00:01:40.710> look<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.869> it<00:01:42.869> actually<00:01:43.320> looked

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
it look like this it actually looked

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
it look like this it actually looked
decent<00:01:45.000> only<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.829> bangs

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020

that's<00:01:51.170> holding<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.159> hair<00:01:52.340> together<00:01:52.549> and<00:01:53.890> you

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
that's holding the hair together and you

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.539
