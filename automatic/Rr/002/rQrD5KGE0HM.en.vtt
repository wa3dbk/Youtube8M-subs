 his wife's name is 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.459
 the choice of barack obama 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.079

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.710

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.289
 for me Mr. Obama extensively an unknown 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.509
 do not know him 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.560
 I only know 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.560
 what we know was elected president of the united states 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.570
 from North America 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.420
 country that became 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.620
 in a true empire that asota 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.950
 to the world 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.140
 ikea goes to shot adobe that keeps hitting 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.400
 to our people 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.800
 let's wait to see 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.740
 by the way, obina 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.030

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.740
 anniversary 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.650
 80 years of birth 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.240
 of a 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.989
 the North American leader 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.989
 killed too 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.970
 when I was a very young man 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.560
 was born on January 15, 1929 80 years ago 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.830
 was born on the plant 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.830
 Martin Luther King 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.800
 the rimenses 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.510
 I have to regret this 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.040
 regret it 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.870
 and alert 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.350
 because later they start to say that vilalta they fasten vega throws stone 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.730
 the bilateral chávez that likes to fight with the whole world 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.730
 obama is repeating what is the same as his bus 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.360
 chávez 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.340
 It has been a force 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.040
 that has interrupted 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.730
 there he is right 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.440
 and the force is not me 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.440
 the force is called venezuela that is the force 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.260
 there is right obama 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.260
 but it's not me and venezuela 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.590
 only that I personalize it not as if I were a worthy man 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:14.229
 Chávez has been a force 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.539
 that has interrupted the progress in the region 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.829
 it will be that he mistook me for bush 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:25.049
 who has thrown into the world by an abyss not only the region the region the 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.569
 whole world has been bush 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.260
 and one of the greatest challenges he receives 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.619
 it's like inheritance 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.889
 the task menda economic crisis 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.499
 moral 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.909
 industrial 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.670
 social that has in there the united states 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.269
 Unemployment 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.269
 and the one that really sank into poverty 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.139
 even more than what was already 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.279
 misery 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:59.970
 to this continent to the state itself eaten and to the world 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.559
 It was bush 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.369
 now if he comes to respect venezuela 

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:05.380
 he will recieve 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.299
 a respectful response 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.419
 If you want to converse with the Venezuelans here, we are to order 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:14.730
 With respect 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.870
 because this country 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.259
 it was respected 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:18.989
 and this town 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.319
 but Mrs. obama 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.319
 follow well 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.169
 on the other hand venezuela 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.169
 it is a country of great importance 

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:37.759
 he's right let's give an applause he deserves applause 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:41.739
 Venezuela is a country of great importance 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.739
 with deserved with the whole region 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:46.990
 obviously 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.990
 It is a major oil supplier 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:55.539
 and for us to say that we are willing to start conversations 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:58.239
 diplomatic 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.379
 on how to improve relationships 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.379
 we have to be very firm we 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.029
 and here that 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:10.479
 same we also very firm 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:12.809
 I answer like mister mister obama 

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:14.219
 we also 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:15.789
 we have learned to be 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:17.789
 very firm 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.849
 we have learned to be very happy 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.439
 when we see 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:24.749
 this news 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:26.999
 that venezuela affected 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:29.999
 exporting terrorist activities 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.940
 those who wear again is confusing with bush 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.230
 who exports 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.409
 terrorist activities 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:44.050
 not only bus 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.050
 now now you are surrounded by mister obama 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.689
 now they surround you there 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.789
 now the chair is around you 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.789
 all that mechanism of terror 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.129
 that kill 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:03.379
 yesterday workshop bring him to the state of israel yesterday I made the decision 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.150
 in the afternoon definitely 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:09.930
 type of relationships 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.930
 with the state of ohio 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.000
 when we see this news that venezuela is exporting activities 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:26.740
 terrorists 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.740
 ob supporting malicious entities 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.360
 like the farc 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.469
 That creates problems that are not acceptable. Well, it's repeating what they say. 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.479
 what you say 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.139
 I hope that's why I say I think we're in time for Mr. Obama 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.229
 rectify 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.800
 when the president assumes the united states 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.300
 and good there 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.960
 even with the limitations that must have 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.789
 the president of an imperial country 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.610
 but nevertheless 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.589
 have 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:01.919
 the most elementary respect for the rules of diplomacy 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.219
 and the respect 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.609
 not to the countries to the sovereignty of the countries
