00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.180
 a healthy diet starts with the 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.809
 choices that you take in the store 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.790
 food or in the supermarket first 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.160
 it's a good idea to go to the store 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.939
 food with a full stomach so not 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.310
 you will make impulsive purchases second plans 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.070
 your balanced meals for the week 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.800
 complete so you'll know exactly why 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.599
 you are buying and you will only choose 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.949
 the food you need to 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.009
 prepare those meals 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:34.250
 in this way you eliminate buying all the 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.530
 junk food that you do not need if you do not 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.590
 you have them in your house you do not go to them 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.170
 eat if all you have is food 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.230
 healthy in your house then everything 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.289
 what you will eat will be healthy foods 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.449
 it's that simple by the way once 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.640
 start eating a healthy diet and 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.530
 natural most people are 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.260
 They find that they no longer feel anxious 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.450
 or cravings for junk food or meals 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.850
 highly processed 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.770
 there is no reason to eliminate or limit the 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.310
 consumption of any food group or 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.940
 macro nutrients proteins carbohydrates 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.910
 or fats 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.670
 restrictive diets always go to 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.590
 fail at some point as a separate note 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.160
 It must be said that there are six 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.950
 carbohydrate nutrient categories 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.200
 protein fat vitamins minerals and 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.720
 water fulfill important functions in 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.000
 our bodies and when they are consumed 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.550
 in the right quantities in the 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.670
 appropriate moments promote a body 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.830
 slender and healthy I do not think there is 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.869
 a dietary composition that produces 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.930
 the best results to lose fat 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.270
 of the body some scientists and 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.880
 Medical experts recommend a diet 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:52.340
 40% carbohydrates 40% protein 20% 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.540
 fat while others recommend a 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.840
 composition of 40% carbohydrates 30% 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.060
 proteins and 30% fat and even others 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.020
 recommend a higher content of 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:11.090
 carbohydrates well 60% carbohydrates 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.550
 15 proteins and 25 fat the truth is that 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.709
 actually almost all of those mentioned 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.780
 They can work well since you're in 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.239
 the correct calorie range and the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.519
 meals are mostly unprocessed 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.709
 and high in nutrients to deliver 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.319
 everything your body needs and so 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.209
 maintain an appropriate hormonal balance and 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.060
 carry out all the functions 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.190
 bodily although I think it is not 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.620
 need to be meticulous about 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.989
 exact percentages of macronutrients 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.760
 in your diet I do believe that you start with your 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.340
 Protein requirements is 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.170
 important most studies 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.420
 recent suggest a consumption of 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.610
 Daily protein of approximately 2 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.500
 grams per kilo of body weight for 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.530
 individuals who train hard and do 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.209
 continuously exercise even though 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.250
 some will argue that it can be 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.680
 too much and others will say that it is not 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.519
 enough I think it's a good point of 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.440
 start for example if you weigh 85 kilos 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.500
 you could try to consume 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.410
 approximately 170 grams of protein 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.070
 per day spread over relative shares 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.160
 equal between 5 to 6 meals a day one 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.560
 60 kilos woman could just try to 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.440
 consume between 100 and 130 grams of 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.360
 protein per day every meal does not have 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.790
 that contain equal amounts of 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.310
 protein but you should include at least 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.620
 some protein in each meal to 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.510
 help to give you satiety and to 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.330
 ensure that your body has a source 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.330
 continuous amino acids throughout the day
