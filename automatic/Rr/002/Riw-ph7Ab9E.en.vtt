out and it was just kind of like little

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.620 
out and it was just kind of like little
crinkly<00:00:16.310> things<00:00:16.640> I<00:00:16.880> guess<00:00:17.029> you<00:00:17.210> could<00:00:17.240> say<00:00:17.570> so

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
crinkly things I guess you could say so

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.450 
crinkly things I guess you could say so
on<00:00:17.960> I<00:00:18.380> didn't<00:00:18.650> really<00:00:18.770> know<00:00:18.920> what<00:00:18.950> to<00:00:19.130> do<00:00:19.310> with

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
on I didn't really know what to do with

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.490 
on I didn't really know what to do with
it<00:00:19.580> but<00:00:19.610> I<00:00:19.820> knew<00:00:19.939> I<00:00:19.970> wasn't<00:00:20.240> ready<00:00:20.540> to<00:00:20.840> wash<00:00:21.200> it

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
it but I knew I wasn't ready to wash it

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.320 
it but I knew I wasn't ready to wash it
but<00:00:21.950> I<00:00:22.010> didn't<00:00:22.369> really<00:00:22.400> like<00:00:22.670> the<00:00:22.849> way<00:00:22.880> that<00:00:23.180> it

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
but I didn't really like the way that it

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.929 
but I didn't really like the way that it
looked<00:00:23.540> because<00:00:23.930> it<00:00:24.169> was<00:00:24.259> just<00:00:24.439> uh<00:00:24.650> I<00:00:25.009> don't

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
looked because it was just uh I don't

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.940 
looked because it was just uh I don't
know<00:00:26.060> it<00:00:26.689> was<00:00:26.810> just<00:00:26.930> it<00:00:27.290> looked<00:00:27.470> like<00:00:27.560> I<00:00:27.710> took<00:00:27.770> a

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
know it was just it looked like I took a

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.700 
know it was just it looked like I took a
crimping<00:00:28.400> iron<00:00:28.669> and<00:00:29.450> crimp<00:00:29.750> my<00:00:29.810> hair<00:00:29.900> and<00:00:30.380> I

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
crimping iron and crimp my hair and I

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.839 
crimping iron and crimp my hair and I
didn't<00:00:31.040> really<00:00:31.130> like<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.340> way<00:00:31.430> that<00:00:31.610> looked

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
didn't really like the way that looked

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.330 
didn't really like the way that looked
just<00:00:32.090> by<00:00:32.930> itself<00:00:33.320> so<00:00:33.560> i<00:00:33.590> just<00:00:33.980> thought<00:00:34.190> i<00:00:34.220> would

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
just by itself so i just thought i would

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.819 
just by itself so i just thought i would
own<00:00:34.640> try<00:00:35.030> braiding<00:00:35.540> it<00:00:35.630> and<00:00:35.840> see<00:00:36.320> what<00:00:36.440> happens

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
own try braiding it and see what happens

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.400 
own try braiding it and see what happens
so<00:00:37.520> I<00:00:37.550> didn't<00:00:37.940> really<00:00:38.120> um<00:00:38.420> to<00:00:38.690> tangle<00:00:39.050> it<00:00:39.170> Ida

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
so I didn't really um to tangle it Ida

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.069 
so I didn't really um to tangle it Ida
tengo<00:00:39.859> look<00:00:40.010> a<00:00:40.100> little<00:00:40.309> bit<00:00:40.519> at<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:41.120> end<00:00:41.449> um

so<00:01:15.840> yeah<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.590> was<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> easiest

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
so yeah that was like the easiest

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.190 
so yeah that was like the easiest
sprayed<00:01:17.580> out<00:01:17.760> that<00:01:17.970> I've<00:01:18.090> ever<00:01:18.120> done<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.840> I

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
sprayed out that I've ever done and I

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.170 
sprayed out that I've ever done and I
was<00:01:19.380> surprised<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.040> came<00:01:20.730> out<00:01:20.760> like<00:01:20.940> this

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
was surprised that it came out like this

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.940 
was surprised that it came out like this
I<00:01:21.390> didn't<00:01:21.780> really<00:01:21.900> know<00:01:22.080> what<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.230> expect<00:01:22.350> so

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
I didn't really know what to expect so

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.830 
I didn't really know what to expect so
that's<00:01:23.130> why<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.340> didn't<00:01:23.640> really<00:01:23.880> take<00:01:24.630> my

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
that's why I didn't really take my

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.360 
that's why I didn't really take my
process<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.410> doing<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.740> but<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:25.980> i<00:01:26.100> said<00:01:26.130> i

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
process of doing it but like i said i

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.250 
process of doing it but like i said i
just<00:01:26.550> took<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.850> twist<00:01:27.090> out<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.600> then<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.200> just

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
just took the twist out and then I just

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.760 
just took the twist out and then I just
basically<00:01:28.920> put<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.120> some<00:01:30.510> braids<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.140> this

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
basically put it in some braids and this

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.010 
basically put it in some braids and this
is<00:01:31.920> what<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.130> got<00:01:32.370> so<00:01:32.820> I'll<00:01:33.480> be<00:01:33.600> wearing<00:01:33.780> my<00:01:33.870> hair

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020
