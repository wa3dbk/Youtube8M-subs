recommend picking some very strong

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.099 
recommend picking some very strong
allies<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.210> because<00:00:30.510> if<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.019> don't

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
allies for this because if you don't

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.560

completely<00:00:34.170> dominated<00:00:34.969> because<00:00:35.969> they're

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
completely dominated because they're

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.990 
completely dominated because they're
pretty<00:00:37.350> high<00:00:37.469> level<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:38.070> most<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.879> time

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
pretty high level and most of the time

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.030 
pretty high level and most of the time
people<00:00:39.149> are<00:00:39.360> about<00:00:39.570> level<00:00:39.989> 85<00:00:40.950> 86<00:00:42.680> but<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.710> would

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
people are about level 85 86 but I would

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.580 
people are about level 85 86 but I would
also<00:00:44.160> recommend<00:00:44.600> you<00:00:45.600> having<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.989> few<00:00:46.230> points

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
also recommend you having a few points

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.100 
also recommend you having a few points
in<00:00:46.739> two<00:00:46.860> strike<00:00:47.190> supers<00:00:47.690> yeah<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.840> believe

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
in two strike supers yeah I believe

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.819 
in two strike supers yeah I believe
that's<00:00:49.200> what<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.530> strike<00:00:49.770> supers

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
that's what it is strike supers

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.689 
that's what it is strike supers
basically<00:00:52.829> when<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.070> start<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.399> mission

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
basically when you start this mission

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.160 
basically when you start this mission
you<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:54.300> want<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.480> go<00:00:54.600> into<00:00:54.870> one<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
you just want to go into one of the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.020 
you just want to go into one of the
portals<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.210> honestly<00:00:57.980> it<00:00:58.980> really<00:00:59.399> doesn't

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
portals and honestly it really doesn't

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.510 
portals and honestly it really doesn't
matter<00:01:00.090> which<00:01:00.300> one<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.449> go<00:01:00.629> into<00:01:00.870> Napa<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
matter which one you go into Napa is the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.210 
matter which one you go into Napa is the
hardest<00:01:02.789> i<00:01:02.940> believe<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.860> I've<00:01:04.860> noticed

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
hardest i believe it is I've noticed

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.740 
hardest i believe it is I've noticed
that<00:01:05.430> nap<00:01:05.640> was<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.970> hardest<00:01:06.210> i<00:01:06.360> don't<00:01:06.540> know<00:01:06.630> if

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750

that's<00:01:06.840> true<00:01:06.990> or<00:01:07.140> not<00:01:07.229> but<00:01:07.380> that's<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.430> what

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
that's true or not but that's just what

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.060
