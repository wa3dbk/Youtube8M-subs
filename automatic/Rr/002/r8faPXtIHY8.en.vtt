00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.270
 were gone today against hardenbergh 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.290
 are going to try the sour aftertaste that of 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.580
 last week 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.559
 in the match against Noordwijk 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.500
 left over 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.750
 barendrecht where mark seekers are injured 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.400
 has been hit and be a mark of splitter 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.810
 will take place 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.980
 jolly young man has had to make way 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.980
 for bass maurits 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.090
 Hardenberg immediately chooses the attack late 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.830
 See why it's a fantastic team 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.830
 has it at the top 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.079
 six in the top class 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.239
 points man and the season shooting here 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.850
 gouriye 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.320
 are players who are at top class level of 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.930
 have more value but has a way 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.230
 and no initial phase then it's hard for sure 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.199
 here with six round the clock 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.250
 he comes that is shall was not to pass 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.629
 but will if had that in the first half 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.640
 awkward against this play hydrate 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.070
 He then well away and is that like 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.210
 lost mind for help but it's mark 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.210
 splitter and in the second instance 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:12.180
 Jeffrey doctor who makes the danger 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:14.250
 Hardenberg is going through it anyway 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.689
 ball is given it is even just 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.530
 again something that has to go in the back 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.409
 defending and sanders trying out here 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.540
 to come but choose Hardenberg 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.450
 Again the attack and therefore courier 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.380
 promising position it is false points that 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.380
 managed to save 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.150
 where a right runs behind hardenbergh 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.140
 to then it has been very difficult in the 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.390
 first error of the first 20 minutes 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.259
 defense and the weather is white again 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.470
 shirt that chooses to give a look 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.540
 but that ball is too low and can list can 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.340
 easily touched by a 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.340
 beech field 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.930
 Here's the good upside down chance for one 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.040
 Bob loses 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.170
 but you do not feel receive enough 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.219
 behind the ball after those 20 minutes there is 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.110
 a tactical adjustment 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.119
 placed by him making train jacket 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.400
 from the mountain and there in barendrecht 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.180
 in a game that view in height 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.730
 the mistake of that is pretty good 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.680
 bakery in the back it's bass maurits that 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.640
 with its walking ability there directly 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.410
 the keeper passes by 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.310
 and shoot him through the inside of the 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.739
 pole within a few and directly on it 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.540
 know how to match the situation 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.129
 directly to the goals it is one 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.980
 logo barendrecht and be easy because it is 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.110
 reverse the voice use case 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.180
 gives a long ball there and looks for arisa 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.180
 coat that stand the defense again 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.110
 except intervening and esajas could there 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.790
 insufficient benefit but gives 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.500
 there are already dangerous ones 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.489
 hardenbergh that won't be too easy 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.930
 to think about how this is the will 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.030
 if that way light 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.879
 which again clock by dangerous 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.879
 He finally came to that bank 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.830
 not good but Hardenberg came and 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.769
 had come through for second place 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.780
 then there comes courier in bonny you 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.099
 of the profiles you make of a one 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.099
 that is a disappointment for barendrecht 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.890
 you will be brought to one and there 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.260
 aerts actually gets in too early 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.450
 thereby release a gouriye 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.720
 voice music.ly is just too late and 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.460
 then lydia 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.130
 you only have to give such a chance once 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.520
 it didn't care in the 22nd minute 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.520
 one one 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.960
 which is highly in the phase of barendrecht 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.090
 played Danny Monster gives the ball here 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.530
 that goes beyond everyone 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.930
 becomes defend again where 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.400
 hard bergh're the man to play than 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.170
 a little too far ahead of him and from Gastel 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.110
 can intervene 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.960
 along with almeida van gastel 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.250
 danny monster and then left state 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:03.700
 already as a completely free placed week 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.920
 does that makes the ball excellent and 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.120
 barendrecht so back to a setback 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.060
 two minutes thereafter 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.990
 just before half time still for the two one 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.990
 he sees her beech field 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.280
 and with the came running in avoided 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.419
 in being cover 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.760
 fantastic goal from daniel esajas and 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.110
 he bram barendregt thereby with a 2 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.840
 in the lead 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.310
 with which they could rest of course 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.990
 must keep mountains second half then go 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.120
 come 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.410
 hardenberg does that also has more the 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:41.320
 ball but are sloppy like here in the 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.390
 defense again a boring jacket but again 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.340
 white shirt and may danny had to 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.660
 benefit that enters the 16 through the 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.160
 action 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.140
 and then shoots wise right leg 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.400
 him in but that is a weak shot 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.130
 for beech field 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.010
 else was there all three can 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.810
 are a good chance for barendrecht then 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.940
 hardenbergh has introduced berger there 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.800
 with length tries to break her head 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.190
 but now it's good for you there 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.590
 defended and immediately landed 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.030
 christian put to work 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.860
 try to play then in stones 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.110
 brought yourself 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.580
 schiedam with the inside of the shoe 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.540
 but there is a little too little power there 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.280
 behind 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.280
 That is why beech field can make your balls stand out 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.150
 it is then again at school in that find 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.260
 on the outside 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.260
 mitchel from gastel 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.210
 in case it is yo yo man it is there again 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.950
 voice your sloop comes only 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.190
 visor is not yet in focus and this one 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:41.730
 ball is wide but shot over 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.730
 barendrecht 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.700
 which remains in any case turn on the 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.560
 despite that there might be more possession 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.820
 was for Ardennes 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.430
 so you just see who is trying to 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.160
 Shoot we have received from arms 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.660
 of defending a confused but the mountain 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.660
 referee sees a penalty in it 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.610
 hardenberg is becoming more pressing us 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.380
 barendrecht gives contraction leaning on 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.860
 the strong defense they have today 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.860
 again 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:14.110
 try of course from the side high 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.460
 balls provide storage of natural 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.979
 courier behind that out of here 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.960
 turn could shoot but mark of 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:22.930
 Splunter proved to be excellent 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.090
 substitute for mark digits and then gave 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.229
 no shrinkage either 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.780
 here comes hardenbergh then maybe 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:31.120
 dangerous out with four but having 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:34.140
 the next is the almere jeffrey doctor 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.140
 who sticks a leg for that 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:41.130
 like here salas that are excellent 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:45.820
 suggested in the 2nd half fredeman comes here 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:49.120
 john man 'christian side 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.530
 in that find then Ebola Majda then look 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.490
 or we could just christian Opschoor 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:57.070
 and he gives it to the distant 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:00.070
 crossing and only a few 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:02.080
 centimeters across the Koran beech field 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.600
 otherwise we had another fantastic 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.130
 cool we can write 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.750
 because of this a head of helma yes that goes there 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.750
 well beside the goal of van splunter 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:18.280
 no barendrecht has to go back but gives 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:20.110
 very little away and defends well here 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.000
 is it then very dangerous and 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.789
 then it comes to do the whole courier again 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.580
 everyone has forgotten about me 

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:29.080
 and he forgets to reward himself by 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.490
 that all people like it great 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.690
 it has not been over the top 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:35.449
 goal line 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:38.300
 given at half an hour but from splunter 

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:40.699
 rules the competition in the book 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.020
 slowly crawls to the end and 

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:44.300
 barendrecht can take three whole here 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.199
 important points go by we write 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.199
 are now in the injury time 

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.460
 the tree is inserted, of course, the 

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.949
 the langenberg in that head butt 

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.870
 but no danger of van splunter 

00:07:54.949 --> 00:07:59.030
 no barendrecht goes the three points here 

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:02.569
 in the house and an important one 

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:04.669
 victory against hard work and 

00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:08.410
 it pays off with this 

00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:08.410
 barendrecht wind from hhc hardenberg
