confidence and if you then you know

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.590 
confidence and if you then you know
because<00:04:07.270> you

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
because you

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.180 
this is a pretty cool throwing axe you
can<00:04:49.750> also<00:04:49.870> just<00:04:50.080> using<00:04:50.410> this<00:04:50.530> I<00:04:50.860> don't<00:04:51.130> know

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
can also just using this I don't know

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.100 
can also just using this I don't know
whatever<00:04:51.430> you<00:04:51.610> want<00:04:51.790> to<00:04:52.150> use<00:04:52.360> your<00:04:52.540> axe<00:04:52.750> for

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
whatever you want to use your axe for

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.670 
whatever you want to use your axe for
but<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:55.000> Bailee<00:04:55.360> is<00:04:55.450> a<00:04:55.510> lot<00:04:55.750> easier<00:04:55.990> to<00:04:56.410> stick

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
but the Bailee is a lot easier to stick

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.200 
but the Bailee is a lot easier to stick
obviously<00:04:56.920> because<00:04:57.430> of<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:57.640> specialized

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
obviously because of the specialized

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.500 
obviously because of the specialized
shape<00:04:58.510> but<00:04:59.110> yeah<00:04:59.230> this<00:04:59.440> is<00:04:59.590> way<00:04:59.830> easier<00:05:00.510> than

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
shape but yeah this is way easier than

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.100 
shape but yeah this is way easier than
this<00:05:01.930> and<00:05:03.570> speaking<00:05:04.570> of<00:05:04.660> easy<00:05:06.150> yes<00:05:07.150> this<00:05:07.870> is<00:05:08.080> a

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
this and speaking of easy yes this is a

intermediate<00:05:58.180> and<00:05:58.300> advanced<00:05:58.810> throwers<00:05:59.170> might

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
intermediate and advanced throwers might

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.440 
intermediate and advanced throwers might
find<00:05:59.800> it<00:05:59.950> a<00:06:00.010> little<00:06:00.130> boring<00:06:00.550> because<00:06:01.000> it's

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
find it a little boring because it's

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.470 
find it a little boring because it's
very<00:06:01.690> easy<00:06:02.020> but<00:06:02.590> of<00:06:02.740> course<00:06:03.030> you<00:06:04.030> can<00:06:04.240> do<00:06:04.360> it

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480 
very easy but of course you can do it

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.000 
very easy but of course you can do it
from<00:06:04.600> farther<00:06:05.080> and<00:06:05.260> farther<00:06:05.500> and<00:06:05.800> farther

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
from farther and farther and farther

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.730 
from farther and farther and farther
away<00:06:06.340> to<00:06:07.060> make<00:06:07.240> it<00:06:07.420> more<00:06:07.630> difficult<00:06:08.050> for

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
away to make it more difficult for

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.360 
away to make it more difficult for
yourself

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
yourself

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.210
