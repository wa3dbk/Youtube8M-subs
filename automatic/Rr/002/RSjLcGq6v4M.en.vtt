00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
defenseman is playing for forward then

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.980 
defenseman is playing for forward then
cut<00:02:00.270> back<00:02:00.509> from<00:02:01.969> so<00:02:02.969> right<00:02:03.390> here<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.719> could

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
cut back from so right here you could

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.929 
cut back from so right here you could
see<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.380> my<00:02:04.530> left<00:02:04.770> winner<00:02:05.040> gets<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.430> goal<00:02:05.640> but

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
see that my left winner gets a goal but

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.119 
see that my left winner gets a goal but
if<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.570> would<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.899> shot<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.860> would<00:02:08.039> have

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
if you would have shot it and would have

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.440 
if you would have shot it and would have
hit<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> goalie<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.670> would<00:02:08.910> got<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.239> rebound

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
hit the goalie I would got the rebound

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.990 
hit the goalie I would got the rebound
and<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:10.619> would<00:02:10.770> have<00:02:10.890> shot<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.550> net

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
and I would have shot in the net

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.300 
and I would have shot in the net
so<00:02:12.900> that's<00:02:13.050> why<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.560> should<00:02:13.860> always<00:02:13.890> be<00:02:14.220> in

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
so that's why you should always be in

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.070 
so that's why you should always be in
