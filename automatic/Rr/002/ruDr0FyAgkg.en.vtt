00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.460 

all<00:00:01.050> right<00:00:01.410> now<00:00:02.100> we<00:00:02.159> get<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.580> good<00:00:02.820> stuff

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:03.470 
all right now we get to the good stuff

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.740 
all right now we get to the good stuff
the<00:00:04.470> skeleton<00:00:05.069> well<00:00:05.609> we<00:00:05.700> talk<00:00:05.910> first<00:00:06.150> about<00:00:06.330> is

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
the skeleton well we talk first about is

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.230 
the skeleton well we talk first about is
the<00:00:07.410> differentiate<00:00:08.130> between<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.490> axial<00:00:09.059> and

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
the differentiate between the axial and

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.160 
the differentiate between the axial and
appendicular<00:00:10.309> skeleton<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.490> then<00:00:12.450> we<00:00:12.929> want

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
appendicular skeleton and then we want

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.390 
appendicular skeleton and then we want
to<00:00:13.290> go<00:00:13.469> straight<00:00:14.040> into<00:00:15.260> the<00:00:16.260> cranial<00:00:16.770> bones<00:00:16.980> as

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
to go straight into the cranial bones as

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.040 
to go straight into the cranial bones as
well<00:00:17.699> as<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.940> facial<00:00:18.270> bones<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.750> skull

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
well as the facial bones the skull

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.370 
well as the facial bones the skull
basically<00:00:21.289> well<00:00:22.289> we<00:00:23.130> have<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:24.300> bones<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:25.260> our

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
basically well we have the bones in our

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.820 
basically well we have the bones in our
body<00:00:25.490> then<00:00:26.490> that's<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.910> skeletal<00:00:27.390> system<00:00:27.830> and

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
body then that's the skeletal system and

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.970 
body then that's the skeletal system and
when<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.640> start<00:00:30.150> looking<00:00:30.300> at<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.750> bones<00:00:30.980> our

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
when we start looking at the bones our

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.310 
when we start looking at the bones our
first<00:00:32.369> differentiation<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.540> between<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
first differentiation is between the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.790 
first differentiation is between the
axial<00:00:35.090> skeletal<00:00:36.090> system<00:00:36.600> or<00:00:36.960> skeleton<00:00:37.620> and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
axial skeletal system or skeleton and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.540 
axial skeletal system or skeleton and
the<00:00:38.010> appendicular<00:00:38.809> skeleton<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.290> here<00:00:41.280> it's

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the appendicular skeleton and here it's

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.430 
the appendicular skeleton and here it's
kinda<00:00:41.910> nice<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.300> way<00:00:42.420> they<00:00:42.570> draw<00:00:43.020> here<00:00:43.320> you

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
kinda nice the way they draw here you

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.700 
kinda nice the way they draw here you
can<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.920> bluish<00:00:44.280> part<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.899> axial

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
can have the bluish part is the axial

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.410 
can have the bluish part is the axial
skeleton<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:49.850> brownish<00:00:50.850> beige<00:00:51.180> each

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
skeleton and the brownish beige each

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.650 
skeleton and the brownish beige each
part<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.140> appendicular<00:00:53.010> skeleton<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
part is the appendicular skeleton so the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.709 
part is the appendicular skeleton so the
axial<00:00:55.199> skeleton<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.250> axis<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.360> us

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
axial skeleton is like the axis of us

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.200 
axial skeleton is like the axis of us
the<00:00:58.050> center<00:00:58.469> part<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.100> includes<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
the center part so that includes the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.529 
the center part so that includes the
skull<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.170> too<00:01:01.500> little<00:01:02.010> ear<00:01:02.219> bones<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
skull is too little ear bones in it the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.250 
skull is too little ear bones in it the
hyoid<00:01:03.780> bone<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> front<00:01:05.479> of<00:01:06.479> us<00:01:06.720> right<00:01:06.750> in

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
hyoid bone in the front of us right in

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.850 
hyoid bone in the front of us right in
here<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:09.119> chest<00:01:09.540> plate<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> ribs<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
here the chest plate and the ribs the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.530 
here the chest plate and the ribs the
sternum<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> chest<00:01:11.670> plate<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.150> makes

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
sternum is the chest plate so that makes

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.580 
sternum is the chest plate so that makes
also<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> thoracic<00:01:13.439> change<00:01:13.979> that's<00:01:14.340> also<00:01:14.760> axial

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
also a thoracic change that's also axial

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.649 
also a thoracic change that's also axial
skeleton<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.770> then<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.580> Retiro<00:01:17.850> column<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
skeleton and then the Retiro column and

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.770 
skeleton and then the Retiro column and
that<00:01:18.840> includes<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.439> sacrum<00:01:19.950> which<00:01:20.600> is<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
that includes the sacrum which is the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.450 
that includes the sacrum which is the
lowest<00:01:22.140> part<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:23.009> spine<00:01:23.630> and<00:01:25.220> that's<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
lowest part of the spine and that's the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.249 
lowest part of the spine and that's the
axial<00:01:26.820> skeleton<00:01:27.330> right<00:01:27.509> there<00:01:27.780> then

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
axial skeleton right there then

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.160 
axial skeleton right there then
everything<00:01:28.439> that's<00:01:28.710> attached<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:30.299> axial

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
everything that's attached to this axial

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.760 
everything that's attached to this axial
piece<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.579> are<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.060> appendages<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.140> they

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
piece is the are the appendages and they

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.399 
piece is the are the appendages and they
make<00:01:34.950> up<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.400> appendicular<00:01:36.200> skeleton<00:01:37.200> so

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
make up the appendicular skeleton so

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.050 
make up the appendicular skeleton so
those<00:01:37.590> are<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> upper<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.700> lower

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
those are the upper and lower

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.390 
those are the upper and lower
extremities

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
extremities

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.770 
extremities
so<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> upper<00:01:41.790> extremity<00:01:42.240> includes<00:01:42.570> this

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
so the upper extremity includes this

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.850 
so the upper extremity includes this
pectoral<00:01:43.470> girdle<00:01:44.329> if<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.509> go<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.590> gym<00:01:46.829> you

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
pectoral girdle if you go to the gym you

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.249 
pectoral girdle if you go to the gym you
have<00:01:47.040> these<00:01:47.399> buff<00:01:47.670> guys<00:01:47.939> they<00:01:48.240> work<00:01:48.450> out<00:01:48.659> all

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
have these buff guys they work out all

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.109 
have these buff guys they work out all
these<00:01:49.470> muscles<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.130> front<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.670> man-boob

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
these muscles in the front and man-boob

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.080 
these muscles in the front and man-boob
muscles<00:01:51.600> sorta<00:01:51.979> that's<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.189> pectoral<00:01:53.970> area

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
muscles sorta that's the pectoral area

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.370 
muscles sorta that's the pectoral area
so<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> pectoral<00:01:55.500> girl<00:01:56.810> speaks<00:01:57.810> over<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
so the pectoral girl speaks over to the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.260 
so the pectoral girl speaks over to the
shoulder

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
shoulder

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.940 
shoulder
including<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.450> scapula<00:02:01.079> as<00:02:01.380> well<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:01.799> this

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
including the scapula as well as this

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.010 
including the scapula as well as this
clavicle<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.820> scapula<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.689> shoulder

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
clavicle the scapula is the shoulder

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.410 
clavicle the scapula is the shoulder
blade<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.979> clavicle<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.670> collarbone

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
blade and the clavicle is the collarbone

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.260 
blade and the clavicle is the collarbone
they<00:02:07.380> attached<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.340> upper<00:02:08.670> extremities

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
they attached and the upper extremities

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.080 
they attached and the upper extremities
to<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.929> actual<00:02:10.229> skeleton<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.819> upper

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
to the actual skeleton and so the upper

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.080 
to the actual skeleton and so the upper
arm<00:02:12.270> bones<00:02:12.569> too

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
arm bones too

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.140 
arm bones too
recent<00:02:13.660> afford<00:02:14.050> Iran<00:02:14.290> bolster<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.790> radius

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
recent afford Iran bolster the radius

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.830 
recent afford Iran bolster the radius
and<00:02:16.300> they<00:02:16.390> are<00:02:16.510> not<00:02:16.750> they<00:02:17.050> are<00:02:18.060> AB<00:02:19.060> colliculus

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
and they are not they are AB colliculus

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.259 
built or so is our list and the hand and
fingers<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.670> then<00:02:24.670> in<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.120> lower

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
fingers and then in the lower

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.320 
fingers and then in the lower
extremities<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:25.930> have<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:26.170> pelvic<00:02:26.560> girdle

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
extremities you have the pelvic girdle

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.360 
extremities you have the pelvic girdle
and<00:02:28.330> that's<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:28.750> pelvis<00:02:29.260> that<00:02:29.650> pelvis<00:02:30.190> in

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
and that's the pelvis that pelvis in

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.339 
and that's the pelvis that pelvis in
itself<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:31.030> made<00:02:31.239> up<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.569> three<00:02:31.810> bones<00:02:32.019> called

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
itself is made up of three bones called

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.150 
itself is made up of three bones called
the<00:02:32.470> ilium<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.069> ischium<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.180> pubis<00:02:35.160> they

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
the ilium the ischium and the pubis they

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.400 
the ilium the ischium and the pubis they
are<00:02:36.220> fused<00:02:36.519> together<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:37.239> when<00:02:37.989> you<00:02:38.140> see<00:02:38.379> a

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
are fused together so when you see a

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.720 
are fused together so when you see a
pelvis<00:02:38.920> it's<00:02:39.069> one<00:02:39.250> bone<00:02:39.519> but<00:02:39.819> in<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.090> in<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:41.730> fetus

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
pelvis it's one bone but in a in a fetus

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.699 
pelvis it's one bone but in a in a fetus
david<00:02:43.360> start<00:02:43.750> as<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.500> three<00:02:44.680> bowls<00:02:44.950> in<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:46.709> that

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
david start as a three bowls in and that

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.880 
david start as a three bowls in and that
pelvis<00:02:48.310> right<00:02:48.549> here<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:50.170> connects<00:02:50.799> the

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
pelvis right here that connects the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.580 
pelvis right here that connects the
sacrum<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.549> then<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.630> upper<00:02:53.110> thigh<00:02:53.319> bone

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
sacrum to then the upper thigh bone

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.190 
sacrum to then the upper thigh bone
which<00:02:54.250> is<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.430> femur<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.060> then<00:02:55.720> we<00:02:55.840> have<00:02:55.989> to

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
which is the femur and then we have to

appendicular skeleton so to review here
the<00:03:13.720> axial<00:03:14.200> skeleton<00:03:14.319> is<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:14.980> core<00:03:15.340> the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
the axial skeleton is the core the

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.289 
the axial skeleton is the core the
central<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.799> appendicular<00:03:18.299> skeletal

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
central and the appendicular skeletal

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.870 
central and the appendicular skeletal
are<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.870> appendages<00:03:20.590> what<00:03:21.069> it<00:03:21.190> needs<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.639> be

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
are the appendages what it needs to be

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.960 
are the appendages what it needs to be
pay<00:03:22.630> attention<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:23.290> is<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.340> shoulder

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
pay attention to is that the shoulder

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.960 
pay attention to is that the shoulder
