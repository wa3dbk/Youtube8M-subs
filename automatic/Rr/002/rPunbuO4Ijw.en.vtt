00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.490 
one of the first things I teach my
goalies<00:00:03.899> is<00:00:04.490> how<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.549> maintain<00:00:06.290> the<00:00:07.290> goal

stick to stay in front of you this is

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.379 
stick to stay in front of you this is
very<00:00:12.000> crucial<00:00:13.400> the<00:00:14.400> very<00:00:14.639> actually<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.299> the

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
very crucial the very actually it's the

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.400 
very crucial the very actually it's the
most<00:00:15.599> important<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.680> all<00:00:18.050> technical<00:00:19.050> things

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
most important of all technical things

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.500 
most important of all technical things
that<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> goalie<00:00:19.859> should<00:00:20.160> do<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:21.119> keep<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
that a goalie should do is to keep the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.390 
that a goalie should do is to keep the
stick<00:00:21.779> always<00:00:22.140> flat<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:22.890> front<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.279> you

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
stick always flat and in front of you

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.870 
stick always flat and in front of you
and<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.510> reason<00:00:24.810> being<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.289> it's<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:26.160> it's<00:00:26.789> a

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
and the reason being is it's a it's a

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.240 
and the reason being is it's a it's a
progressive<00:00:27.300> stage<00:00:27.779> if<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.830> stick<00:00:29.099> is

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
progressive stage if this stick is

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.519 
progressive stage if this stick is
flattened<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.880> front<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.330> here<00:00:30.660> that

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
flattened in front of you here that

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.290 
flattened in front of you here that
means<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.099> your<00:00:32.219> hands<00:00:32.700> are<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:33.120> good

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
means that your hands are in good

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.120 
means that your hands are in good
position<00:00:33.870> here<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.469> means<00:00:34.620> you're<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:34.920> good

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
position here that means you're in good

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.670 
position here that means you're in good
balanced<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.850> posture<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.960> also<00:00:37.079> means<00:00:37.440> that

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
balanced and posture it also means that

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.940 
balanced and posture it also means that
your<00:00:37.770> shoulders<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.340> square<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.450> shooter

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
your shoulders are square to the shooter

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.330 
your shoulders are square to the shooter
and<00:00:40.950> your<00:00:41.250> legs<00:00:41.460> will<00:00:42.300> be<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.629> good<00:00:42.780> position

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
and your legs will be in a good position

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.880 
and your legs will be in a good position
if<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.879> shooter<00:00:45.660> were<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.989> move<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.620> this

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
if this shooter were to move in this

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.209 
if this shooter were to move in this
direction<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.520> way<00:00:48.079> then<00:00:49.079> all<00:00:49.289> he<00:00:49.559> Luongo

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
direction this way then all he Luongo

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.950 
direction this way then all he Luongo
has<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.520> do<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.850> bring<00:00:51.059> his<00:00:51.239> stick<00:00:51.539> with<00:00:51.750> him

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
has to do is bring his stick with him

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.930 
has to do is bring his stick with him
and<00:00:52.500> when<00:00:52.829> he<00:00:52.860> brings<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.370> stick<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.760> him

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
and when he brings to stick with him

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.080 
and when he brings to stick with him
what<00:00:54.510> follows<00:00:55.020> everything<00:00:55.920> his<00:00:56.190> hands<00:00:56.760> will

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
what follows everything his hands will

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.900 
what follows everything his hands will
follow<00:00:57.390> his<00:00:58.260> shoulders<00:00:58.739> will<00:00:59.190> follow<00:00:59.520> and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
follow his shoulders will follow and

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.610 
follow his shoulders will follow and
then<00:00:59.940> again<00:01:00.750> he'll<00:01:00.989> be<00:01:01.109> squared<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
then again he'll be squared to the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.439 
then again he'll be squared to the
shooter<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.399> shooter<00:01:02.879> brings<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.270> puck

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
shooter if the shooter brings the puck

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.020 
shooter if the shooter brings the puck
into<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.780> area<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.519> same<00:01:05.519> thing<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
into this area and same thing if the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.820 
into this area and same thing if the
shooter<00:01:06.299> moves<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.900> direction<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:07.680> with

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
shooter moves this direction here with

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.760 
shooter moves this direction here with
the<00:01:07.950> puck<00:01:08.159> all<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:09.210> goalies<00:01:09.930> have<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.320> do<00:01:10.500> is

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the puck all the goalies have to do is

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.770 
the puck all the goalies have to do is
what<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.100> teach<00:01:11.310> my<00:01:11.549> goalies<00:01:11.909> they<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.659> have

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
what I teach my goalies they just have

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.170 
what I teach my goalies they just have
to<00:01:12.900> bring<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> stick<00:01:13.439> with<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.920> puck<00:01:14.180> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
to bring the stick with the puck the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.510 
to bring the stick with the puck the
hands<00:01:15.570> will<00:01:15.750> follow<00:01:16.110> they'll<00:01:17.040> be<00:01:17.100> square<00:01:17.490> to

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
hands will follow they'll be square to

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.010 
hands will follow they'll be square to
the<00:01:17.640> shooter<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.150> then<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.390> course<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the shooter and then of course the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.570 
the shooter and then of course the
progression<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> shoulders<00:01:20.130> will<00:01:20.310> follow

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
progression the shoulders will follow

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.609 
progression the shoulders will follow
and<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.659> legs<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.200> go<00:01:22.350> into<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
and then the legs just go into a

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.100 
and then the legs just go into a
butterfly<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.150> first<00:01:24.540> thing

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
butterfly and this is the first thing

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.410 
butterfly and this is the first thing
that<00:01:25.259> every<00:01:25.619> goalie<00:01:25.830> should<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.250> taught<00:01:26.460> every

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
that every goalie should be taught every

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.910 
that every goalie should be taught every
NHL<00:01:27.630> goalie<00:01:28.170> should<00:01:28.530> be<00:01:28.619> working<00:01:29.009> on<00:01:29.159> this

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
NHL goalie should be working on this

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.499 
NHL goalie should be working on this
this<00:01:31.920> technique<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> most<00:01:33.000> important

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
this technique it's the most important

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.289 
this technique it's the most important
but<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.750> find<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.520> nine<00:01:35.520> out<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.759> 10<00:01:35.970> NHL

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
but I find that nine out of 10 NHL

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.990 
but I find that nine out of 10 NHL
goalies<00:01:36.810> don't<00:01:37.110> do<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.590> as<00:01:38.460> you're<00:01:38.700> about<00:01:38.939> to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
goalies don't do this as you're about to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.390 
goalies don't do this as you're about to
see<00:01:39.290> for<00:01:40.290> some<00:01:40.470> reason<00:01:40.860> they<00:01:40.979> think<00:01:41.280> it's

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
see for some reason they think it's

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.310 
see for some reason they think it's
faster<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.939> move<00:01:42.299> their<00:01:42.540> left<00:01:42.750> side<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
faster to move their left side to the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.280 
faster to move their left side to the
puck<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.920> leave<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.790> right<00:01:45.210> side<00:01:45.509> over<00:01:45.930> here

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
puck and leave the right side over here

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.370 
puck and leave the right side over here
or<00:01:46.470> even<00:01:47.040> move<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.579> right<00:01:47.729> side<00:01:48.030> as<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.140> can

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
or even move the right side as you can

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.069 
or even move the right side as you can
see<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:49.920> he<00:01:50.399> moves<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.850> whole<00:01:51.060> stick<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.960> if

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
see here he moves this whole stick so if

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.080 
see here he moves this whole stick so if
we<00:01:52.110> quickly<00:01:52.439> just<00:01:52.740> rewind<00:01:53.130> here<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.610> split

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
we quickly just rewind here a split

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.709 
we quickly just rewind here a split
second<00:01:54.860> we'll<00:01:55.860> see<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.159> very<00:01:56.850> obvious<00:01:57.119> again

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
second we'll see it very obvious again

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.370 
second we'll see it very obvious again
that<00:01:58.619> what<00:01:59.100> he<00:01:59.130> does<00:01:59.399> here<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.759> wrong<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.380> here

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
that what he does here is wrong and here

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.160 
that what he does here is wrong and here
it<00:02:01.469> comes<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.700> again<00:02:03.000> his<00:02:03.360> stick<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.810> where<00:02:04.079> it

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
it comes so again his stick is where it

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.660 
it comes so again his stick is where it
should<00:02:04.229> be<00:02:04.880> where<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.969> should<00:02:06.180> be<00:02:06.229> but<00:02:07.229> then

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
should be where it should be but then

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.820 
should be where it should be but then
look<00:02:08.670> what<00:02:08.729> happens<00:02:08.879> for<00:02:09.690> some<00:02:09.899> reason<00:02:10.289> he

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
look what happens for some reason he

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.460 
look what happens for some reason he
throws<00:02:11.129> his<00:02:11.370> left<00:02:11.640> leg<00:02:11.819> out<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.330> his<00:02:12.599> left<00:02:12.810> arm

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
throws his left leg out and his left arm

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.040 
throws his left leg out and his left arm
but<00:02:14.130> for<00:02:14.340> some<00:02:14.520> reason<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.030> stick<00:02:15.360> has<00:02:15.750> left

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
but for some reason the stick has left

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.100 
but for some reason the stick has left
the<00:02:16.170> front<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.850> has<00:02:18.300> moved<00:02:18.570> over<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.960> this

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
the front and has moved over to this

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.320 
the front and has moved over to this
location<00:02:19.500> now<00:02:20.460> this<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.880> very<00:02:21.090> bizarre

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
location now this is a very bizarre

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.300 
location now this is a very bizarre
concept<00:02:21.960> to<00:02:22.140> me<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.530> makes<00:02:22.680> absolutely<00:02:23.220> no

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
concept to me and it makes absolutely no

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.520 
concept to me and it makes absolutely no
sense<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.850> its<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.030> wrong<00:02:24.300> completely<00:02:24.840> wrong

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
sense in its a wrong completely wrong

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.610 
sense in its a wrong completely wrong
maneuver<00:02:26.040> by<00:02:26.730> moving<00:02:27.030> his<00:02:27.180> right<00:02:27.540> side<00:02:27.870> lwanga

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
maneuver by moving his right side lwanga

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.060 
maneuver by moving his right side lwanga
moving<00:02:28.920> his<00:02:29.100> right<00:02:29.370> arm<00:02:29.610> out<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.060> way

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
moving his right arm out of the way

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.350 
moving his right arm out of the way
what's<00:02:32.070> happening<00:02:32.490> is<00:02:32.580> as<00:02:32.730> part<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.300> a

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
what's happening is as part of this a

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.810 
what's happening is as part of this a
momentum<00:02:33.960> is<00:02:34.080> going<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.680> right<00:02:34.980> even

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
momentum is going to the right even

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.970 
momentum is going to the right even
though<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.120> puck<00:02:36.360> has<00:02:36.600> clearly<00:02:36.990> gone<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.860> the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
though the puck has clearly gone to the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.460 
though the puck has clearly gone to the
left<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:39.030> now<00:02:39.180> what's<00:02:39.420> happening<00:02:39.900> your<00:02:40.260> body

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
left so now what's happening your body

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.350 
left so now what's happening your body
obviously<00:02:40.710> has<00:02:41.160> two<00:02:41.370> sides<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.880> has<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:42.030> left

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
obviously has two sides it has a left

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.360 
obviously has two sides it has a left
and<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.600> right<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:43.380> by<00:02:43.560> moving<00:02:43.770> your<00:02:44.070> right<00:02:44.130> side

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
and a right so by moving your right side

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.850 
and a right so by moving your right side
the<00:02:45.270> opposite<00:02:45.930> direction<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.650> puck

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
the opposite direction of the puck

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.400 
the opposite direction of the puck
direction<00:02:47.760> you're<00:02:48.360> fighting<00:02:48.959> your<00:02:49.110> right

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
direction you're fighting your right

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.680 
direction you're fighting your right
side<00:02:49.709> muscles<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:50.850> now<00:02:51.000> you've<00:02:51.209> got<00:02:51.390> tension

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
side muscles so now you've got tension

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.480 
side muscles so now you've got tension
between<00:02:52.170> your<00:02:52.380> left<00:02:52.590> side<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.100> your<00:02:53.310> right

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
between your left side and your right

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.850 
between your left side and your right
side<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.600> only<00:02:54.780> tells<00:02:55.110> me<00:02:55.590> one<00:02:55.830> thing

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
side and that only tells me one thing

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.550 
side and that only tells me one thing
that<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.910> aren't<00:02:57.270> able<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.600> stretch<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:58.110> as

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
that you aren't able to stretch a as

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.830 
that you aren't able to stretch a as
fast<00:02:58.980> be<00:02:59.670> as<00:03:00.000> far<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.470> direction<00:03:02.300> if<00:03:03.300> he

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
fast be as far to that direction if he

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.160 
fast be as far to that direction if he
had<00:03:04.020> brought<00:03:04.320> this<00:03:04.830> stick<00:03:05.160> here<00:03:05.580> with<00:03:06.510> him<00:03:06.840> to

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
had brought this stick here with him to

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.530 
had brought this stick here with him to
this<00:03:07.320> direction<00:03:07.740> it's<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.790> same<00:03:09.090> speed<00:03:09.510> in

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
this direction it's the same speed in

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.810 
this direction it's the same speed in
fact<00:03:09.990> it<00:03:10.170> moves<00:03:10.500> your<00:03:10.680> body<00:03:10.860> faster<00:03:11.280> because

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
fact it moves your body faster because

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.000 
fact it moves your body faster because
your<00:03:12.120> muscles<00:03:12.330> aren't<00:03:12.750> fighting<00:03:13.470> against

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
your muscles aren't fighting against

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.190 
your muscles aren't fighting against
each<00:03:14.100> other<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.970> this<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:15.300> a<00:03:15.330> completely<00:03:15.840> wrong

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
each other so this is a completely wrong

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.680 
each other so this is a completely wrong
maneuver<00:03:16.770> and<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:18.150> course<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.570> most

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
maneuver and of course the most

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.140 
maneuver and of course the most
important<00:03:19.260> part<00:03:19.470> what<00:03:20.160> happens<00:03:20.519> here<00:03:20.820> what's

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
important part what happens here what's

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.780 
important part what happens here what's
this<00:03:21.330> this<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.470> huge<00:03:22.620> opening<00:03:23.400> this<00:03:23.519> is<00:03:23.580> the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
this this is a huge opening this is the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.850 
this this is a huge opening this is the
five<00:03:24.030> hole<00:03:24.300> because<00:03:24.930> he's<00:03:25.050> removed<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.590> stick

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
five hole because he's removed a stick

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.740 
five hole because he's removed a stick
so<00:03:26.489> he's<00:03:26.700> done<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:26.910> bunch<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.360> things<00:03:27.570> wrong

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
so he's done a bunch of things wrong

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.400 
so he's done a bunch of things wrong
here<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.580> end<00:03:29.850> result<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.570> he<00:03:30.930> left<00:03:31.200> his

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
here and the end result is he left his

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.460 
here and the end result is he left his
whole<00:03:31.620> legs<00:03:31.830> open<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.900> puck<00:03:34.080> just<00:03:34.110> went

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
whole legs open and the puck just went

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.140 
whole legs open and the puck just went
through<00:03:34.620> his<00:03:34.709> legs<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.010> in<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.400> again<00:03:35.910> look

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
through his legs and in and again look

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.650 
through his legs and in and again look
at<00:03:36.300> his<00:03:36.390> arm<00:03:36.570> way<00:03:36.870> back<00:03:37.080> here<00:03:37.470> this<00:03:38.100> is

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
at his arm way back here this is

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.030 
at his arm way back here this is
actually<00:03:39.660> doing<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.050> complete<00:03:40.350> opposite<00:03:40.980> of

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
actually doing the complete opposite of

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.699 
actually doing the complete opposite of
he<00:03:41.220> wants<00:03:41.489> of<00:03:42.030> what<00:03:42.269> he<00:03:42.900> wants<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.260> do<00:03:43.470> and

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
he wants of what he wants to do and

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.070 
he wants of what he wants to do and
that's<00:03:44.160> get<00:03:44.430> speed<00:03:44.760> of<00:03:44.910> momentum<00:03:45.390> so<00:03:45.930> by

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
that's get speed of momentum so by

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.170 
that's get speed of momentum so by
throwing<00:03:46.380> his<00:03:46.799> right<00:03:47.070> side<00:03:47.340> away<00:03:47.640> from<00:03:47.910> the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
throwing his right side away from the

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.430 
throwing his right side away from the
puck<00:03:48.420> he's<00:03:49.200> actually<00:03:49.440> counter<00:03:50.430> productive<00:03:51.440> it

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
puck he's actually counter productive it

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.900 
puck he's actually counter productive it
makes<00:03:52.620> no<00:03:52.709> sense<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.130> me<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.519> it's<00:03:53.610> it's
