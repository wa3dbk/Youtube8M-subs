00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
about five minutes to go so it's a

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.480 
about five minutes to go so it's a
pretty<00:00:22.109> big<00:00:22.289> deficit<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.220> game<00:00:23.369> was

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
pretty big deficit and the game was

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.740 
pretty big deficit and the game was
already<00:00:23.580> halfway<00:00:23.820> over<00:00:24.090> they<00:00:24.449> already<00:00:24.570> had

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
already halfway over they already had

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.480 
already halfway over they already had
orbitals<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.740> know<00:00:25.830> they're<00:00:26.010> like<00:00:26.039> 30

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
orbitals and you know they're like 30

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.310 
orbitals and you know they're like 30
kills<00:00:26.760> or<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.029> when<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.269> all<00:00:27.390> joined<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.230> we

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
kills or so when we all joined and we

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.540 
kills or so when we all joined and we
end<00:00:28.439> up<00:00:28.529> coming<00:00:28.800> back<00:00:28.920> at<00:00:29.099> winning<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.400> game

hard or whatever and I ended up dropping
nuclear<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:03.960> them<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.829> was<00:02:04.920> pretty<00:02:05.070> cool

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
nuclear on them so that was pretty cool

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.469 
nuclear on them so that was pretty cool
and<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.640> was<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.030> was<00:02:06.119> kind<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.299> like<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
and it was like it was kind of like the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.880 
and it was like it was kind of like the
opposite<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.990> what<00:02:07.170> usually<00:02:07.320> like<00:02:07.649> usually

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890
