circle<00:01:37.369> now<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.430> can<00:01:38.610> pop<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> device<00:01:39.119> into

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
circle now you can pop the device into

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.749 
circle now you can pop the device into
the<00:01:39.390> wristband<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.200> wearing<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.280> wristband

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the wristband and wearing the wristband

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.240 
the wristband and wearing the wristband
is<00:01:42.000> fairly<00:01:42.479> simplistic<00:01:42.899> once<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:43.979> put<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.189> in

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
is fairly simplistic once you put it in

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.160 
is fairly simplistic once you put it in
the<00:01:44.340> wristband<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.820> get<00:01:45.000> additional<00:01:45.570> levels

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
the wristband you get additional levels

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.300 
the wristband you get additional levels
of<00:01:46.380> protection<00:01:46.530> from<00:01:48.380> water<00:01:49.380> etc<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.100> can

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
of protection from water etc so you can

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.590
