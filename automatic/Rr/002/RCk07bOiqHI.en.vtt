00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.560
 hello the purpose of the author of the march 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:32.230
 slow is to control the engine speed that 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.960
 depending on engine load 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.610
 it will increase or decrease the passage 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.739
 to the intake manifold of the 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.860
 engine has two 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.649
 coils or one will advance the 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.870
 shutter and the other will 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.199
 so before starting any 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:57.239
 test is important to identify the mos 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:01:01.359
 which the system a actuator belongs to 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.000
 system gave fai the ring order 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.239
 he lies in chaos as you can 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.239
 observe 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:16.270
 already the system marelli the ring order 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:21.190
 he is leaning against the seal of the flap 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.800
 and here we can observe the 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.479
 difference in the system gave father to 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.479
 marelli system 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:43.510
 after the identification of the systems 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:47.520
 let's test the marelli system enter 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.750
 the probes on pins 1 and 4 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.820
 resistance must be around the 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:57.910
 50 years now to test the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.550
 resistance of the second coil is still 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:04.530
 marelli system insert the tips of 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:08.170
 proof on pins 2 and 3 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.179
 the resistance should be around 50 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.330
 11 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.330
 already in the system gave fai insert the tips 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.209
 testing of pins 1 and 2 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.220
 the resistance obtained must be around 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:26.650
 50 years still system I said let's go 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.080
 now test the second coil or 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.240
 at 3 and 4 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.770
 the existence obtained must be around 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.770
 of 50 ons 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.340
 now we will install a system actuator 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:50.530
 gave fai retreat to all the old and install 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.600
 the new and connect the whip only 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.820
 start the engine and wait for 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.540
 stabilization of the idle speed for up to 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.540
 five minutes 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.520
 now we will install a system actuator 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:14.700
 marelli remove the old actuator is there 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:17.190
 new actuator and connect the alloy lash 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.190
 ignition without starting the engine and 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.319
 wait 15 seconds 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.280
 turn off ignition and wait another 15 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.550
 seconds 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.980
 if you do the procedure to the letter not 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.690
 it will work 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.690
 made this starting in the engine 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:42.230
 and wait for up to five minutes to 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:44.750
 idle stabilization at ds 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.540
 provides an information 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.540
 Actuator idle and remember not 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.000
 always the oscillation is caused by the actor 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.090
 There are other sensors that contributes 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.300
 directly to a slow idle 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.600
 perfect 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.630
 before you apply or purchase an actuator 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:09.410
 ds see the application in the catalog 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:12.170
 on www.br.com.br and remember to follow 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:16.010
 themselves on social networks refer to our 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:20.710
 news tips make sure you start 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.710
