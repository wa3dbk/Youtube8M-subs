00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.050 

flip<00:02:50.790> them<00:02:50.970> all<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.599> way<00:02:51.720> up<00:02:51.840> like<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.260> and

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
flip them all the way up like that and

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.440 
flip them all the way up like that and
then<00:02:54.060> flip<00:02:54.359> the<00:02:54.510> gorilla<00:02:54.750> head<00:02:54.959> down<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:56.450> flip

then flip the gorilla head down and flip

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.710 
then flip the gorilla head down and flip
the<00:02:58.730> grey<00:02:59.730> section<00:03:00.090> that's<00:03:00.389> behind<00:03:00.599> the

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
gorilla head up and that will allow the

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.159 
gorilla head up and that will allow the
arms<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.359> come<00:03:03.659> together<00:03:05.540> flip<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.750> down<00:03:07.019> to

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
arms to come together flip that down to

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.699 
arms to come together flip that down to
form<00:03:07.379> the<00:03:07.439> butt<00:03:08.120> flip<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:09.450> up<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:10.109> out<00:03:10.560> of

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
form the butt flip this up and out of

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.069 
form the butt flip this up and out of
the<00:03:10.799> way<00:03:10.980> rotate<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:11.909> whole<00:03:12.150> section<00:03:12.780> around

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
the way rotate this whole section around

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.599 
the way rotate this whole section around
and<00:03:14.010> then<00:03:14.159> while<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.639> do<00:03:14.879> that<00:03:15.290> open<00:03:16.290> up<00:03:16.609> this

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
and then while you do that open up this

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.809 
and then while you do that open up this
intersection<00:03:18.919> geez<00:03:19.919> this<00:03:20.189> is<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.340> lot<00:03:20.579> harder

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
intersection geez this is a lot harder

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:21.860 
intersection geez this is a lot harder
than<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.180> looks

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
than it looks

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.819 
than it looks
because<00:03:22.829> there's<00:03:23.069> a<00:03:23.129> head<00:03:23.430> in<00:03:23.459> there<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.650> just

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
because there's a head in there and just

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.729 
because there's a head in there and just
getting<00:03:26.129> everything<00:03:26.489> out<00:03:26.849> of<00:03:26.909> the<00:03:27.150> way<00:03:27.650> so<00:03:28.650> you

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
getting everything out of the way so you

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.149 
getting everything out of the way so you
can<00:03:29.040> clear<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:30.290> section<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.379> fold<00:03:31.620> over<00:03:31.979> is

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
can clear the section to fold over is

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.330 
can clear the section to fold over is
the<00:03:32.370> hardest<00:03:32.760> part<00:03:33.290> then<00:03:34.290> you're<00:03:34.829> supposed<00:03:35.010> to

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
the hardest part then you're supposed to

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.309 
the hardest part then you're supposed to
be<00:03:35.459> able<00:03:35.609> to<00:03:36.500> open<00:03:37.500> up<00:03:38.090> this<00:03:39.090> section<00:03:39.479> here<00:03:40.079> to

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
be able to open up this section here to

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.140 
be able to open up this section here to
flip<00:03:40.560> out<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.859> head<00:03:41.069> I'm<00:03:41.669> going<00:03:41.819> to<00:03:41.879> reverse

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
flip out the head I'm going to reverse

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.759 
flip out the head I'm going to reverse
the<00:03:42.359> transformation<00:03:42.659> a<00:03:43.109> little<00:03:43.349> bit<00:03:43.470> so<00:03:43.650> we

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
the transformation a little bit so we

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.800 
the transformation a little bit so we
can<00:03:43.889> get<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.129> head<00:03:44.370> exposed<00:03:44.819> open<00:03:45.690> that

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
can get the head exposed open that

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.860 
can get the head exposed open that
section<00:03:46.169> up<00:03:46.379> flip<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.879> silverback<00:03:48.569> part

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
section up flip the silverback part

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.110 
section up flip the silverback part
around<00:03:49.280> fold<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.400> section<00:03:50.879> that<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.030> was

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
around fold that section that I was

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.789 
around fold that section that I was
talking<00:03:51.299> about<00:03:51.449> earlier<00:03:51.569> down<00:03:52.229> and<00:03:52.620> pick<00:03:52.769> it

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
talking about earlier down and pick it

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.640 
talking about earlier down and pick it
into<00:03:53.069> place<00:03:53.389> and<00:03:54.389> then<00:03:54.479> just<00:03:54.840> start<00:03:55.109> fiddling

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
into place and then just start fiddling

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.229 
into place and then just start fiddling
around<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.159> getting<00:03:56.310> everything<00:03:56.609> situated

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
around and getting everything situated

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.920 
around and getting everything situated
and<00:03:58.459> that's<00:03:59.459> it<00:03:59.669> even<00:04:00.510> though<00:04:00.599> that<00:04:00.629> is<00:04:00.900> a

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
and that's it even though that is a

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.000 
and that's it even though that is a
little<00:04:01.229> bit<00:04:01.379> hairier<00:04:01.799> than<00:04:01.859> it<00:04:02.129> should<00:04:02.340> be<00:04:04.010> now

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
little bit hairier than it should be now

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.159 
little bit hairier than it should be now
this<00:04:05.220> is<00:04:05.370> where<00:04:05.519> I<00:04:05.549> think<00:04:06.090> they<00:04:06.329> nailed<00:04:06.840> the

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
this is where I think they nailed the

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:08.839 
this is where I think they nailed the
look<00:04:07.560> of<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.829> figure<00:04:08.129> this<00:04:08.430> looks<00:04:08.699> like

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
look of the figure this looks like

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.229 
look of the figure this looks like
Optimus<00:04:09.299> Primal<00:04:09.629> should<00:04:10.079> he<00:04:10.889> has<00:04:11.189> a<00:04:11.489> bit<00:04:11.909> of<00:04:12.150> a

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
Optimus Primal should he has a bit of a

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.050 
Optimus Primal should he has a bit of a
backpack<00:04:12.659> going<00:04:13.290> but<00:04:13.859> I<00:04:14.069> can<00:04:14.340> forgive<00:04:14.759> that

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
backpack going but I can forgive that

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.270 
backpack going but I can forgive that
given<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.049> overall<00:04:16.470> look<00:04:16.680> of<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:16.889> robot

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
given that the overall look of the robot

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.969 
given that the overall look of the robot
mode<00:04:17.430> is<00:04:17.639> excellent<00:04:18.599> it<00:04:19.109> got<00:04:19.349> it<00:04:19.620> has<00:04:19.769> all<00:04:19.949> of

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.060 
his colour schemes and it just works
well<00:04:22.530> it's<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.699> very<00:04:23.970> nice<00:04:24.449> figure<00:04:24.990> in<00:04:25.380> robot

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
well it's a very nice figure in robot

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.310 
well it's a very nice figure in robot
mode<00:04:26.099> Plus<00:04:27.060> that<00:04:27.300> head<00:04:27.539> sculpt<00:04:27.960> is<00:04:28.080> just
