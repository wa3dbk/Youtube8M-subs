 that will effectively be the old one in the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.490
 doctor strange movie happening to

 refutes official title of Green Lantern 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.710
 which becomes stronger rumors 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.350
 that we're going to see hal jordan ya jon 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.150
 stewart in the same movie also 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.950
 for all those who followed the series 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.630
 TV show from Konstantin 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.450
 there is a possibility that this 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.820
 alive character within an episode of 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.709
 the television series of arrow before its 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.080
 cancellation had already been heard the 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.090
 interest in making a crossover between 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.220
 I ate it with the actors 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.680
 they answered the question if still 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.050
 there is a possibility that constantin 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.790
 live in the universe of arrow above all 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.530
 because in this fourth season there will be 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.840
 more mysticism with the introduction of 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.520
 new villain damián dark to what 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.620
 they answered if we really want 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.450
 doing it is something we've talked about 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.490
 with a says and it's a matter of 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.320
 policy but also from the agenda of 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.870
 actor we are trying to fix it 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.510
 but we do not know if it is 100% sure that 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.120
 happen while this happens the channel if 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.890
 double launches the first trailer of its 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.540
 animated series the big set although the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.370
 plot is still a mystery is a 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.640
 very good introduction to the powers of 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.130
 The character also includes flash hoop and 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.130
 the dubbing is made by stephen gamer 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.650
 and great hosting so it's amazing and of 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.709
 this way we're not going to rule out the 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.110
 possibility that vick will make his 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.390
 crossover with a real character inside 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.650
 of these series the dennis lady actor who 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.330
 it's gwen stacy's dad in the 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.190
 movies of the amazing spiderman 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.500
 offered details about an idea for the 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.090
 third movie where Peter used 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.830
 a formula to regenerate all 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.810
 those people who had 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.910
 and there was a discussion if his character 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.100
 was going to be resurrected the question is 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.400
 Peter would have used it to revive 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.010
 to gwen stacy or even to uncle ben this 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.870
 I would have brought an element from the comics 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.720
 that all those characters that die 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.370
 at some point they come back to life with 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.440
 this ends the program but I have some

 apparently if we finally answered the 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.449
 8 ball or 8 big ball or 8 big ball
