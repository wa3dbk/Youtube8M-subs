so<00:00:00.599> in<00:00:01.260> the<00:00:01.439> last<00:00:01.680> video<00:00:02.100> we<00:00:03.060> talked<00:00:03.720> about

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
so in the last video we talked about

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.130 
so in the last video we talked about
changing<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:05.430> common<00:00:05.790> paradigm<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.750> the

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
changing the common paradigm of the

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.009 
changing the common paradigm of the
guitar<00:00:07.730> outputting<00:00:08.730> tone<00:00:09.030> which<00:00:09.420> travels

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
guitar outputting tone which travels

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.070 
guitar outputting tone which travels
along<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.620> chain<00:00:10.940> to<00:00:11.940> an<00:00:12.330> amplifier<00:00:13.049> and

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
along a chain to an amplifier and

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.200 
along a chain to an amplifier and
speaker<00:00:13.650> we<00:00:13.980> talked<00:00:14.160> about<00:00:14.280> changing<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:14.940> to

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
speaker we talked about changing that to

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.540 
speaker we talked about changing that to
a<00:00:15.240> different<00:00:15.420> paradigm<00:00:15.960> we're<00:00:16.619> instead<00:00:17.039> we

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
a different paradigm we're instead we

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.120 
a different paradigm we're instead we
see<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.880> guitar<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.449> little<00:00:18.800> generator<00:00:19.800> of

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
see the guitar is a little generator of

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.910 
see the guitar is a little generator of
an<00:00:20.430> AC<00:00:20.730> voltage<00:00:21.210> that's<00:00:21.960> connected<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.830> a

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
an AC voltage that's connected in a

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.220 
an AC voltage that's connected in a
circuit<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.420> speaker<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:26.480> the<00:00:27.480> pickups<00:00:28.080> in

circuit to a speaker and the pickups in

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.169 
circuit to a speaker and the pickups in
the<00:00:28.289> guitar<00:00:28.590> function<00:00:29.130> as<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.490> source<00:00:29.910> of

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the guitar function as the source of

this voltage that's alternating the
speaker<00:00:33.660> functions<00:00:34.110> as<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.410> load<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.700> use

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
speaker functions as the load and we use

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.530 
speaker functions as the load and we use
electricity<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:37.100> make<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.309> source<00:00:38.610> drive<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
electricity to make the source drive the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.780 
electricity to make the source drive the
load<00:00:39.719> we<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.350> mechanical<00:00:40.739> work<00:00:41.010> over<00:00:41.460> here<00:00:41.489> by

plucking the string it gets turned into

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.290 
plucking the string it gets turned into
an<00:00:43.680> alternating<00:00:44.100> voltage<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.180> gets

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
an alternating voltage and it gets

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.209 
an alternating voltage and it gets
turned<00:00:45.539> back<00:00:45.840> into<00:00:45.870> mechanical<00:00:46.590> motion<00:00:47.039> at

turned back into mechanical motion at
the<00:00:47.850> load<00:00:48.090> okay<00:00:48.780> now<00:00:49.590> there's<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.280> little<00:00:50.520> bit

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the load okay now there's a little bit

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.729 
the load okay now there's a little bit
of<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.760> problem<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.870> paradigm<00:00:52.289> because

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
of a problem with this paradigm because

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.130 
of a problem with this paradigm because
any<00:00:53.039> paradigm<00:00:53.550> our<00:00:53.760> model<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.870> it's

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
any paradigm our model is just that it's

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.990 
any paradigm our model is just that it's
partial<00:00:55.680> right<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.250> doesn't<00:00:56.550> explain<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
partial right that doesn't explain the

partial right that doesn't explain the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
whole picture and the problem that we're

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.830 
whole picture and the problem that we're
gonna<00:00:59.340> deal<00:00:59.609> with<00:00:59.789> today<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.359> fact<00:01:00.719> that

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
gonna deal with today is the fact that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.590 
gonna deal with today is the fact that
the<00:01:01.620> amount<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.100> voltage<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.969> pickup<00:01:03.239> puts

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
the amount of voltage that a pickup puts

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.810 
the amount of voltage that a pickup puts
out<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.989> actually<00:01:04.379> quite<00:01:04.650> low<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
out is actually quite low it's on the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.880 
out is actually quite low it's on the
order<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.090> millivolts<00:01:06.630> or<00:01:07.020> hundreds<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.710> volts

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
order of millivolts or hundreds of volts

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.840 
order of millivolts or hundreds of volts
or<00:01:08.189> tencel<00:01:08.760> volts<00:01:09.920> maybe<00:01:10.920> with<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> really<00:01:11.670> hot

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
or tencel volts maybe with a really hot

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.580 
or tencel volts maybe with a really hot
pickup<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.750> hit<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> strings<00:01:13.320> really

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
pickup if you hit the strings really

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.800 
pickup if you hit the strings really
hard<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.189> might<00:01:14.369> get<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> peak<00:01:14.909> voltage<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.570> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
hard you might get a peak voltage of a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.740 
hard you might get a peak voltage of a
volt<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:17.009> generally<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:17.939> quite<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> bit<00:01:18.390> less

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
volt but generally it's quite a bit less

guitar pickup directly to the speaker

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.219 
guitar pickup directly to the speaker
and<00:01:49.110> make<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.439> work<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.540> it's<00:01:51.540> not<00:01:51.840> gonna<00:01:51.960> work

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
and make it work but it's not gonna work

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.870 
and make it work but it's not gonna work
with<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> kind<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.950> speakers<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:53.520> typically

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
use so where are we gonna get enough

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.889 
use so where are we gonna get enough
voltage<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.219> therefore<00:01:59.729> enough<00:02:00.450> current

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
flow to move a speaker well the place

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.740 
flow to move a speaker well the place
we're<00:02:03.420> gonna<00:02:03.509> get<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.159> is<00:02:05.159> at<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.149> power<00:02:06.390> plant

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.370 
wall from some power plant only problem
is<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:32.940> we<00:02:33.240> connect<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.750> directly<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.290> the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
is if we connect that directly to the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.200 
is if we connect that directly to the
speaker<00:02:34.740> we're<00:02:35.070> gonna<00:02:35.160> get<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.400> 60<00:02:35.820> cycle<00:02:36.000> hum

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
speaker we're gonna get a 60 cycle hum

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.330 
speaker we're gonna get a 60 cycle hum
in<00:02:36.570> most<00:02:36.930> countries<00:02:37.140> 50<00:02:37.710> cycle<00:02:38.070> in<00:02:38.190> other

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
in most countries 50 cycle in other

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.030 
in most countries 50 cycle in other
countries<00:02:38.790> because<00:02:39.180> that's<00:02:39.840> actually<00:02:40.350> the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
countries because that's actually the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.620 
countries because that's actually the
frequency<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.760> voltage<00:02:41.880> that's<00:02:42.300> coming

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
frequency of the voltage that's coming

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.360 
frequency of the voltage that's coming
out<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.930> wall<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.650> that's<00:02:43.860> not<00:02:44.010> gonna<00:02:44.190> be

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
out of the wall so that's not gonna be

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.280 
out of the wall so that's not gonna be
good<00:02:44.550> right<00:02:44.610> that's<00:02:45.209> not<00:02:45.390> really<00:02:45.959> what<00:02:46.140> we're

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
good right that's not really what we're

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.230 
good right that's not really what we're
looking<00:02:46.680> for<00:02:46.920> we're<00:02:47.160> still<00:02:47.430> looking<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:47.850> turn

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
looking for we're still looking to turn

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.630 
looking for we're still looking to turn
the<00:02:48.810> voltage<00:02:49.200> over<00:02:49.350> here<00:02:49.890> into<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.310> bigger

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
the voltage over here into a bigger

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.270 
the voltage over here into a bigger
voltage<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.300> current<00:02:51.600> flow<00:02:51.810> over<00:02:52.260> here<00:02:52.590> so

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
voltage and current flow over here so

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.130 
voltage and current flow over here so
how<00:02:53.400> are<00:02:53.489> we<00:02:53.580> going<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.760> do<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.090> well<00:02:54.420> as<00:02:54.720> it

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
how are we going to do that well as it

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.470 
how are we going to do that well as it
turns<00:02:55.350> out<00:02:55.560> what<00:02:56.070> we're<00:02:56.220> gonna<00:02:56.310> do<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:56.970> we<00:02:57.360> are

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
turns out what we're gonna do is we are

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.620 
turns out what we're gonna do is we are
going<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.780> use<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:58.920> alternating<00:02:59.730> voltage<00:02:59.910> to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
going to use this alternating voltage to

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.290 
going to use this alternating voltage to
control<00:03:01.290> current<00:03:01.770> flow<00:03:02.130> being<00:03:02.459> driven<00:03:02.760> by

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
control current flow being driven by

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.500 
control current flow being driven by
this<00:03:03.360> voltage<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:04.950> have<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.850> voltage<00:03:06.270> at<00:03:06.420> the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
this voltage so we have a voltage at the

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.420 
this voltage so we have a voltage at the
wall<00:03:06.690> socket<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.410> we're<00:03:07.830> going<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.040> use<00:03:08.190> this

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
wall socket and we're going to use this

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.520 
wall socket and we're going to use this
voltage<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:09.030> control<00:03:09.390> how<00:03:09.660> much<00:03:09.870> gets<00:03:10.170> through

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
voltage to control how much gets through

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.080 
voltage to control how much gets through
at<00:03:10.709> any<00:03:10.800> given<00:03:11.070> moment<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.610> in<00:03:11.850> which

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
at any given moment and in which

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.070 
at any given moment and in which
direction<00:03:12.360> it's<00:03:13.320> going<00:03:13.709> hmm<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:15.420> now<00:03:15.450> what<00:03:15.959> we

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
direction it's going hmm so now what we

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.340 
direction it's going hmm so now what we
have<00:03:16.110> is<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:17.070> kind<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:17.880> an<00:03:18.000> interlocking<00:03:18.690> loop

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
have is a kind of an interlocking loop

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.400 
have is a kind of an interlocking loop
we<00:03:20.220> have<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.549> loop<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.630> pickup<00:03:21.900> and

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
we have the loop that is the pickup and

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.150 
we have the loop that is the pickup and
whatever<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.580> input<00:03:23.910> circuitry<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:24.959> of<00:03:25.320> the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
whatever the input circuitry is of the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.910 
whatever the input circuitry is of the
amplifier<00:03:26.850> or<00:03:27.150> perhaps<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.930> pedal<00:03:28.260> it's<00:03:28.620> really

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
amplifier or perhaps a pedal it's really

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.780 
amplifier or perhaps a pedal it's really
the<00:03:29.040> same<00:03:29.190> deal<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.820> in<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.600> middle<00:03:30.989> we<00:03:31.530> have

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
the same deal and in the middle we have

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.820 
the same deal and in the middle we have
amplification<00:03:32.790> happening<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.959> that's<00:03:34.620> going

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
amplification happening and that's going

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.190

miniaturized<00:03:53.310> transistor<00:03:54.030> there's<00:03:54.209> lots<00:03:54.390> of

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
miniaturized transistor there's lots of

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.780 
miniaturized transistor there's lots of
kinds<00:03:54.900> of<00:03:54.959> transistors<00:03:55.530> they<00:03:55.980> work<00:03:56.220> kind<00:03:56.670> of

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
kinds of transistors they work kind of

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.759 
kinds of transistors they work kind of
the<00:03:56.880> same<00:03:57.090> way<00:03:57.330> for<00:03:57.630> our<00:03:57.720> purposes<00:03:58.230> here<00:03:58.290> and

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
the same way for our purposes here and

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.100 
the same way for our purposes here and
they<00:03:59.310> work<00:03:59.489> pretty<00:03:59.760> much<00:03:59.850> like<00:04:00.180> tubes<00:04:00.480> as<00:04:00.810> far

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
they work pretty much like tubes as far

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.320 
they work pretty much like tubes as far
as<00:04:01.230> our<00:04:01.350> purposes<00:04:01.830> here<00:04:02.130> are<00:04:02.220> concerned<00:04:02.400> what

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
as our purposes here are concerned what

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.780 
as our purposes here are concerned what
they<00:04:03.510> allow<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:04.110> do<00:04:04.320> is<00:04:04.560> apply<00:04:05.190> this

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
they allow you to do is apply this

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.590 
they allow you to do is apply this
little<00:04:06.269> varying<00:04:06.989> voltage<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:08.220> control<00:04:08.820> a<00:04:09.150> much

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
little varying voltage to control a much

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.600 
little varying voltage to control a much
larger<00:04:10.230> current<00:04:10.650> flow<00:04:10.890> so<00:04:11.130> we<00:04:11.160> can<00:04:11.400> make<00:04:11.579> a

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
larger current flow so we can make a

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.310 
larger current flow so we can make a
copy<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:13.350> signal<00:04:13.799> that's<00:04:13.920> happening<00:04:14.430> here

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
copy of the signal that's happening here

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.460 
copy of the signal that's happening here
over<00:04:16.320> here<00:04:16.709> but<00:04:17.250> with<00:04:17.430> much<00:04:17.760> more<00:04:18.060> voltage<00:04:19.049> and

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
over here but with much more voltage and

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.380 
over here but with much more voltage and
therefore<00:04:19.919> much<00:04:20.160> more<00:04:20.190> current<00:04:20.970> flowing

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
therefore much more current flowing

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.110 
therefore much more current flowing
enough<00:04:22.020> to<00:04:22.320> drive<00:04:22.680> this<00:04:23.220> speaker<00:04:23.669> we<00:04:24.090> are

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
enough to drive this speaker we are

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.810 
enough to drive this speaker we are
actually<00:04:24.450> using<00:04:24.690> tubes<00:04:25.500> or<00:04:25.800> transistors<00:04:26.160> or

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
actually using tubes or transistors or

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.560 
actually using tubes or transistors or
some<00:04:27.030> common

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
some common

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.950 
some common
to<00:04:28.290> make<00:04:28.590> an<00:04:28.770> analogous<00:04:29.580> copy<00:04:30.090> of<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.480> signal

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
to make an analogous copy of the signal

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.050 
to make an analogous copy of the signal
at<00:04:31.200> higher<00:04:31.530> voltage<00:04:32.010> with<00:04:32.400> higher<00:04:32.610> current

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
at higher voltage with higher current

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.540 
at higher voltage with higher current
flow<00:04:33.270> so<00:04:33.840> now<00:04:34.020> we've<00:04:34.260> moved<00:04:34.530> from<00:04:34.800> looking<00:04:35.370> at

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
flow so now we've moved from looking at

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.820 
flow so now we've moved from looking at
the<00:04:35.670> signal<00:04:36.060> chain<00:04:36.360> as<00:04:36.660> a<00:04:37.020> path<00:04:37.320> from<00:04:37.620> one

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
the signal chain as a path from one

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.800 
the signal chain as a path from one
place<00:04:38.070> to<00:04:38.100> another<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.910> looking<00:04:39.210> at<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.510> as<00:04:39.600> one

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
place to another to looking at it as one

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.870 
place to another to looking at it as one
big<00:04:39.840> loop<00:04:40.440> where<00:04:40.950> we're<00:04:41.100> using<00:04:41.130> electricity

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
big loop where we're using electricity

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.480 
big loop where we're using electricity
to<00:04:42.150> convert<00:04:42.780> mechanical<00:04:43.350> motion<00:04:44.130> here<00:04:44.340> to

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
to convert mechanical motion here to

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.250 
to convert mechanical motion here to
mechanical<00:04:44.940> motion<00:04:45.240> here<00:04:45.480> and<00:04:45.630> now<00:04:46.080> we've

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
mechanical motion here and now we've

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.620 
mechanical motion here and now we've
added<00:04:46.380> an<00:04:46.890> additional<00:04:47.610> piece<00:04:48.180> to<00:04:48.420> this<00:04:48.540> puzzle

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
added an additional piece to this puzzle

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.230 
added an additional piece to this puzzle
and<00:04:49.140> said<00:04:49.620> well<00:04:49.800> actually<00:04:50.010> it's<00:04:50.370> interlocking

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
and said well actually it's interlocking

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.690 
and said well actually it's interlocking
loops<00:04:51.270> because<00:04:52.050> we<00:04:52.620> have<00:04:52.770> a<00:04:52.800> loop<00:04:53.040> over<00:04:53.370> here

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
loops because we have a loop over here

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.270 
loops because we have a loop over here
that's<00:04:54.150> a<00:04:54.390> small<00:04:54.840> voltage<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:55.530> then<00:04:55.920> we<00:04:55.950> want

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
that's a small voltage and then we want

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.700 
that's a small voltage and then we want
to<00:04:56.340> turn<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:56.790> into<00:04:57.120> a<00:04:57.510> bigger<00:04:58.080> voltage<00:04:58.530> and

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
to turn that into a bigger voltage and

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.350 
to turn that into a bigger voltage and
current<00:04:59.040> flow<00:04:59.250> over<00:04:59.490> here<00:04:59.820> remember<00:05:00.210> these

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
current flow over here remember these

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.850 
current flow over here remember these
things<00:05:00.570> are<00:05:00.720> going<00:05:00.930> back<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.140> forth<00:05:01.380> this<00:05:01.800> is

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
things are going back and forth this is

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.070 
things are going back and forth this is
an<00:05:02.100> alternating<00:05:02.670> signal<00:05:03.120> we<00:05:03.960> have

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
an alternating signal we have

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.080 
an alternating signal we have
alternating<00:05:04.620> motion<00:05:05.040> we<00:05:05.400> have<00:05:05.430> alternating

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
alternating motion we have alternating

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.480 
alternating motion we have alternating
motion<00:05:06.480> we've<00:05:06.990> got<00:05:07.140> to<00:05:07.260> keep<00:05:07.410> that<00:05:07.490> current

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
motion we've got to keep that current

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.970 
motion we've got to keep that current
and<00:05:08.640> voltage<00:05:09.120> alternating<00:05:09.420> as<00:05:10.290> well<00:05:10.500> to

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
and voltage alternating as well to

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.310 
and voltage alternating as well to
reproduce<00:05:11.490> it<00:05:11.700> so<00:05:11.940> straight<00:05:12.600> path<00:05:12.840> to<00:05:13.110> loop

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
reproduce it so straight path to loop

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.410 
reproduce it so straight path to loop
and<00:05:13.560> now<00:05:13.890> we've<00:05:14.070> got<00:05:14.250> interlocking<00:05:14.940> loops<00:05:14.970> and

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
and now we've got interlocking loops and

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.940 
and now we've got interlocking loops and
that's<00:05:15.840> going<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.050> take<00:05:16.260> us<00:05:16.440> even<00:05:16.710> further

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
that's going to take us even further

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.550 
that's going to take us even further
into<00:05:17.640> an<00:05:17.730> understanding<00:05:17.970> of<00:05:18.480> how<00:05:18.900> all<00:05:19.230> of<00:05:19.470> this

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
into an understanding of how all of this

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.240 
into an understanding of how all of this
stuff<00:05:19.800> works<00:05:20.100> and<00:05:20.630> how<00:05:21.630> we<00:05:21.690> get<00:05:22.250> awesome

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
stuff works and how we get awesome

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:33.239 
stuff works and how we get awesome
guitar<00:05:24.090> sounds<00:05:24.510> until<00:05:25.470> next<00:05:25.590> time
