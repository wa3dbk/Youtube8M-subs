00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.970 
mean you're kind of disrespecting your
organization<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.810> mean<00:03:30.019> I'm<00:03:30.290> not<00:03:30.709> saying

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
organization I mean I'm not saying

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.979 
organization I mean I'm not saying
against<00:03:31.340> anyone<00:03:31.639> else<00:03:31.669> but<00:03:32.060> I<00:03:32.209> mean<00:03:32.419> I<00:03:32.449> tested

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
against anyone else but I mean I tested

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.140 
against anyone else but I mean I tested
a<00:03:33.049> 16<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:33.889> the<00:03:34.220> only<00:03:34.370> way<00:03:34.549> that<00:03:34.579> you<00:03:34.849> can<00:03:35.000> even

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
a 16 and the only way that you can even

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.349 
a 16 and the only way that you can even
show<00:03:35.449> on<00:03:35.780> a<00:03:35.840> test<00:03:36.409> as<00:03:36.620> if<00:03:36.739> it's<00:03:36.889> 15<00:03:37.370> so<00:03:37.760> I<00:03:38.000> think

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
show on a test as if it's 15 so I think

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.210 
show on a test as if it's 15 so I think
it<00:03:38.629> should<00:03:38.659> be<00:03:38.870> tested<00:03:39.290> based<00:03:39.470> upon<00:03:39.739> nanogram

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
it should be tested based upon nanogram

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.250 
it should be tested based upon nanogram
levels<00:03:40.639> and<00:03:40.970> I<00:03:41.239> mean<00:03:41.389> that<00:03:41.419> that<00:03:41.810> really<00:03:41.959> tells

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
levels and I mean that that really tells

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.649 
levels and I mean that that really tells
the<00:03:42.379> true<00:03:42.650> story<00:03:42.979> that<00:03:43.579> that<00:03:43.940> tells<00:03:44.209> like<00:03:44.479> what

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
the true story that that tells like what

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.780 
the true story that that tells like what
really<00:03:44.810> happened<00:03:45.319> so<00:03:45.620> I<00:03:45.859> don't<00:03:46.370> agree<00:03:46.579> with

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
really happened so I don't agree with

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.849 
really happened so I don't agree with
that<00:03:47.150> but<00:03:47.569> yet<00:03:47.780> again<00:03:47.989> it<00:03:48.139> is<00:03:48.260> it<00:03:48.500> is<00:03:48.650> break

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
that but yet again it is it is break

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:50.259 
that but yet again it is it is break
it's<00:03:49.010> breaking<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.400> rule<00:03:49.549> I<00:03:49.609> mean<00:03:49.940> you<00:03:50.090> break<00:03:50.239> a

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.240 
it's breaking a rule I mean you break a
role<00:03:50.510> you<00:03:50.659> serve<00:03:51.139> penalties<00:03:51.590> if<00:03:51.799> you<00:03:51.919> speed

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
even if it's one mile an hour over if

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.229 
even if it's one mile an hour over if
