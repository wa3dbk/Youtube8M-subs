that I can make in this patch I'm only

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.850 
that I can make in this patch I'm only
going<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.150> use<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.170> I'm<00:01:31.350> gonna<00:01:31.470> make<00:01:31.680> sure

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
going to use one so I'm gonna make sure

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.789 
going to use one so I'm gonna make sure
this<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.340> turned<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:33.299> these<00:01:34.110> others<00:01:34.500> are

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
turned off by default off I'll go back

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.499 
turned off by default off I'll go back
to<00:01:38.790> one<00:01:39.259> now<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.560> target<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.820> parameter

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
to one now the target is the parameter

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.020 
to one now the target is the parameter
the<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.229> setting<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.799> want<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.220> turn<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.700> and

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.459 
to the amp type switch this is what
turns<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:03.570> amp<00:02:03.750> on<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.290> off<00:02:04.759> so<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.119> set

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
turns the amp on and off so that is set

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.040 
turns the amp on and off so that is set
my<00:02:07.469> target<00:02:07.740> minimum<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.459> off<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.119> my<00:02:09.179> maximum

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
my target minimum is off and my maximum

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.309 
my target minimum is off and my maximum
is<00:02:10.229> on<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.950> means<00:02:11.510> when<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.540> send<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:13.020> MIDI

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
is on so that means when I send a MIDI

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.649 
is on so that means when I send a MIDI
control<00:02:13.769> change<00:02:13.980> message<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.489> zero<00:02:14.760> it'll

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
control change message of zero it'll

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.739 
control change message of zero it'll
turn<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:16.109> target<00:02:17.069> off<00:02:17.219> and<00:02:17.730> when<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.209> send<00:02:18.540> one

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:18.749 
turn that target off and when I send one

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:23.030 
turn that target off and when I send one
CC<00:02:19.650> dn't<00:02:19.829> message<00:02:20.159> of<00:02:20.480> 127<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:22.469> turns<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:22.920> on

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
CC dn't message of 127 it turns it on

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.619 
CC dn't message of 127 it turns it on
now<00:02:23.879> my<00:02:24.090> source<00:02:24.599> is<00:02:24.989> what<00:02:25.709> we'll<00:02:25.950> be<00:02:26.629> doing

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
CTL pedal and that's fine if you want

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.720 
CTL pedal and that's fine if you want
that<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.599> happen<00:02:33.750> but<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.859> actually<00:02:35.099> want<00:02:35.519> this

to turn on and off via a midi control

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.099 
to turn on and off via a midi control
change<00:02:40.230> message<00:02:40.620> from<00:02:40.889> another<00:02:41.129> device<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:42.810> I

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
change message from another device so I

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.770

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
MIDI control change number 80 to do this

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.490 
MIDI control change number 80 to do this
action<00:02:49.849> so<00:02:50.849> I'm<00:02:50.969> gonna<00:02:51.150> turn<00:02:51.449> this<00:02:51.659> dial<00:02:51.900> until

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
action so I'm gonna turn this dial until

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.629 
action so I'm gonna turn this dial until
my<00:02:52.620> source<00:02:53.010> says<00:02:53.629> CC<00:02:54.680> 80<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:56.719> there<00:02:57.719> we<00:02:57.900> go<00:02:58.639> I'm

or I can assign this expression pedal on
the<00:04:23.190> FC<00:04:23.550> 300<00:04:23.969> to<00:04:24.060> do<00:04:24.210> something<00:04:24.599> it's

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
the FC 300 to do something it's

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.960 
the FC 300 to do something it's
basically<00:04:25.979> all<00:04:26.219> MIDI

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
basically all MIDI

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.990 
basically all MIDI
control<00:04:27.150> change<00:04:27.390> messages<00:04:28.550> when<00:04:29.550> if<00:04:29.820> you

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
control change messages when if you

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.700 
control change messages when if you
think<00:04:30.210> about<00:04:30.390> it<00:04:30.540> that<00:04:30.660> leaves<00:04:30.900> since<00:04:31.530> there

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
think about it that leaves since there

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.430 
think about it that leaves since there
are<00:04:31.890> eight<00:04:32.610> different<00:04:33.270> assigns<00:04:33.630> available<00:04:34.290> to

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
are eight different assigns available to

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.120 
are eight different assigns available to
you<00:04:34.680> in<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:35.760> patch<00:04:36.120> that<00:04:37.110> leaves<00:04:37.350> quite<00:04:37.830> a<00:04:37.860> few

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
you in a patch that leaves quite a few

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.510 
you in a patch that leaves quite a few
options<00:04:38.310> that<00:04:38.760> you<00:04:38.940> can<00:04:39.090> control<00:04:40.130> so<00:04:41.130> I<00:04:41.160> hope

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
options that you can control so I hope
