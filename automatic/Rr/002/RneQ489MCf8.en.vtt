00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 here is garden video point is my 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.980
 name is markus plan now to the topic 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.500
 Today I plant a row of trees 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.440
 row a fruit tree or fall in the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 a row with mini legs there in 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.529
 garden sometimes situations like there 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.400
 you plant several fruit trees 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.560
 behind each other 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.449
 and there you go a bit 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.910
 Inspire this from the rows 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.369
 For example, in the acquisition on the building there 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.320
 and if you look closely, there is 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.849
 actually the right ones 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.740
 clues how to do such a planting 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.960
 To make such a framework must be the simplest 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.410
 if this little one was a scaffold 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.670
 are and also here entrat connected 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.710
 they will be able to know how to 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.450
 Do not stabilize that in the wind 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.239
 here, for example, from the south of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.190
 Hair dryers come with 120 kilometers per hour 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.789
 not just be knocked over 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.920
 you can see the plant here that is 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.559
 hanspeter schwendener he is 60 years old 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.590
 got old a few weeks ago 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.600
 has or months and we of lukas 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.760
 get paid as a series with 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.989
 But trees have the pad that 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.850
 to plant yourself 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.229
 as we have experienced 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.830
 did not do that myself 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.510
 but his son did that 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.430
 chapeau to his son who planted that 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.740
 has and we look how it did 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.659
 yes done right with a few 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.880
 with a strong case of circa 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.220
 three meters he hit the strike 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.520
 have and then he has an anchor here 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.890
 You can see here and have one 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.020
 Silent drive down on the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.939
 We still request with a wire voltage 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.759
 so that can sometimes relax 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.180
 and then that always tensed then tensed 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.710
 he also has the third one here 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.140
 on the other side 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.630
 For my part now, too 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.610
 here still ever a wire tension 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.280
 grown that built in that one so 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.439
 here, too, the wide exciting again 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.140
 could and the whole thing a bit denser 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.110
 and could make it narrower and better though 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.360
 it's also like hans-peter's 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.210
 was made here and the plants to 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.420
 example mali every 50 centimeters 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.259
 Paradise apple trees or or raid loves 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.900
 every 100 to 150 cm a tree and has 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.560
 the same opportunity 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.629
 on scaffolding moor and as it goes 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.989
 two three years and has its own escape 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.489
 warns the in winter light lets through so 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.829
 that you just enjoy the landscape 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.439
 Can make the summer and in the summer 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.420
 autumn still wonders bears good fruits 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:31.340
 So just a little one 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.890
 Fruit plant for planting at home 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.079
 is also possible that different 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.909
 plant marini maloney paradis or 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.730
 also no or a stone expand taking 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.810
 Stone fruit needs a little more space two 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.790
 meter more 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.959
 in comparison to the apple tree and before 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.959
 all in comparison to berlin
