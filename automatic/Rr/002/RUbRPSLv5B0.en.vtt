00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 hi hi speed personal 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:18.420
 We're going to talk about Hungary's formulam. 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:20.760
 oh I do not even know where to start right 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.640
 to talk about this race after all, people 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.830
 had so much movement it was super cool 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.769
 so I think we needed a 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.500
 step like that with the cold the passage 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.770
 with a dispute on the track some confusion but 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.630
 I just did not need that much position. 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.610
 I confess that I am still somewhat lost in 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.190
 everything that happened only the bad guy he 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.870
 had three positions in that race 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.270
 It's okay that he already has a certain 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.129
 historical in this sense but even so 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.480
 it was a little out of the house 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.600
 I'll also talk a little bit about what 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.090
 happened before the test, because this 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.579
 is the first since the death jules 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.800
 bianchi and the pilots performed a 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.469
 Super homage to him including 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.570
 the family was reunited and in moments 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.939
 before the test they formed to achieve 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.210
 put all the helmets in there 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.790
 of this wheel that they made and the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.979
 father hugged in the Felipe Mass was a 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.650
 very nice moment very beautiful so 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.540
 symbolic and legal is that everyone who 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.330
 had a great result in this race 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.180
 ended up dedicating is bianchi's memory 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.060
 we saw in the code the ricardo is e 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.189
 still the hand to the sky thanking 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.840
 the veto spoke on the radio even after 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.850
 He won the race and said so 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.770
 you are with us while another you 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.390
 would be part of the team 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.119
 I think it was a good size. 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.640
 homage for sure his memory goes 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.110
 follow the formula 1 along 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.540
 of centuries 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.790
 now let's talk about the race itself is not 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.250
 everyone was betting on a victory 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.579
 mercedes on Saturday, you could imagine 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.950
 that the defendant could not take it easy but 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.340
 ferrari I think 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.560
 Seeing she said it 's the team that was 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.020
 eye on the red bull that was not looking 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.549
 much in the mercedes but that was not what the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.520
 people saw in the race just before the start 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.069
 both vettel and icon were up 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.830
 rowing rosberg Itu got the 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.420
 overtaking and impressive is 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.700
 that the regime qualifies was stolen 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.180
 when he sees himself out there a little 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.280
 his comfort zone ended up not having 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.250
 nothing with rosberg actually he kind of 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.310
 He erred alone was to be crushed 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.230
 several positions fell to the tenth place 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.959
 and then you could imagine just the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.209
 I did not try the challenge, but it was not so much. 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.610
 thing so many moves that he 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.360
 got the law back the four 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.480
 first 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.510
 I was going up already from Rosberg there. 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.739
 new with the other drives 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.040
 in fact he had a problem with 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.650
 Ricardo is also again was flustered to 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.829
 up hit the side of the car 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.920
 of Ricardo and broke the wing have teams 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.959
 boxes and again fell back and luck 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.239
 it is that can also had a 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.000
 problem in the home is but in the 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.100
 It's true who was the ricardo and 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.410
 He was also in the day to clean 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.560
 some confusion ended up hitting 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.569
 rosberg punctured the tire and then he had to 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.000
 practically almost internal time in the 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.920
 track to get in the pits and 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.870
 I have to be strong of the defendant then by 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.209
 that because of this he succeeded 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.319
 finish in front rosberg and also 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.389
 still in the lead of the championship 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.540
 so it was a disastrous run 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:32.060
 to the mercedes but they are still there 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.230
 on the edge then the work was not all 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.760
 lost 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.370
 Now we have to speak also a 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.370
 few of the accidents of this test had 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.220
 tomás one maneuver with Remy tone 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.590
 they passed quietly just touched 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.109
 in a little bit the tires but then a 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.050
 similar attempt, the maldonado is over 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.810
 hitting the thesis liu 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.670
 Perez went outside and gave a 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.650
 round to get back 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.480
 I figured I could not even get back 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.120
 for the race but it all worked out 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.280
 It turned out well that he then 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.300
 That weekend was so I was not 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.190
 not good 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.710
 so much so that a little happened who 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.750
 drink that strongest beat of this 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.830
 Race, because what happened was 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.160
 on the line 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.890
 the iaa just so Tom went 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.510
 under the car he had to brake and everything 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.310
 and a little bit to try to reduce to the 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.400
 before hitting the 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.170
 tires and the image is put on the camera 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.570
 slow transition is very 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.750
 awesome because the car raises 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.450
 Wing goes under, Ricardo gets all 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.990
 the possible debris soon back poor 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.150
 more smoke from the brake but still not well 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.490
 he is a civil servant and only one 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.960
 bad weekend to pretend and 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.090
 Do not talk or suck 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.090
 We're going to talk about mclaren, but this 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.010
 instead of a bomb way after Saturday 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.870
 is that the ad tried to push the car 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.130
 there to go back to the classification 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.380
 got 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.060
 we had there at least I had to 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.560
 expectation that his race will also be 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.570
 it would not be good 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.750
 but it was instead they surprised 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.060
 they just got out of the mess 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.470
 got involved in nothing and the two cars 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.510
 of the team scored 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.400
 alonso finished fifth with button 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.680
 ended in ninth and went one way 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.870
 very cool because they got to stay 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.910
 on the track but also there 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.880
 overtaking is not that race that 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.820
 they simply survived not him 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.980
 was up and they had to battle 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.290
 so it was a great result with certainty 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.930
 a highlight and now we also have 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.120
 that talking about the negative side that were the 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.230
 Brazilian is felipe márcio felipe 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.480
 born so little appeared 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.460
 still in mass had already been punished 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.290
 before the start because he 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.810
 lined up wrong on grid 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.940
 took five weeks of cognition and then 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.930
 it seems that he has not met more 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.150
 Proof, right? 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.450
 in the beginning he even made a bid with harrison 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.760
 it was nice but it disappeared and sauber too 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.890
 wins over the weekend super discreet 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.620
 it was not cool so it was already a 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.540
 better than expected at the end 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.900
 but now it 's cheering for both 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.550
 ailton to disclose in Belgium and 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.620
 for us to close or comment on a 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.990
 a little there is not the veto is a 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.380
 sovereign by the ferrari a great proof 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.570
 oh, he was going to be able to get there, but 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.520
 problems in the car this time did not 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.630
 nothing to do with him so he did not even have 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.730
 what to do 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.250
 in second place stayed here and I think 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.260
 for the first time was the podium but he 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.260
 will have ten seconds added to your 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.210
 time then it's like changing that rule 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.370
 national level is forming, leaving the 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.950
 people a little confused this morning and 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.140
 the finish the pilot can let go 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.630
 only have seconds added in time 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.730
 in punishment then it ends up messing up like this 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.070
 the entire classification at the end of the race 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.170
 and the tie came in third and managed to 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.580
 a double for the red bull 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.070
 it had been a long time since they had 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.080
 Then it was really cool, too. 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.480
 along with verse wanting not everyone 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.500
 remember him with the red bull went to 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.050
 ferrari is making an excellent 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.780
 work was a result like this. 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.120
 very cool, different I'm sure 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.460
 everyone who bet on the jackpot had 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.310
 placed that the victory be mercedes 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.260
 and I also planned and it was super bad but 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.100
 was a final week was pretty cool 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.750
 a very good race 

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.090
 I was very happy and had everything 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.320
 A little then I think everyone left 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.880
 pleased 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.680
 in fact you can also leave your 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.750
 What did you think of the race? 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.030
 interesting bid you can 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.100

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:38.370
 this was the high speed that today 

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.710
 commenting on formula 1 does not win if you 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.510
 I like God, I already came here. 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.950
