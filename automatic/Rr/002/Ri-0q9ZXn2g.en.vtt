00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.760
 books that I received during the month of 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.920
 April and the truth is that they are many and not 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.720
 I know why they give me a lot of 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.670
 verses to the projector y'all not by order 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.349
 of arrival or anything like that and there 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.640
 let's go here the first two books that 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.769
 I'm going to teach you are from the publisher 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.320

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.869
 author mary jones is from sweden and this 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.329
 book belongs to a pretty saga 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.700
 wide novel mystery books 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.800
 black that good develops in all 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.570
 I believe in the same city and I had 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.870
 a book of walks proved lake bell 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.910
 also the rooms and never and when I 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.649
 I write down the press and saw what this was about 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.320
 Well, it caught my attention because 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.629
 in addition to having segment killings 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.820
 also the theme of fashion and 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.859
 models all this so good me 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.690
 it seems quite interesting and it came to me 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.460
 also with your press release and 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.140
 Bookmark of the book the following 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.860
 book and the last one of the editorial maeva 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.320
 slash 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.570
 perfumes of christina cape ni is a 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.940
 book that today a lot of attention for its 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.190
 synopsis I do not know I think it's not the type 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.630
 of books that I usually read but has something 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.940
 that catches my attention 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.800
 we have the cover it seems very nice 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.420
 he also came to me with his press release and 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.950
 with a matching bookmark what I 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.940
 makes grace of these maeva books is 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.400
 that inside the pastas have 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.440
 as the cover continues then not 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.790
 I know it seems very nice and thank you 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.320
 have is to sink the tooth 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.090
 the next book comes to me from part of 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.460
 the editorial planet is something the inverse 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.930
 cabbage injuve I 've read it and I hope 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.640
 that you have soon the teaches in the blog 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.970
 The truth is that it is a book that has 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.800
 liked but has not been too 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.940
 but I will tell you in Europe of 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.100
 this month that the publishing house the galley 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.930
 I received two books the first one is white 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.670
 like the snow of these which is never 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.440
 the second part of the trilogy called me 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.170
 the one mickey that is also a trilogy 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.000
 in this juvenile case of police novel 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.110
 black that also a magnificent author 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.570
 so then I think it's a little more 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.160
 light because he is good because he is young and 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.030
 I liked it first but it left me a little 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.460
 as well as loose 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.140

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.000
 the wish list of amazon and I wanted to read it 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.699
 for a long time from a couple of 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.990
 years in when I discovered the author 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.000

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.630
 of the author's best books so 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.280
 I still have much more desire to read it 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.539
