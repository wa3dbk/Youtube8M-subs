00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.890
 millions of people 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.669

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:38.100
 it will be difficult 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.150

 you can 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.710

 it's your own thoughts and sex 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.180
 and can not share at all 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.800
 because the internet is all simple 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.260
 wonderful 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.890

 he will make us celebrated 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.820
 technical wisdom 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.880
 which name is 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.789

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.000
 who do you want to visit

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.670
 his companion process 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.800
 creation 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.800
 is it a drug addict 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.550
 now let's go technical 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.080
 issues 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.050
 I will specifically say 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.580
 Abubakir who will enter 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.530

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.700
 cup final 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.020
 why did i win the cup 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.090
 because 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.420
 the public is the largest company 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.590
 which provides 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.880
 nansen big cross and accessibility 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.640
 so what will come of it 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.560
 and that to us with you 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.679

 your computer's browser 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.999
 if these pits 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:28.659
 we go out 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.540
 look at the pictures and video maps of the news 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.259

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:35.119
 Nikolsky mail which is called 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:36.319

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.369
 tons find it on a button and somehow 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:39.169
 way 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.399
 and you open 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:43.729
 opportunity to create your account 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:45.729
 please take a look 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:46.569
 on right 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.559
 I think it's clear 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:51.629
 be sure to register with 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:52.369
 this temple 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:54.269
 because if you will not be justified 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.269
 the public you can not open 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.149
 I will not 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:03.149
 that is, the window sill, etc. great for everyone 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:05.930
 very simple 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.749
 is investing there 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:09.329
 really pass stage 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:10.249
 registration 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:12.349
 after the document says 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.039
 square then what 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:17.249
 although about the post to the public is better than all 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:20.009
 the rest after the picket could with him 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:21.519
 now look 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.889
 I have limitations 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.139
 this is so cool 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.479
 then got tight control 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:27.619
 spam 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:29.799
 here and the courage the politician controls 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:30.669
 and spam 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:31.790
 and even vice versa 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.060
 sometimes you have to look for a song that 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.859
 public mark as spam 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.449
 they have to be looked for with paul 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.439
 in the streets of Donetsk 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.039
 he has a lot of the same age 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.999
 now later 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:44.869
 for will 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:46.689
 so if you master this 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:48.589
 will not regret it and you will 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:50.079
 use only her 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.209
 and in order mailboxes on others 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.089
 made and here you can do very 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:56.900
 simple and practice all the other girls 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.059
 which you have 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:00.359
 to computer 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:01.730
 you just open 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.599
 and on the chip change residence 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.319
 going on issues 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.619
 there is such an option kept the media 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:10.539
 previous boxes 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:12.619
 you will be asked a question for example at sea 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:15.049
 this part is not preserved 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.959
 that is, some kind of there are those who at least somehow 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.280
 worked hard to keep you 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.039
 switched to the search for drugs 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.869
 it will be very convenient if you 

00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:24.240
 going to do business 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.430
 the internet 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.840
 I highly recommend having experience 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.740
 and skills 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.389
 because if you will open 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:31.550
 contributions 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.810
