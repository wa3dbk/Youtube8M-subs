going to see me dead lift first and then
you're<00:00:11.099> going<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.250> see<00:00:11.400> me<00:00:11.550> do<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:12.599> guess<00:00:13.230> what

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
with the base cycle of small up you're

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.390 
with the base cycle of small up you're
going<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.230> see<00:00:19.350> me<00:00:19.470> work<00:00:19.590> up<00:00:19.770> here<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.160> do<00:00:20.279> my

going to see me work up here and do my
warm-ups<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.150> 225<00:00:21.750> going<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.740> do<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.920> for

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
warm-ups this is 225 going to do it for

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.830 
warm-ups this is 225 going to do it for
a<00:00:23.100> single<00:00:23.490> going<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.730> work<00:00:23.880> up<00:00:24.060> at<00:00:24.180> about<00:00:24.269> fifty

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
a single going to work up at about fifty

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.150 
a single going to work up at about fifty
pound<00:00:25.080> intervals<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.430> 275<00:00:27.029> right<00:00:27.480> here

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
pound intervals this is 275 right here

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.380 
pound intervals this is 275 right here
initially<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.340> speed<00:00:29.699> did<00:00:29.939> not<00:00:30.119> feel

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
initially the speed did not feel

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.840 
initially the speed did not feel
fantastic<00:00:30.740> I<00:00:31.740> wasn't<00:00:32.250> really<00:00:32.489> getting<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
fantastic I wasn't really getting the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.729 
fantastic I wasn't really getting the
speed<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.360> was<00:00:33.510> accustomed<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.170> off<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
speed that I was accustomed to off the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.740 
speed that I was accustomed to off the
floor<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.520> did<00:00:35.910> feel<00:00:36.059> good<00:00:36.120> about<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.570> fact

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
floor but I did feel good about the fact

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.869 
floor but I did feel good about the fact
that<00:00:36.930> at<00:00:37.079> least<00:00:37.230> my<00:00:37.440> lockout<00:00:37.890> had<00:00:38.100> some<00:00:38.370> pop<00:00:38.610> to

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
that at least my lockout had some pop to

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.690 
that at least my lockout had some pop to
it<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:40.200> didn't<00:00:40.890> know<00:00:40.950> how<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.340> was<00:00:41.489> going

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
it so I didn't know how this was going

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.660 
it so I didn't know how this was going
to<00:00:41.790> turn<00:00:42.059> out<00:00:42.120> but<00:00:43.020> um<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:44.160> felt<00:00:44.370> good<00:00:44.550> at

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to turn out but um but I felt good at

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.060 
to turn out but um but I felt good at
least<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.000> my<00:00:45.120> lockout<00:00:45.539> now<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.649> notice

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
least in my lockout now as you notice

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.000 
least in my lockout now as you notice
there<00:00:47.309> i'm<00:00:47.550> sitting<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.059> position<00:00:48.770> too<00:00:49.770> much

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
there i'm sitting in position too much

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.010 
there i'm sitting in position too much
and<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.789> was<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> mistake<00:00:51.180> i<00:00:51.539> was<00:00:51.660> making

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
and this was a mistake i was making

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.930 
and this was a mistake i was making
throughout<00:00:52.289> my<00:00:52.440> warm-ups<00:00:52.890> i<00:00:53.100> finally

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
throughout my warm-ups i finally

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.939 
throughout my warm-ups i finally
corrected<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.510> towards<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.870> end<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.199> i<00:00:55.500> get

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
corrected it towards the end but i get

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.560 
corrected it towards the end but i get
in<00:00:56.039> position<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:56.969> sort<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.180> sit<00:00:57.420> and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
in position and I just sort of sit and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.330 
in position and I just sort of sit and
hover<00:00:57.809> there<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.739> never<00:00:58.920> want<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.250> do

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
hover there and you never want to do

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.860 
hover there and you never want to do
that<00:00:59.370> because<00:00:59.730> number<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.210> you're<00:01:00.539> inducing

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
that because number one you're inducing

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.170 
that because number one you're inducing
an<00:01:01.199> isometric<00:01:01.800> phase<00:01:02.039> which<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.699> going<00:01:03.059> to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
an isometric phase which is going to

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.179 
an isometric phase which is going to
fatigue<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.809> even<00:01:04.439> if<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.949> little

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
fatigue you even if it's just a little

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.940 
fatigue you even if it's just a little
bit<00:01:05.309> formats<00:01:05.820> pole<00:01:06.119> or<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.750> any<00:01:07.020> pole<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.770> which

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
bit formats pole or in any pole in which

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.469 
bit formats pole or in any pole in which
you're<00:01:08.130> trying<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.460> generate<00:01:08.790> maximal<00:01:09.330> force

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
you're trying to generate maximal force

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.480 
you're trying to generate maximal force
you<00:01:09.750> obviously<00:01:10.200> don't<00:01:10.409> want<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.740> accumulate

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
you obviously don't want to accumulate

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.520 
you obviously don't want to accumulate
fatigue<00:01:12.030> before<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.570> actually<00:01:12.810> perform<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
fatigue before you actually perform the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.490 
fatigue before you actually perform the
lift<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:15.630> second<00:01:15.960> reason<00:01:16.020> why<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.350> don't

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
lift the second reason why you don't

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.410 
lift the second reason why you don't
want<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.280> because<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:18.150> get<00:01:18.390> a

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
want to do that is because you can get a

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.249 
want to do that is because you can get a
very<00:01:18.869> slight<00:01:19.290> stretch<00:01:19.710> reflex<00:01:20.310> if<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.140> set<00:01:22.140> up

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
very slight stretch reflex if you set up

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.010 
very slight stretch reflex if you set up
get<00:01:22.799> into<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> left<00:01:23.460> pull<00:01:24.450> your<00:01:24.630> hips<00:01:24.750> into

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
get into the left pull your hips into

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.620 
get into the left pull your hips into
position<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.310> lift<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.150> know<00:01:27.299> and

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
position and then just lift you know and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.990 
position and then just lift you know and
I<00:01:28.020> was<00:01:28.200> really<00:01:28.530> giving<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.979> away<00:01:29.100> by<00:01:29.759> just

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
I was really giving that away by just

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.460 
I was really giving that away by just
sitting<00:01:30.150> there<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.780> few<00:01:30.930> seconds<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
sitting there for a few seconds at a

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.429 
sitting there for a few seconds at a
time<00:01:31.579> that<00:01:32.579> was<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:33.119> 55<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.200> felt

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
time that was for 55 and that felt

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.270 
time that was for 55 and that felt
pretty<00:01:34.500> solid<00:01:35.220> 405<00:01:35.880> felt<00:01:36.270> okay<00:01:36.930> I'm<00:01:37.829> still<00:01:38.159> not

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
pretty solid 405 felt okay I'm still not

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.399 
pretty solid 405 felt okay I'm still not
happy<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:38.759> my<00:01:38.909> speed<00:01:39.329> I'm<00:01:39.810> going<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.110> move<00:01:40.259> up

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
happy with my speed I'm going to move up

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.219 
happy with my speed I'm going to move up

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
floor I know it looks probably pretty

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.580

fast<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:50.909> me<00:01:51.030> that's<00:01:51.210> not<00:01:51.450> fast<00:01:51.750> that's

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.670 
fast but for me that's not fast that's
not<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> fast<00:01:53.159> pole<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:54.329> my<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:55.140> my<00:01:55.290> lockout

egregiously on this session to be

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.860 
egregiously on this session to be
perfectly<00:03:39.320> honest<00:03:40.070> it<00:03:40.220> was<00:03:40.400> about<00:03:41.030> as<00:03:41.239> ugly<00:03:41.480> as

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
perfectly honest it was about as ugly as

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.140

my<00:03:42.440> squat<00:03:42.800> has<00:03:43.040> looked<00:03:43.370> in<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:43.670> last<00:03:43.880> few

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150

my squat has looked in the last few
weeks<00:03:44.390> and<00:03:44.690> I<00:03:44.780> did<00:03:45.350> it<00:03:45.590> just<00:03:45.920> to<00:03:45.980> get<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.310> reps

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519

weeks and I did it just to get the reps
I<00:03:46.850> guess<00:03:47.180> is<00:03:47.450> is<00:03:47.810> my<00:03:47.989> only<00:03:48.170> excuse<00:03:48.650> for<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:49.010> you

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
I guess is is my only excuse for it you

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.710

know<00:03:49.190> just<00:03:49.519> to<00:03:49.640> get<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.880> reps<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.239> really<00:03:50.510> broke

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
know just to get the reps I really broke

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.740 
know just to get the reps I really broke
technique<00:03:51.700> but<00:03:52.700> ultimately<00:03:53.120> I<00:03:53.209> was<00:03:53.390> happy<00:03:53.660> to

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
technique but ultimately I was happy to

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.940
