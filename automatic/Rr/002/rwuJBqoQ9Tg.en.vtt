00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.219 
because you can put items like a phone
or<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> GPS<00:01:41.579> or<00:01:41.759> tools<00:01:42.450> here<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.140> to

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
or a GPS or tools here and not have to

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.300 
or a GPS or tools here and not have to
take<00:01:43.380> off<00:01:43.500> your<00:01:43.619> pack<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.920> order<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.189> access

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
take off your pack in order to access

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.010 
take off your pack in order to access
them<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.820> that's<00:01:44.970> nice<00:01:45.180> another<00:01:45.689> thing<00:01:45.899> is

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
them so that's nice another thing is

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.450 
them so that's nice another thing is
instead<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.710> mesh<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.009> would<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.310> this

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
instead of mesh I would have like this

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.550 
instead of mesh I would have like this
them<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.790> material<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.750> way<00:01:48.899> it

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
them in material just so that way it

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.660 
them in material just so that way it
would<00:01:49.710> protect<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> items<00:01:50.460> from<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
would protect the items from the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.620 
would protect the items from the
elements<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.329> I'll<00:01:52.079> take<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.350> as<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.619> get<00:01:52.770> it

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
elements but I'll take it as I get it

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.679 
elements but I'll take it as I get it
going<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> suspension<00:01:55.200> system<00:01:55.649> itself<00:01:56.689> it

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
going to the suspension system itself it

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.870 
going to the suspension system itself it
uses<00:01:58.140> what<00:01:58.619> Gregory<00:01:59.070> calls<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> Jetstream

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
uses what Gregory calls the Jetstream

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.340 
uses what Gregory calls the Jetstream
technology<00:02:00.390> basically<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.840> mean<00:02:01.079> you've<00:02:01.200> seen

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
technology basically I mean you've seen

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.319 
technology basically I mean you've seen
this<00:02:01.530> design<00:02:01.860> over<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.219> over<00:02:02.430> again<00:02:02.579> what<00:02:03.240> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
this design over and over again what you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.819 
this design over and over again what you
have<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.869> main<00:02:04.020> body<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.439> pack<00:02:04.619> is

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
have is the main body of the pack is

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.649 
have is the main body of the pack is
arched<00:02:05.159> away<00:02:05.430> from<00:02:05.670> your<00:02:05.790> body<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.479> then<00:02:06.630> you

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
arched away from your body and then you

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.869 
arched away from your body and then you
have<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.039> elastic<00:02:08.039> mesh<00:02:08.190> frame<00:02:08.399> sheet<00:02:08.670> that

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
have this elastic mesh frame sheet that

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.490 
have this elastic mesh frame sheet that
covers<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.869> way<00:02:09.959> you<00:02:10.020> have<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.229> air

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
covers so that way you have this air

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.410 
covers so that way you have this air
circulation<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.640> between<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.270> don't

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
circulation in between so that you don't

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.780 
circulation in between so that you don't
get<00:02:12.540> as<00:02:12.720> much<00:02:12.870> sweaty

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
get as much sweaty

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.220 
get as much sweaty
when<00:02:13.939> you're<00:02:14.090> wearing<00:02:14.450> this<00:02:14.629> pack<00:02:14.810> now<00:02:15.170> the

when you're wearing this pack now the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.309 
when you're wearing this pack now the
thing<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:15.620> this<00:02:15.799> is<00:02:15.950> only<00:02:16.069> for<00:02:16.459> say<00:02:17.450> half<00:02:18.290> the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
pack or 1/3 of the pack and then you

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.470 
pack or 1/3 of the pack and then you
still<00:02:20.959> have<00:02:21.140> these<00:02:21.610> back<00:02:22.610> cushion<00:02:22.970> plates<00:02:23.180> so

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
you won't get as much circulation but

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.440 
you won't get as much circulation but
the<00:02:25.220> one<00:02:25.340> bonus<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:25.879> is<00:02:26.030> you'll<00:02:26.180> get<00:02:26.299> this

now<00:04:43.290> I<00:04:43.320> said<00:04:43.680> this<00:04:43.770> was<00:04:43.950> a<00:04:43.979> top-line<00:04:44.370> design

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
now I said this was a top-line design

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.879 
now I said this was a top-line design
that's<00:04:44.940> half<00:04:45.150> true<00:04:45.180> this<00:04:45.960> is<00:04:45.990> a<00:04:46.110> bag<00:04:46.620> that<00:04:46.650> you

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
that's half true this is a bag that you

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.010 
that's half true this is a bag that you
can<00:04:47.070> treat<00:04:47.310> either<00:04:47.490> as<00:04:47.700> a<00:04:47.729> top<00:04:48.030> loader<00:04:48.270> or<00:04:48.540> as<00:04:48.990> a

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
can treat either as a top loader or as a

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.200 
can treat either as a top loader or as a
panel<00:04:49.410> loader<00:04:49.620> where<00:04:49.950> you<00:04:50.100> can<00:04:50.280> list<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.610> flat

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
panel loader where you can list the flat

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.170 
panel loader where you can list the flat
so<00:04:51.780> I<00:04:52.310> stick<00:04:53.310> things<00:04:53.520> through<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.789> top<00:04:53.970> here

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
so I stick things through the top here

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.550 
so I stick things through the top here
and<00:04:54.240> just<00:04:54.390> tree<00:04:54.510> it<00:04:54.570> like<00:04:54.690> a<00:04:54.720> top<00:04:54.900> loader<00:04:55.140> or<00:04:55.350> if

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
and just tree it like a top loader or if

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.550 
and just tree it like a top loader or if
you<00:04:55.650> don't<00:04:55.800> want<00:04:56.039> that<00:04:56.840> see<00:04:57.840> this<00:04:58.080> zipper<00:04:58.410> that

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.719 
you don't want that see this zipper that
goes<00:04:58.740> along<00:04:59.750> if<00:05:00.750> I<00:05:01.050> grab<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:02.010> zipper<00:05:02.250> pulls<00:05:02.580> on

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
goes along if I grab the zipper pulls on

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.120 
goes along if I grab the zipper pulls on
that<00:05:02.760> and<00:05:03.210> open<00:05:03.419> it<00:05:03.690> you'll<00:05:04.620> see<00:05:04.860> that<00:05:04.979> this

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
that and open it you'll see that this

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.830 
that and open it you'll see that this
can<00:05:05.460> also<00:05:05.640> be<00:05:05.850> treated<00:05:06.030> as<00:05:06.210> a<00:05:06.300> panel<00:05:06.660> loader

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840
