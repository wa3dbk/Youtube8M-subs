 doubt primarily considers himself the inventor of the large MPV 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.220
 you can talk about the merger there 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.490
 where every case is there has been very successful for more than twenty years 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.869
 The consumer oscars down is a new trend for inter should that 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.869
 already the 4 strength of each case 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.200
 according to the americans is at least a mini version of our sport 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.880
 for all 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.670
 a very large and 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.880
 heavy car 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.570
 but our standards 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.410
 it is striking that hard will be a moment later a contribution for the same amount 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.180
 bookings and it will become clear or more time by shortening the strikes 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.630
 then for indian movie ever you learn it was smooth 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.120
 That of course has a cause the one hand is that this is an example of this 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.490
 former tennis club a large square box component is only 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.380
 bring a living room 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.600
 on the other hand 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.200
 stress prices afterwards to make this model as timeless as possible this is one 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.200
 model will be an employee this year 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.390
 but the opponent there sometimes becomes room of the images for you do you want 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.660
 of course what we clapped 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.790
 but that is to be able to show that as an adult I imagine your child 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.460
 and can put comfortably 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.540
 many details by yes, most other models that they are against the will of the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.440
 be online 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.200
 what I absolutely do not understand is that especially in the American car possible 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.810
 is just like that 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.549
 the safety and security that things are 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:15.409
 that it is possible to hit the water without him without me blocking 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.269
 from the old toll that i used an english and in a decadent 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.800
 imagine, for example, with this point that your children will be left behind in your car 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:25.439
 and she did 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.439
 and then about it 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.530
 just before that with the pvv by the big three, this is expected to be a v6 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.719
 gasoline engine 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:56.419
 These the following parts of these costs are the rainy weather they 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:57.049
 less 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.539
 become animals 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:01.489
 that is quite a strong will 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.989
 but not in a van by working hard 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.879
 for this reason, these crops no longer drive in motion 21 out of 75 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.129
 kilometers 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.579
 and that is a pity that you always feel it is a very big heavy car 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:18.949
 in dealing with it meant that if you record a turn that is yes 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.079
 the roundabout 55 miles per hour 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.549
 to put the big drought on a WC again, there he belongs 4 in us 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.739
 small dutch 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.739
 it is actually a bit 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:42.679
 to respect 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:46.439
 when we are told that this is of course a huge interior space 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.379
 that has been added compared to the previous generation is that the seating comfort 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.049
 on these rear seats is much better than before 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.970
 the big question is only to what extent this kind of motorway has a future 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:01.000
 what nowadays a little more sporting the so-called cross over 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:04.150
 on the other hand, if plaster is the only one of this kind 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.620
 mistakes continue to make the idea for care still a decent one 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.090
 future
