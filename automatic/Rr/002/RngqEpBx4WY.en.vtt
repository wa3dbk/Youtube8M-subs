welcome everybody it's raining Schaefer
what<00:00:09.330> I'm<00:00:09.420> going<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.570> do<00:00:09.719> here<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.639> just<00:00:11.639> do

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
what I'm going to do here is just do

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.720 
what I'm going to do here is just do
some<00:00:12.450> really<00:00:12.780> basic<00:00:13.019> simple<00:00:13.980> color<00:00:14.219> mixing

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
some really basic simple color mixing

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.109 
some really basic simple color mixing
for<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.809> absolute<00:00:16.470> beginner<00:00:16.859> just<00:00:17.130> make<00:00:18.090> a

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
for the absolute beginner just make a

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.260 
for the absolute beginner just make a
quick<00:00:18.359> video<00:00:19.279> because<00:00:20.279> I'm<00:00:20.550> sure<00:00:21.000> there's<00:00:21.210> a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
quick video because I'm sure there's a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.370 
quick video because I'm sure there's a
lot<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.480> people<00:00:21.689> out<00:00:21.810> there<00:00:21.990> still<00:00:22.170> using

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
lot of people out there still using

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.910 
lot of people out there still using
green<00:00:23.010> out<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.400> tube<00:00:24.199> etc<00:00:25.199> other<00:00:25.439> colors

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
green out of the tube etc other colors

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.480 
green out of the tube etc other colors
straight<00:00:26.220> out<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.580> tube<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.140> you<00:00:28.369> know<00:00:29.369> by

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
straight out of the tube and you know by

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.910 
straight out of the tube and you know by
limiting<00:00:29.939> you're<00:00:30.090> limiting<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.140> color<00:00:31.529> palette

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
limiting you're limiting a color palette

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.500 
limiting you're limiting a color palette
it's<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.040> great<00:00:35.280> exercise<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.090> it's<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.270> great

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
it's a great exercise and it's a great

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.380 
it's a great exercise and it's a great
way<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.690> paint<00:00:37.790> because<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> different

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
way to paint because of the different

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.930 
way to paint because of the different
colors<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.020> values<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.399> practice<00:00:41.820> of

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
colors and values and the practice of

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.350 
colors and values and the practice of
color<00:00:42.180> mixing<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.579> let's<00:00:44.579> get<00:00:44.730> into<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.180> have

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
color mixing so let's get into it I have

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.369 
color mixing so let's get into it I have
red<00:00:45.719> yellow<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:47.329> ultramarine<00:00:48.329> blue<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:49.200> be

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
red yellow and ultramarine blue to be

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.430 
red yellow and ultramarine blue to be
specific<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:52.760> let's<00:00:53.760> get<00:00:53.910> into<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.440> simple

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
specific so let's get into the simple

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
specific so let's get into the simple
color<00:00:55.649> Theory<00:00:56.070> here<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.489> here's<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:58.460> I'm

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
color Theory here and here's the I'm

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.920 
color Theory here and here's the I'm
kind<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.789> too<00:00:59.910> zoomed<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.449> see<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.629> but

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
kind of too zoomed in to see that but

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.920 
kind of too zoomed in to see that but
there's<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.260> color<00:01:01.500> wheel<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.780> I'll<00:01:03.780> get

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
there's the color wheel and I'll get

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.300 
there's the color wheel and I'll get
into<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.199> after<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.619> mix<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.100> up<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.400> guess<00:01:07.310> so

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
into that after I mix it up I guess so

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.899 
into that after I mix it up I guess so
by<00:01:09.180> taking<00:01:09.390> red<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.229> little<00:01:11.189> bit<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.520> red<00:01:11.700> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
by taking red a little bit of red and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.499 
by taking red a little bit of red and
yellow<00:01:13.310> most<00:01:14.310> people<00:01:14.640> should<00:01:14.790> know<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.210> but

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
yellow most people should know this but

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.410 
yellow most people should know this but
I'm<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:15.840> going<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.229> do<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:18.119> sake<00:01:18.390> of

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
I'm just going to do it for the sake of

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.499 
I'm just going to do it for the sake of
this<00:01:18.689> color<00:01:18.990> theory<00:01:19.500> series<00:01:23.270> mixing<00:01:24.270> red<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
this color theory series mixing red and

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:36.130 
this color theory series mixing red and
yellow<00:01:25.909> gives<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.090> orange<00:01:29.299> very<00:01:30.299> basic

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.420 

so<00:01:36.710> there<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:37.160> go<00:01:38.710> you<00:01:39.710> know<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:39.920> depends<00:01:40.310> on

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
so there you go you know it depends on

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.970 
so there you go you know it depends on
you<00:01:41.120> know<00:01:41.210> if<00:01:41.300> you<00:01:41.390> add<00:01:41.570> more<00:01:41.840> red<00:01:42.080> to<00:01:42.830> it

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
you know if you add more red to it

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.320 
you know if you add more red to it
you'll<00:01:43.130> get<00:01:43.220> a<00:01:43.280> red<00:01:43.460> orange<00:01:43.820> if<00:01:43.910> you<00:01:44.030> add<00:01:44.120> more

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
you'll get a red orange if you add more

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.750 
you'll get a red orange if you add more
yellow<00:01:44.450> you<00:01:44.780> get<00:01:44.900> a<00:01:44.960> yellow<00:01:45.200> orange<00:01:48.760> so

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
yellow you get a yellow orange so

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.040 
yellow you get a yellow orange so
there's<00:01:50.060> orange<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:53.090> let<00:01:53.210> me<00:01:53.300> let<00:01:53.690> me<00:01:53.810> point

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
there's orange and let me let me point

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.140 
there's orange and let me let me point
out<00:01:54.260> that<00:01:54.320> these<00:01:54.890> three<00:01:55.220> colors<00:01:55.580> are<00:01:55.820> the

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
out that these three colors are the

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.230 
out that these three colors are the
primary<00:01:56.870> colors<00:01:57.290> on<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.680> color<00:01:57.860> wheel<00:02:01.240> and

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
primary colors on the color wheel and

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.270 
primary colors on the color wheel and
that's<00:02:02.479> how<00:02:02.660> you<00:02:02.720> make<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.229> secondary<00:02:03.950> colors

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
that's how you make the secondary colors

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.180 
that's how you make the secondary colors
which<00:02:04.580> comprise<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.330> orange<00:02:05.870> purple<00:02:06.860> and

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
which comprise of orange purple and

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.420 
which comprise of orange purple and
green<00:02:09.250> so<00:02:10.250> now<00:02:10.580> we're<00:02:10.700> going<00:02:10.790> to<00:02:10.850> mix<00:02:10.970> up<00:02:12.430> let's

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
green so now we're going to mix up let's

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.050 
green so now we're going to mix up let's
do<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.760> red<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.090> blue<00:02:14.270> here<00:02:16.030> red<00:02:17.030> and

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
do the red and blue here red and

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.560 
do the red and blue here red and
ultramarine<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:21.850> depending<00:02:22.850> on<00:02:22.910> how<00:02:23.150> much<00:02:23.360> of

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
ultramarine and depending on how much of

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.850 
ultramarine and depending on how much of
each<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.959> put<00:02:24.230> in<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.590> could<00:02:24.770> get<00:02:25.209> red<00:02:26.860> violet

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
each you put in you could get red violet

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.810 
each you put in you could get red violet
or<00:02:28.040> blue<00:02:28.239> violet<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:33.230> that's<00:02:34.190> where<00:02:34.400> warm<00:02:34.640> and

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
or blue violet and that's where warm and

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.820 
or blue violet and that's where warm and
cool<00:02:34.970> colors<00:02:35.239> and<00:02:35.750> color<00:02:36.020> temperature<00:02:36.260> comes

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
cool colors and color temperature comes

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.780 
cool colors and color temperature comes
into<00:02:37.100> play<00:02:37.340> but<00:02:38.180> for<00:02:38.330> now<00:02:38.450> we'll<00:02:38.630> just<00:02:38.660> mix<00:02:39.020> up

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
into play but for now we'll just mix up

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:48.880 
into play but for now we'll just mix up
now<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.820> regular<00:02:41.060> purple<00:02:41.830> violet<00:02:42.830> there<00:02:47.890> so

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
now a regular purple violet there so

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.340 
now a regular purple violet there so
there<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.310> is

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
there it is

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.650 
there it is
it's<00:02:51.350> kind<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.620> dark<00:02:51.830> so<00:02:52.549> maybe<00:02:53.540> hard<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.959> see

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
it's kind of dark so maybe hard to see

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.270 
it's kind of dark so maybe hard to see
the<00:02:56.660> actual<00:02:56.989> color<00:02:59.049> all<00:03:00.049> right<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:00.620> next<00:03:00.890> let

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
the actual color all right so next let

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
blue and yellow that will give us green

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.660 
blue and yellow that will give us green
now<00:03:25.670> there<00:03:26.030> is<00:03:26.299> the<00:03:26.600> basic<00:03:28.180> very<00:03:29.180> basic<00:03:30.670> color

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.140 

and<00:03:42.620> I<00:03:42.769> recommend<00:03:43.070> if<00:03:43.370> you're<00:03:43.730> still<00:03:44.000> using

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
and I recommend if you're still using

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.770 
and I recommend if you're still using
green<00:03:44.510> out<00:03:44.690> of<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.900> tube<00:03:45.140> to<00:03:46.270> stop<00:03:47.270> using<00:03:47.510> it

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
green out of the tube to stop using it

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.320 
green out of the tube to stop using it
immediately

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
immediately

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.370 
immediately
I<00:03:51.150> mean<00:03:52.150> that's<00:03:52.360> fine<00:03:52.630> using<00:03:53.110> all<00:03:53.230> these

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
I mean that's fine using all these

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.020 
I mean that's fine using all these
others<00:03:53.650> you<00:03:53.800> know<00:03:53.950> using<00:03:54.310> a<00:03:54.400> purple<00:03:54.640> already

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
others you know using a purple already

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.150 
others you know using a purple already
out<00:03:55.150> of<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.330> tube<00:03:55.570> and<00:03:55.810> in<00:03:55.900> all<00:03:56.020> I<00:03:56.050> mean<00:03:56.170> it's

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
out of the tube and in all I mean it's

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.360 
out of the tube and in all I mean it's
okay<00:03:57.580> but<00:03:58.150> you<00:03:58.960> have<00:03:59.110> much<00:03:59.320> more<00:03:59.350> control<00:03:59.590> I

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
okay but you have much more control I

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.580 
okay but you have much more control I
believe<00:04:00.580> when<00:04:01.450> you<00:04:01.480> just<00:04:01.870> stick<00:04:02.170> with<00:04:02.350> the

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
believe when you just stick with the

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.080 
believe when you just stick with the
primary<00:04:02.860> colors<00:04:04.350> you<00:04:05.350> know<00:04:05.470> do<00:04:06.130> with<00:04:06.280> do<00:04:06.580> ten

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
primary colors you know do with do ten

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.520 
primary colors you know do with do ten
or<00:04:07.270> twenty<00:04:07.570> paintings<00:04:07.960> just<00:04:08.140> using<00:04:08.470> the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
or twenty paintings just using the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.440 
or twenty paintings just using the
primary<00:04:08.950> colors<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.310> see<00:04:09.670> how<00:04:09.820> you<00:04:09.880> do<00:04:10.150> and

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
primary colors and see how you do and

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.020 
primary colors and see how you do and
see<00:04:11.050> how<00:04:11.200> your<00:04:11.380> color<00:04:11.590> your<00:04:12.340> eye<00:04:12.370> for<00:04:12.580> color

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
see how your color your eye for color

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.220 
see how your color your eye for color
will<00:04:13.300> improve<00:04:13.920> so<00:04:14.920> I<00:04:15.959> recommend<00:04:16.959> doing<00:04:17.049> that

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
will improve so I recommend doing that

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.140 
will improve so I recommend doing that

years or something hopefully I'd thrown

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.670 
years or something hopefully I'd thrown
some<00:04:58.390> points<00:04:58.720> there<00:04:58.870> that<00:04:58.930> made<00:04:59.410> some<00:04:59.650> sense

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
some points there that made some sense

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.680 
some points there that made some sense
and<00:05:00.250> sometimes<00:05:00.760> it<00:05:00.910> helps<00:05:01.000> to<00:05:01.240> go<00:05:01.330> back<00:05:01.540> to

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
and sometimes it helps to go back to

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.590 
and sometimes it helps to go back to
basics<00:05:02.140> and<00:05:02.700> start<00:05:03.700> from<00:05:03.790> the<00:05:03.910> ground<00:05:04.030> up<00:05:04.330> and

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
basics and start from the ground up and

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.040
