fitting<00:00:13.559> for<00:00:13.860> Bruce<00:00:14.280> Willis<00:00:14.639> that's<00:00:14.969> what<00:00:15.150> I

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
fitting for Bruce Willis that's what I

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.849 
fitting for Bruce Willis that's what I
called<00:00:15.480> my<00:00:15.660> Armageddon<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.320> think<00:00:16.529> it's<00:00:16.650> pretty

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
called my Armageddon I think it's pretty

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.420 
called my Armageddon I think it's pretty
apt<00:00:17.330> when<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.480> know<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.840> movie<00:00:19.230> but<00:00:19.890> let's

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
apt when you know the movie but let's

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.490 
apt when you know the movie but let's
start<00:00:20.670> with<00:00:20.760> hi<00:00:21.090> slots<00:00:21.390> here<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.900> first<00:00:22.380> of

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
start with hi slots here and first of

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.259 
start with hi slots here and first of
all<00:00:22.590> we<00:00:22.740> have<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.890> large<00:00:23.340> remote<00:00:23.730> armor<00:00:24.150> repair

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
all we have a large remote armor repair

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.920 
all we have a large remote armor repair
to<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.380> idea<00:00:25.740> here<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.310> if<00:00:27.269> we<00:00:27.539> do<00:00:27.720> get

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
to the idea here is that if we do get

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.720 
to the idea here is that if we do get
into<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.260> PvP<00:00:28.800> engagement<00:00:29.400> with<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
into a PvP engagement with the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.179 
into a PvP engagement with the
battleship<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:31.080> far<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:31.560> always<00:00:31.980> been

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
battleship so far it's always been

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.310 
battleship so far it's always been
against<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.969> small<00:00:33.329> gang<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.840> tech<00:00:34.110> tree

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
against a small gang of tech tree

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.590 
against a small gang of tech tree
cruisers<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.070> some<00:00:35.399> other<00:00:35.640> cruisers<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
cruisers and some other cruisers and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.569 
cruisers and some other cruisers and
battle<00:00:36.809> cruisers<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.410> hope<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.399> we<00:00:38.550> can

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
battle cruisers the hope is that we can

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.819 
battle cruisers the hope is that we can
buy<00:00:39.000> enough<00:00:39.300> time<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.719> get<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> second<00:00:40.290> second

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
buy enough time to get a second second

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.830 
buy enough time to get a second second
battleship<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.550> field<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.059> then<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.570> do

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
battleship on the field and then we do

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.319 
battleship on the field and then we do
feel<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.620> bit<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.010> spider<00:00:44.309> tanking<00:00:44.820> can

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
feel that a bit of spider tanking can

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.850 
feel that a bit of spider tanking can
actually<00:00:45.690> make<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> really<00:00:46.410> big<00:00:46.620> difference

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
actually make a really big difference

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.610 
actually make a really big difference
especially<00:00:47.600> considering<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.660> gap<00:00:49.079> warfare

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
especially considering that gap warfare

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.529 
especially considering that gap warfare
has<00:00:49.829> really<00:00:50.160> been<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.309> deciding<00:00:50.910> factor<00:00:51.300> so

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
has really been the deciding factor so

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.200 
has really been the deciding factor so
far<00:00:52.039> next<00:00:53.039> up<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.340> have<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:56.000> neutralizer

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
far next up we have a neutralizer

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.139 
far next up we have a neutralizer
so<00:00:57.570> neutralizes<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> portion<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.309> energy

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
so neutralizes a portion of the energy

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.950 
so neutralizes a portion of the energy
in<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.719> target<00:01:01.590> ships<00:01:01.829> capacitor<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:03.539> army

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
in the target ships capacitor the army

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.810 
in the target ships capacitor the army
given<00:01:04.170> has<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> bonus<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.070> it's<00:01:05.400> not<00:01:05.790> a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
given has a bonus for this it's not a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.880 
given has a bonus for this it's not a
tech<00:01:06.090> -<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.570> think<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.320> because<00:01:07.710> we

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
tech - I think that just because we

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.980 
tech - I think that just because we
bought<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.640> number<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.180> meta<00:01:09.540> trees<00:01:09.810> and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
bought a number of meta trees and

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.990 
bought a number of meta trees and
metaphors<00:01:10.470> brought<00:01:10.740> them<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:10.979> overall<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.970> so

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
metaphors brought them in overall and so

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.609 
metaphors brought them in overall and so
we're<00:01:12.570> still<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> process<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.439> using

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
we're still in the process of using

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.640 
we're still in the process of using
those<00:01:14.479> but<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.630> only<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.140> them<00:01:16.409> this

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
those but it's only one of them this

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.130 
those but it's only one of them this
time<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.220> went<00:01:17.610> with<00:01:17.820> three<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.390> them<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
time I went with three of them on the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.010 
time I went with three of them on the
Dominik's<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.119> while<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.750> very

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
Dominik's and while this can be very

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.960 
Dominik's and while this can be very
powerful<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.860> problem<00:01:23.340> I've<00:01:23.490> had<00:01:23.520> with<00:01:23.850> this

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
powerful the problem I've had with this

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.330 
powerful the problem I've had with this
is<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.630> try<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.200> new<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> target<00:01:26.189> and

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
is that I try to new that the target and

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.370 
is that I try to new that the target and
also<00:01:26.670> don't<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:27.270> my<00:01:27.450> cap<00:01:27.689> was<00:01:27.720> gone<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.290> I

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
also don't have my cap was gone and I

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.340 
also don't have my cap was gone and I
couldn't<00:01:28.710> armor<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.759> comfortably<00:01:30.509> anymore<00:01:31.049> so

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
couldn't armor up comfortably anymore so

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.219 
couldn't armor up comfortably anymore so
I<00:01:31.560> actually<00:01:31.920> feel<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.880> them<00:01:33.229> should

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
I actually feel that one of them should

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.800 
I actually feel that one of them should
be<00:01:34.259> enough<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:35.009> neut<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.729> target<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.390> has<00:01:36.570> like

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
be enough to neut a target that has like

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
be enough to neut a target that has like
a<00:01:36.840> high<00:01:37.049> priority<00:01:37.350> or<00:01:37.950> that's<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.310> real<00:01:38.460> problem

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
a high priority or that's a real problem

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.270 
a high priority or that's a real problem
and<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.350> why<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:40.979> one<00:01:41.159> of

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
and so this is why we have just one of

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.480 
and so this is why we have just one of
them<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.689> five<00:01:43.409> rip<00:01:43.890> rapid

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
them here but we do have five rip rapid

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.580 
them here but we do have five rip rapid

counter smaller combat ships it has

counter smaller combat ships it has
frigates<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.299> cruisers<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.890> really

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
frigates and cruisers so that is really

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.510 
frigates and cruisers so that is really

take three cruisers or up to a battle

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.630 
take three cruisers or up to a battle
cruiser<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.619> have<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.799> very<00:02:08.129> high<00:02:08.399> rate

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.229 
of fire and very long reload time as
well<00:02:10.530> but<00:02:11.220> what<00:02:11.550> we're<00:02:11.730> hoping<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.150> achieve

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
well but what we're hoping to achieve

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.880 
well but what we're hoping to achieve
with<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.810> is

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
with this is

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.940 
with this is
and<00:02:14.310> IV<00:02:14.610> can<00:02:15.120> basically<00:02:15.330> overwhelm<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.650> first

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
and IV can basically overwhelm the first

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.690 
and IV can basically overwhelm the first
target<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.790> we<00:02:18.060> managed<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.750> catch<00:02:19.460> and<00:02:20.460> that

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
target that we managed to catch and that

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.000 
target that we managed to catch and that
is<00:02:20.910> hopefully<00:02:21.330> what<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.630> what<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.560> rapid

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
is hopefully what the what is rapid

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.620 
is hopefully what the what is rapid
heavy<00:02:23.160> missile<00:02:23.640> launchers<00:02:24.030> will<00:02:24.210> bring<00:02:24.480> to

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
heavy missile launchers will bring to

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.160 
heavy missile launchers will bring to
the<00:02:24.660> table<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:26.010> Caldari<00:02:26.580> Navy<00:02:27.000> Nova's<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.750> for

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
the table the Caldari Navy Nova's is for

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.830 
the table the Caldari Navy Nova's is for
the<00:02:28.290> explosive<00:02:28.920> damage<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.940> idea<00:02:30.300> here<00:02:30.660> is

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
the explosive damage the idea here is

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.990 
the explosive damage the idea here is
that<00:02:30.870> if<00:02:31.440> we<00:02:31.860> happen<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.190> come<00:02:32.400> across<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.700> ship

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
that if we happen to come across a ship

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.060 
that if we happen to come across a ship
that's<00:02:33.150> not<00:02:33.510> thanked<00:02:34.020> very<00:02:34.200> well<00:02:34.470> it's<00:02:34.860> very

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
that's not thanked very well it's very

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.880 
that's not thanked very well it's very
likely<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:36.210> have<00:02:36.330> an<00:02:36.480> explosive<00:02:37.110> gap<00:02:37.560> so

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
likely to have an explosive gap so

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.070 
likely to have an explosive gap so
that's<00:02:38.130> why<00:02:38.310> we<00:02:38.490> went<00:02:38.610> with<00:02:38.760> these<00:02:39.000> missiles

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
that's why we went with these missiles

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.370 
that's why we went with these missiles
next<00:02:40.830> up<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.100> mid<00:02:41.250> slots<00:02:41.520> we<00:02:42.180> have<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.600> 100mm

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
next up the mid slots we have a 100mm

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.590 
next up the mid slots we have a 100mm
afterburner<00:02:44.100> why<00:02:44.580> not<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.820> microwave<00:02:45.330> drive

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
afterburner why not a microwave drive

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.470 
afterburner why not a microwave drive
the<00:02:46.110> idea<00:02:46.470> here<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:46.890> we<00:02:47.430> want<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:48.150> catch<00:02:48.360> a

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
the idea here is we want to catch a

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.070 
the idea here is we want to catch a
target<00:02:48.870> close<00:02:49.170> range<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:50.390> if<00:02:51.390> they<00:02:51.660> happen<00:02:52.020> to

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
target close range and if they happen to

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.500 
target close range and if they happen to
have<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.290> scram<00:02:52.680> on<00:02:52.830> there<00:02:53.010> as<00:02:53.160> well<00:02:53.510> an

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
have a scram on there as well an

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.960 
have a scram on there as well an
afterburner<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.440> making<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.520> more<00:02:56.700> likely

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
afterburner is making it more likely

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.560 
afterburner is making it more likely
that<00:02:57.120> we'll<00:02:57.450> be<00:02:57.570> able<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.810> stay<00:02:58.110> in<00:02:58.140> range

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
that we'll be able to stay in range

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.820 
that we'll be able to stay in range
compared<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.690> having<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:01.050> microbe<00:03:01.440> drive<00:03:01.650> that

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
compared to having a microbe drive that

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.410 
compared to having a microbe drive that
would<00:03:01.920> be<00:03:02.100> non-functional<00:03:02.760> if<00:03:03.120> they<00:03:03.239> also

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
would be non-functional if they also

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.820 
would be non-functional if they also
have<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.660> scram<00:03:03.989> in<00:03:04.140> there<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.410> then<00:03:04.500> something

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
have a scram in there and then something

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.380 
have a scram in there and then something
like<00:03:04.860> if<00:03:05.100> fast<00:03:05.340> Cruiser<00:03:05.610> could<00:03:05.910> actually<00:03:06.030> get

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
like if fast Cruiser could actually get

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.650 
like if fast Cruiser could actually get
away<00:03:06.510> from<00:03:06.690> us<00:03:07.020> then<00:03:07.739> we<00:03:08.190> have<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.340> scram<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.150> a

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
away from us then we have a scram and a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.199 
away from us then we have a scram and a
wet<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.200> idea<00:03:10.530> here<00:03:10.800> again<00:03:11.100> catch<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.820> target

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
wet the idea here again catch the target

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.729 
wet the idea here again catch the target
stay<00:03:12.510> right<00:03:12.780> on<00:03:12.840> top<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.590> then

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
stay right on top of it and then

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.760 
stay right on top of it and then
overwhelm<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.430> with<00:03:14.670> ogres<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.330> with<00:03:15.770> with

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
overwhelm it with ogres and with with

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.039 
overwhelm it with ogres and with with
the<00:03:16.860> rabbit<00:03:17.130> having<00:03:17.370> missile<00:03:17.640> launchers<00:03:18.060> the

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
the rabbit having missile launchers the

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.050 
the rabbit having missile launchers the
one<00:03:19.200> big<00:03:19.739> novelty<00:03:20.160> here<00:03:20.459> compared<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:20.910> the

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
one big novelty here compared to the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.600 
one big novelty here compared to the
Dominic's<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.600> course<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.890> gap<00:03:23.160> booster

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
Dominic's of course the the gap booster

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.199 
Dominic's of course the the gap booster
which<00:03:24.209> again<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.799> has<00:03:26.070> been<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.310> gap<00:03:26.610> warfare

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
which again it has been a gap warfare

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.699 
which again it has been a gap warfare
that's<00:03:27.450> really<00:03:27.690> become<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.170> deciding

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
that's really become the deciding

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.039 
that's really become the deciding
factors<00:03:29.160> when<00:03:29.820> we<00:03:29.970> had<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.269> go<00:03:30.420> up<00:03:30.510> against<00:03:30.870> a

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
factors when we had to go up against a

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.190 
factors when we had to go up against a
larger<00:03:31.590> group<00:03:32.180> with<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.299> battleships<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.049> so

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
larger group with the battleships and so

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.810 
larger group with the battleships and so
this<00:03:34.380> is<00:03:34.500> why<00:03:34.650> now<00:03:34.860> we're<00:03:35.100> gonna<00:03:35.280> try<00:03:35.549> with<00:03:35.610> the

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
this is why now we're gonna try with the

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.460 
this is why now we're gonna try with the
caboose<00:03:36.209> or<00:03:36.390> try<00:03:36.600> to<00:03:36.660> survive<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.170> little<00:03:37.350> bit

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
caboose or try to survive a little bit

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.550 
caboose or try to survive a little bit
longer<00:03:37.790> hopefully<00:03:38.790> buy<00:03:39.120> enough<00:03:39.510> time<00:03:39.560> for

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
longer hopefully buy enough time for

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.770 
longer hopefully buy enough time for
another<00:03:41.370> battleship<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.060> come<00:03:42.209> on<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:42.420> fields

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
another battleship to come on the fields

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.660 
another battleship to come on the fields
maybe<00:03:42.930> do<00:03:43.140> some<00:03:43.350> remote<00:03:43.650> reps<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.220> just

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
maybe do some remote reps and just

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.030 
maybe do some remote reps and just
basically<00:03:45.000> turn<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.049> fight<00:03:46.290> around<00:03:46.500> but<00:03:46.890> we

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
basically turn the fight around but we

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.520 
basically turn the fight around but we
do<00:03:47.220> need<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.600> bit<00:03:48.810> of<00:03:48.900> extra<00:03:49.290> time<00:03:49.470> and

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
do need that that bit of extra time and

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.650 
do need that that bit of extra time and
hopefully<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:50.190> cap<00:03:50.519> booster<00:03:50.670> can<00:03:51.060> buy<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:51.420> for

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
hopefully a cap booster can buy that for

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.890 
hopefully a cap booster can buy that for
us<00:03:51.810> low<00:03:52.739> slots<00:03:53.100> is<00:03:53.340> pretty<00:03:54.209> standard<00:03:54.510> here

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
us low slots is pretty standard here

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.050 
us low slots is pretty standard here

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000

actually $26 to when I'm in a fleet I

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.820 
actually $26 to when I'm in a fleet I
guess<00:04:35.700> we<00:04:36.000> get<00:04:36.150> like<00:04:36.330> a<00:04:36.360> bit<00:04:36.540> of<00:04:36.570> a<00:04:36.720> bonus<00:04:36.990> when

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
guess we get like a bit of a bonus when

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.490
