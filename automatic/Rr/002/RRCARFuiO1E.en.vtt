00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.410
 hundreds of options until you reach the 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.139
 hard box decide what weighs most in the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.150
 time to choose what to take home the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.199
 what weighs is the quality 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.300
 I'm sure I'm looking for a judge 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.640
 integer expiration date 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.830
 giovanna also take this care in 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.529
 choice but does not leave aside the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.990
 Which trust do I want in my house? 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.240
 not only who I trust and know the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.149
 food and beverage industry invests 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.989
 increasingly in primary care to 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.680
 security in coca cola one is different 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.320
 I'm just one of the biggest factories in the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.020
 Brazil 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.309
 here are more than three thousand employees 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.860
 working on ten production lines 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.660
 with the supervision of machines son of 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.390
 watchful eyes 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.719
 a world that does not stop and where the word 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.670
 order and quality 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.660
 care begins on the arrival of the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.579
 packaging 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.890
 Carol checks to see if the can is 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.540
 completely organized this is 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.760
 important so that the drink does not enter 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.619
 in contact with the aluminum if the can 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.400
 be disapproved it goes straight to the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.500
 trash 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.990
 all packaging goes through this 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.080
 laboratory including tubes that 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.909
 They will turn bottles later. 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.369
 then from here they go to the wash 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.770
 when the packaging is new it is 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.600
 cleaning equipment rinse 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.430
 and chlorinated water solution 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.310
 packaging has already been used as is 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.180
 the case of returnable care is still 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.030
 bigger 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.939
 This is a super washer I'm the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.880
 bottle she stays for at least ten minutes 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.060
 with components such as high temperature 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.970
 and a wash at the end of it with water 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.880
 extremely treaty thinking that now 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.070
 just fill in fractions of seconds 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.140
 electronic inspector photographs each 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.049
 packaging if there is still any 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.280
 I suggest a defect, the bottle is expelled from the 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.880
 production line 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:12.060
 now it's time to fill up thinking one 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.890
 even thinner thin tube with a tube 4 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.260
 millimeters in diameter 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.900
 It is because of this tube that is made with 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.180
 in a channel so narrow that it only allows 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.360
 the passage of liquid 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.670
 then only the bottle cap is so 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.260
 that you may not see as a 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.320
 blink of an eye 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.630
 Escou closed at the end of the production line 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.390
 plus an electronic inspector makes the 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.130
 packaging checks are the ones that 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.220
 for example check whether the cover is 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.850
 completely closed and only what happens 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.400
 in the test goes to the warehouse in the stores is 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.380
 important to be aware of the label there 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.500
 have all the information to preserve 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.790
 the care taken at the factory 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.320
 important to follow in order not to 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.140
 change product characteristics 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.600
 processing industries 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.420
 In general, they have a very 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.940
 efficient manner on this yes all 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.250
 problems after contamination 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.580
 processing and not to it sometimes in the 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.900
 house of the people behind this food 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.680
 industrialized 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:20.610
 there is a security that surely brings 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.690
 directly to nutrition 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.150
 balanced 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.460
 population of the prison to keep this 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.130
 quality standards followed in the factories 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.370
 of coca cola in more than 200 countries 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.850
 coca cola brazil invests heavily in 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.620
 technology 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.680
 but that's not all that makes the difference 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.300
 really the day to day is the quality of the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.070
 people as she follows the procedures 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.810
 how does she commit to that 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.120
 result as they give their best 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.670
 to deliver a product of the highest 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.320
 very high quality level 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.870
 in the last three years coca cola brazil 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.080
 and its suppliers were responsible 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.000
 for 75% of the requests to the 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.260
 certification in the security sector 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.150
 to feed 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.700
 it is as if it were a seal an organ 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.280
 independent visiting companies to 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.740
 dictates and controls all processes 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.360
 parameters and procedures but not 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.400
 are only those bodies that accompany the 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.460
 the quality of what is done in the 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.460
 company 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.370
 Coca-Cola factories are open to 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.980
 public 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.430
 If you want to arrive, just schedule a visit. 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.610
 as carlos eduardo and alessandro did 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.890
 opportunity to come and see live and 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.760
 people did not waste time did not have much 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:40.169
 notion as was the security process 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:44.130
 and cleanliness in the sanitation I found the 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:46.590
 very thorough process and vision of the 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.830
 the same total quality of the product 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.540
 very high but the duo prioritize even the 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.540
 perfection and found it very interesting
