00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.639
 Welcome youtube channel paisana 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.320
 code tv I am sergio you can me 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.029
 find on twitter by arroba es navas 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.029
 10 and today we are going to do a review for 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.710
 all the news from ios 7.0 point 3 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.420
 we already announce you in our networks 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.670
 social that was already available for 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.530
 its actualization, the truth is that already 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.539
 we have tested what we have tested during 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.130
 a couple of days and we can tell you a 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.050
 what are the news and how 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.910
 they work more or less not so in this 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.860
 video let's talk about everything snow 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.100
 canary in 7 and especially of the 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.989
 news of ios 7.0 point 3 we started 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.930
 talking on the keychain this new 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.059
 function that is integrated in ios with the 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.030
 icloud and that we can also access 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.770
 she from the mac with mac os x mavericks 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.500
 it's a new function that they have put into 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.410
 ios 7.0 point 3 that allows us to save 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.360
 all our passwords in icloud the 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.010
 wifi password and password 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.320
 user of our internet data 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.299
 In addition, our bank cards are 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.979
 completely safe as you are going to read 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.770
 right now to activate it you have to go 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.969
 to the adjustments you have to go to icloud and 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.830
 from here chop those that we have the 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:13.450
 keychain option is this from here 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.789
 we simply enter and activate it 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.380
 and as you see here puts hold the 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.810
 passwords and card data 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.880
 of credit updated in all 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.189
 devices that approve that information 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.200
 will be encrypted and support will not be able 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.390
 reading this means that all 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.220
 wifi passwords and user data 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.470
 credit cards all information 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.000
 that we put here is going to go to icloud and 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.710
 it's going to be encrypted, so we're going 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.750
 to have it on all devices 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.060
 apple that have access to the cloud by 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.140
 course and good the data are going to be 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.509
 quite safe because supposedly 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.580
 apple can not read anything at risk by 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.039
 if you have x mavericks you will see 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.569
 where do you have to configure the keychain 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.189
 you have to the settings so 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:54.250
 simple as go to preferences of the 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.840
 You are going to icloud and from here 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.610
 when you activate on a keychain you will have to 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.560
 verify that everything is correct 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.720
 just from here it says a click 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.399
 verify 'aces' and that's it from 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.679
 here if you want to see the passwords of 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.920
 You simply you are going to Key Chain 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.360
 access to keychains what is this from here and 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.430
 from here, rogues that you will be able to see 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.380
 all your passwords appear 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.180
 all certificates appear 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.889
 passwords of water and as you are seeing 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.080
 agree everything you have in 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:21.700
 your iphone for example you are going to have it 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.530
 in your sea I also want to highlight 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.330
 that there are three new functions for a 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.340
 side in the spotlight lohan vitaminado and 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.440
 we can again search the internet and 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.750
 also in wikipedia they have also 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.610
 improved iwork because it was incompatible 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.720
 we already explained you on our website 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.820
 is and senados dot net 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.400
 what of the blue screen on the iphone 5 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.280
 that was also known that there are my six 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.630
 It gave problems in ios 7 because it seems that 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.190
 they have solved it there will not be 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.500
 no type of problem or activation 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.480
 nor will messages be lost along the way and 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.670
 one of the things that I like the most 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.170
 love the new option of reducing 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.260
 movements an option that we already had 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.060
 in ios 7 but I did not do the same now 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.290
 much better because I'll explain 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.760
 and I 'm going to show you a little bit what they are 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.440
 the news as I tell you one of the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.900
 new functions is to reduce the 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.490
 movement you have that adjustments you have 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.010
 to go or leave here you have to go 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.300
 to general you are going to accessibility and 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.760
 from here you have a new option that 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.280
 it's called reducing movement this option 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.810
 if you have it off you have the 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.360
 default movement set the 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.120
 transitions how they look open and 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.650
 we close open a folder to see this 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.840
 it really looks very nice but to me 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.690
 I got a little twitchy because it was very 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.800
 compared to yesterday 6 and the jailbreak the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.239
 truth is that I removed the 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.709
 transitions so that everything would be a 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.170
 little bit faster and I've noticed that there is or 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.790
 the 7 goes slower precisely not because 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.560
 slower or heavier system 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.599
 but that is that the transitions are 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.269
 too slow as you are 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.010
 seeing nothing you are simply going to remove and 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.670
 you are going to activate this from here that 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.680
 we repeat is in general adjustments 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.540
 accessibility and reduce movement what 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.819
 you have activated and see how they are going now 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.190
 the transitions this is the novelty that 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.079
 incorporates this new function before 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.849
 what it was doing to us is that well, the background 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.560
 it did not move and everything was a little 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.239
 more static not but the transitions 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.769
 They kept looking like you've seen 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.720
 principle now notice that it makes a 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.459
 sort of blur and everything is like more 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.650
 instantaneous I prefer it because 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.510
 I notice that my team is going a little bit more 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.340
 fast and I can go a little bit more 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.810
 fast only is that is nothing either 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.220
 from the other world this has been done 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.109
 basically because there were people who 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.850
 dizzy with these effects it will seem 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.590
 joke but I 'm talking on twitter 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.560
 with a girl who supposedly had 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.970
 problems because he got dizzy with the 7 yo 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.620
 I do not really understand it 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.350
 we speak in a podcast of sena 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.419
 cast daily and also on the website of 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.580
 the web dot net but good I understand 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.800
 that there are people who happen to him and in fact what 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.690
 verified did not certify it because to this 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.820
 girl, for example, did not happen to her 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.560
 simply activating this at least 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.300
 although you will not be dizzy at least 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.860
 system for me going a tad faster 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.870
 good apart from all this there have been 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.570
 other updates other improvements but 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.100
 they are unimportant, the truth is that 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.720
 surely many of you have not 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.090
 noticed these failures are simply from 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.410
 problem solving that had ios 7 and 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.150
 it seems that we already have a seven help 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.220
 pretty fine then what about the 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.950
 jailbreak let's see the jailbreak in 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.080
 ios 7.0 point 3 good to start 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.720
 I'll say that muscle nerd in the beginning 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.160
 When Ios 703 came out he told us not to 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.010
 update masters because they were not 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.150
 sure if it's the jailbreak would be the see 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.910
 that they are preparing 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.500
 it would be good or it would enter ios 703 that 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.240
 they had to test how good it looks like 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.860
 the admired the novelties and it seems that 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.750
 many have tells us that we can 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.580
 update without fear because when there 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.320
 a jailbreak will be compatible with this 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.520
 version and good guys and girls said 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.140
 is here I say goodbye I hope you have 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.310
 liked the information of this video and 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.770
 see you if you want 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.950
 and we read in reference to the court point 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.950
 net
