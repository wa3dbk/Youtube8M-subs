00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
like this telephone pole and there's a

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.529 
like this telephone pole and there's a
driveway<00:04:59.219> right<00:04:59.460> here<00:04:59.699> I<00:04:59.849> was<00:05:00.210> pulling<00:05:00.389> out<00:05:00.479> of

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
driveway right here I was pulling out of

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.330 
driveway right here I was pulling out of
the<00:05:00.599> drive<00:05:00.840> well<00:05:01.110> I<00:05:01.139> know<00:05:01.379> it's<00:05:01.590> much<00:05:01.830> much

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340

worse<00:05:02.909> than<00:05:03.150> that<00:05:03.210> like<00:05:03.599> that<00:05:04.430> okay<00:05:05.430> be<00:05:05.610> I

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
worse than that like that okay be I

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.149 
worse than that like that okay be I
guess<00:05:06.090> this<00:05:06.330> is<00:05:06.479> comparable<00:05:06.889> they'd<00:05:07.889> be<00:05:08.009> like
