00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.389
 hello everyone who without stopping to 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.549
 the new 31 revise minecraft is about 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.619
 of the way to go bike is a mod that goes to 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.329
 add motocross bikes to minecraft 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.369
 so I'll quickly explain 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:22.619
 its characters okay mister how it works 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.779
 and at the end of the video I will explain 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.489
 how to install it well let's start the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.529
 first catch of all is going to be this one 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:31.410
 five iron ingots and one coal 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.090
 let's get the motorcycle motor 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.829
 we are going to need this other 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.500
 would be with five ingots of 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.120
 iron and we're going to get the support of 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.790
 the motorcycle where the rest of 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.760
 components very well and finally we're going 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.320
 to need wheels, let's do them like that 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.270
 a little weird because they are going to be 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.680
 also with iron but good four 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.239
 iron ingots and a stick 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.250
 we would get a wheel 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.770
 We are going to need two wheels very well 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.350
 with all those crafter already done 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.840
 let's make this other craft eo four 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.510
 iron the support of the motorbike the motor 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.820
 two wheels and here we are going to put a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.890
 dye well blue color well color 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.840
 red or green depending 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.070
 of the dye we will get one of these 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.020
 three motorcycles 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.240
 and we would have another different character 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.240
 It would be to get this gold bike 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.600
 that would be with four gold ingots the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.490
 support the wheels and the engine is worth 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.380
 motorcycles are the same simply this 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.510
 character I am different as you see 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.920
 we would have the bikes here so you 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:34.710
 I'm going to teach we're going to put one 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.090
 you see how pretty are good 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.390
 wheels are a little square but good 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.880
 and you can hear them 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.770
 very good we are going to ride in it is 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.860
 Right click and you can see that we are going to 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:50.659
 to be able to turn and to move simply 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.450
 let's move like in minecraft vale 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.210
 forward backwards to make a 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.610
 skid for you see what speed goes 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.640
 Quite faster than walking 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.650
 running anything so you can see that 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.860
 very good to get off just yes 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.679
 left and we would go down that we want 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.020
 pick up the bike we do shift and click 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.000
 right on the bike and we would have 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.310
 here 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.350
 let's take a walk in this circuit 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.600
 that I have created we are going to mount and 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.000
 you see that there are all the holes 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.250
 obstacles and we will be able to jump the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.200
 everyone is worth it so we jump first the 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.660
 water you see we have jumped 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.690
 past also an obstacle of this is 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.790
 it can happen automatically and if there's more 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.490
 from a height we will give the jump 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.400
 ok you see we've passed this one too 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.660
 we had a good time even these fences 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.130
 we will be able to jump 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.130
 without any problem 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.250
 for you 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.030
 we do not go clear aggressiveness without you 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.569
 you can is that we all go ice and everything 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.269
 come on or yes 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.889
 the rehousing is a pity perhaps the fires 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:10.319
 artificial and everything that merited good 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:13.409
 As you can see you can do many 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.930
 racing with these bikes we are going to give 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:18.329
 another round you can upload the blocks 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.700
 of one and a half of the fences can be 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.310
 raise the normal blocks the holes 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.439
 normal will be able to jump and even 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.439
 fences of two heights also goes to 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.439
 happen with the jumping vale 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.280
 let's see if we have fallen 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:47.590
 so let's do it again 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.590
 here is fire today 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:59.730
 so good guys, how do you see 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.240
 to stay the bike that we are going to do 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.740
 this is the mod 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.050
 it's very simple what you will be able to use 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.910
 to do different races or 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.220
 just move by minecraft more 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.540
 quickly for the world of minecraft I hope 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.820
 that you liked it if you have any 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.440
 doubt you comment to me and now I am going to happen to 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.260
 explain how it is installed so nothing 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.830
 so far to install the mod of 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.480
 airbag 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.400
 We are going to need forge as I already did 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.340
 tutorial I leave here the link in 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.680
 concrete I have used forge 830 you 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.630
 you can use another version and if for some 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.820
 casual you have a problem always 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.110
 you could use this voucher I'm going to 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.760
 leave in the description of the video well 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.920
 once installed forge we are going to 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.890
 come start let's write percentage 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.200
 app data percentage we're going to go to the 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.060
 minecraft point folder and here's a 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.340
 folder that is called mods let's catch 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.980
 our derbaix file and we're going to 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.380
 drag inside this mod folder very 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.340
 well you see we would have it here and go 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.340
 to run minecraft 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.490
 We select the forge profile and we 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.490
 we give to play 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:08.720
 very well without the player creating new world 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.720
 creative create 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.160
 very well, the world has already been created 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.050
 we're going to go to the inventory and here in 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.330
 the right part appears the tab 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.850
 of mod derbaix as you see we have the 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.130
 four types of motorcycles and their components 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.830
 so let's put a motorcycle in the 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.990
 ground we are going to ride page xxiv 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.610
 to disassemble 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.500
 we're going to ride and let's see what 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.510
 it works correctly, so 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.940
 all right 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.180
 we are uploading all the blocks of 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.180
 a 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:51.310
 is still carrying the world for that 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.310
 I was going a little bit but good 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.650
 so nothing as you can see we can climb 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.370
 we can use the motorcycle correctly 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.270
 that we already have the mod installed 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.800
 correctly also so nothing 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.690
 I hope you liked it if you have 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.190
 some doubt you comment to me and nothing we 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.640
 we see in the following video is worth all 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.640
 all
