what<00:01:40.270> we<00:01:40.420> generally<00:01:40.869> just<00:01:41.140> doesn't<00:01:41.799> fizzy<00:01:42.130> no

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
what we generally just doesn't fizzy no

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.560 
what we generally just doesn't fizzy no
fizzy<00:01:42.490> drinks<00:01:42.820> or<00:01:42.880> anything<00:01:43.030> before<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:43.360> come

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
fizzy drinks or anything before you come

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.170 
fizzy drinks or anything before you come
on<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:43.750> track<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:45.340> know<00:01:45.520> just<00:01:45.789> make<00:01:45.970> sure

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
on the track and you know just make sure

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.880 
on the track and you know just make sure
that<00:01:46.390> you've<00:01:46.600> got<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:47.140> probably<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.710> right

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
that you've got the probably the right

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.590 
that you've got the probably the right
equipment<00:01:48.159> comfy<00:01:48.939> Kyle<00:01:49.119> was<00:01:49.299> not<00:01:49.450> suggesting

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
equipment comfy Kyle was not suggesting

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.300 
equipment comfy Kyle was not suggesting
everybody<00:01:50.110> goes<00:01:50.229> out<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:50.500> bicycling<00:01:50.860> kit

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
everybody goes out and bicycling kit

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.550 
everybody goes out and bicycling kit
straightaway<00:01:51.789> we<00:01:52.360> do<00:01:52.479> recommend<00:01:52.899> two<00:01:53.229> layers

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
straightaway we do recommend two layers

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.389 
straightaway we do recommend two layers
and<00:01:53.950> you<00:01:54.850> know<00:01:54.939> like<00:01:55.119> top<00:01:55.509> layers<00:01:55.840> and

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
and you know like top layers and

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.160 
and you know like top layers and
basically<00:01:57.399> that<00:01:57.520> is<00:01:57.939> if<00:01:58.179> you<00:01:58.600> are<00:01:58.630> bra<00:01:58.960> off

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
basically that is if you are bra off

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.630 
basically that is if you are bra off
sometimes<00:01:59.710> through<00:01:59.890> no<00:02:00.070> fault<00:02:00.100> of<00:02:00.399> your<00:02:00.460> own

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
sometimes through no fault of your own

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.279 
sometimes through no fault of your own
two<00:02:00.939> layers<00:02:01.240> will<00:02:01.450> rub<00:02:01.720> together<00:02:01.869> and<00:02:02.200> reduce

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
two layers will rub together and reduce

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.790 
two layers will rub together and reduce
any<00:02:02.649> friction<00:02:02.890> burns<00:02:03.250> that<00:02:03.399> you<00:02:03.549> may<00:02:03.700> get

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.969 

I<00:02:06.890> think<00:02:07.850> most<00:02:08.810> people<00:02:09.320> if<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.470> get<00:02:09.710> into

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
I think most people if you get into

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.410 
I think most people if you get into
cycling<00:02:10.400> they<00:02:10.490> do<00:02:10.670> lights<00:02:10.970> have<00:02:11.180> their<00:02:11.330> own

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
cycling they do lights have their own

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.940 
cycling they do lights have their own
bag<00:02:11.660> you<00:02:11.930> know<00:02:11.990> I<00:02:12.050> say<00:02:12.260> our<00:02:12.410> bikes<00:02:12.620> are<00:02:12.800> good

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
bag you know I say our bikes are good

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.440 
bag you know I say our bikes are good
but<00:02:13.130> all<00:02:13.250> we<00:02:13.370> can<00:02:13.550> really<00:02:13.670> do<00:02:13.910> on<00:02:13.940> those<00:02:14.240> you

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
but all we can really do on those you

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.360 
but all we can really do on those you
set<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.720> satellite<00:02:15.140> up<00:02:15.320> or<00:02:15.500> down<00:02:15.710> so<00:02:16.220> if<00:02:16.280> you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
set the satellite up or down so if you

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.680 
set the satellite up or down so if you
get<00:02:16.520> your<00:02:16.550> own<00:02:16.700> but<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.120> can<00:02:17.270> tweak<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.540> a

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
get your own but you can tweak that a

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.970 
get your own but you can tweak that a
little<00:02:17.750> bit<00:02:18.020> better<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.380> can<00:02:18.650> change<00:02:18.860> the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
little bit better you can change the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.230 
little bit better you can change the
stem<00:02:19.220> if<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.490> need<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.850> etc<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.740> I<00:02:22.090> suppose<00:02:23.090> on

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
stem if you need to etc and I suppose on

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.120 
stem if you need to etc and I suppose on
the<00:02:23.330> long<00:02:23.480> side<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:23.990> then<00:02:24.200> your<00:02:24.440> shoes<00:02:24.650> and

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
the long side that then your shoes and

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.420 
the long side that then your shoes and
then<00:02:25.430> again<00:02:25.700> then<00:02:25.880> after<00:02:26.120> that<00:02:26.240> your<00:02:26.390> helmet

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.220 

obviously<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.209> biggest<00:02:31.540> difference<00:02:31.900> is<00:02:32.079> that

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
obviously the biggest difference is that

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.929 
obviously the biggest difference is that
the<00:02:32.349> bikes<00:02:32.560> have<00:02:32.799> got<00:02:32.950> no<00:02:33.099> brakes<00:02:33.400> in<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.670> fixed

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
the bikes have got no brakes in a fixed

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.640 
the bikes have got no brakes in a fixed
gear<00:02:34.060> so<00:02:34.269> you<00:02:34.360> can't<00:02:34.599> just<00:02:34.870> stop<00:02:35.079> pedaling<00:02:35.470> so

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
gear so you can't just stop pedaling so

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.020 
gear so you can't just stop pedaling so
like<00:02:35.829> when<00:02:36.159> you're<00:02:36.310> out<00:02:36.370> on<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.549> road<00:02:36.610> we<00:02:36.909> all

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
like when you're out on the road we all

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.520 
like when you're out on the road we all
like<00:02:37.239> to<00:02:37.420> think<00:02:37.659> that<00:02:37.720> we<00:02:37.959> don't<00:02:38.079> freewheel

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
like to think that we don't freewheel

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.899 
like to think that we don't freewheel
but<00:02:38.860> you<00:02:39.010> come<00:02:39.189> on<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.400> track<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:39.879> you

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
but you come on the track and you

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.030 
but you come on the track and you
realize<00:02:40.299> well<00:02:40.480> actually<00:02:40.629> yeah<00:02:40.959> I<00:02:41.110> do<00:02:41.230> feel<00:02:41.349> far

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
realize well actually yeah I do feel far

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.580 
realize well actually yeah I do feel far
more<00:02:42.310> than<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.549> want<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.819> admit<00:02:42.939> and<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.470> I<00:02:44.500> think

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
more than I want to admit and so I think

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.780 
more than I want to admit and so I think
it's<00:02:44.829> just<00:02:44.920> getting<00:02:45.189> used<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:45.549> constant

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
it's just getting used to that constant

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.660 
it's just getting used to that constant
peddling<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:46.709> obviously<00:02:47.709> you're<00:02:48.280> just<00:02:48.459> going

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
peddling and obviously you're just going

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.119 
peddling and obviously you're just going
right<00:02:49.030> round<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.750> round<00:02:49.959> as<00:02:50.319> opposed<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.890> up

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
right round and round as opposed to up

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.410 
right round and round as opposed to up
and<00:02:51.310> down<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.579> hills<00:02:51.730> but<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.060> is<00:02:52.209> very

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
and down the hills but it is very

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.000 
and down the hills but it is very
similar<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.019> because<00:02:53.379> obviously<00:02:53.650> going

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
similar to that because obviously going

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.080 
similar to that because obviously going
into<00:02:54.189> the<00:02:54.280> bends<00:02:54.640> is<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.760> bit<00:02:54.939> like<00:02:55.060> going

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
into the bends is a bit like going

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.089 
into the bends is a bit like going
uphill<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.659> push<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:55.989> little<00:02:56.170> bit<00:02:56.379> more<00:02:56.650> and

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
uphill you push a little bit more and

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.289 
uphill you push a little bit more and
then<00:02:57.250> coming<00:02:57.489> out<00:02:57.579> at<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.790> bend<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.090> get<00:02:58.269> a

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
then coming out at the bend you get a

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.490 
then coming out at the bend you get a
little<00:02:58.480> bit<00:02:58.569> the<00:02:58.659> free<00:02:58.840> speed<00:02:59.140> what<00:02:59.290> you<00:02:59.379> do

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
little bit the free speed what you do

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.990 
little bit the free speed what you do
when<00:02:59.650> you<00:02:59.739> come<00:02:59.859> in<00:02:59.980> downhill<00:03:00.189> so<00:03:00.819> it<00:03:00.879> is

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
when you come in downhill so it is

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.059 
when you come in downhill so it is
similar<00:03:01.720> it's<00:03:01.900> just<00:03:02.109> probably<00:03:02.319> that<00:03:02.590> constant

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
similar it's just probably that constant

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.790 
similar it's just probably that constant
pedal<00:03:03.310> leg<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.579> can't<00:03:03.790> just<00:03:04.060> stop

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.250 

Quoddy<00:03:08.800> really<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.430> i<00:03:09.880> think<00:03:10.180> obviously<00:03:10.870> it's

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
Quoddy really and i think obviously it's

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.320 
Quoddy really and i think obviously it's
here<00:03:12.130> like<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.280> say<00:03:12.490> it's<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.670> age<00:03:12.820> of<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:13.090> tour

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
here like I say it's the age of a tour
