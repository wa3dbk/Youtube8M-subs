00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.950
 we have seen previously that a no hit 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.920
 polymorphisms of a single nucleotide of its marker due to the presence of 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.730
 different nucleotides in a specific position of the human genome in different 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.789
 individuals of the general population 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.930
 here we have represented the individuals with their 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.580
 all as they are more than two therefore to read them for each position 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.720
 and we see in two concrete positions marked in red 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.739
 as an individual has an atheist train I divide the guy from tinun age into 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.920
 this case in this cinema one that so nick sessions 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.450
 i the individual to this other position has excess while the individual b that 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.640
 we are and vote for the minag and therefore he joins without hit 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.830
 efe t 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.690
 these are the two local variants the icas that are found in the population 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.810
 general 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.790
 by having two of your close grandchildren you can build ap the types a 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.810
 haplotype is a combination specifically alleles 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.750
 for aldo cesm and pce in this case they are in the same as soma 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.580
 here we see two possible haplotypes in these individuals a tc haplotype 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.659
 which is what leads the individual to in his chromosomes and another haplotype 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.320
 haplotype 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.270
 that we could call gt because that is the combination of alleles for both is 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.270
 mix that leads this individual of his as we are 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.170
 logically if not of the individuals it is esoteric zygote for one of the is my weight 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.759
 The possible number of haplotypes is greater 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.560
 in this case we see how the individual to st 2 'and vote for him is nick 1 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.670
 carries an art and a g 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.230
 and the guy unbe that zygote shot for him is my type 2 here a pc and an art 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.680
 therefore besides the haplotypes that we already had the haplotype tc 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.680
 or the haplotype people 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.780
 appeared a new haplotype formed by the alleles ges the haplotype gc 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.179
 these groups what blew typical or are very important the haplotypes that 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.400
 is very close they are inherited together because they are in imbalance of 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.180
 linkage and you can find what is up to 20 this mix different like 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.909
 these that we see represented here 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.630
 that erre have four different types in this case 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.370
 and these blocks as a peak are inherited together and that's why they matter 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.280
 for him the studies of mapping and genetic linkage of diseases 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.339
 complex as another chapter will look 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:40.039
 interesting thing now 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:43.040
 is that these blocks can be detected 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.520
 Indo genotyping only some of them is an ex that the form is not 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.010
 necessary genotyping all but some of these is mix allow 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.019
 deduct 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.269
 which type is the one that each individual carries and this logically allows 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.410
 greatly reduce the number of genotyping be necessary to sweep all the 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:02.799
 human genome
