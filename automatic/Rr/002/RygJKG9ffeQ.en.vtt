00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:10.620
 marielis let's see something of the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.690
 category of games I will not talk about 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.519
 apps because he wants to get out a little bit 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.750
 what was the environment of the apps 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.300
 so they would see that we have here in the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.369
 cannabis friends of all kinds of topics and 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.920
 since we are talking about games and 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.170
 streaming and from the internet I wanted to look for a 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.060
 game which I could get for my 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.170
 mark makes me a little difficult 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.179
 I do not comment with one by one 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.219
 pc computer but I like them a lot 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.680
 the strategy games then 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.930
 sailing I found a company myself 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.379
 he used a lot what is called commands 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.270
 commands 1 2 and 3 when it changes more 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.040
 logically my game I could not return 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.379
 to get more than through certain 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.960
 kind of software but good I decided not to 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.390
 more play them but the weekend 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.309
 I found there browsing a link that 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.260
 gave through torrents you can 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.789
 download that game the game that I'm going 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.270
 to show today is called company 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.550
 of heroes tells or value in this case 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.070
 they pay for my english this this game is 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.600
 for pc but a hacker out there managed 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.460
 convert it to mac 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.900
 then we can play in a brand like that 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.180
 that people who have a machine 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.979
 play lopez to 11 leagues only in that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.119
 They send it well up that mx and with pleasure 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.530
 I send you the link so you can 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.530
 download through torrents 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.670
 how good is this guy? 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.640
 the graphics are very very good he gets 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.640
 excellent in clear nvidia but be 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.510
 is the character is the tackle that made 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.510
 we could be able to mark 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.300
 you need company that's the option 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.650
 here we are going to really load the pepito 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.970
 I'm going to enter an interface in some 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.950
 part of the game so they can see it 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.620
 how graphics come in as they can 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.570
 check it here you mark missions are your 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.090
 full missions does not come the option of 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.590
 play online because politically it is 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.270
 a service that only gives you for pc 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.280
 but good to play it to the whole story 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.650
 It's very good I'm several missions 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.820
 for each of them we will enter 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.820
 low volume usage options 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.069
 yes then the brand gameplay of 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.900
 control spirit options how are you going to 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.269
 spin let's accept if I give it 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.799
 select mission here comes an action 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.720
 is that I have already made the graphics 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.430
 it moves very well it shows you a 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.739
 story how do you have that is integral 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.019
 through it you are earning points 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.150
 winning according to appointments every time 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.819
 you complete all the missions and for 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.200
 example let's train the Obaba 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.819
 beach 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.489
 here it will be completed but let's give it 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.609
 again all initial so you can 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.159
 enter I repeat you are going to see a lot a lot 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:56.950
 a lot of excellent graphic as it rotates and what 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:59.859
 I know when a 27-inch imac and 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.980
 It works very well very well I like it a lot 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.629
 much more than what it occupied much earlier 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.580
 I repeat you can not play online because 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.400
 he is jaqueado to be able to play in mark 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.590
 and play 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.409
 you have to pass 25 soldiers to what is 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.409
 the bay these are the graphics see 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.710
 here all the soldiers all these 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.540
 soldiers have to get to what is 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.079
 this part and I move it 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.939
 here comes my first the first one 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:31.069
 I can grab all these and send them 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:32.269
 so that's the first mission you get a 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.590
 little volume so that what 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.450
 we could practice 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.300
 and here we are coming to the first 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.300
 mission see 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.900
 that's the place the bay has been reduced 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.900
 closer 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.060
 but if I'm going to turn 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:02.830
 is what is fabulous this here you 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.710
 It shows what they are seeing them 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.370
 everything everything you can turn can you 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.370
 get closer 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.910
 it's not great this game I liked 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.670
 very much for all this, not because you see 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.870
 all expectations of weapons 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.180
 then we wanted third I wanted them 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.440
 give them a little bit of a view of the game 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.950
 I'm not going to play because I do not 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.870
 I'm a gaming channel but let's see 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.000
 if we can do any of the 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.320
