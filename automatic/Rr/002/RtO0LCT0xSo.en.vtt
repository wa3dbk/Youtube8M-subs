00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
thing on the other side here and just

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.360 
thing on the other side here and just
really<00:00:56.969> gently<00:00:57.360> lift<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.559> bit<00:00:58.859> off<00:00:59.129> so

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
got the case with nothing in it anymore

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.460 
got the case with nothing in it anymore
so<00:02:38.709> you<00:02:38.799> can<00:02:39.010> see<00:02:39.220> here<00:02:39.549> that<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:40.000> case<00:02:40.360> has<00:02:40.900> is

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
so you can see here that the case has is

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.050 
so you can see here that the case has is
very<00:02:41.530> different<00:02:42.010> than<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.129> normal<00:02:42.190> GoPro<00:02:42.819> case

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
very different than a normal GoPro case

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.300 
very different than a normal GoPro case
it's<00:02:43.750> got<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:43.930> lot<00:02:44.049> of<00:02:44.110> screw<00:02:44.680> mounts<00:02:45.010> in<00:02:45.099> here

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
it's got a lot of screw mounts in here

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.559 
it's got a lot of screw mounts in here
for<00:02:45.489> stuff<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.700> get<00:02:45.879> mounted<00:02:46.209> to<00:02:46.329> the<00:02:46.450> other

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
for stuff to get mounted to the other

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:47.280 
for stuff to get mounted to the other
thing<00:02:46.659> you're<00:02:46.840> going<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:47.019> notice<00:02:47.140> that

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
thing you're going to notice that

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.940 
thing you're going to notice that
there's<00:02:47.560> no<00:02:48.329> holes<00:02:49.329> here<00:02:50.200> where<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.739> can

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
there's no holes here where you can

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.180 
there's no holes here where you can
detach<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.909> lens<00:02:52.239> housing<00:02:52.959> so<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.859> lens<00:02:54.040> on

detach the lens housing so the lens on

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.210 
detach the lens housing so the lens on
this<00:02:54.340> is<00:02:54.519> not<00:02:54.910> replaceable<00:02:55.420> at<00:02:55.599> all<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.220> then

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
this is not replaceable at all and then

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.130 
this is not replaceable at all and then
you<00:02:57.250> can<00:02:57.640> see<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:58.209> there's<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.450> big<00:02:58.720> window

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.170 
cut out here for the LCD screen and the
buttons<00:03:03.040> are<00:03:03.280> very<00:03:03.310> similar<00:03:03.849> to<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.090> normal

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
buttons are very similar to the normal

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.670 
buttons are very similar to the normal
GoPro<00:03:04.599> case<00:03:04.750> now<00:03:04.959> because<00:03:05.170> this<00:03:05.260> case<00:03:05.440> it's<00:03:05.590> in

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
GoPro case now because this case it's in

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.250 
GoPro case now because this case it's in
clear<00:03:05.890> that's<00:03:06.040> also<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.549> add<00:03:06.879> in<00:03:07.450> there<00:03:07.750> for

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
clear that's also a add in there for

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.300 
clear that's also a add in there for

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
right here as well as yet just about on

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.420 
right here as well as yet just about on
the<00:03:54.819> top<00:03:57.359> there's<00:03:58.359> also<00:03:58.569> this<00:03:59.139> connector<00:03:59.709> here

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
the top there's also this connector here

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.710

which<00:04:01.030> connects<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:02.280> main<00:04:03.280> PCB<00:04:04.090> motherboard

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
which connects the main PCB motherboard

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.789 
which connects the main PCB motherboard
kind<00:04:05.049> of<00:04:05.169> thing<00:04:05.379> to<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:06.669> camera<00:04:07.349> lens<00:04:08.349> setup

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
kind of thing to the camera lens setup

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.589 
kind of thing to the camera lens setup
and<00:04:09.069> then<00:04:09.190> also<00:04:09.459> down<00:04:09.819> here<00:04:09.849> on<00:04:10.299> the<00:04:10.419> bottom

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
and then also down here on the bottom

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.379 
and then also down here on the bottom
there's<00:04:11.470> this<00:04:11.859> little<00:04:12.400> housing<00:04:12.910> here<00:04:13.090> which<00:04:13.239> I

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
there's this little housing here which I

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.569 
there's this little housing here which I
believe<00:04:13.900> houses<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.829> microphone<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:15.459> that

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
believe houses the microphone so that

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.550 
believe houses the microphone so that
sits<00:04:15.879> right<00:04:15.970> down<00:04:16.150> here<00:04:16.630> in<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:17.349> bottom

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
sits right down here in the bottom

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.599 
sits right down here in the bottom
corner<00:04:17.739> of<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.400> case<00:04:19.410> then<00:04:20.410> we<00:04:21.250> have<00:04:21.400> the

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
corner of the case then we have the

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.650 
corner of the case then we have the
second<00:04:22.380> PCB<00:04:23.380> that's<00:04:24.010> this<00:04:24.250> one<00:04:24.460> here<00:04:24.910> so<00:04:25.389> this

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
second PCB that's this one here so this

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.839 
second PCB that's this one here so this
one<00:04:25.960> was<00:04:26.410> that<00:04:26.590> original<00:04:27.099> board<00:04:27.400> which<00:04:27.610> sat

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
one was that original board which sat

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:29.190 
one was that original board which sat
right<00:04:28.150> up<00:04:28.270> here<00:04:28.479> in<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:28.630> corner<00:04:28.810> of<00:04:29.080> the

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
right up here in the corner of the

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.640 
right up here in the corner of the
housing<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:29.710> this<00:04:30.640> one<00:04:30.969> has<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.659> micro<00:04:32.260> SD

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
housing and this one has the micro SD

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.020 
housing and this one has the micro SD
card<00:04:32.979> slot<00:04:33.039> in<00:04:33.460> it

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
card slot in it

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.580 
card slot in it
here<00:04:34.620> micro<00:04:35.620> SD<00:04:35.800> card<00:04:36.040> slot<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:36.430> a<00:04:37.240> u<00:04:37.810> micro<00:04:38.380> or

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
here micro SD card slot and a u micro or

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.180 
here micro SD card slot and a u micro or
a<00:04:38.620> mini<00:04:38.860> USB<00:04:39.160> port<00:04:39.780> here

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
a mini USB port here

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.460 
a mini USB port here
then<00:04:42.190> there's<00:04:42.730> the<00:04:43.090> lens<00:04:43.420> itself<00:04:44.020> so<00:04:44.230> this<00:04:44.320> is

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
then there's the lens itself so this is

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.230 
then there's the lens itself so this is
the<00:04:44.620> camera<00:04:45.100> lens<00:04:45.280> you<00:04:45.580> can<00:04:45.700> see<00:04:45.760> it's<00:04:46.000> built

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
the camera lens you can see it's built

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.960 
the camera lens you can see it's built
into<00:04:46.420> this<00:04:46.750> kind<00:04:47.590> of<00:04:47.650> very<00:04:48.430> cool-looking

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
into this kind of very cool-looking

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.010 
into this kind of very cool-looking
housing<00:04:49.960> so<00:04:50.140> this<00:04:51.010> has<00:04:51.730> a<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.660> lens<00:04:52.840> on<00:04:52.960> the

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
housing so this has a the lens on the

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.540 
housing so this has a the lens on the
front<00:04:53.050> of<00:04:53.260> it<00:04:53.350> the<00:04:53.770> image<00:04:53.980> sensor<00:04:54.160> on<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.400> back

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
front of it the image sensor on the back

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.610 
front of it the image sensor on the back
of<00:04:54.700> it<00:04:54.790> and<00:04:54.940> then<00:04:55.060> a<00:04:55.090> connector<00:04:55.660> here<00:04:55.690> which

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
of it and then a connector here which

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.700 
of it and then a connector here which
connects<00:04:57.070> it<00:04:57.250> on<00:04:57.430> to<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.210> mainboard<00:04:58.750> and<00:04:59.020> then

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
connects it on to the mainboard and then

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.770 
connects it on to the mainboard and then
finally<00:05:00.250> there's<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.700> battery<00:05:01.000> so<00:05:01.480> this<00:05:01.600> is<00:05:01.690> a

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
finally there's the battery so this is a

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.810 
finally there's the battery so this is a
three<00:05:02.140> point<00:05:02.500> eight<00:05:03.600> volt<00:05:04.600> uhm<00:05:05.820> presumably

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
three point eight volt uhm presumably

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.300 
three point eight volt uhm presumably
lithium<00:05:07.330> polymer<00:05:07.600> I<00:05:07.990> can't<00:05:08.620> read<00:05:08.950> much<00:05:09.130> of<00:05:09.250> the

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
lithium polymer I can't read much of the

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.860 
lithium polymer I can't read much of the
information<00:05:09.640> on<00:05:09.700> the<00:05:09.760> back<00:05:09.910> of<00:05:10.090> it

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870

lithium-ion rechargeable battery three

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:22.260 
lithium-ion rechargeable battery three
point<00:05:14.410> eight<00:05:14.620> volts<00:05:15.220> with<00:05:15.640> a<00:05:20.580> 1130<00:05:21.580> milliamp

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
point eight volts with a 1130 milliamp

point eight volts with a 1130 milliamp
hour<00:05:22.540> capacity<00:05:23.100> battery<00:05:24.100> and<00:05:24.340> now<00:05:24.370> this<00:05:24.970> one

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
hour capacity battery and now this one

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.030 
hour capacity battery and now this one
is<00:05:25.210> detachable<00:05:25.810> and<00:05:25.990> it's<00:05:26.110> very<00:05:26.470> easy<00:05:26.680> to<00:05:26.919> this

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
is detachable and it's very easy to this

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.030 
is detachable and it's very easy to this
battery<00:05:27.400> so<00:05:27.610> I<00:05:27.900> would<00:05:28.900> presume<00:05:29.169> that<00:05:29.470> this

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
battery so I would presume that this

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.680 
battery so I would presume that this
would<00:05:30.220> almost<00:05:30.460> be<00:05:30.760> user<00:05:30.940> replaceable<00:05:31.240> getting

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
would almost be user replaceable getting

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.480 
would almost be user replaceable getting
this<00:05:31.750> back<00:05:32.020> door<00:05:32.290> off<00:05:32.470> the<00:05:32.650> camera<00:05:32.980> is<00:05:33.100> really

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
this back door off the camera is really

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.550 
this back door off the camera is really
easy<00:05:33.790> it<00:05:34.000> just<00:05:34.180> basically<00:05:34.440> involves<00:05:35.440> like

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
easy it just basically involves like

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.930 
easy it just basically involves like
just<00:05:35.770> pressing<00:05:36.100> on<00:05:36.190> side<00:05:36.370> of<00:05:36.490> a<00:05:36.550> little<00:05:36.730> bit<00:05:36.850> to

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
just pressing on side of a little bit to

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
just pressing on side of a little bit to
pop<00:05:37.120> it<00:05:37.240> out<00:05:37.330> like<00:05:37.540> we<00:05:37.570> did<00:05:37.750> the<00:05:37.840> very

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
pop it out like we did the very

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.659 
pop it out like we did the very
beginning<00:05:38.290> of<00:05:38.320> the<00:05:38.410> video<00:05:38.500> so<00:05:38.830> remove<00:05:39.550> this

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
beginning of the video so remove this

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.760 
beginning of the video so remove this
back<00:05:39.880> door<00:05:40.090> is<00:05:40.240> simple<00:05:40.630> and<00:05:40.810> then<00:05:41.080> I<00:05:41.110> think<00:05:41.650> you

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
back door is simple and then I think you

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.409 
back door is simple and then I think you
could<00:05:42.040> probably<00:05:42.280> use<00:05:42.760> a<00:05:42.790> replace<00:05:43.180> this

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
could probably use a replace this

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.380 
could probably use a replace this
battery<00:05:43.900> um<00:05:44.550> if<00:05:45.550> you<00:05:45.669> ever<00:05:45.850> needed<00:05:46.030> to<00:05:46.120> because

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
battery um if you ever needed to because

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.670 
battery um if you ever needed to because
the<00:05:46.450> battery<00:05:46.720> was<00:05:46.750> dead<00:05:46.900> or<00:05:47.290> old<00:05:47.500> you're<00:05:47.620> not

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
the battery was dead or old you're not

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.840 
the battery was dead or old you're not
going<00:05:47.919> to<00:05:47.979> do<00:05:48.070> it<00:05:48.100> on<00:05:48.220> the<00:05:48.340> hill<00:05:48.550> you're<00:05:48.760> not

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
going to do it on the hill you're not

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.909 
going to do it on the hill you're not
going<00:05:49.000> to<00:05:49.060> do<00:05:49.150> it<00:05:49.240> during<00:05:49.390> the<00:05:49.479> day<00:05:49.540> but<00:05:50.169> kind

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
wanted to see inside of it but um and it

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:22.170 
wanted to see inside of it but um and it
was<00:06:21.010> also<00:06:21.250> cheap<00:06:21.490> enough<00:06:21.669> that<00:06:21.729> if<00:06:21.970> I<00:06:22.120> don't

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
was also cheap enough that if I don't

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.670 
was also cheap enough that if I don't
get<00:06:22.600> this<00:06:22.750> book<00:06:22.930> back<00:06:22.960> together<00:06:23.320> and<00:06:23.530> working

get this book back together and working

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.140 
get this book back together and working
which<00:06:24.130> shouldn't<00:06:24.520> be<00:06:24.580> too<00:06:24.669> much<00:06:24.760> of<00:06:24.880> a<00:06:24.910> trouble

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
which shouldn't be too much of a trouble

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.030 
which shouldn't be too much of a trouble
it<00:06:25.300> was<00:06:25.390> fairly<00:06:25.540> simple<00:06:25.660> but<00:06:26.110> it<00:06:26.740> wasn't<00:06:27.010> a

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
it was fairly simple but it wasn't a

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.280 
it was fairly simple but it wasn't a
huge<00:06:27.520> loss<00:06:28.000> I<00:06:28.360> probably<00:06:28.780> I<00:06:28.930> can<00:06:29.020> do<00:06:29.110> this<00:06:29.169> with

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.290 
huge loss I probably I can do this with

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.570 
huge loss I probably I can do this with
a<00:06:29.350> hero<00:06:29.500> 4<00:06:29.830> I'm<00:06:29.979> just<00:06:30.100> going<00:06:30.220> to<00:06:30.280> tell<00:06:30.400> you<00:06:30.430> that

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
and enough people just make enough noise

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.860 
and enough people just make enough noise
and<00:06:36.100> we<00:06:36.490> might<00:06:37.060> be<00:06:37.300> able<00:06:37.479> to<00:06:37.540> make<00:06:37.660> it<00:06:37.780> happen
