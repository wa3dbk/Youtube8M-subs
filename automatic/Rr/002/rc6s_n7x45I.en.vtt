00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.830
 then of 6 bad 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.789
 yes 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.310
 because for me it means a style of 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.160
 life and then day with all people 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.700
 they come to ask a silly question and 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.390
 they say it hurts obviously that everything was a 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.900
 Tattoo is based on cars only 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.900
 it has to hurt 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.140
 the materials are new are the 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.210
 techniques are the inflatables are going to pay 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.950
 is dedicated to work and I give them a 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.820
 very good recommendation that do not compare 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.360
 prices but quality 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.340
 the tattoo has some consequence if 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.200
 you do it in a non-professional studio or 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.310
 as an apprentice and not if you come to me 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.310
 store for your health 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.630
 my opinion about the people that my 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.630
 body the truth that is art 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.780
 it's something that makes you different 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.970
 the rest 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.040
 it becomes special 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.540
 in this 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.350
 It's part of your 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:47.540
 but the news of the fight 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.189
 already in these times the truth throughout 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.009
 the information that jens gives to the gave 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.869
 intervention on the internet all that is already 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.690
 more fluid the height wave that each 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.280
 people more and more people are being 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.700
 acting 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.670
 I tell everyone 18 years old in 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.280
 I do not think that most of them had 77 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.310
 years or so then it's already going 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.650
 removing everything that afternoon after much 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.360
 time what sometimes right up 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.150
 of the policemen you were just going to the 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.400
 street with tattoos they had and hey for 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.340
 have a review and things like that in 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.550
 jobs strictly say I do not have 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.140
 understood that your mind you multi-sided 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.050
 for having a tattoo not in some 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.940
 companies that simply would not have no 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.050
 you do is making a tattoo 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.660
 70% are clients that I have 30 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.730
 percent are males since I feel that 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.700
 the ladies are the ones that choose a good 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.230
 place to have tea 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.910
 many people who do not do them 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.830
 Interested but be very careful and 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.300
 A lot of attention to where they are going because 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.360
 they were counting the stores of 14 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.980
 around we are about 10 15 and of those 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.120
 we are four established 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.120
 I also where you are going 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.990
 for me
