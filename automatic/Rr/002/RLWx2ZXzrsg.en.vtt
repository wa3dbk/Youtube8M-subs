configure a configuration on it and for

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.870 
configure a configuration on it and for
future<00:01:31.140> modding<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.829> very<00:01:32.189> useful<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.759> have

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
future modding it's very useful to have

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.550 
future modding it's very useful to have
quite<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> big<00:01:33.869> size<00:01:34.110> us<00:01:34.500> fit<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.920> by<00:01:35.180> step<00:01:36.180> 5

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
quite a big size us fit that by step 5

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.719 
quite a big size us fit that by step 5
basically<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.590> wait<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.280> configure

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
basically just wait for it to configure

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.390 
basically just wait for it to configure
it'll<00:01:39.000> take<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.360> few<00:01:39.420> sec<00:01:39.900> 2<00:01:40.680> seconds<00:01:41.220> depending

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
it'll take a few sec 2 seconds depending

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.830 
it'll take a few sec 2 seconds depending
on<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.390> speed<00:01:42.659> or<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.990> few<00:01:43.649> minutes<00:01:44.630> once<00:01:45.630> it's

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
on the speed or a few minutes once it's

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.130 
on the speed or a few minutes once it's
configured<00:01:46.409> than<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.100> hey<00:01:47.280> presto<00:01:47.899> you're<00:01:48.899> done
