00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.799
 how are you family here is the video 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.139
 about tattoos, not the tattoos that 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:10.480
 I carry on but what happens to the 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.040
 tattoos when we increase or decrease 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.620
 weight is a question that you have asked me 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.170
 I have constantly received a lot 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.360
 I do not always have a tour 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.860
 received a lot of emails about this 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.960
 theme so the other day I launched the 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.430
 ask social networks and I 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.770
 you have helped a lot but also also 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.390
 He has informed me to see what 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.280
 it happened because after all I'm not 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.280
 an expert let's go to it 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.450
 fat tight fat ass floats 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.240
 cartouche those kilos put on a diet not 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.830
 I'm worth a lot of weight on Monday I start if 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.830
 I'm fat that more 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.300
 the tattoos change if my body changes 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.820
 If losing weight a tattoo will stay well 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.400
 as if you were a flap 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.540
 that weight gain of muscle mass is 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.180
 will make big and fierce and I will be like hulk 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.670
 the places where we should do the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.370
 tattoos and should not occur any 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.410
 problem of weight gain or loss or 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.950
 the drawing is extended or that 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:17.320
 deteriorate or that there are some problems are 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.969
 hands good hands too 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.270
 depending on the taste of each person 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:24.490
 but well there we include dolls worth 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.800
 which is a place where more or less 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.750
 Changes a lot 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.870
 well that the body when we have 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.730
 overweight when we reproduce weight 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:38.350
 when we gain muscle mass or when the 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:41.170
 we lose our feet and ankles and 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.200
 back of the neck around here by 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.690
 the neck is worth it and the places where we go to 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.150
 have problems are surely in the 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.150
 men mostly arms 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.020
 and the stomach and in women the 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.180
 hips thighs 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.390
 the breasts 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.070
 and the belly and remember the area where 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.429
 he puts the epidural they always say that 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.110
 it's very bad not because I'm going to expand or 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.250
 reduce or such and such but because 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.320
 good is a place where we have to 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.120
 puncture the epidural and do not like 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.500
 because good the ink spoke cloudy 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.630
 there are always urban legends and those 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.010
 things I avoided it 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.680
 If you already have it there, nothing happens 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.530
 nobody has died but good always 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.470
 It is well worth thinking before acting 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.240
 because we do tattoos so 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.480
 with the tattoos on the equal where I would 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.790
 do and in the end then we repent 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.489
 so I read and I do not say that 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.150
 truth is a lie is easier than you 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.489
 deteriorate a big tattoo because if it is 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.860
 I know that something is continuous that 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.080
 So you have many things to imagine a 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.000
 carp coi with lots of flowers in a 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.700
 arm starts to deteriorate and it 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.690
 loses a little what the concept is not 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.860
 of the drawing that the tattooists tell 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.239
 so then well we have to think 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.360
 in which maybe a small tattoo 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.650
 It may have less problem 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.480
 because at the end of the day then it also 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.430
 can cover 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.799
 problematic problem come repeat 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.720
 words nothing happens in the end that's what 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.640
 they say do not say I do not know is also 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.650
 true that it is coherent to think that what 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.170
 better a tattoo if you start to stretch 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.959
 and it has a coherence 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:25.080
 theoretically miss and look like a fucking 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:29.310
 pride is very important that you have in 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:33.569
 note that symmetrical tattoos with 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.090
 tribal voucher lines and so on 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.310
 they tend to have a lot more problems with 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.230
 the weight changes because the lines 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.480
 they tend to curve or tend to 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.090
 stretch tend to lose their 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.190
 straightness and symmetrical things tend 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.590
 to distort so you can choose 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.299
 if you think you're going to change weight in 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.340
 a short term and you want to tattoo and 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.290
 Well, a tattoo that is not symmetrical 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.849
 neither has tribal and have lines 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.739
 lan or lines of the drawing but lines 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.349
 straight you are understanding me 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.480
 perfectly what I want to say and what 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.849
 most important of all among other things 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.010
 Now that I'm going to tell you is that the 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.650
 drastic loss will always provoke 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.750
 drastic effects is to say if I'm in 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.450
 an overweight and I lose very quickly 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.790
 the skin can not adapt to the changes 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.380
 and it is when they are lower but it is very 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.780
 sports portal is very 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.400
 important the diet if we make a 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.930
 less drastic weight loss because it is 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.300
 true that changes are less noticeable already 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.300
 Sometimes we do not have any stretch marks to remember if 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.590
 there are stretch marks there are skin problems with 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.270
 which may have problems in a 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.490
 tattoo is that it is to follow bodies like this 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.660
 those bastard knows if already without 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.200
 have a fat ass behind their 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.460
 consequences but good above all and what 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.980
 What I want you to keep in mind is that 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.780
 trust your tattoo artist I trust 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.180
 in which there are very professional people for the 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.710
 world that will advise you always I have 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.120
 I was lucky when he gave me a tattoo 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.680
 I have been told that you would not prefer this 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.660
 tattoo do everything on this site that is 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.640
 bigger or that is smaller you can 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.990
 adapt it better is going to stay like this or not 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.840
 do it there because imagine in a 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.300
 future me that I know are people depending 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.740
 of the place that are professionals you have 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.320
 what to look for very well you have to 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.330
 inform you have to be coherent and 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.820
 well knowing that especially in 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.720
 the wrists the feet the back 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.370
 By the neck 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.490
 the twins also the ankles 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.949
 areas like the shoulders that do not change 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:26.419
 much with the weight you can tattoo 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:28.310
 cheerfully but with head please and 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.350
 those who already have tattoos well 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.660
 make drastic changes give us a lot 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.790
 hydrated cream very careful with the 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.949
 diet and well, you can always 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.810
 ask in one at a tattoo site 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.090
 or where you have done it that can 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.990
 occur or if you can fix it in the 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:47.330
 case the disaster is inevitable 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.370
 saying this I want you a lot of thanks 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.650
 to continue there I hope to have helped you and 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.130
 a very big kiss 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:57.520
 you see this is a part of the arm that 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:06:00.460
 usually have as well as quite 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:03.650
 flaccid but good luckily this 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.320
 at the moment he has not lost anything of 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.840
 because I have not been stretched or anything or has 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.090
 has lost color or lost anything so 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:15.110
 I am very happy and the others that I have 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:17.630
 because they are on the shoulders you see that no 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:21.740
 which is not a place where it is extended 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:24.009
 or shrink the skin much I have 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.279
 in the back 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:30.189
 I have another one down on my back that 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:32.740
 it's right in the middle and it's not a 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:35.379
 great skin deterioration I have those in the 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.600
 twin and then I have here in the 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:40.620
 ribs 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.810
 and then I have here in the arm 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:46.129
 so good and the elbow is that 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:48.589
 neither increases nor 

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:50.659
 nor change size I was conscious 

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:52.939
 since I was little I did not want 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:55.249
 do it to me neither in the part from where 

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:57.800
 it punctures you in the epidural or the gut 

00:06:55.249 --> 00:07:01.189
 or anything so good if you do not have it 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.169
 still think about it very well and look 

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:05.179
 areas where you do not believe if you go to 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:07.339
 increase or decrease in weight or go to 

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:09.409
 increase muscle mass or vice versa 

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:12.769
 Well where do you think it will not happen 

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:15.739
 something that you do not like in the long term and 

00:07:12.769 --> 00:07:18.169
 it is but each body is a world each 

00:07:15.739 --> 00:07:20.059
 person is a world and each tattoo is a 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:22.519
 world because it can be better worse 

00:07:20.059 --> 00:07:24.050
 made to ink more inside less inside 

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:25.490
 it may look like before it might be 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.910
 by the weight it might be because the 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:32.490
 tattooist has been a son of super 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:35.009
 fatal or we never know is something a 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:40.289
 little of destiny but good is always 

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:42.830
 well ask to inquire and think before 

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:42.830
 to do it
