00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.670 
try to fortified it and hold out there
again<00:01:47.939> they<00:01:48.060> get<00:01:48.180> over<00:01:48.420> ran<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.960> don't<00:01:49.470> know<00:01:49.560> if

again they get over ran I don't know if
they<00:01:49.860> found<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.430> plane<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.790> take<00:01:51.000> maybe<00:01:51.360> they

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
they found a plane to take maybe they

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.810 
they found a plane to take maybe they
fixed<00:01:51.780> up<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.200> broken<00:01:52.560> plane<00:01:52.799> but<00:01:53.100> they<00:01:53.579> use<00:01:53.790> a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
fixed up a broken plane but they use a

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.179 
fixed up a broken plane but they use a
plane<00:01:54.149> they<00:01:54.509> get<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.720> hell<00:01:54.869> out<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.020> there<00:01:55.290> and

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
plane they get the hell out of there and

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.800 
plane they get the hell out of there and
Rick<00:01:56.399> Finn<00:01:56.610> knows<00:01:56.759> he<00:01:57.000> has<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.210> go<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.450> shi<00:01:57.689> no

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
Rick Finn knows he has to go to shi no

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.840 
Rick Finn knows he has to go to shi no
numa<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.170> get<00:01:58.290> more<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.560> 115<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.490> that's<00:01:59.700> where

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
numa to get more of 115 so that's where

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.480 
numa to get more of 115 so that's where
he<00:01:59.909> travels<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.950> meanwhile<00:02:01.950> well<00:02:02.159> that's

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
he travels to meanwhile well that's

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.580 
he travels to meanwhile well that's
going<00:02:02.759> on<00:02:02.850> somehow<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.899> hem<00:02:04.290> really

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
going on somehow the hem really

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.770 
going on somehow the hem really
explained<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.040> but<00:02:05.159> Samantha<00:02:05.700> finds<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.270> way<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
explained it but Samantha finds a way to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.680 
explained it but Samantha finds a way to
take<00:02:07.560> your<00:02:07.680> soul<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.250> control<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.270> zombies

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
take your soul and control the zombies

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.240 
take your soul and control the zombies
so<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:10.590> know<00:02:10.709> that's<00:02:10.890> going<00:02:11.129> on

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
so we know that's going on

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.860 
so we know that's going on
after<00:02:12.430> she<00:02:12.610> no<00:02:12.760> numa<00:02:13.060> after<00:02:13.360> Rick's<00:02:13.660> think

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
after she no numa after Rick's think

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.530 
after she no numa after Rick's think
it's<00:02:14.020> is<00:02:14.140> 115<00:02:14.770> we<00:02:15.460> actually<00:02:15.640> traveled<00:02:16.270> back<00:02:16.510> to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
it's is 115 we actually traveled back to

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.480 
it's is 115 we actually traveled back to
Greece<00:02:16.960> now<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.320> is<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.500> race<00:02:17.830> we<00:02:18.100> actually

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
Greece now this is the race we actually

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.460 
Greece now this is the race we actually
play<00:02:18.700> where<00:02:19.090> all<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.750> stuff<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.320> actually

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
play where all the stuff is actually

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.970 
play where all the stuff is actually
already<00:02:20.800> gone<00:02:21.040> down<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.930> wanderings<00:02:23.740> you

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
already gone down and wanderings you

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.530 
already gone down and wanderings you
know<00:02:24.070> we<00:02:24.220> get<00:02:24.370> stuck<00:02:24.640> in<00:02:24.790> this<00:02:24.910> time<00:02:25.150> we're

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
know we get stuck in this time we're

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.090 
know we get stuck in this time we're
trying<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.870> actually<00:02:25.990> read<00:02:26.710> offense<00:02:26.920> trying

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
trying to actually read offense trying

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.850 
trying to actually read offense trying
to<00:02:27.220> tell<00:02:27.430> if<00:02:27.520> we're<00:02:27.670> out<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.820> there<00:02:28.090> and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
to tell if we're out of there and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.630 
to tell if we're out of there and
Samantha's<00:02:29.860> just<00:02:30.040> keeping<00:02:30.340> them<00:02:30.490> in<00:02:30.550> this

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
Samantha's just keeping them in this

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.220 
Samantha's just keeping them in this
time<00:02:30.940> loop<00:02:31.150> which<00:02:31.360> is<00:02:31.480> why<00:02:31.570> you<00:02:31.630> see<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.959> clock

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
time loop which is why you see the clock

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.350 
time loop which is why you see the clock
stuck<00:02:32.590> in<00:02:32.740> time<00:02:32.980> but<00:02:33.520> eventually<00:02:33.610> we<00:02:34.030> actually

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
stuck in time but eventually we actually

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.410 
stuck in time but eventually we actually
get<00:02:34.510> out<00:02:34.540> we<00:02:35.350> make<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.800> kino<00:02:36.310> na<00:02:36.550> keno<00:02:37.240> is

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
get out we make it to kino na keno is

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.320 
get out we make it to kino na keno is
actually<00:02:37.810> in<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.080> future<00:02:39.209> we're<00:02:40.209> actually

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
actually in the future we're actually

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.510 
actually in the future we're actually
this<00:02:40.840> is<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.350> seems<00:02:41.650> like<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.010> stage<00:02:42.250> for

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
this is it seems like the stage for

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.310 
this is it seems like the stage for
every<00:02:42.820> film<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.330> Maxis<00:02:43.840> we're<00:02:43.959> gonna<00:02:44.110> show

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
every film and Maxis we're gonna show

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.660 
every film and Maxis we're gonna show
off<00:02:44.350> their<00:02:44.560> experiments<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.370> know<00:02:45.489> they<00:02:45.610> were

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
off their experiments you know they were

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.800 
off their experiments you know they were
going<00:02:45.820> to<00:02:45.850> show<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.209> progress<00:02:46.390> with<00:02:46.720> the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
going to show the progress with the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.440 
going to show the progress with the
zombies<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:48.370> between<00:02:48.760> Teresa<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.120> kina

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
zombies in between Teresa and kina

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.880 
zombies in between Teresa and kina
there's<00:02:49.630> something<00:02:50.050> big<00:02:50.200> happens<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:50.770> they

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
there's something big happens that they

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.710 
there's something big happens that they
haven't<00:02:51.010> shown<00:02:51.310> us<00:02:51.459> yet<00:02:51.670> because<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.330> the

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
haven't shown us yet because the the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.900 
haven't shown us yet because the the
crawling<00:02:53.320> zombies<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.370> zombies<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:54.850> the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
crawling zombies and the zombies and the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.729 
crawling zombies and the zombies and the
barrels<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.300> stuff<00:02:55.450> like<00:02:55.570> that<00:02:55.630> they<00:02:56.440> had<00:02:56.709> to

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
barrels and stuff like that they had to

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.590 
barrels and stuff like that they had to
come<00:02:57.100> from<00:02:57.220> somewhere<00:02:57.310> so<00:02:57.880> Richtofen<00:02:58.330> brought

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
come from somewhere so Richtofen brought

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.290 
come from somewhere so Richtofen brought
them<00:02:58.810> from<00:02:58.930> somewhere<00:02:59.550> in<00:03:00.550> between<00:03:00.730> these<00:03:01.060> two

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
them from somewhere in between these two

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.210 
them from somewhere in between these two
maps<00:03:01.510> we<00:03:01.810> just<00:03:02.050> don't<00:03:02.440> know<00:03:02.560> what<00:03:02.709> it<00:03:02.830> is<00:03:02.860> yet

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
maps we just don't know what it is yet

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.670 
maps we just don't know what it is yet
so<00:03:03.850> there<00:03:04.300> is<00:03:04.330> he's<00:03:04.690> at<00:03:04.840> keno<00:03:05.170> he's<00:03:05.380> trying<00:03:05.620> to

so there is he's at keno he's trying to

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.350 
so there is he's at keno he's trying to
show<00:03:05.800> off<00:03:05.830> and<00:03:06.160> then<00:03:06.280> again<00:03:06.670> they're<00:03:06.850> over<00:03:07.150> ran

girish device to pull dr. girish back

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.460 
girish device to pull dr. girish back
out<00:03:27.220> of<00:03:27.340> purgatory<00:03:27.519> and<00:03:27.940> Richtofen<00:03:28.780> it's<00:03:29.380> a

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
out of purgatory and Richtofen it's a

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.740 
out of purgatory and Richtofen it's a
spark<00:03:29.769> you<00:03:29.920> know<00:03:30.040> he<00:03:30.160> realizes<00:03:30.489> hey<00:03:31.480> if<00:03:31.630> I

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
spark you know he realizes hey if I

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.270 
spark you know he realizes hey if I
could<00:03:31.900> build<00:03:32.110> a<00:03:32.200> big<00:03:32.410> enough<00:03:32.620> girish<00:03:32.980> device

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
could build a big enough girish device

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.850 
could build a big enough girish device
power<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:34.060> up<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.510> right<00:03:34.630> way<00:03:34.690> then<00:03:35.560> I<00:03:35.650> could

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
power it up the right way then I could

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.160 
power it up the right way then I could
actually<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:37.120> know<00:03:37.239> maybe<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.570> could<00:03:37.870> control

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
actually you know maybe I could control

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.259 
actually you know maybe I could control
the<00:03:38.350> zombies<00:03:38.880> which<00:03:39.880> is<00:03:40.000> where<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.150> actually

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
the zombies which is where I actually

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.910 
the zombies which is where I actually
finds<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.840> blueprints<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.560> plans<00:03:41.769> for

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
finds the blueprints and the plans for

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.800 
finds the blueprints and the plans for
the<00:03:42.040> Russian<00:03:42.370> space<00:03:42.489> station<00:03:42.640> he<00:03:43.480> realizes

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
the Russian space station he realizes

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.330 
the Russian space station he realizes
that<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.260> Russians<00:03:44.680> actually<00:03:45.010> found<00:03:45.220> an

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
that the Russians actually found an

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.000 
that the Russians actually found an
ancient<00:03:45.519> pyramid<00:03:46.120> on<00:03:46.299> the<00:03:46.420> moon<00:03:46.630> they<00:03:47.380> you

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
ancient pyramid on the moon they you

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.800 
ancient pyramid on the moon they you
know<00:03:48.040> build<00:03:48.400> a<00:03:48.489> space<00:03:48.760> station<00:03:48.790> around<00:03:49.360> it<00:03:49.600> to

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
know build a space station around it to

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.050 
know build a space station around it to
hide<00:03:49.989> it<00:03:50.200> and<00:03:50.380> he<00:03:50.980> starts<00:03:51.280> forming<00:03:51.519> this<00:03:51.760> plan

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
hide it and he starts forming this plan

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.850 
hide it and he starts forming this plan
to<00:03:52.329> get<00:03:52.450> all<00:03:52.540> these<00:03:52.660> parts<00:03:53.079> so<00:03:53.260> that<00:03:53.290> he<00:03:53.560> can<00:03:53.709> go

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
to get all these parts so that he can go

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.479 
to get all these parts so that he can go
into<00:03:54.190> purgatory<00:03:54.630> so<00:03:56.280> that's<00:03:57.280> where<00:03:57.430> we

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
into purgatory so that's where we

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.340 
into purgatory so that's where we
realized<00:03:57.790> we<00:03:57.940> need<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.269> he<00:03:58.720> realizes<00:03:59.019> he<00:03:59.290> has

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
realized we need to he realizes he has

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.340 
realized we need to he realizes he has
trouble<00:03:59.650> to<00:04:00.190> call<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.940> dead<00:04:01.120> so<00:04:01.840> we<00:04:01.989> traveled

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
trouble to call the dead so we traveled

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.050 
trouble to call the dead so we traveled
there<00:04:02.470> but<00:04:03.190> we<00:04:03.250> actually<00:04:03.340> spawned<00:04:03.850> in<00:04:04.000> a

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
there but we actually spawned in a

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.490 
there but we actually spawned in a
pitch-black<00:04:04.299> room<00:04:04.570> we<00:04:05.049> can't<00:04:05.230> see<00:04:05.350> what's

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
pitch-black room we can't see what's

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.050 
pitch-black room we can't see what's
going<00:04:05.680> on<00:04:05.739> and<00:04:06.100> Nicolai<00:04:06.700> actually

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
going on and Nicolai actually

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.910 
going on and Nicolai actually
accidentally<00:04:07.720> hits<00:04:07.959> a<00:04:08.049> button<00:04:08.200> that<00:04:08.350> locks<00:04:08.739> us

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
accidentally hits a button that locks us

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.670 
accidentally hits a button that locks us
in<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.130> room<00:04:09.310> so<00:04:10.209> richtofen<00:04:11.110> being<00:04:11.380> a<00:04:11.440> smart

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
in the room so richtofen being a smart

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.080 
in the room so richtofen being a smart
guy<00:04:11.769> that<00:04:11.980> he<00:04:12.040> is<00:04:12.190> he<00:04:12.459> has<00:04:12.640> the<00:04:12.880> other

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
guy that he is he has the other

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.569 
guy that he is he has the other
characters<00:04:13.600> actually<00:04:13.870> get<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.320> golden<00:04:14.650> rod

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
characters actually get the golden rod

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.030 
characters actually get the golden rod
for<00:04:15.820> him<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.290> so<00:04:17.290> yeah<00:04:17.440> he<00:04:17.560> completes<00:04:17.890> that

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
for him and so yeah he completes that

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.530 
for him and so yeah he completes that
step<00:04:18.340> so<00:04:18.579> from<00:04:18.880> there<00:04:19.030> we<00:04:19.060> travel<00:04:19.479> to

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
step so from there we travel to

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.350 
step so from there we travel to
shangri-la<00:04:19.870> now<00:04:20.590> during<00:04:20.859> shangri-la<00:04:21.459> you

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
shangri-la now during shangri-la you

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.570 
shangri-la now during shangri-la you
know<00:04:22.479> he<00:04:22.660> knows<00:04:23.289> he<00:04:23.530> has<00:04:23.740> to<00:04:23.770> do<00:04:24.039> something<00:04:24.310> is

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
know he knows he has to do something is

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.950 
know he knows he has to do something is
get<00:04:24.789> these<00:04:24.940> black<00:04:25.210> balls

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
get these black balls

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.070 
get these black balls
so<00:04:26.169> you<00:04:26.919> know<00:04:27.039> get<00:04:27.250> whatever<00:04:27.400> he<00:04:27.610> has<00:04:27.699> to<00:04:27.729> get

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
so you know get whatever he has to get

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.529 
so you know get whatever he has to get
so<00:04:29.080> he<00:04:29.229> has<00:04:29.380> those<00:04:29.590> parts<00:04:29.949> that's<00:04:30.819> real<00:04:31.090> simple

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
so he has those parts that's real simple

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.180 
so he has those parts that's real simple
self<00:04:31.780> explanatory<00:04:32.259> so<00:04:32.470> then<00:04:32.740> we<00:04:32.919> finally

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
self explanatory so then we finally

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.860 
self explanatory so then we finally
traveled<00:04:33.729> to<00:04:33.910> move<00:04:34.120> well<00:04:34.419> we<00:04:34.509> actually<00:04:34.599> go

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
traveled to move well we actually go

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.559 
traveled to move well we actually go
over<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:35.110> groom<00:04:35.349> Lake<00:04:35.910> obviously<00:04:36.910> we<00:04:37.270> had<00:04:37.419> no

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:37.569 
over to groom Lake obviously we had no

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.620 
over to groom Lake obviously we had no
way<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:37.810> get<00:04:37.990> to<00:04:38.020> moon<00:04:38.289> but<00:04:38.740> richtofen<00:04:39.639> you

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
way to get to moon but richtofen you

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.580 
way to get to moon but richtofen you
know<00:04:40.750> he<00:04:40.900> knew<00:04:41.050> about<00:04:41.139> these<00:04:41.440> other

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
know he knew about these other

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.260 
know he knew about these other
teleporters<00:04:42.400> that<00:04:42.729> people<00:04:43.030> have<00:04:43.120> been

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
teleporters that people have been

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.670 
teleporters that people have been
working<00:04:43.630> on<00:04:43.780> other<00:04:43.960> governments<00:04:44.440> have<00:04:44.560> been

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
working on other governments have been

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.249 
working on other governments have been
working<00:04:45.039> on<00:04:45.160> which<00:04:45.970> actually<00:04:46.150> explains<00:04:46.660> 5<00:04:46.960> you

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
working on which actually explains 5 you

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.279 
working on which actually explains 5 you
know<00:04:47.410> and<00:04:47.650> in<00:04:47.889> five<00:04:48.599> so<00:04:49.599> how<00:04:49.720> rich<00:04:49.960> for<00:04:50.169> new

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
know and in five so how rich for new

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.589 
know and in five so how rich for new
about<00:04:50.500> five<00:04:50.800> he<00:04:51.190> knew<00:04:51.370> that<00:04:51.400> America<00:04:52.330> had<00:04:52.449> been

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
about five he knew that America had been

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.900 
about five he knew that America had been
working<00:04:52.900> on<00:04:53.020> teleportation<00:04:53.620> devices<00:04:54.039> and<00:04:54.669> so

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
working on teleportation devices and so

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.059 
working on teleportation devices and so
he<00:04:55.030> travels<00:04:55.419> a<00:04:55.479> groom<00:04:55.660> lake<00:04:55.870> we<00:04:56.770> use<00:04:56.919> that

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.069 
he travels a groom lake we use that

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.950 
he travels a groom lake we use that
teleporter<00:04:57.580> to<00:04:57.759> get<00:04:57.940> to<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:58.180> moon<00:04:58.360> which<00:04:58.840> is

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
teleporter to get to the moon which is

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.020 
teleporter to get to the moon which is
where<00:04:59.139> we<00:04:59.259> complete<00:04:59.590> the<00:04:59.740> easter<00:05:00.070> egg<00:05:00.190> now

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
where we complete the easter egg now

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.930 
where we complete the easter egg now
while<00:05:01.300> while<00:05:01.780> moon<00:05:02.020> is<00:05:02.169> actually<00:05:02.289> going<00:05:02.650> on

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
while while moon is actually going on

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:23.469 
tower we get that done and then we

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:25.709 
tower we get that done and then we
actually<00:06:23.889> move<00:06:24.099> on<00:06:24.340> to<00:06:24.580> die<00:06:24.849> rise<00:06:25.150> now<00:06:25.419> and<00:06:25.570> i

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:25.719 
actually move on to die rise now and i

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.899 
actually move on to die rise now and i
rise<00:06:25.990> you<00:06:26.469> know<00:06:26.620> we<00:06:26.860> also<00:06:27.430> have<00:06:27.699> to<00:06:27.789> power

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:27.909 
rise you know we also have to power

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:29.370 
rise you know we also have to power
tower<00:06:28.210> we<00:06:28.419> keep<00:06:28.570> trying<00:06:28.719> and<00:06:28.870> failing<00:06:28.960> trying

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
tower we keep trying and failing trying

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.779 
tower we keep trying and failing trying
feeling<00:06:29.680> we're<00:06:29.830> stuck<00:06:30.009> in<00:06:30.039> a<00:06:30.190> timeless<00:06:30.550> loop

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
feeling we're stuck in a timeless loop

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:33.330 
feeling we're stuck in a timeless loop
but<00:06:31.750> we<00:06:31.840> actually<00:06:31.960> get<00:06:32.289> it<00:06:32.380> done<00:06:32.530> so<00:06:32.800> we<00:06:32.949> power

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
but we actually get it done so we power

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.399 
but we actually get it done so we power
that<00:06:33.490> tower<00:06:33.759> and<00:06:34.120> then<00:06:34.599> obviously<00:06:34.839> we<00:06:35.199> don't

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:35.409 
that tower and then obviously we don't

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:37.350 
that tower and then obviously we don't
move<00:06:35.620> on<00:06:35.800> to<00:06:35.979> mob<00:06:36.250> of<00:06:36.430> the<00:06:36.460> dead<00:06:36.520> but<00:06:36.880> mob<00:06:37.210> of
