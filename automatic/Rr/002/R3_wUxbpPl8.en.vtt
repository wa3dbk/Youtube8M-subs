 tecla 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.470
 came from the hand 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.470
 on the table 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.090
 will consider 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.090
 roll 5 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.539
 trisa 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.690
 from hear 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.730
 no words 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.100
 I can just not your competitor 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.140
 started talking about your group not 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.660
 impressed him i want you 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:32.080
 say a few words literally about 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.210
 my team and me me very 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.760
 understandable pedaling that its not very 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.530
 Mentor and our group is also not very 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.480
 patents and for that reason I generally 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:48.160
 I protest completely firstly because 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:50.740
 I master or mentor this time 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.040
 second there is such a Russian demotic 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.510
 scapegoat expression here I 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.660
 strongly against my team 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.870
 was a scapegoat so they spoke 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.870
 fine 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.570
 stand up for yourself and your team 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.600
 Odesa I like what you did 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.710
 Now I will say about 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.110
 rival firm they were very 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.870
 beautiful and sexy very impressive 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.430
 their costumes energetically but at the end of 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:25.750
 I got the impression that we have 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:29.050
 a little lead singer and her group some 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.220
 zest rap in Russian she is very bright 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.210
 was oh that's how 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:37.720
 yes mister song is difficult and guys are not 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:40.180
 just know their worth the song is complicated 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.890
 polyphonic and what is called the order 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.870
 no less did I hear 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.210
 and consider each say for 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.030
 wonderful for the idea of artem there 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:52.690
 rules to read rap in Russian 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:56.110
 but that is not enough pressure for this important 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:58.320
 the song seems to me to require a big 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.880
 and Nastya herself need to perform 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.670
 causing insolent something and in some kind 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:07.260
 degrees yes thats god being confident 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.260
 We currently also 100 percent 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.910
 thanks i feel rage of you now 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:16.139
 definite present well go to 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.139
 Timati he is waiting for you 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.160
 heard the opinion of constantin and now want 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:30.540
 ask timati do you agree 

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.280
 despite the fact that the folk team is not 

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:35.670
 absolutely perfect in this room from the point 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:37.830
 Vocal view we look confident all 

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.580
 and it is a fact I can not understand what you 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:42.970
 They dug up Artem 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:45.400
 incomprehensible to me straight wildly you infer from 

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.750
 the fact that we will constantly call our group 

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.409
 they say that here arti marti 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:52.439
 we don't have one person and 2 or 3 

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:56.710
 there are four of us equal 

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:58.539
 team members boys when you 

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:01.530
 criticize it means they give you 

00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:01.530
 opportunity to grow
