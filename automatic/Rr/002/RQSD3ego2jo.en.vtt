a<00:01:07.530> storm<00:01:07.860> with<00:01:08.010> them<00:01:08.220> your<00:01:08.640> menu<00:01:08.909> have<00:01:09.060> some

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
a storm with them your menu have some

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.480 
a storm with them your menu have some
more<00:01:09.420> level<00:01:09.689> eights<00:01:09.840> there<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.799> lot<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.310> that

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
more level eights there so a lot of that

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.770 
more level eights there so a lot of that
deck<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.760> probably<00:01:12.090> going<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.270> be<00:01:12.360> really

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
deck is probably going to be really

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.789

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
card like I said I think it would I

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.230 
card like I said I think it would I
think<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:46.979> be<00:01:47.009> useful<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> level

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
think it can be useful for like a level

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.569 
think it can be useful for like a level
8<00:01:48.540> synchro<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.380> someone<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.740> dec<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.189> know<00:01:50.340> I

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
8 synchro and someone in dec you know I

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.639 
8 synchro and someone in dec you know I
realize<00:01:51.360> things<00:01:51.750> along<00:01:52.079> those<00:01:52.320> nature

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
realize things along those nature

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.260 
realize things along those nature
because<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.460> normal<00:01:53.759> dragon-type

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
because it's a normal dragon-type

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.170 
because it's a normal dragon-type
