one of the audience members asked that

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.449 
one of the audience members asked that
you<00:00:12.389> hinted<00:00:12.780> at<00:00:13.039> connections<00:00:14.039> between<00:00:14.219> music

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:14.459 
you hinted at connections between music

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.310 
you hinted at connections between music
and<00:00:15.059> speech<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.779> they<00:00:15.900> were<00:00:15.959> hoping<00:00:16.230> you

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
might be able to say a little bit more

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.380 
might be able to say a little bit more
about<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.750> sure<00:00:18.750> happy<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:20.239> well<00:00:21.239> you<00:00:21.360> know

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
about that sure happy to well you know

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.939 
about that sure happy to well you know
there's<00:00:21.720> some<00:00:21.900> people<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.169> think<00:00:22.320> speech

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
there's some people that think speech

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.410 
there's some people that think speech
King<00:00:23.220> our<00:00:23.430> language<00:00:24.270> came<00:00:24.509> first<00:00:25.820> and<00:00:26.820> that

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
King our language came first and that

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.089 
King our language came first and that
music<00:00:27.660> came<00:00:28.050> out<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.380> machinery<00:00:28.949> and

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
music came out of that machinery and

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.560 
music came out of that machinery and
there<00:00:29.250> are<00:00:29.339> others<00:00:29.640> like<00:00:29.730> Darwin<00:00:30.390> that

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
there are others like Darwin that

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.020 
there are others like Darwin that
thought<00:00:30.990> no<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.619> reverse<00:00:31.980> was<00:00:32.309> true<00:00:32.339> I

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
thought no the reverse was true I

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.210 
thought no the reverse was true I
actually<00:00:33.210> think<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.690> they<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.470> music<00:00:35.010> and

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
actually think that they that music and

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.810 
actually think that they that music and
language<00:00:36.199> co-evolved<00:00:37.199> together<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.040> you

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
language co-evolved together and you

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.000 
language co-evolved together and you
have<00:00:39.059> musical<00:00:39.780> abilities<00:00:40.290> youth

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
have musical abilities youth

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.950 
have musical abilities youth
differentially<00:00:41.760> more<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.360> side<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.870> the

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
symbolic words and adults and it takes a

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:17.960 
symbolic words and adults and it takes a
long<00:01:16.470> time<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> child<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.369> get<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:17.789> this

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
long time for a child to get to do this

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.650 
long time for a child to get to do this
but<00:01:18.630> if<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.399> adults<00:01:20.399> if<00:01:20.729> they<00:01:21.000> talk<00:01:21.479> to

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
but if you adults if they talk to

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.520 
but if you adults if they talk to
somebody<00:01:21.899> and<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.970> person<00:01:24.390> saying<00:01:24.720> one<00:01:25.229> thing

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
somebody and the person saying one thing

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.440 
somebody and the person saying one thing
with<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> speech<00:01:26.810> but<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.200> body<00:01:28.770> language

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
with a speech but the body language

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.620 
with a speech but the body language
makes<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.780> listener<00:01:31.530> suspect<00:01:32.399> the<00:01:32.670> veracity

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
makes the listener suspect the veracity

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.990 
makes the listener suspect the veracity
of<00:01:33.660> what<00:01:33.780> they're<00:01:34.080> saying<00:01:34.319> the<00:01:35.310> listener<00:01:35.819> is

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
of what they're saying the listener is

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.419 
of what they're saying the listener is
going<00:01:36.330> to<00:01:36.479> go<00:01:37.080> with<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.410> tone<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.649> voice<00:01:37.830> and

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
going to go with the tone of voice and

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.719 
going to go with the tone of voice and
that's<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.690> learned<00:01:40.020> skill<00:01:40.649> so<00:01:41.039> I<00:01:41.069> think<00:01:41.190> that

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
that's a learned skill so I think that

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.809 
that's a learned skill so I think that
the<00:01:41.940> Machinery's<00:01:42.840> there<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.619> co-evolve<00:01:44.069> and

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
the Machinery's there it co-evolve and

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:46.760 
the Machinery's there it co-evolve and
I'm<00:01:44.910> not<00:01:45.030> talking<00:01:45.270> about<00:01:45.300> symphonies<00:01:45.989> you

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
I'm not talking about symphonies you

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.130 
I'm not talking about symphonies you
know<00:01:46.860> any<00:01:47.550> more<00:01:47.759> than<00:01:47.819> Shakespeare's<00:01:48.539> sonnets

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
know any more than Shakespeare's sonnets

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.740 
know any more than Shakespeare's sonnets
those<00:01:49.410> are<00:01:49.649> even<00:01:50.039> more<00:01:50.340> derived<00:01:50.880> out<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.420> those

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
those are even more derived out of those

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.229 
those are even more derived out of those
two<00:01:52.349> facets<00:01:52.800> but<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.009> really<00:01:53.369> think<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:54.119> know

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:54.239 
two facets but I really think you know

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:57.919 
two facets but I really think you know
the<00:01:54.360> brain<00:01:54.599> evolved<00:01:55.610> together<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.970> these<00:01:57.599> are

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
the brain evolved together and these are

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.139 
the brain evolved together and these are
and<00:01:58.560> they<00:01:58.679> time<00:01:58.920> share<00:01:59.250> music<00:01:59.550> and<00:01:59.819> language

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
and they time share music and language

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.960 
and they time share music and language
some<00:02:00.569> parts<00:02:00.929> of<00:02:01.050> the<00:02:01.200> brain<00:02:01.410> and<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.819> I<00:02:02.849> think

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
some parts of the brain and so I think

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.629 
some parts of the brain and so I think
it<00:02:03.209> was<00:02:03.300> together
