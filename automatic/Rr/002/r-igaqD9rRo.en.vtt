00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.810
 this video is presented by he's man Rogier your boiler 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.079
 Hello GR is offering you a video called Gold Citic 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:12.679
 the karts and much more 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:13.530
 therefore 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.530
 Emma MoobiAir the 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.710
 Century gets for the second time to the throne of the tide the good Mr. Kong 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.879
 you can rock on it with pop or something, or at least a pre-decided one 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:32.159
 and that is reinvested from formal again and not completely recovered 

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.660
 to let something grow 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.670
 comparatively little to compare let Nahles 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.200
 one person is like another 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.420
 and 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.510
 what is so far that it is directly from 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.589
 Langendorf year to these bosses is coming 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.539
 there is no amplification between them, but they continue in practice, then follow on 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.350
 the lamb with this bus and percent he has ca 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.570
 a skill Hiddenseer award celebration personnel records 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.180
 Popular on the floor 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.040
 and these wolf's son keep getting farther out of Isny ​​not cocky 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.130
 sound over with the water so he needs someone to stand here is that 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.270
 not so, but they just keep spreading out, that's what they do 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.650
 Graph of and percent that 12 yards according to the problem 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.300
 the people who were there before, of course, the Franke 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.710
 Deduction of percent depending on how long the whole room needs 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.920
 fills in yes 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.009
 then he just looked at the team in the hand and scripts the person like that 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.700
 a little bit what makes states 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.370
 per second so that's percent in normal mode only 4000 but just percent 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.200
 took advantage of writing the damage per second 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.970
 and the whole thing makes it but at least six seconds so so that 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.229
 it's about 60% of damage here you see that the DAX is Witt 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.230
 getting bigger 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.720
 Now I felt strong again 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.550
 in between then still had one then if in South and Fire you can 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.200
 not removed so that was so euro that is the boss percent 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.590
 saving 8 percent more in the time it makes 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.840
 Luckily, Grace is very in between normally when the 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.630
 Batteries should be as Tenk the boss in time then move on that has it 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.760
 Incidentally, Dan Harris Tweed continues to look at our thinking 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.250
 perpetuated space percent so that from there will also be fast 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.920
 must be on the road says our Finck did not do it now I want it too 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.889
 to Trieste 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:28.379
 Percent give but understand somehow from the operation 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.619
 2 in Group 2 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.589
 If you should do it there is still another 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:34.899
 Arne more skills through a curse 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:40.269
 Dr partly resulted in that 50 percent slower it still 50 percent 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.049
 slow Karstedt so that feels very very ugly 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.049
 especially if you just Jung wants to flee from murder 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:50.909
 that is at the stupid year so as said the pheasant hat on fall 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.390
 you should always with you 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.130
 three as well the complexion should have run away from him and so that the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.379
 op-team follows 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.540
 Percent make the car possible first make percent expected Dennis Aogo built 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.629
 has or around 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.790
 but only as long as the tantrum of the court is that here Arkeia 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.230
 second little caution makes the fight easy again that we again 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.039
 you can watch 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:17.029
 Here you see the head only if you want to pick up the hand for six seconds 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:22.039
 Pupation of the damage per second and percent after that day fisherman 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:24.099
 is getting bigger and you can see that now too 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.899
 Raúl Castro for the second and the 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:30.099
 Ferguson parts for about a minute 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.789
 so that you should come naturally that the room is good 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:34.639
 is filled in the eighth game 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.669
 but I think of all things when you make me good to the growing 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.219
 Series becomes relatively good 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:43.919
 but only if you are not so good for shipping then you can 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.809
 whole to be already fatal 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:49.249
 the bill at the end of the games is so high that in March 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:50.489
 1 can do 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.810
 that's so that for me a little stupid to sober must me 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.469
 then position again 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:59.269
 under 60 years can do little under 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.139
 and Janka back on the course which must be in line accordingly 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.819
 Percent drift when in the tantrum, it is just at the beginning of their host 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.249
 Schillings will take 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:12.399
 he took notice of it's bulk he'll catch it now 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:14.119
 also enormous 

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:16.180
 Fischer an Rhein the duo because 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.810
 l whoever wants to can not do whatever he wants as a loan now also not much later 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.620
 and through them as much as you still do 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.810
 to England or even in advance not in the spirit of cunning 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.430
 So that's the boss is a technically difficult of what you do 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.530
 But you have to do it if you have little damage 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.069
 It can be very difficult around here 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:38.270
 the others offer IFS and the whole load of the abrupt ones you see as always 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.560
 if the point is you 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.130
 there are also all the videos listed sometimes if they are good to others 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.960
 word 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.710
 Until next time
