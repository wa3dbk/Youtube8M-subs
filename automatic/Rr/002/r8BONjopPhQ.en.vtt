our<00:00:05.940> minds<00:00:06.180> on<00:00:06.450> collecting<00:00:06.960> water<00:00:07.200> I<00:00:07.560> need

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
our minds on collecting water I need

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.470 
our minds on collecting water I need
lots<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.309> water<00:00:08.490> for<00:00:08.790> my<00:00:08.880> natural<00:00:09.269> swimming

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
pool and I collect some of it well most

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.390 
pool and I collect some of it well most
of<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.599> from<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.990> Roos<00:00:13.170> but<00:00:13.530> some<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.009> from

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
of it from the Roos but some of it from

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.820 
of it from the Roos but some of it from
this<00:00:14.880> roof<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.690> summer<00:00:15.929> house<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.379> built<00:00:16.590> by

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
this roof of the summer house I built by

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.950 
this roof of the summer house I built by
the<00:00:16.890> pool<00:00:17.240> now<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.300> good<00:00:18.750> thing<00:00:18.810> about

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
the pool now the good thing about

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.359 
the pool now the good thing about
rainwater<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.820> it's<00:00:21.000> almost<00:00:21.689> pure

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
rainwater is that it's almost pure

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.800 
rainwater is that it's almost pure
collects<00:00:23.369> few<00:00:23.640> bits<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.910> just<00:00:24.150> particles<00:00:24.660> as

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
collects few bits of just particles as

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.660 
collects few bits of just particles as
it<00:00:24.960> falls<00:00:25.170> through<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.560> atmosphere<00:00:25.670> but

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
it falls through the atmosphere but

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.950 
it falls through the atmosphere but
other<00:00:26.789> than<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.269> pretty<00:00:27.330> good<00:00:27.750> and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
other than that it's pretty good and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.609 
other than that it's pretty good and
it's<00:00:28.050> my<00:00:28.170> best<00:00:28.500> source<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.949> water<00:00:30.050> but<00:00:31.050> when<00:00:31.500> it

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
it's my best source of water but when it

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.040 
it's my best source of water but when it
hits<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.920> roof<00:00:32.540> it<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.780> pick<00:00:33.989> up

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
hits the roof it can pick up

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.740 
hits the roof it can pick up
contaminants<00:00:34.920> bird<00:00:35.130> poo<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.820> pollen<00:00:36.570> and

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
contaminants bird poo and pollen and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.799 
contaminants bird poo and pollen and
stuff<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.260> dust<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.969> the<00:00:38.969> first<00:00:39.239> flush

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
stuff like that dust and the first flush

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.610 
stuff like that dust and the first flush
of<00:00:40.010> rainwater<00:00:41.010> coming<00:00:41.550> down<00:00:42.140> drain<00:00:43.140> pipe<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
of rainwater coming down drain pipe and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.350 
of rainwater coming down drain pipe and
into<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.160> pool<00:00:44.370> where<00:00:44.610> I'm<00:00:44.700> collecting<00:00:45.180> it

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
into the pool where I'm collecting it

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.690 
into the pool where I'm collecting it
can<00:00:45.899> contain<00:00:46.289> lots<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.620> nutrients<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.340> we<00:00:47.550> want

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
can contain lots of nutrients so we want

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.240 
can contain lots of nutrients so we want
to<00:00:47.789> get<00:00:47.910> rid<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.300> first<00:00:48.539> flush<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.800> hence

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
to get rid of the first flush so hence

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.660 
to get rid of the first flush so hence
this<00:00:51.149> cunning<00:00:51.809> device<00:00:52.500> well<00:00:53.160> what<00:00:53.370> we've<00:00:53.489> got

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
this cunning device well what we've got

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.330 
this cunning device well what we've got
here<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:55.100> pivot<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:57.199> I've<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.559> used<00:00:58.980> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
here is a pivot and I've just used a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.600 
here is a pivot and I've just used a
child<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.899> recycle<00:01:02.629> wheel<00:01:03.629> from<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.229> bicycle

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
child we recycle wheel from a bicycle

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.010 
child we recycle wheel from a bicycle
it's<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.939> those<00:01:06.000> stabilizing<00:01:06.659> wheels<00:01:06.810> in

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
it's one of those stabilizing wheels in

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.280 
it's one of those stabilizing wheels in
fact<00:01:07.760> it's<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.000> them<00:01:09.860> to<00:01:10.860> my<00:01:12.080> child's<00:01:13.080> have

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
fact it's one of them to my child's have

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.550 
fact it's one of them to my child's have
to<00:01:13.409> learn<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.799> cycle<00:01:14.250> pretty<00:01:14.520> quickly<00:01:14.760> anyway

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
to learn to cycle pretty quickly anyway

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.840 
to learn to cycle pretty quickly anyway
so<00:01:16.560> I've<00:01:16.710> got<00:01:16.860> all<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.009> them<00:01:17.189> there<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.790> just

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
so I've got all of them there it just

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.460 
so I've got all of them there it just
happened<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.840> around<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.320> could

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
happened to have it around you could

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.280 
happened to have it around you could
just<00:01:19.650> use<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> bolt<00:01:20.450> through<00:01:21.450> there<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.200> a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290

there we go okay we've got the water
coming<00:01:56.930> down<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:57.230> gutter<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:58.670> here's<00:01:58.940> been

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
coming down the gutter and here's been

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.710 
coming down the gutter and here's been
diverted<00:01:59.750> into<00:02:00.410> the<00:02:00.830> bucket<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.690> bucket

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
diverted into the bucket and the bucket

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.810 
diverted into the bucket and the bucket
is<00:02:03.080> slowly<00:02:03.350> filling<00:02:03.770> with<00:02:04.010> water<00:02:04.040> from<00:02:04.700> the

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
is slowly filling with water from the

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.170 
is slowly filling with water from the
first<00:02:05.090> flush<00:02:08.350> but<00:02:09.350> this<00:02:09.470> will<00:02:09.649> contain<00:02:09.920> over

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
first flush but this will contain over

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.780 
first flush but this will contain over
bird<00:02:11.180> mocking<00:02:11.770> droppings<00:02:12.770> we<00:02:13.160> hope<00:02:13.370> in<00:02:13.640> the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
bird mocking droppings we hope in the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.240 
bird mocking droppings we hope in the
bucket<00:02:14.060> here<00:02:14.180> there<00:02:15.110> we<00:02:15.200> go<00:02:15.260> when<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.100> gets

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
bucket here there we go when it gets

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.550
