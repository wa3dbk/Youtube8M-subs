00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.690 
conduction speaker on the glasses
themselves<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.619> isn't<00:01:46.950> mandatory<00:01:47.250> to

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
themselves so that isn't mandatory to

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.149 
themselves so that isn't mandatory to
use<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.630> back<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.079> pouch<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:50.100> hard

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
use but back to the pouch it's just hard

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.420 
use but back to the pouch it's just hard
shell<00:01:50.759> because<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.659> glasses<00:01:52.170> do<00:01:52.350> not<00:01:52.500> fold<00:01:52.890> so

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
shell because the glasses do not fold so

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.190 
shell because the glasses do not fold so
that's<00:01:53.820> why<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.000> pouch<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.600> long<00:01:54.930> and

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
that's why the pouch is so long and

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.590 
that's why the pouch is so long and
that's<00:01:55.680> why<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.890> need<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.250> hard<00:01:56.460> shell<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.119> in

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that's why I need to be hard shell so in

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.660 
that's why I need to be hard shell so in

because obviously you're not going to

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.280 
because obviously you're not going to
make<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.090> glasses<00:02:39.420> out<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.660> plastic<00:02:40.170> or

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
make the glasses out of plastic or

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.930 
make the glasses out of plastic or
something<00:02:40.650> because<00:02:40.830> they<00:02:41.310> can<00:02:41.459> easily<00:02:41.700> break

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
something because they can easily break

the<00:03:49.620> bottom<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.160> trackpad<00:03:50.610> platform

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
the bottom of the trackpad platform

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.910 
the bottom of the trackpad platform
there<00:03:51.570> is<00:03:51.660> a<00:03:51.690> micro<00:03:52.049> USB<00:03:52.440> port<00:03:52.470> for<00:03:52.769> charging

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
there is a micro USB port for charging

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.039 
there is a micro USB port for charging
and<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:53.910> where<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.120> mono<00:03:54.299> earbud<00:03:54.570> plugs

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
and that is where the mono earbud plugs

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.440 
and that is where the mono earbud plugs
in<00:03:55.320> but<00:03:55.890> moving<00:03:56.160> further<00:03:56.340> down<00:03:56.459> we<00:03:57.000> have<00:03:57.239> the

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
in but moving further down we have the

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.080 
in but moving further down we have the
bone<00:03:57.810> conduction<00:03:58.440> speaker<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:59.519> model<00:03:59.820> earbud

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
bone conduction speaker the model earbud

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.729 
bone conduction speaker the model earbud
is<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.329> alternative<00:04:00.900> for<00:04:01.140> that<00:04:01.290> but

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
is the alternative for that but

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.140 
is the alternative for that but
essentially<00:04:02.190> how<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.370> bone<00:04:02.670> in<00:04:02.790> conduction

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
essentially how the bone in conduction

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.990 
essentially how the bone in conduction
speaker<00:04:03.420> works<00:04:03.900> is<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.769> rattles<00:04:05.310> your<00:04:05.579> skull

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
speaker works is it rattles your skull

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.630 
speaker works is it rattles your skull
and<00:04:06.299> that<00:04:06.780> produces<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.320> sound<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:08.070> isn't<00:04:08.549> the

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
and that produces a sound it isn't the

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.130 
and that produces a sound it isn't the
best<00:04:08.820> sound<00:04:09.030> quality<00:04:09.209> out<00:04:09.630> there<00:04:09.810> but<00:04:10.019> it

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
best sound quality out there but it

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.199 
best sound quality out there but it
works<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.739> it's<00:04:10.980> really<00:04:11.160> cool<00:04:11.430> if<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:11.760> ask<00:04:11.820> me

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
works and it's really cool if you ask me

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.449 
works and it's really cool if you ask me
taking<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:12.870> look<00:04:13.019> at<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.290> audio<00:04:13.650> alternative

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
taking a look at the audio alternative

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.520 
taking a look at the audio alternative
the<00:04:14.790> mono<00:04:15.000> earbud<00:04:15.299> it's<00:04:15.930> pretty<00:04:16.200> cool<00:04:16.440> and

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
the mono earbud it's pretty cool and

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.930 
the mono earbud it's pretty cool and
pretty<00:04:16.739> stylish<00:04:17.400> but<00:04:17.519> I'm<00:04:17.640> going<00:04:17.729> to<00:04:17.820> stick

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
pretty stylish but I'm going to stick

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.699 
pretty stylish but I'm going to stick
with<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.120> bone<00:04:18.299> conduction<00:04:18.630> speaker<00:04:18.959> because

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
with the bone conduction speaker because

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.170 
with the bone conduction speaker because
I<00:04:19.979> don't<00:04:20.310> want<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.489> walk<00:04:20.609> around<00:04:20.790> with<00:04:21.030> an

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
I don't want to walk around with an

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.270 
I don't want to walk around with an
earbud<00:04:21.359> because<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:22.049> kind<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.320> hurts<00:04:22.590> on<00:04:22.890> the

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
earbud because that kind of hurts on the

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.070 
earbud because that kind of hurts on the
top<00:04:23.520> of<00:04:23.550> Google<00:04:23.940> glass<00:04:24.180> there<00:04:24.539> is<00:04:24.690> a<00:04:24.720> quick

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
top of Google glass there is a quick

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.080 
the shades attached to Google glass I'm
not<00:04:35.770> really<00:04:35.889> too<00:04:36.129> fond<00:04:36.430> of<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:36.699> it's<00:04:36.909> not

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
not really too fond of it it's not

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.279 
not really too fond of it it's not
really<00:04:37.330> that<00:04:37.449> appealing<00:04:37.599> to<00:04:37.960> me<00:04:38.050> in<00:04:38.199> my

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
really that appealing to me in my

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.040 
really that appealing to me in my
opinion<00:04:38.680> but<00:04:39.099> let<00:04:39.250> me<00:04:39.280> know<00:04:39.370> if<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:39.759> like<00:04:40.000> it

working<00:04:43.330> on<00:04:43.930> partnering<00:04:44.770> up<00:04:44.979> with<00:04:45.039> other

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
working on partnering up with other

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.330 
working on partnering up with other
companies<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.599> make<00:04:46.720> shades<00:04:47.110> so<00:04:47.530> maybe<00:04:47.710> that

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
companies to make shades so maybe that

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.920 
companies to make shades so maybe that
will<00:04:48.550> be<00:04:48.699> a<00:04:48.729> bit<00:04:48.940> more<00:04:49.060> appealing<00:04:49.360> for<00:04:49.569> me<00:04:49.720> once

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
will be a bit more appealing for me once

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.510 
will be a bit more appealing for me once
other<00:04:50.229> companies<00:04:50.440> start<00:04:50.889> producing<00:04:51.099> shades

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
other companies start producing shades

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.999 
other companies start producing shades
I'll<00:04:51.879> maybe<00:04:52.150> pick<00:04:52.449> up<00:04:52.569> a<00:04:52.720> few<00:04:52.900> to<00:04:53.020> review<00:04:53.409> but

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009
