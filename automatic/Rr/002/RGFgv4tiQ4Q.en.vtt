00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.450
 bamboo fishing rod is a classic 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:08.389
 the split bamboo cane exists from 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.790
 early 19th century nowadays 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.860
 synthetic reeds abound but the 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.440
 bamboo still has the appeal of what 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.420
 Traditional people still DEALING 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.420
 hook with rod and all 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.600
 a bamboo cane is considered a 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.170
 work of art in the circles of 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.170
 fishermen 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.940
 to start the process the artisan 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.940
 toast a bamboo stick in a flame 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.050
 he holds her close to the fire but not 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.329
 too close a movement of the fake 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.999
 and I could burn it 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.350
 the goal is for the bamboo to acquire 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:51.350
 golden brown hue 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.810
 the toasted bamboo 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.810
 and passes it along the rod 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.989
 open the rod by dividing it into 2 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.060
 then the artisan continues to open the 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.140
 bamboo and making strips of less than one 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.140
 centimeter wide 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.890
 lowers the knots on the outside of 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.770
 Each strip using a belt sander 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.630
 then go to the milling machine that 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.120
 narrow the bottom of the strip 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.740
 watching it at an angle of 60 degrees 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.990
 from end to end 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.799
 this vital step will affect performance 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.799
 of the cane 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.260
 all the strips have to be perfect 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.380
 the artisan inspections in search of 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.920
 defects and then 16 forming a 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.920
 hexagon 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.620
 wrap them with cotton thread to 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.620
 hold it gently on one end 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.130
 then submerge the strips in a tank 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.130
 thermos hardened glue 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.869
 winding machine that joins all the strips 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.760
 it is a provisional wrapper a kind 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.380
 engraving to hold together the 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.570
 pieces while the tail dries 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.520
 the pieces are now only one but the 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.190
 result never fits perfectly 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.420
 straight so the craftsman heats the 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.270
 reed in a flame 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.560
 the heat softens the bamboo so that it 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.560
 can analyze the creases 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.960
 then stick some silver tubes 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.470
 Nickel-plated on bamboo pieces 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.470
 laminate 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.800
 these tubes will be used to connect the 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.170
 Toe cap and heel of the cane 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.430
 the heel pad goes through a lathe where a 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.430
 blade cuts it 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.110
 in certain sections to accommodate the 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.180
 Handle and reel stand 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.450
 the local support for the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.730
 reel 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.819
 and slip some cork rings 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.930
 on the cane to make the hilt 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.420
 the rings are glued 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.189
 it takes between 12 and 14 to make 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.610
 a handle for a bamboo cane 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:15.660
 normal 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.850
 will provide a claw and soft and 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.460
 anti-slip 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.600
 once the tail dries it deforms 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.600
 the cork on a lathe 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.610
 to give it a uniform finish 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.319
 then cola is heated in a flame 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.520
 the hot tail of the toe is applied 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.020
 stainless steel and sticks in the 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.020
 narrow end of the cane 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.740
 with black ink you write the 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.740
 model and the serial number on the street 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.209
 and varnish 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.209
 using a cooking stone 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.209
 reeds are hung to dry 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.310
 now three hands of varnish are missing for 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.800
 that take a nice shine 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.319
 with a silk thread join the guides of 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.250
 steel to the cane are the rings by the 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.250
 what will happen the line 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.750
 three coats of varnish are applied to the yarn 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.750
 this solidifies 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.319
 a ring slides on the support 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.389
 of the reel to provide certain 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:36.389
 separation of the cork handle 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:42.509
 they are mounted on the toe cap and the heel 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.509
 the bamboo cane 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.460
 They have needed 40 hours to do this 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.889
 bamboo cane now only remains 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.000
 wonder how long it will take you 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.000
 catch a good piece
