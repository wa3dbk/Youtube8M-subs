be the gray one on the bottom now taking
a<00:00:20.200> closer<00:00:20.439> look<00:00:20.560> at<00:00:20.770> this<00:00:20.860> stake<00:00:21.040> you'll

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
a closer look at this stake you'll

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:22.499 
a closer look at this stake you'll
actually<00:00:21.340> notice<00:00:21.550> that<00:00:21.759> this<00:00:21.939> is<00:00:22.119> the<00:00:22.270> stick

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
actually notice that this is the stick

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.499 
actually notice that this is the stick
that's<00:00:22.869> replacing<00:00:23.320> the<00:00:23.559> east<00:00:23.800> and<00:00:24.070> SE<00:00:24.460> 16<00:00:25.090> aki

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
that's replacing the east and SE 16 aki

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.889 
that's replacing the east and SE 16 aki
stick

00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:25.899 
stick

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.109 
stick
so<00:00:26.200> it<00:00:26.290> really<00:00:26.380> builds<00:00:26.860> off<00:00:27.009> wood<00:00:27.250> the<00:00:27.430> SE<00:00:27.730> 16

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
so it really builds off wood the SE 16

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.030 
so it really builds off wood the SE 16
was<00:00:28.300> known<00:00:28.419> for<00:00:28.630> that<00:00:28.779> ultimate<00:00:29.320> feel<00:00:29.710> and

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
was known for that ultimate feel and

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.769 
was known for that ultimate feel and
overall<00:00:30.579> balance<00:00:31.029> of<00:00:31.180> the<00:00:31.270> six<00:00:31.540> so<00:00:31.630> they've

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
overall balance of the six so they've

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.990 
overall balance of the six so they've
done<00:00:31.899> a<00:00:31.930> great<00:00:32.110> job<00:00:32.290> at<00:00:32.770> offering<00:00:33.190> performance

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
done a great job at offering performance

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.970 
done a great job at offering performance
as<00:00:34.120> well<00:00:34.300> as<00:00:34.360> that<00:00:34.690> ideal<00:00:35.140> equilibrium<00:00:35.890> of

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
as well as that ideal equilibrium of

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.349 
as well as that ideal equilibrium of
that<00:00:36.070> balance<00:00:36.460> point<00:00:36.730> between<00:00:36.789> the<00:00:37.120> stick

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:37.359 
that balance point between the stick

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:39.750 
that balance point between the stick
I'll<00:00:38.050> go<00:00:38.230> into<00:00:38.440> some<00:00:38.829> of<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:39.010> ways<00:00:39.550> that

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
I'll go into some of the ways that

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.579 
I'll go into some of the ways that
they've<00:00:39.910> done<00:00:40.089> that<00:00:40.149> in<00:00:40.359> a<00:00:40.449> moment<00:00:40.600> but<00:00:41.350> first

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589 
they've done that in a moment but first

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.410 
they've done that in a moment but first
taking<00:00:42.070> a<00:00:42.190> look<00:00:42.370> at<00:00:42.489> the<00:00:42.579> overall<00:00:42.820> shaft<00:00:43.210> all

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
taking a look at the overall shaft all

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.750 
taking a look at the overall shaft all
its<00:00:43.570> pretty<00:00:43.870> traditional<00:00:44.379> hockey<00:00:44.890> stick<00:00:45.219> will

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
its pretty traditional hockey stick will

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.239 
its pretty traditional hockey stick will
feel<00:00:46.420> to<00:00:46.600> it<00:00:46.690> maybe<00:00:46.899> slightly<00:00:47.469> concave<00:00:47.859> walls

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.249 
feel to it maybe slightly concave walls

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:50.189 
feel to it maybe slightly concave walls
but<00:00:48.550> pretty<00:00:48.789> straight<00:00:49.059> feel<00:00:49.300> rounded<00:00:49.780> corners

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
but pretty straight feel rounded corners

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.950 
but pretty straight feel rounded corners
it<00:00:50.469> does<00:00:50.890> have<00:00:51.129> a<00:00:51.489> complete<00:00:51.969> Kevlar<00:00:52.510> wrap<00:00:52.719> on

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
it does have a complete Kevlar wrap on

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.349 
it does have a complete Kevlar wrap on
this<00:00:53.109> so<00:00:53.620> that's<00:00:53.800> gonna<00:00:53.920> offer<00:00:54.219> that<00:00:54.760> a<00:00:54.789> great

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
this so that's gonna offer that a great

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.329 
this so that's gonna offer that a great
vibration<00:00:56.079> dampening<00:00:56.859> as<00:00:57.010> well<00:00:57.219> as

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
vibration dampening as well as

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:58.970 
vibration dampening as well as
durability<00:00:57.819> you<00:00:57.879> can<00:00:58.030> kind<00:00:58.239> of<00:00:58.300> feel<00:00:58.600> that

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
durability you can kind of feel that

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.649 
durability you can kind of feel that

that you can now see on the stick is the

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.190 
that you can now see on the stick is the
actual<00:01:09.610> I'm<00:01:10.000> carbon<00:01:10.480> they're<00:01:10.690> using<00:01:10.960> here<00:01:11.050> you

actual I'm carbon they're using here you
can<00:01:11.320> see<00:01:11.560> that<00:01:11.740> layer<00:01:11.950> of<00:01:12.040> carbon<00:01:12.310> right<00:01:12.550> on

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
can see that layer of carbon right on

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.940 
can see that layer of carbon right on
the<00:01:12.730> stick<00:01:12.940> so<00:01:13.420> it's<00:01:13.570> really<00:01:13.690> nice<00:01:13.900> and<00:01:14.230> East

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
the stick so it's really nice and East

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.020 
the stick so it's really nice and East
and<00:01:15.130> actually<00:01:15.370> what<00:01:15.520> they've<00:01:15.670> really<00:01:15.820> done

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
and actually what they've really done

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.460 
and actually what they've really done
with<00:01:16.180> this<00:01:16.360> is<00:01:16.510> they<00:01:16.720> made<00:01:16.930> a<00:01:16.960> lot<00:01:17.260> of<00:01:17.290> the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
with this is they made a lot of the

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.710 
with this is they made a lot of the
features<00:01:17.800> that<00:01:17.830> was<00:01:18.490> present<00:01:18.880> on<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:19.030> SE<00:01:19.270> 16

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
features that was present on the SE 16

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.090 
features that was present on the SE 16
actually<00:01:19.900> visible<00:01:20.440> in<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.620> stick<00:01:20.800> and<00:01:20.920> kind

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
actually visible in the stick and kind

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.710 
actually visible in the stick and kind
of<00:01:21.130> took<00:01:21.280> it<00:01:21.370> to<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.580> next<00:01:21.760> level<00:01:21.850> so<00:01:22.510> as<00:01:22.600> you

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
of took it to the next level so as you

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.300 
of took it to the next level so as you
go<00:01:22.840> ahead<00:01:22.930> and<00:01:23.140> move<00:01:23.260> down<00:01:23.530> you'll<00:01:24.040> notice

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
go ahead and move down you'll notice

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.010 
go ahead and move down you'll notice
that<00:01:24.400> it<00:01:24.520> has<00:01:24.610> a<00:01:24.640> nice<00:01:24.880> taper<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.660> stick<00:01:25.870> so

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
that it has a nice taper to the stick so

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.600 
that it has a nice taper to the stick so
it's<00:01:26.110> going<00:01:26.200> to<00:01:26.260> have<00:01:26.440> that<00:01:26.560> low<00:01:26.830> kick<00:01:27.400> point

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
it's going to have that low kick point

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.460 
it's going to have that low kick point
as<00:01:27.820> well<00:01:28.000> moving<00:01:28.840> down<00:01:29.020> into<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.320> blade

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
as well moving down into the blade

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.260 
as well moving down into the blade
they've<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.800> continue<00:01:30.430> to<00:01:30.580> use<00:01:30.700> that<00:01:30.730> focus

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
they've a continue to use that focus

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.150 
they've a continue to use that focus
weight<00:01:31.420> technology<00:01:32.110> however<00:01:32.680> this<00:01:32.890> year

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
weight technology however this year

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.430 
weight technology however this year
compared<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:33.640> last<00:01:33.790> year's<00:01:34.300> SE<00:01:34.660> 16<00:01:35.110> they

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
compared to last year's SE 16 they

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.470 
compared to last year's SE 16 they
actually<00:01:35.800> make<00:01:36.010> those<00:01:36.220> weights<00:01:36.610> more<00:01:36.970> visible

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
actually make those weights more visible

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.030 
actually make those weights more visible
in<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.660> blade<00:01:37.870> so<00:01:38.320> you<00:01:38.380> can<00:01:38.530> actually<00:01:38.650> see

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
in the blade so you can actually see

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.860 
in the blade so you can actually see
here<00:01:39.250> I<00:01:39.310> have<00:01:39.550> a<00:01:39.580> set<00:01:40.270> of<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.480> weights<00:01:40.660> that

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
here I have a set of the weights that

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.140 
here I have a set of the weights that
they're<00:01:41.020> embedding<00:01:41.470> in<00:01:41.590> it<00:01:41.740> these<00:01:42.400> weights<00:01:42.970> on

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
they're embedding in it these weights on

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.360 
they're embedding in it these weights on
the<00:01:43.300> EQ<00:01:43.660> 50<00:01:44.020> is<00:01:44.110> actually<00:01:44.410> 20<00:01:44.770> grams<00:01:45.010> so<00:01:45.310> it's

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
the EQ 50 is actually 20 grams so it's

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.650 
the EQ 50 is actually 20 grams so it's
concentrating<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.120> weight<00:01:46.240> right<00:01:46.480> at<00:01:46.570> the

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
concentrating the weight right at the

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.870 
concentrating the weight right at the
heel<00:01:46.870> a<00:01:47.080> few<00:01:47.710> thing<00:01:47.890> that<00:01:48.100> that's<00:01:48.250> gonna<00:01:48.430> do<00:01:48.700> is

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
heel a few thing that that's gonna do is

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.760 
heel a few thing that that's gonna do is
one<00:01:49.360> is<00:01:49.570> going<00:01:49.900> to<00:01:49.960> give<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.230> blade<00:01:50.410> more<00:01:50.650> of<00:01:50.710> a

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
one is going to give the blade more of a

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.440 
one is going to give the blade more of a
solid<00:01:51.160> feel<00:01:51.370> to<00:01:51.430> it<00:01:51.640> so<00:01:51.670> epoxy<00:01:52.120> will<00:01:52.240> want<00:01:52.360> to

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
solid feel to it so epoxy will want to

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.640 
solid feel to it so epoxy will want to
stay<00:01:52.630> on<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.810> blade<00:01:53.020> a<00:01:53.050> little<00:01:53.380> bit<00:01:53.500> better

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
stay on the blade a little bit better

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.200 
stay on the blade a little bit better
it's<00:01:54.220> gonna<00:01:54.340> make<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.730> great<00:01:54.970> for<00:01:55.000> those

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
it's gonna make it great for those

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.180 
it's gonna make it great for those
OneTouch<00:01:55.720> passes<00:01:56.230> and<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.440> one-timers<00:01:57.040> as

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
OneTouch passes and the one-timers as

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.950 
OneTouch passes and the one-timers as
well<00:01:57.760> as<00:01:57.850> having<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.210> weight<00:01:58.390> right<00:01:58.600> -<00:01:58.780> he

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
well as having the weight right - he

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.600 
well as having the weight right - he
loved<00:01:59.110> it<00:01:59.260> it's<00:01:59.770> gonna<00:01:59.890> offer<00:02:00.100> a<00:02:00.280> little<00:02:00.490> bit

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
loved it it's gonna offer a little bit

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.950 
loved it it's gonna offer a little bit
better<00:02:00.820> of<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.030> swing<00:02:01.330> weight<00:02:01.540> and<00:02:01.690> it's<00:02:01.810> gonna

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
better of a swing weight and it's gonna

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.300 
better of a swing weight and it's gonna
stay<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.170> little<00:02:02.320> more<00:02:02.440> true<00:02:02.830> throughout<00:02:03.130> the

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
stay a little more true throughout the

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.130 
stay a little more true throughout the
shot<00:02:03.550> I'm<00:02:04.000> instead<00:02:04.390> of<00:02:04.510> having<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:04.870> weight<00:02:04.990> at

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
shot I'm instead of having the weight at

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.510 
shot I'm instead of having the weight at
the<00:02:05.260> end<00:02:05.470> of<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.650> blade<00:02:05.890> it's<00:02:06.100> gonna<00:02:06.190> want<00:02:06.460> to

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
the end of the blade it's gonna want to

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.550 
the end of the blade it's gonna want to
distort<00:02:07.120> less<00:02:07.420> as<00:02:07.660> you're<00:02:07.840> shot<00:02:08.080> so<00:02:08.379> it's<00:02:08.500> a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
distort less as you're shot so it's a

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.529 
distort less as you're shot so it's a
nice<00:02:08.709> feature<00:02:09.250> there<00:02:09.429> and<00:02:09.759> then<00:02:10.300> kind<00:02:10.509> of

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
nice feature there and then kind of

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.869 
nice feature there and then kind of
going<00:02:10.720> on<00:02:11.019> to<00:02:11.499> the<00:02:11.769> other<00:02:12.010> part<00:02:12.459> of<00:02:12.579> the<00:02:12.670> focus

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
going on to the other part of the focus

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.250 
going on to the other part of the focus
weight<00:02:13.150> technologies<00:02:13.749> it's<00:02:13.870> going<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.049> be<00:02:14.109> up

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
weight technologies it's going to be up

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.869 
weight technologies it's going to be up
in<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.469> back<00:02:14.709> end<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.159> it<00:02:15.249> or<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.489> butt<00:02:15.640> end<00:02:15.790> of

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
in the back end of it or the butt end of

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:16.390 
in the back end of it or the butt end of
the<00:02:15.939> stick

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
the stick

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.500 
the stick
and<00:02:16.519> really<00:02:16.819> what<00:02:16.970> that's<00:02:17.060> going<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.330> do<00:02:17.420> is

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
and really what that's going to do is

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.210 
and really what that's going to do is
gonna<00:02:17.690> balance<00:02:18.080> out<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.620> weight<00:02:18.830> from<00:02:19.069> the

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
gonna balance out the weight from the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.160 
gonna balance out the weight from the
blade<00:02:19.549> into<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.450> suit<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.810> has<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:20.959> nice

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
blade into that suit it has a nice

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.960 
blade into that suit it has a nice
overall<00:02:21.860> balanced<00:02:22.250> feel<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.549> this<00:02:22.610> is<00:02:22.760> one<00:02:22.909> of

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
overall balanced feel and this is one of

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.190 
overall balanced feel and this is one of
the<00:02:23.090> new<00:02:23.239> features<00:02:23.629> that<00:02:23.659> they've<00:02:23.989> actually

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
the new features that they've actually

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.770 
the new features that they've actually
featured<00:02:24.680> on<00:02:24.739> this<00:02:24.860> stick<00:02:25.129> is<00:02:25.280> they've<00:02:25.970> added

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
featured on this stick is they've added

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.050 
featured on this stick is they've added
the<00:02:26.959> weights<00:02:27.170> actually<00:02:27.709> in<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.190> butt<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.580> the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
the weights actually in the butt of the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.759 
the weights actually in the butt of the
stick<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.450> you're<00:02:29.599> actually<00:02:29.780> able<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.290> adjust

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
stick and you're actually able to adjust

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.009 
stick and you're actually able to adjust
it<00:02:31.010> yourself<00:02:31.209> so<00:02:32.209> right<00:02:32.390> here<00:02:32.629> I<00:02:32.659> have<00:02:32.930> an

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
it yourself so right here I have an

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.020 
it yourself so right here I have an
example<00:02:33.079> of<00:02:33.860> what<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:34.280> button<00:02:34.549> looks<00:02:34.819> like

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
example of what the button looks like

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.059 
example of what the button looks like
basically<00:02:35.750> has<00:02:36.019> four<00:02:36.319> slots<00:02:36.680> for<00:02:36.920> these

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
basically has four slots for these

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.399 
basically has four slots for these
little<00:02:37.459> weights<00:02:37.730> on<00:02:38.060> each<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.840> these<00:02:38.930> are<00:02:39.140> five

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:39.409 
little weights on each of these are five

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.380 
little weights on each of these are five
grams<00:02:39.799> and<00:02:40.099> you<00:02:40.280> can<00:02:40.400> go<00:02:40.519> ahead<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:40.819> add<00:02:41.090> and

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
grams and you can go ahead and add and

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.910 
grams and you can go ahead and add and
subtract<00:02:41.810> these<00:02:41.989> weights<00:02:42.230> depending<00:02:42.440> on

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
subtract these weights depending on

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.680 
subtract these weights depending on
where<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:43.879> cut<00:02:44.090> your<00:02:44.209> stick

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
where you cut your stick

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.690 
where you cut your stick
so<00:02:45.140> as<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.560> stick<00:02:45.769> is<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:46.099> you'd<00:02:46.519> actually

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
so as the stick is is you'd actually

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.030 
so as the stick is is you'd actually
want<00:02:46.909> to<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.569> weights<00:02:47.750> in<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.079> and<00:02:48.230> then<00:02:48.739> on

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040

in it and right here before so to go

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.030 
in it and right here before so to go
ahead<00:02:59.810> it's<00:02:59.989> really<00:03:00.170> easy<00:03:00.379> to<00:03:00.530> interchange

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
ahead it's really easy to interchange

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.860 
ahead it's really easy to interchange
them<00:03:01.489> you<00:03:01.640> just<00:03:01.819> kind<00:03:02.030> of<00:03:02.090> take<00:03:02.239> them<00:03:02.480> go<00:03:02.780> ahead

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
them you just kind of take them go ahead

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.420 
them you just kind of take them go ahead
and<00:03:02.959> slide<00:03:03.319> them<00:03:03.470> in<00:03:03.620> or<00:03:03.769> push<00:03:03.980> them<00:03:04.099> out<00:03:04.250> with

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
and slide them in or push them out with

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.160 
and slide them in or push them out with
a<00:03:04.459> push<00:03:04.819> pin<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.239> that's<00:03:05.690> going<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:05.959> give<00:03:06.079> you

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
a push pin and that's going to give you

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.960 
a push pin and that's going to give you
either<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.769> additional<00:03:07.250> weight<00:03:07.430> or<00:03:07.730> other

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
either to the additional weight or other

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.819 
either to the additional weight or other
weight<00:03:08.209> so<00:03:08.690> basically<00:03:08.989> if<00:03:09.140> you<00:03:09.230> cut<00:03:09.470> down<00:03:09.620> the

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
weight so basically if you cut down the

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.530 
weight so basically if you cut down the
stick<00:03:10.069> it's<00:03:10.549> gonna<00:03:10.670> make<00:03:10.879> a<00:03:10.909> little<00:03:11.180> bit<00:03:11.359> more

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
stick it's gonna make a little bit more

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.849 
stick it's gonna make a little bit more
blade<00:03:11.870> heavy<00:03:12.109> and<00:03:12.379> this<00:03:12.440> is<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.650> way<00:03:12.829> that

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
blade heavy and this is a way that

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.199 
blade heavy and this is a way that
really<00:03:13.250> allows<00:03:13.430> you<00:03:13.579> to<00:03:13.700> customize<00:03:14.180> your

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
really allows you to customize your

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.880 
really allows you to customize your
stick<00:03:14.569> and<00:03:14.690> making<00:03:15.319> sure<00:03:15.500> you<00:03:15.620> still<00:03:15.859> have

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
that overall balanced feel even if

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.750 
that overall balanced feel even if
you're<00:03:18.319> cutting<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.650> a<00:03:18.709> little<00:03:18.890> bit<00:03:19.010> now<00:03:19.700> that
