00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
how do I use a QR code well you have to

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.750 
how do I use a QR code well you have to
start<00:00:39.989> by<00:00:40.140> using<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.800> smartphone<00:00:41.250> with<00:00:41.730> a

can scan it now on android we use

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.279 
can scan it now on android we use
barcode<00:00:46.440> scanner<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:48.000> iphone<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:48.719> use<00:00:48.870> neo

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
barcode scanner and on iphone we use neo

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.869 
barcode scanner and on iphone we use neo
reader<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:50.010> there<00:00:50.160> are<00:00:50.190> other<00:00:50.430> apps<00:00:50.640> out

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
in what ways are we using QR codes so I

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.799 
in what ways are we using QR codes so I
was<00:00:56.399> reading<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.789> magazine<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.600> other<00:00:57.629> day
