increase the hipfire spread and after

that may increase the recall just a

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.319

right<00:01:59.189> now<00:01:59.219> if<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.610> zoom<00:01:59.640> in<00:02:00.030> with<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.299> MSMC

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
right now if you zoom in with the MSMC

right now if you zoom in with the MSMC
with<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:00.990> PDW<00:02:01.469> you're<00:02:01.560> probably<00:02:01.799> not<00:02:02.100> going

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
with the PDW you're probably not going

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.590 
with the PDW you're probably not going
to<00:02:02.369> be<00:02:02.430> getting<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.759> lot<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.909> kills<00:02:03.180> at<00:02:03.299> medium

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
to be getting a lot of kills at medium

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.359 
to be getting a lot of kills at medium
range<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:04.290> if<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.469> actually<00:02:04.619> hit<00:02:04.950> by<00:02:05.159> with

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
range but if you actually hit by with

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.069

the<00:02:05.490> laser<00:02:05.729> side<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.210> come<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.570> be<00:02:06.630> winning<00:02:06.960> a

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
the laser side you come to be winning a

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.809 
the laser side you come to be winning a
ton<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.380> gunfights<00:02:07.860> because<00:02:08.429> they<00:02:08.550> still

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
ton of gunfights because they still

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.369 
ton of gunfights because they still
haven't<00:02:09.179> touched<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.569> damage<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.170> guns

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
haven't touched the damage of the guns

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.920 
haven't touched the damage of the guns
itself<00:02:10.979> anyway<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:11.849> like<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.209> said<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.569> lasers

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
itself anyway so like I said the lasers

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.490 
itself anyway so like I said the lasers
I<00:02:13.020> just<00:02:13.260> made

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
I just made

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.050 
I just made
sure<00:02:13.650> your<00:02:13.950> hipfire<00:02:14.100> spread<00:02:14.310> gets<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.910> little

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
sure your hipfire spread gets a little

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.030 
sure your hipfire spread gets a little
bit<00:02:15.210> tightened<00:02:15.660> cosmic<00:02:16.530> it's<00:02:16.710> just<00:02:16.860> one<00:02:17.010> of

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
bit tightened cosmic it's just one of

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.710 
bit tightened cosmic it's just one of
those<00:02:17.130> attachment<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.910> help<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.300> reload<00:02:18.690> a

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
those attachment that help you reload a

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.450 
those attachment that help you reload a
little<00:02:18.990> bit<00:02:19.080> faster<00:02:19.230> now<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.950> personally

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
little bit faster now I personally

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.700 
little bit faster now I personally
prefer<00:02:20.640> fast<00:02:21.180> mag<00:02:21.450> over<00:02:21.720> extended<00:02:22.230> clip<00:02:22.440> any

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
prefer fast mag over extended clip any

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.100 
prefer fast mag over extended clip any
day<00:02:23.070> but<00:02:23.580> if<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.850> do<00:02:24.060> prefer<00:02:24.420> extended<00:02:24.930> clips

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
day but if you do prefer extended clips

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.750 
day but if you do prefer extended clips
and<00:02:25.290> visually<00:02:25.560> simply<00:02:25.890> use<00:02:26.070> that<00:02:26.310> or<00:02:26.460> you<00:02:26.580> can

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
and visually simply use that or you can

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.160 
and visually simply use that or you can
actually<00:02:26.910> switch<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.450> up<00:02:27.510> for<00:02:27.690> anything<00:02:27.900> else

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
actually switch it up for anything else

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.320 
actually switch it up for anything else
that<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.440> prefer<00:02:28.770> maybe<00:02:29.460> even<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.910> reflex

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
that you prefer maybe even the reflex

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.090 
that you prefer maybe even the reflex
sight<00:02:30.540> because<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:31.020> attachment<00:02:31.320> also<00:02:31.830> works

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
sight because that attachment also works

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.000 
sight because that attachment also works
very<00:02:32.220> well<00:02:32.490> on<00:02:32.700> both<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.150> MSMC<00:02:33.570> in<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:33.990> PDW<00:02:34.530> or

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
very well on both the MSMC in the PDW or

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.560 
very well on both the MSMC in the PDW or
even<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.280> silencer<00:02:35.790> if<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.000> prefer<00:02:36.330> them

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
even the silencer if you prefer them

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.510 
even the silencer if you prefer them
anyway<00:02:37.320> lightweight<00:02:37.800> is<00:02:37.920> simply<00:02:38.280> going<00:02:38.430> to

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
anyway lightweight is simply going to

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.770 
anyway lightweight is simply going to
help<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.880> get<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.090> your<00:02:39.209> enemies<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.570> little

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
help you get to your enemies a little

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.970 
help you get to your enemies a little
bit<00:02:39.870> faster<00:02:40.230> because<00:02:40.380> this<00:02:40.709> gun<00:02:40.950> is

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
bit faster because this gun is

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.520 
bit faster because this gun is
incredibly<00:02:41.730> good<00:02:41.970> up<00:02:42.240> close<00:02:42.270> due<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.350> its

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
incredibly good up close due to its

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.620 
incredibly good up close due to its
damage<00:02:43.980> then<00:02:44.490> toughness<00:02:45.000> will<00:02:45.150> make<00:02:45.300> sure<00:02:45.480> you

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
damage then toughness will make sure you

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.270 
damage then toughness will make sure you
win<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> lot<00:02:46.080> more<00:02:46.200> gun<00:02:46.440> fight<00:02:46.650> because<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.040> gets

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
win a lot more gun fight because it gets

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.010 
win a lot more gun fight because it gets
rid<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.610> flinch<00:02:48.030> when<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.270> actually<00:02:48.420> get<00:02:48.720> shot

rid of flinch when you actually get shot

black ops ii I think I use it on about
ninety-five<00:02:53.730> percent<00:02:53.910> my<00:02:54.150> classes<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:54.780> want<00:02:55.200> to

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
ninety-five percent my classes I want to

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.110 
ninety-five percent my classes I want to
say<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.620> use<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:55.950> on<00:02:56.070> 28<00:02:56.580> out<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.790> 30

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
say that I use it on 28 out of 30

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.150 
say that I use it on 28 out of 30
classes<00:02:57.600> i<00:02:57.660> did<00:02:57.840> buy<00:02:58.020> those<00:02:58.260> extra<00:02:58.590> classes<00:02:58.860> as

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
classes i did buy those extra classes as

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.920 
classes i did buy those extra classes as
well<00:02:59.190> i<00:02:59.580> bought<00:03:00.060> those<00:03:00.239> last<00:03:00.540> week<00:03:00.780> when<00:03:00.900> i

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
well i bought those last week when i

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.360 
well i bought those last week when i
actually<00:03:01.080> wanted<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.500> make<00:03:01.620> one<00:03:01.920> more<00:03:02.100> class

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
actually wanted to make one more class

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.100 
actually wanted to make one more class
and<00:03:02.400> i<00:03:02.640> ended<00:03:02.850> up<00:03:03.000> making<00:03:03.209> about<00:03:03.510> 20<00:03:03.840> extra

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
and i ended up making about 20 extra

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.320 
and i ended up making about 20 extra
classes<00:03:04.440> animate<00:03:05.400> scavenger<00:03:05.820> just<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.180> make

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
classes animate scavenger just to make

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330 
classes animate scavenger just to make
sure<00:03:06.360> that<00:03:06.600> i<00:03:06.660> do<00:03:06.720> not<00:03:07.020> run<00:03:07.290> out<00:03:07.320> of<00:03:07.500> ammo<00:03:07.860> when

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
sure that i do not run out of ammo when

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.370 
sure that i do not run out of ammo when
i'm<00:03:08.430> using<00:03:08.670> an<00:03:08.730> SMG<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.360> especially<00:03:09.690> an<00:03:10.020> SMD

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
i'm using an SMG and especially an SMD

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.320 
i'm using an SMG and especially an SMD
with<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.770> later<00:03:11.010> side<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.520> tend<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.880> spray<00:03:12.300> a

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
with the later side I tend to spray a

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.510 
with the later side I tend to spray a
lot<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:13.020> is<00:03:13.140> why<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.290> scavenger<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.100> I

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
lot so that is why you scavenger and I

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.220 
lot so that is why you scavenger and I
also<00:03:14.700> use<00:03:15.060> gamma<00:03:15.360> just<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.780> make<00:03:15.930> sure<00:03:15.959> that<00:03:16.200> I

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
also use gamma just to make sure that I

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.900 
also use gamma just to make sure that I
do<00:03:16.290> not<00:03:16.620> have<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:17.040> pick<00:03:17.250> up<00:03:17.400> another<00:03:17.670> weapon

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
do not have to pick up another weapon

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.030 
do not have to pick up another weapon
because<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.720> simply<00:03:18.959> hate<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.500> pick<00:03:19.680> up<00:03:19.830> weapons

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
because I simply hate to pick up weapons

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.380 
because I simply hate to pick up weapons
because<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.549> really<00:03:20.820> don't<00:03:20.970> know<00:03:21.209> whether

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
because you really don't know whether

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.580 
because you really don't know whether
the<00:03:21.540> gun<00:03:21.570> that<00:03:21.810> you're<00:03:21.959> going<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.260> be<00:03:22.380> picking

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
the gun that you're going to be picking

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.039 
the gun that you're going to be picking
up<00:03:22.799> is<00:03:22.950> either<00:03:23.070> good<00:03:23.459> or<00:03:23.670> either<00:03:24.150> bet<00:03:24.510> and

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
up is either good or either bet and

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.449 
up is either good or either bet and
dexterity<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.680> going<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:26.040> allow<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.280> to

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
dexterity is going to allow you to

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.460 
dexterity is going to allow you to
mental<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.150> Clive<00:03:27.360> obstacles<00:03:27.930> faster<00:03:28.290> but

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
mental and Clive obstacles faster but

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.259 
mental and Clive obstacles faster but
it's<00:03:28.590> also<00:03:28.830> going<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.310> allow<00:03:29.580> you<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.820> hip<00:03:30.030> fire

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
it's also going to allow you to hip fire

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.210 
it's also going to allow you to hip fire
faster<00:03:30.750> after<00:03:30.930> sprinting<00:03:31.160> now<00:03:32.160> the

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
faster after sprinting now the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.220 
faster after sprinting now the
combination<00:03:32.910> of<00:03:33.030> dexterity<00:03:33.510> together<00:03:34.049> with

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
combination of dexterity together with

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.170 
combination of dexterity together with
the<00:03:34.380> laser<00:03:34.620> sight<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.190> incredibly<00:03:35.700> powerful

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
the laser sight is incredibly powerful

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.880 
the laser sight is incredibly powerful
and<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:36.360> would<00:03:36.510> definitely<00:03:36.750> recommend<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.709> to

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
and I would definitely recommend you to

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.949 
and I would definitely recommend you to
try<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:38.250> out<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.670> then<00:03:39.030> extreme<00:03:39.390> condition<00:03:39.840> is

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
try it out and then extreme condition is

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.630 
try it out and then extreme condition is
going<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.320> allow<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.980> run<00:03:41.190> for<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.459> long

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
going to allow you to run for a long

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.940 
going to allow you to run for a long
duration<00:03:41.880> which<00:03:42.720> is<00:03:42.870> in<00:03:43.019> return<00:03:43.380> go<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.650> help

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
duration which is in return go to help

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.620 
duration which is in return go to help
you<00:03:44.070> get<00:03:44.250> from<00:03:44.459> one<00:03:44.670> side<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.910> another<00:03:45.120> side<00:03:45.420> a

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
you get from one side to another side a

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.630 
you get from one side to another side a
little<00:03:45.989> bit<00:03:46.110> faster<00:03:46.440> anyway<00:03:47.310> that<00:03:47.489> is<00:03:47.519> the

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
little bit faster anyway that is the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.100 
little bit faster anyway that is the
class<00:03:47.820> up<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.120> would<00:03:48.239> actually<00:03:48.480> recommend<00:03:48.630> you

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
class up I would actually recommend you

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.840 
class up I would actually recommend you
to<00:03:49.260> use<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.590> is<00:03:49.829> a<00:03:49.860> lot<00:03:50.130> different<00:03:50.340> from<00:03:50.670> the

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
to use it is a lot different from the

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.060 
to use it is a lot different from the
first<00:03:50.880> MSMC<00:03:51.690> class<00:03:51.989> title<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.320> I<00:03:52.350> uploaded<00:03:52.799> a

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
first MSMC class title that I uploaded a

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.440 
first MSMC class title that I uploaded a
couple<00:03:53.610> of<00:03:53.670> months<00:03:53.940> ago<00:03:54.000> but<00:03:54.269> I<00:03:54.299> actually

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
couple of months ago but I actually

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.810 
couple of months ago but I actually
uploaded<00:03:55.110> that<00:03:55.200> after<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.709> first<00:03:56.010> patch<00:03:56.250> so

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
uploaded that after the first patch so

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.490 
uploaded that after the first patch so
that<00:03:56.970> was<00:03:57.060> before<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.660> second<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.320> third

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
that was before the second and third

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.470 
that was before the second and third
batch<00:03:58.980> anyway<00:03:59.730> another<00:03:59.940> thing<00:04:00.209> you<00:04:00.450> should

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
batch anyway another thing you should

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.729 
batch anyway another thing you should
know<00:04:00.900> is<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:01.079> when<00:04:01.440> you're<00:04:01.590> actually

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
know is that when you're actually

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.100 
know is that when you're actually
rushing<00:04:02.160> around<00:04:02.370> with<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.820> MSMC<00:04:03.180> or<00:04:03.750> even<00:04:03.959> any

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
rushing around with the MSMC or even any

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.660 
rushing around with the MSMC or even any
other<00:04:04.380> SMG<00:04:04.799> for<00:04:04.980> that<00:04:05.070> matter<00:04:05.250> that<00:04:05.310> it<00:04:05.549> is

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
other SMG for that matter that it is

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.699 
other SMG for that matter that it is
probably<00:04:06.120> better<00:04:06.420> to<00:04:06.570> stick<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.200> outsides

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
probably better to stick to the outsides

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.710 
probably better to stick to the outsides
of<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:07.920> map<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:08.430> did<00:04:08.940> that<00:04:09.150> throughout<00:04:09.510> the

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
of the map I did that throughout the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.360 
of the map I did that throughout the
entire<00:04:10.049> game<00:04:10.290> play<00:04:10.500> I'm<00:04:10.680> a<00:04:10.709> type<00:04:10.980> of<00:04:11.010> play<00:04:11.340> that

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
entire game play I'm a type of play that

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.520 
entire game play I'm a type of play that
really<00:04:11.880> doesn't<00:04:12.209> run<00:04:12.570> into<00:04:12.989> those<00:04:13.170> close

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
really doesn't run into those close

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.470 
really doesn't run into those close
range<00:04:13.829> engagements<00:04:14.060> mainly<00:04:15.060> because<00:04:15.209> I

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
range engagements mainly because I

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.690 
range engagements mainly because I
usually<00:04:15.900> tend<00:04:16.200> to<00:04:16.320> lose<00:04:16.560> one<00:04:16.829> feet<00:04:17.040> to<00:04:17.220> verify

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
usually tend to lose one feet to verify

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.539 
usually tend to lose one feet to verify
its<00:04:17.880> 133<00:04:18.630> gunfights<00:04:19.109> so<00:04:19.680> that<00:04:19.829> is<00:04:19.950> why<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.100> stick

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
its 133 gunfights so that is why I stick

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.550 
its 133 gunfights so that is why I stick
to<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.820> outsides<00:04:21.269> of<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.510> map<00:04:21.810> now<00:04:22.289> if<00:04:22.410> you're

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
to the outsides of the map now if you're

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.960 
to the outsides of the map now if you're
going<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:22.890> be<00:04:23.039> using<00:04:23.220> an<00:04:23.520> assault<00:04:23.910> rifle

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
going to be using an assault rifle

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.670 
going to be using an assault rifle
because<00:04:24.360> that<00:04:24.630> actually<00:04:24.750> also<00:04:25.080> works<00:04:25.470> pretty

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
because that actually also works pretty

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.660 
because that actually also works pretty
well<00:04:25.770> on<00:04:25.950> this<00:04:26.039> map

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
well on this map

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.280 
well on this map
then<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:26.850> would<00:04:27.030> definitely<00:04:27.240> recommend<00:04:27.540> you<00:04:28.140> to

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
then I would definitely recommend you to

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.200 
then I would definitely recommend you to
stick<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.680> outsides<00:04:29.160> of<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.430> map<00:04:29.640> anyway

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
stick to the outsides of the map anyway

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.490 
stick to the outsides of the map anyway
