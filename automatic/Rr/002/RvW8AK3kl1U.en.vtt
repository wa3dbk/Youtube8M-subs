00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
highly recommend sketch three it's a lot

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.859 
highly recommend sketch three it's a lot
cheaper<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.430> it's<00:01:32.479> specifically<00:01:33.479> made<00:01:33.840> for

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
cheaper and it's specifically made for

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.260 
cheaper and it's specifically made for
this<00:01:34.170> purpose<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> first<00:01:36.030> thing<00:01:36.090> we're

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
this purpose so the first thing we're

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.490 
this purpose so the first thing we're
going<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> do<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.689> we're<00:01:36.780> going<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.960> hit<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.229> on

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
going to do is we're going to hit a on

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.380 
going to do is we're going to hit a on
our<00:01:37.680> keyboard<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.299> bring

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
our keyboard and this is going to bring

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.880 
our keyboard and this is going to bring
up<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> right<00:01:39.869> hand<00:01:40.079> side<00:01:40.229> different

up on the right hand side different

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.010 
up on the right hand side different
screens<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.909> we<00:01:42.030> can<00:01:42.210> kind<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.479> design<00:01:42.780> for

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
screens that we can kind of design for

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.199 
center just yet although we can just
kind<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.690> put<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:36.989> in<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.410> center<00:03:37.680> right<00:03:37.830> there

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
kind of put it in the center right there

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.460 
kind of put it in the center right there
we're<00:03:39.209> going<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.390> turn<00:03:39.570> off<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:40.110> borders

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
we're going to turn off the borders

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.960 
we're going to turn off the borders
again<00:03:42.560> actually<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.920> doesn't<00:03:44.100> yeah<00:03:44.519> we<00:03:44.760> can<00:03:44.880> do

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
again actually it doesn't yeah we can do

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.940 
again actually it doesn't yeah we can do
that<00:03:45.000> doesn't<00:03:45.269> really<00:03:45.390> matter<00:03:45.540> for<00:03:46.350> right<00:03:46.920> now

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
that doesn't really matter for right now

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.800 
that doesn't really matter for right now
but<00:03:47.760> now<00:03:47.850> that<00:03:48.000> we<00:03:48.060> have<00:03:48.090> that<00:03:48.209> we're<00:03:48.660> going<00:03:48.750> to

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
but now that we have that we're going to

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.870 
but now that we have that we're going to
come<00:03:48.959> over<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.350> triangle<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:49.980> we're

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
come over to the triangle and we're

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.729 
come over to the triangle and we're
going<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.090> set<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.300> triangle<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:52.140> equilateral

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
going to set the triangle to equilateral

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.250 
going to set the triangle to equilateral
and<00:03:53.390> that's<00:03:54.390> very<00:03:54.600> very<00:03:54.750> important<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.230> we

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
and that's very very important that we

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.330 
and that's very very important that we
do<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.530> it's<00:03:55.620> going<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.800> be<00:03:55.890> easier<00:03:56.070> to

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
do that it's going to be easier to

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.310 
do that it's going to be easier to
combined<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.180> with<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.450> circle<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.019> we're

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
combined it with the circle and we're

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.100 
combined it with the circle and we're
also<00:03:58.470> going<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.769> make<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.640> high<00:04:00.630> or<00:04:00.930> the

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
also going to make the high or the

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.560 
also going to make the high or the
heightened<00:04:01.650> with<00:04:01.830> 150<00:04:02.430> x<00:04:02.550> 150<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.300> now<00:04:03.420> we're

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
heightened with 150 x 150 and now we're

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.229 
heightened with 150 x 150 and now we're
going<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.720> drag<00:04:03.959> this<00:04:04.170> in<00:04:04.380> as<00:04:05.190> you'll<00:04:05.400> see<00:04:05.640> one

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
going to drag this in as you'll see one

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.520 
going to drag this in as you'll see one
thing<00:04:06.269> that<00:04:06.510> Photoshop<00:04:06.900> doesn't<00:04:07.200> have<00:04:07.350> that

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
thing that Photoshop doesn't have that

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.860 
thing that Photoshop doesn't have that
this<00:04:07.860> app<00:04:08.070> sketch<00:04:08.519> does<00:04:08.820> are<00:04:09.120> these<00:04:09.570> guides

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
this app sketch does are these guides

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.330 
this app sketch does are these guides
that<00:04:10.140> make<00:04:10.320> it<00:04:10.440> really<00:04:10.470> really<00:04:10.739> easy<00:04:10.980> to

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
that make it really really easy to

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.120 
that make it really really easy to
combine<00:04:11.519> things<00:04:12.000> move<00:04:12.690> things<00:04:12.900> around<00:04:13.130> and

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
combine things move things around and

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.640 
combine things move things around and
position<00:04:14.580> them<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.820> way<00:04:14.910> that<00:04:14.940> we<00:04:15.120> want<00:04:15.299> to<00:04:15.650> so

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
position them the way that we want to so

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.930 
position them the way that we want to so
now<00:04:16.919> we've<00:04:17.100> done<00:04:17.280> that<00:04:17.400> we're<00:04:17.549> going<00:04:17.669> to<00:04:17.729> go<00:04:17.820> up

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
now we've done that we're going to go up

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.870 
now we've done that we're going to go up
to<00:04:18.090> edit<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:18.830> we're<00:04:19.830> going<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:19.979> make<00:04:20.190> these

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
to edit and we're going to make these

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.779 
to edit and we're going to make these
corners<00:04:21.860> 34<00:04:22.860> pixels<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.460> that's<00:04:23.610> going<00:04:23.729> to

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
corners 34 pixels and that's going to

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.390 
corners 34 pixels and that's going to
make<00:04:23.940> this<00:04:24.060> look<00:04:24.270> less<00:04:24.510> like<00:04:24.539> a<00:04:24.720> triangle<00:04:25.020> and

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
make this look less like a triangle and

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.620 
make this look less like a triangle and
more<00:04:26.400> like<00:04:26.550> a<00:04:26.580> water<00:04:26.880> droplet

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
more like a water droplet

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.360 
more like a water droplet
now<00:04:28.050> we're<00:04:28.170> going<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.320> hit<00:04:28.500> finish<00:04:28.830> edit

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
now we're going to hit finish edit

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.250 
now we're going to hit finish edit
editing<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.300> we're<00:04:30.720> going<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:30.900> hit<00:04:30.960> shift

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
editing and we're going to hit shift

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.260 
editing and we're going to hit shift
click<00:04:32.130> on<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.340> circle<00:04:32.520> so<00:04:32.790> now<00:04:32.910> we<00:04:32.970> have<00:04:33.060> them

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
click on the circle so now we have them

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.330 
click on the circle so now we have them
both<00:04:33.390> selected<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:34.110> hit<00:04:34.320> Union<00:04:34.830> which<00:04:35.190> is

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
both selected and hit Union which is

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.330 
both selected and hit Union which is
going<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:35.550> make<00:04:35.700> someone<00:04:36.800> one<00:04:37.800> thing<00:04:38.130> and

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
going to make someone one thing and

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.360 
going to make someone one thing and
we're<00:04:38.430> going<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:38.580> Center<00:04:38.970> those<00:04:40.070> inside<00:04:41.070> of

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
we're going to Center those inside of

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.850 
we're going to Center those inside of
the<00:04:41.910> image<00:04:42.180> now<00:04:42.600> we're<00:04:43.230> going<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.410> turn<00:04:43.800> off

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
the image now we're going to turn off

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.680 
the image now we're going to turn off
the<00:04:44.130> borders<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.610> we're<00:04:45.390> going<00:04:45.510> to<00:04:45.570> go<00:04:45.660> to

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
the borders and we're going to go to

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.860 
the borders and we're going to go to
fill<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:47.580> radial<00:04:48.060> gradient<00:04:48.480> which<00:04:48.630> is<00:04:48.750> just

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
fill the radial gradient which is just

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.930 
fill the radial gradient which is just
circular<00:04:49.500> one<00:04:49.680> we're<00:04:50.310> going<00:04:50.400> to<00:04:50.460> drag<00:04:50.730> this

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
circular one we're going to drag this

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.940 
circular one we're going to drag this
circle<00:04:51.330> so<00:04:51.540> it's<00:04:51.720> kind<00:04:52.050> of<00:04:52.110> in<00:04:52.350> where<00:04:52.770> the

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
circle so it's kind of in where the

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.660 
circle so it's kind of in where the
actual<00:04:53.220> circle<00:04:53.700> was<00:04:55.100> beaten<00:04:56.100> up<00:04:56.280> a<00:04:56.370> little<00:04:56.550> bit

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
actual circle was beaten up a little bit

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.000 
actual circle was beaten up a little bit
and<00:04:56.820> we're<00:04:57.810> going<00:04:57.930> to<00:04:57.960> make<00:04:58.020> this<00:04:58.170> side<00:04:58.740> this

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
and we're going to make this side this

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.430 
and we're going to make this side this
white<00:04:59.310> side<00:04:59.550> is<00:04:59.700> going<00:04:59.850> to<00:04:59.910> be<00:05:00.000> at<00:05:00.090> the<00:05:00.180> blue

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
white side is going to be at the blue

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.420 
white side is going to be at the blue
except<00:05:01.440> that<00:05:01.530> we're<00:05:01.950> going<00:05:02.040> to<00:05:02.100> start<00:05:02.310> with

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
except that we're going to start with

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.400 
except that we're going to start with
our<00:05:02.580> blue<00:05:02.880> but<00:05:03.360> we're<00:05:03.510> going<00:05:03.600> to<00:05:03.660> darken<00:05:04.050> it<00:05:04.290> a

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
our blue but we're going to darken it a

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.040 
our blue but we're going to darken it a
little<00:05:04.890> bit<00:05:05.160> too<00:05:05.370> like<00:05:05.550> there<00:05:05.970> and<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.870> heck's

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
little bit too like there and the heck's

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.400 
little bit too like there and the heck's
that<00:05:07.200> we<00:05:07.320> have<00:05:07.470> there<00:05:07.740> is<00:05:07.920> 0<00:05:08.310> 0<00:05:08.640> a<00:05:08.880> BF<00:05:09.390> 1<00:05:09.810> i'll

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
that we have there is 0 0 a BF 1 i'll

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.400 
that we have there is 0 0 a BF 1 i'll
also<00:05:10.770> put<00:05:11.430> that<00:05:11.640> in<00:05:11.760> the<00:05:11.820> description<00:05:12.410> now

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
we're going to make this other side

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.800 
we're going to make this other side
which<00:05:14.610> was<00:05:14.850> the<00:05:14.970> black<00:05:15.210> side<00:05:15.420> we're<00:05:15.630> going<00:05:15.750> to

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
which was the black side we're going to

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.540 
which was the black side we're going to
make<00:05:15.900> it<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:16.290> gradient<00:05:16.920> that<00:05:17.010> we<00:05:17.130> use<00:05:17.310> before

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
make it the gradient that we use before

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.060 
make it the gradient that we use before
the<00:05:18.180> light<00:05:18.420> gradient<00:05:18.900> we<00:05:19.350> can<00:05:19.500> even<00:05:19.560> darken

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
the light gradient we can even darken

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.360 
the light gradient we can even darken
this<00:05:20.220> a<00:05:20.490> little<00:05:20.970> bit<00:05:21.240> hmm<00:05:22.170> that's<00:05:23.010> too<00:05:23.190> much

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
is we're going to drag the circle in a

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.150 
is we're going to drag the circle in a
little<00:05:29.760> bit<00:05:29.880> so<00:05:30.060> that<00:05:30.090> we<00:05:30.240> can<00:05:30.390> see<00:05:31.010> that<00:05:32.010> it's

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
little bit so that we can see that it's

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.150 
little bit so that we can see that it's
