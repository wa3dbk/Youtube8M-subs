00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:19.160
 hello how about youtube friends i am your 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.619
 friend angel montiel and today 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.010
 let's continue with our reviews 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.990
 in Spanish so they stop seeing all 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.640
 those videos of Japanese children and cough and 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.730
 completely in English in which 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.450
 we keep nothing and that's why today 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:40.579
 let's remaster the first review 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:45.260
 of the game show 5 x 5 x 5 good 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:47.390
 Here we have my genius 5 x 5 and good 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.140
 let's start by knowing your 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.120
 internal composition 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.600
 these are the pieces that make up the 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.870
 study 5 x 5 an edge that like 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.670
 we can see it is much smaller both 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.000
 on the edge as the pieces of the 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.449
 centers in the 5 x 5 5 compared to the 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.449
 viking 5 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.600
 We can see these designs very well 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.510
 facts because they honestly help 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.390
 enough to reduce ones own in the 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.550
 Cube 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.350
 and good that the plastics are not of the 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.190
 better quality or they are not the same 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.619
 quality than those of a big club 5 for 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.119
 example that plastics are very very 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.970
 hard 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.080
 sex also has very good 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.950
 materials 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.690
 and his performance for speed is very good 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.410
 this has not suffered any event 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.750
 like for example 7 by 7 change show that 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.060
 the core is split into 2 to 5 by 5 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.150
 I have never heard that something has happened to him 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.150
 A) Yes 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.770
 good in his performance for spears is a 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.860
 juice that you want very well is very soft and 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.770
 even from the factory is a bucket with 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.330
 a very good performance the cube is 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.840
 adjustable and that makes things much easier 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:13.230
 in terms of performance it has a cut 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.190
 corner is very good in the layers 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.470
 external responds very very well 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.140
 when cutting corners and in layers 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.770
 internal is also very respectable the 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.160
 cut corners that has 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.160
 optimum 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.700
 very good the truth is also the size 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.670
 ideal 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.300
 I get used more with the viking 5 x 5 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:41.110
 that with the sensor 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.680
 but you also adapt quickly to the 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.890
 size that has 5 by 5 has a 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.470
 slight disadvantage I see him without 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.120
 show that gets stuck a little in the suns 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.700
 what do you give him 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.920
 it tends to get stuck in some of its 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:02.700
 layers and it's very annoying 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.360
 it gets stuck and that encourages a little 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.670
 performance of your times but you will 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.030
 can make the famous florian mod that is 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.830
 the modification that was made to the cube 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.000
 that has the world record or that 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.239
 had the world record in that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.480
 then with Felix and leave the bucket 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.850
 get stuck and it looks great for the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.470
 reduction of 3 3 that's one of 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.620
 the great advantages that evasion show 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.630
 for the size it has when you get to 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.290
 the part of the reduction the truth is 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.120
 that the outer layers are the best 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.520
 in performance when you get to the stage 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.400
 to perform the 3 x 3 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.500
 compared to 25 that its size is 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.870
 very big 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.150
 and sometimes it gets a little stolen or 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.460
 when you're in reducing three 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.060
 three all the layers work of 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.670
 wonder actually freeze live the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.120
 reduction the assembly of the centers is 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.430
 very very good and also a great 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.200
 disadvantage but this I want to be achieved 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.080
 in all the cubes in soul not only 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.650
 in 5 by 5 is the quality of their 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.600
 stickers this cube is already worn 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.660
 of a sticker and I just took it out of your 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:21.430
 box is completely new and already 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:23.110
 I bring a sticker cut and they last very 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.350
 little time the stickers of the brand 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.860
 bed bug and this and they are very low area 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.870
 quality if they last a while but do not last 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.430
 what should last must be 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:38.070
 change them very fast for a few 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.070
 fulbright well that 's my taste 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.180
 are the only disadvantages that I see in 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:46.750
 reality is an excellent cube nakajima 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.560
 he uses it and with that he broke the record of 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.670
 world 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.490
 Felix uses it with that old age has 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.680
 world record and of course my friend 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:01.540
 Jorge Sanchez also uses it and has the 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:04.750
 nr from mexico in 5 by 5 so good 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.670
 here is our review completely 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.740
