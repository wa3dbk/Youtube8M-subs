 raisins 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.150

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.860

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.110
 He passed 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.580
 we start mixing the flours in a 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.650
 We throw 300 grams of flour from 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.410
 rye we add 100 grams of flour 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.270
 strength wheat and another 100 grams of 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.370
 integral flour for integral life 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.489
 We are going to use a sieve to sift 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.489
 the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.699
 This malware part is reserved for 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.129
 throw it over before baking 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:53.239
 we add the baking powder that 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.239
 we came on the we celebrated 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.920
 and mix it with a spoon 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.640
 we throw a grain of salt and we begin 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.470
 with the liquid I will use milk 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.450
 semi-skimmed instead of water 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.180
 give a touch of extra flavor if you are 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.159
 tempered will act before yeast in 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.240
 total we will use about 300 milliliters 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.220
 milk 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.220
 with the help of a spoon we are mixing 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.549
 when you already need dry flour 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.710
 we knead by hand for it we analyze the 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.149
 work surface and we throw to the 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.720
 flour in the hands so that we do not get 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.720
 paste the dough 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.430
 because they go to massa and we are mixing the 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.430
 little bit 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.730
 what we will do is make a ball and go 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.730
 stretching the and shrinking 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.020
 we stretch and collect stretch and 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.240
 we collect 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.390
 is now based the same for about 45 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.390
 minutes 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.500
 now we stretch the dough a little and 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.500
 we add raisins 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.480
 seven steps and kneading and mixing 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.750
 we are pressing and picking 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.750
 we press the dough and we collect again 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.810
 also masters until they are delivered 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.810
 grapes and we make a grandmother 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.130
 in the same volume that we had kneaded 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.900
 we throw a little more flour we put 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.420
 our ball and cover with film 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.370
 so that we do not get stuck dough dunked 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.350
 the inner part with oil already 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.990
 then let it rest in a 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.560
 temperate let stand a 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.560
 four or five hours 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.730
 once it has rested remove the film 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.950
 As you can see, nothing has been stuck and 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.270
 is perfect now the next step is 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.980
 place it in the mold in this case 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.720
 We use a silicone model that 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.670
 we put inside another metal so that 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.920
 do not open we stretch the dough and the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.970
 We place on the mold press the 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.970
 edges so there are no gaps 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.430
 and then we would see the wholemeal flour 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.670
 that we had left in the colander 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.280
 and we have you ready to bake 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.860
 we bake at 200 degrees for about 40 a 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.860
 45 minutes good and here we have it 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.510
 now the next step is to remove it from 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.350
 mold and place it on a grid for 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.300
 that cool 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.280
 we can leave it like this or take advantage now 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.110
 that is hot and throw him over 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.880
 a honey bath this is going to give you a 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.780
 special touch and now let's cut it 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.780
 so you can see how it is 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.480
 you see how juicy the raisins are 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.480
 and that is tender and fluffy 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.680
 It is a special rich and very tasty bread 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.190
 and on this Christmas day we are going to 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.470
 accompany in the seafood paella 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.800
