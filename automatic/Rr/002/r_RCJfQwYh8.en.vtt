00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.630 
believe that's in different languages as
well<00:01:10.229> that's<00:01:10.560> why<00:01:10.680> you've<00:01:10.799> got<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.220> many<00:01:11.490> of

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
well that's why you've got so many of

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.850 
well that's why you've got so many of
them<00:01:11.850> inside<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.810> little<00:01:13.080> packet<00:01:13.470> there<00:01:13.650> so

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
them inside that little packet there so

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.620 
them inside that little packet there so
you<00:01:13.950> also<00:01:14.100> get<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> USB<00:01:14.460> cable<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.600> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
you also get a USB cable so this is a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.630 
you also get a USB cable so this is a
micro<00:01:15.960> USB<00:01:15.990> cable<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.920> recharging<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
micro USB cable for recharging the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.060 
micro USB cable for recharging the
device<00:01:18.450> itself<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.229> mentioned<00:01:19.439> LEDs<00:01:19.950> will

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
device itself like I mentioned LEDs will

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.399 
device itself like I mentioned LEDs will
last<00:01:20.220> your<00:01:20.310> six<00:01:20.520> hours<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:20.970> that's<00:01:21.750> as<00:01:22.170> it

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
really does nothing else inside a

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.460 
really does nothing else inside a
packaging<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.360> let's<00:01:24.600> take<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> closer<00:01:25.020> look<00:01:25.140> at

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
packaging so let's take a closer look at

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.469 
packaging so let's take a closer look at
the<00:01:25.799> speaker<00:01:26.280> itself<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.880> see<00:01:27.119> why<00:01:27.330> it's

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the speaker itself and see why it's

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.210 
the speaker itself and see why it's
light<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.229> ultra<00:01:28.560> portable<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.130> as

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
light so this is ultra portable so as

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.800 
light so this is ultra portable so as
you<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.490> see<00:01:29.640> there<00:01:29.820> from<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> size<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.630> the

port is you charge in port and a quick
on<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.590> off<00:02:31.680> switch<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:32.370> switch<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.760> enough

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
on and off switch to switch it on enough

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.370

so if you switch it on enough there you

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.880 
so if you switch it on enough there you
can<00:02:36.540> then<00:02:36.660> press<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.200> power<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.530> on<00:02:37.620> and
