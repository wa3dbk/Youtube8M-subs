here on the bottom everything here from
the<00:00:48.030> trucks<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.350> actual<00:00:49.620> board<00:00:50.070> is

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
the trucks to the actual board is

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.840 
the trucks to the actual board is
basically<00:00:51.870> standard<00:00:52.379> setup<00:00:53.219> except<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.789> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
so basically these wheels are made of

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.520 
so basically these wheels are made of
you've<00:01:11.640> seen<00:01:11.909> those<00:01:12.090> super<00:01:12.869> bouncy<00:01:12.900> balls

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
you've seen those super bouncy balls

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.499 
you've seen those super bouncy balls
while<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:13.950> made<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.970> basically

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
while it's made of that so basically

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.219 
while it's made of that so basically
these<00:01:15.990> wheels<00:01:16.259> do<00:01:16.439> not<00:01:16.619> slide<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.850> nothing<00:01:18.420> no

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
these wheels do not slide for nothing no

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.510 
these wheels do not slide for nothing no
matter<00:01:19.409> how<00:01:19.530> fast<00:01:19.799> you're<00:01:20.009> going<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.430> will

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
matter how fast you're going you will

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
not slide and they are bouncy so

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.240 
not slide and they are bouncy so
basically<00:01:26.840> right<00:01:27.840> here<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.350> mechanism<00:01:28.860> here

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
basically right here this mechanism here

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.590 
basically right here this mechanism here
is<00:01:29.369> what<00:01:29.880> basically<00:01:30.360> charges<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.200> LED<00:01:32.509> it's<00:01:33.509> a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
is what basically charges the LED it's a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.010 
is what basically charges the LED it's a
battery<00:01:33.869> inside<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:35.060> this<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.420> button<00:01:36.810> here

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
battery inside and this here button here

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.690 
battery inside and this here button here

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
they're very bright okay so there's no

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.230 
they're very bright okay so there's no
doubt<00:01:49.619> about<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.890> as<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.759> can<00:01:50.880> see<00:01:51.030> they<00:01:51.119> go

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
doubt about that as you can see they go

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.840 
doubt about that as you can see they go
around<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.659> whole<00:01:51.869> outside<00:01:52.770> outskirts<00:01:53.759> of

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
around the whole outside outskirts of

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.580 
around the whole outside outskirts of
the<00:01:53.909> bottom<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.420> board<00:01:54.659> all<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.409> way

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the bottom of the board all the way

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.499 
the bottom of the board all the way
around<00:01:55.710> from<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.130> tail<00:01:56.399> all<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.240> way<00:01:57.329> up<00:01:57.479> to

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
around from the tail all the way up to

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.850 
around from the tail all the way up to
the<00:01:57.630> top<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.500> it's<00:01:58.649> basically

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the top so it's but it's basically

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.970 
the top so it's but it's basically
double<00:01:59.490> tailed<00:01:59.729> also<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.630> can<00:02:00.780> stop<00:02:01.110> okay

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
double tailed also you can stop okay

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.350 
double tailed also you can stop okay
so<00:02:04.980> basically<00:02:06.170> you<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.560> lights<00:02:08.360> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
so basically you have the lights the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.080 
so basically you have the lights the
trucks<00:02:09.690> are<00:02:10.250> basic<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.430> dependent<00:02:11.940> like

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
trucks are basic and dependent like

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.010 
trucks are basic and dependent like
independent<00:02:13.080> trucks<00:02:13.970> it's<00:02:14.970> no<00:02:15.360> name<00:02:15.630> on<00:02:15.660> it

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
independent trucks it's no name on it

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.680 
independent trucks it's no name on it
exactly<00:02:16.590> but<00:02:16.980> they<00:02:17.250> are<00:02:17.690> standard

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
exactly but they are standard

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.740 
exactly but they are standard
independent<00:02:19.260> trucks<00:02:19.530> as<00:02:19.770> well<00:02:20.400> as<00:02:20.550> the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
independent trucks as well as the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.610 
independent trucks as well as the
everything<00:02:21.750> else<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.920> shock<00:02:23.160> pads<00:02:23.460> are

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
everything else the shock pads are

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.150 
everything else the shock pads are
basically<00:02:25.620> kind<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.250> thin<00:02:26.490> but<00:02:26.700> they're<00:02:27.540> good

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
basically kind of thin but they're good

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.560 
basically kind of thin but they're good
it's<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.190> very<00:02:29.370> sturdy<00:02:29.610> board<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.150> looks<00:02:30.330> about

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
it's a very sturdy board it looks about

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.490 
it's a very sturdy board it looks about
I<00:02:30.900> think<00:02:31.140> it's<00:02:31.350> about<00:02:31.470> 6<00:02:32.280> ply<00:02:32.520> probably<00:02:33.500> very

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
I think it's about 6 ply probably very

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.610 
I think it's about 6 ply probably very
strong<00:02:34.860> board<00:02:35.190> has<00:02:35.459> weight<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.060> and

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
strong board has weight to it and

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.490 
strong board has weight to it and
basically<00:02:37.620> as<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.540> see<00:02:39.750> even<00:02:40.110> on<00:02:40.410> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
basically as you can see even on the
