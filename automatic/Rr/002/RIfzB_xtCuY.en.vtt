00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.549

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.109
 to meet the staff of the eyes of 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.330
 hangover 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.310
 They took me to the curitiba bookstores and 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.380
 in comparison to the freedom I have 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.660
 here in my city I made the party 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.970

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.120
 improve my little ones 50 in almost 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.710
 nothing and there's everything and I bought it 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.960
 some books there I'll show them to 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.000
 You, but first of all I want to 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.040
 explain something as you know the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.190
 channel calls literary worse 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.200
 only for personal reasons and for 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.649
 college sometimes is good have to make the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.840
 beard 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.430
 even more now that I 'm going down to 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.980
 present in the same year as 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.160
 then I would need the case 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.460
 shaving and in such cases not to 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.829
 lose the essence of the channel I'm going to paint 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.110
 a mustache on my face to live up to 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.570
 name is not one of the books I bought there 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.010
 including indication of the Niger River is 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.840
 grade 26 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.670
 I confess that I'm a little afraid to 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.530
 genre of terror but I'm 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.880
 venturing out is like I said one of the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.560
 past videos 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.500
 Antonio Ventura I'm reading some books 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.810
 different ones that I would not read 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.119
 so you will have 26 was one of them 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.790

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.159
 You can stop seeing the kids as you said 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.409
 can not fail to see also 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.810
 victor boys statement that i 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.689
 I bought plays number 1 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.179
 I love Estonian and I think this 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.009
 book will be one of those who will most like 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.520
 even my friend who was staying in 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.990
 Take a look at the book and stay 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.090
 to buy brawn also because she 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.530
 loves a story so new and in the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.709
 super yummy watch 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.079
 already our game technology dystopia 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:00.000
 these matters so I think that player 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.039
 it will enter quite 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.439
 Come on, another book that I finished. 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.409
 shopping for Ana indication 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.269
 moreover it also bought silo is I 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.079
 I ended up buying the valid law in the synopsis 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:15.180
 I confess that looking at the cover was better 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:17.489
 will it be worth it but there was 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.970
 synopsis all this story 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.860
 chill and frightened I do not think so 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.410
 this story will hold me you sincere 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.569
 themselves, not by the cover nor by the 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.220
 No problem, it 's but I think I 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.299
 know that before all eight 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.489
 unofficial 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.440
 Curious to know what's going to happen. 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.420
 also your real one is one of the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.540
 the most precious books to read 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.010
 next I 'll tell you the courage to read 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.889
 this book because it is not anyone who 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.049
 Face this one, I did not buy this one. 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.060
 here I have gained from this will leave 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.370
 even if you have not left 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.530
 video has already been released from the UN staff 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.569
 People's hangover 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.959
 We showed gifts that we looked at 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.760
 for others it is near royale this book 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.530
 I was very keen on law 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.389
 after the vanessa of the moral channel of the 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.389
 history showed us 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:08.710
 The story got stuck holding me too tight. 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:11.710
 all this part of survival 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.660
 of voracious game styles fight for 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.870
 survival and by life by death 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.460
 So you arrested me, I'm very tired. 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.590
 curiosity to see 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.480
 Sometimes I get caught looking at 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.200
 each end of chapter into one thing that 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.470
 if megan leaves curious is that each end 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.450
 of chapter has while are students 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.370
 and such does tribes 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.790
 For those who do not have this story, it's a boy. 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.540
 voracious games even the government and obliges 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.300
 survival students kill some 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.670
 to others and it's pretty annoying behind 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.160
 each chapter has conducted the site are 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.590
 Live and give me that medley of my God 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.960
 To die that does not go there that goes 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.250
 happen against your problems would be 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.950
 As I said, it's not anyone who 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.650
 faces is because it looks the size of 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.830
 book but not with me I do not think I'm going 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.440
 reads I'm super mega personal problem 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.210
 You know I'm super slow to the law but 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.130
 This time here I think I'm going to 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.980
 quickly 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.920
 Let's go there and the last book that I 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.750
 I bought it, it 's not for me, it 's for real that's it. 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.920
 also the moral channel of history is a 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.290
 I bought the gift 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.020
 I said some videos ago that she 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.120
 never read anything extraordinary and 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.430
 complexity of the present so I can send 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.750
 I'm going to do this lawlessness favor. 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.060
 extraordinary that is a story 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.070
 wonderful that she has not yet read me 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.050
 I think she'll like it so they 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.150
 french by wanda soon you were 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.810
 hoping to record the video is a power 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.430
 walk and tell her to dispatch because 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.140
 it will take a little while to get even 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.240
 bauru josé manuel osório that takes a 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.610
 Time I 'm going to focus today I bought
