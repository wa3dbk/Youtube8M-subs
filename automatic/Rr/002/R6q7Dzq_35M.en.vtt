analog sticks and as you see when you

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.600 
analog sticks and as you see when you

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
analog stick and that's where it gives

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.710 
analog stick and that's where it gives
you<00:01:25.259> an<00:01:25.439> improved<00:01:26.100> range<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.700> motion<00:01:27.479> whether

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
you an improved range of motion whether

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.350 
you an improved range of motion whether
or<00:01:27.960> not<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.290> helps<00:01:28.649> your<00:01:29.189> game<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.790> entirely

or not it helps your game is entirely

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
or not it helps your game is entirely
subjective<00:01:30.719> I<00:01:31.259> think<00:01:31.799> but<00:01:32.990> it<00:01:33.990> certainly

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
subjective I think but it certainly

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.139 
subjective I think but it certainly
increases<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.100> range<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.430> motion<00:01:35.790> like<00:01:35.969> they

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
increases the range of motion like they

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.630 
increases the range of motion like they
claim<00:01:36.450> also<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.930> has<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.130> rubberized<00:01:38.130> grip<00:01:38.520> II

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
there who immediately thinks does it

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.740 
there who immediately thinks does it
work<00:02:29.130> on<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.340> Dreamcast<00:02:30.000> controller<00:02:30.300> which

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
work on the Dreamcast controller which

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.080 
work on the Dreamcast controller which
is<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.620> hard<00:02:31.950> plastic<00:02:31.980> thumb<00:02:32.640> stick<00:02:32.880> and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
is this hard plastic thumb stick and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.900 
is this hard plastic thumb stick and
sadly<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:33.690> does<00:02:33.810> not<00:02:33.960> it's<00:02:34.920> just<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.370> little<00:02:35.790> bit

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
sadly it does not it's just a little bit

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.880 
sadly it does not it's just a little bit
too<00:02:36.060> large<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.480> fit<00:02:36.630> on<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:37.350> Dreamcast

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
too large to fit on the Dreamcast

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.700 
too large to fit on the Dreamcast
controller<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:38.790> sorry<00:02:39.270> guys<00:02:39.510> control<00:02:40.410> freak

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
controller so sorry guys control freak

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.170 
controller so sorry guys control freak
we'll<00:02:40.860> have<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.220> go<00:02:41.310> back<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.970> drawing

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
we'll have to go back to the drawing

to<00:04:34.970> mind<00:04:35.180> that<00:04:35.389> could<00:04:35.750> definitely<00:04:36.020> use<00:04:36.680> some

to mind that could definitely use some
some<00:04:37.729> improvement<00:04:38.270> and<00:04:38.360> that's<00:04:38.449> the<00:04:38.750> Atari

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139

like it fits on that so it's not
