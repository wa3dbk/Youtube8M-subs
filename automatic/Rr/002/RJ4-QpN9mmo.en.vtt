 they have that I find in the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.239
 organic rays at the crossroads at the crossroads 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.469
 close to my house 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:01:01.050

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:03.120
 little we will add 2 or 3 pods 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.220
 garlic we pay in fact does not languish the 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.680
 penalty 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.690
 to place them the reminders by tonight 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.960

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.830
 I was back onions and 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.830
 mushrooms cursed the moonlight 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.050
 and I also add an apple of 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.630
 earth or two it depends on the size of 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.630
 candidates cut into small pieces 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.220
 I just add a glass of cream 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.280
 liquid and about 3 glasses of water for 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.240
 cover the lathe and cook for 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.240
 a little while 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.710
 you will tell me how much time and 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.340
 well I'll tell you pretty much a 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.860
 fifteen minutes noting that my vegetables 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.300
 is cooked and that they can 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.300
 knicks and thereafter 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.700
 as I do not have any truth at first so I 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.849
 I can really 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.010
 then you have to cover and cook 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.840
 about 10 to 15 minutes the time that the 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.819
 vegetables are mounted I repeat myself a 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.629
 once well cooked so go all to 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.760
 mixer and this will be ready to serve voice over 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.560
