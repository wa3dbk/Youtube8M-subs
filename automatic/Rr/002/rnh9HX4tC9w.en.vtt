00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.730
 your water bottle is lukewarm 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.780
 after being exposed to the sun and 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.959
 you dream of fresh water for you 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.959
 drink 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.310
 no problem here is a simple trick and 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.230
 convenient to refresh a bottle 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.199
 of water and the guard and fresh a maximum 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.699
 of time for this trick you will not have 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.830
 need only a dish towel that you 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.279
 have humidified beforehand and 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.829
 Sun 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.230
 more ambient air will be dry more this 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.200
 trick will be effective and if there is wind 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.220
 it's even better just by 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.570
 improve your bottle in the 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.570
 wet towel like this 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.780
 or even the name of the paper wipes all wet 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.589
 then leave it in full sun 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.649
 and yes in full sun the more he will do 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.780
 hot him the bottle will refresh if 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.360
 you have a small fan or a 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.500
 invented place do not hesitate to place 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.909
 your mayotte bottle and in the 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.590
 airflow for even more 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.789
 effectiveness 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.130
 how does it work it's the 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:18.409
 thermodynamics the science of heat 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.090
 who explain to us the rays of the 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.470
 sun and the ambient heat are going 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.080
 cause the evaporation of water 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.270
 contained in the rag in this a year 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.020
 the water will take away the heat of the rag 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.750
 cool it down and therefore cool down the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.429
 bottle swaddled inside the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.060
 wind speed up this phenomenon and the 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.060
 make it more effective 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.149
 so if you are in a hurry 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.590
 do not hesitate to run the 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.330
 bottle swaddled with damp cloth 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.860
 to create a draft that 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.860
 accelerate evaporation 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.960
 otherwise the only numbers have during 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.210
 minus one hour around the bottle 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.009
 of course this method works 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.140
 also with glass bottles 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.329
 or aluminum soda cans 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.460
 materials also accelerating the 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.810
 phenomenon 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.220
 attention this method allows to 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.079
 refresh the content of your 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.250
 bottle but you will not have the same 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:16.480
 fica quote that a freezer 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.480
 do not dream anyway 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.440
 moreover this method will work less 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.390
 well in hot and humid areas 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.310
 if the air is already heavily loaded 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.170
 moisture evaporation will be less 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.800
 effective and therefore cooling 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.800
 lesser
