00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.120
 (Arabic) Traslation by (Kitty) 

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.080
 one two Three 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.320
 Good evening, we are JJ 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.520
 Today... 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.190
 Just like yesterday, a lot of you came to see us 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.430
 Thank you so much for your first concert 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.060
 thank you 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.840
 It's cold outside, right? 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.340
 Cold cold, right? 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.410
 I hear "yes" more than "no" 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.520
 They say "no" while sitting like this 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.660
 But I think it's better than yesterday 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.390
 Above all this 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.400
 As Qalamn before 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.470
 The curtain covering the ceiling is not present 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.610
 We are really sorry for that 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.450
 Now the curtain is not there, and maybe the lighting is then 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.420
 Oh, oh ... 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.660
 This is not a good prank 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.390
 In that case, we can not see 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.530
 Why are you trying to make jokes these days? 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.240
 You did it, Jonso 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.380
 Well, we do not know how it will turn out 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.980
 So make sure what you do 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.190
 Today, we are truly happy to meet you all 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.660
 We hope to have other opportunities to meet you 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.070
 Can I change the subject? 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.400
 please enter 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.740
 But nothing special 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.970
 nothing special... 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.650
 What's wrong with that? 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.280
 Well, all you want 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.750
 I want to tell you today something special, young people 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.390
 About Twitter today 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.560
 Just a little 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.970
 Really, I want to talk about it a bit 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.100
 I have more followers among us 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.080
 Do you think it's dangerous? 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.120
 Anyway, I'm so proud of that 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.660
 Yesterday we talked about Twitter at the ceremony 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.260
 About who has the most followers 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.930
 Jonso? 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.870
 Yuchen? 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.170
 What? Do you snow? 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.370
 it's snowing 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.410
 Oh really 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.040
 It is the first snowfall I see this year 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.810
 I think I know why it started to snow 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.650
 Why did this happen? 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.650
 It happened because the hearts of our fans are as clean as snow 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.790
 Yuchen is trying hard in many ways now 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.300
 Yesterday, Jonso heard 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.040
 One of our fans says ... 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.540
 He was worried about the disappearance of the ceiling 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.110
 A fan said 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.780
 Even the sky wants to see the concert 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.150
 I was very impressed 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.320
 What we felt yesterday was like ... 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.700
 Well, this is our first attempt at Korea 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.700
 We are very proud of them 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.840
 And we wanted to tell you guys how wonderful it is 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.610
 But something is ruined 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.310
 We did not know what to do 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.310
 Because it happened on the same day as the concert 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.290
 But the fans encouraged us to make nice comments 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.290
 Really made us happy 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.190
 When we first came yesterday 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.530
 We were really frustrated 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.800
 But the comments and messages gave us a lot of energy 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.830
 So I told the members too 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.740
 I would like to tell you all thank you 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.070
 Thank you very much 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.380
 Another thing also ... 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.190
 I think I talked a lot but ... 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.220
 The following is an occasional unilateral 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.100
 I think that's why I talk most of the time 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.230
 So, now 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.070
 I hope you enjoy my solo show
