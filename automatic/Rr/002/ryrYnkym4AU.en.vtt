Flint<00:00:24.900> really<00:00:25.800> just<00:00:26.039> reviewing<00:00:26.430> design<00:00:27.150> and

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
Flint really just reviewing design and

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.419 
Flint really just reviewing design and
making<00:00:28.619> sure<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.070> we<00:00:29.160> can<00:00:29.310> actually

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
making sure that we can actually

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.880 
making sure that we can actually
construct<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.359> field<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:31.410> now<00:00:31.529> here<00:00:31.740> we

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
construct it in the field so now here we

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.950 
construct it in the field so now here we
are<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.219> field<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.759> we've<00:00:33.510> built<00:00:33.780> these

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
are in the field and we've built these

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.490 
are in the field and we've built these
these<00:00:34.350> modules<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.660> we're<00:00:36.660> able<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.020> set<00:00:37.320> them

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
these modules and we're able to set them

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.100 
these modules and we're able to set them
on<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> pile<00:00:38.309> cap<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.879> it's<00:00:39.540> like<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:40.079> a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
on the pile cap so it's like a like a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.170 
on the pile cap so it's like a like a
puzzle<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.649> got<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.010> piece<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.520> experience<00:00:42.000> in

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
puzzle I got the piece of experience in

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.389 
puzzle I got the piece of experience in
the<00:00:42.270> front<00:00:42.510> end<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:43.020> how<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.260> project<00:00:43.559> really

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
the front end of how the project really

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.970 
the front end of how the project really
comes<00:00:44.730> together<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.210> design<00:00:45.570> phase<00:00:45.860> into<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
comes together in design phase into the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.889 
comes together in design phase into the
execution<00:00:47.610> at<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.760> mod<00:00:48.000> shot<00:00:48.270> we're<00:00:48.450> building

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
execution at the mod shot we're building

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.310 
execution at the mod shot we're building
these<00:00:48.989> modules<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:51.000> then<00:00:51.329> finally<00:00:52.110> into

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
these modules and then finally into

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.410 
these modules and then finally into
setting<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.739> module<00:00:53.129> onto<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.550> pile<00:00:53.820> cap<00:00:54.090> like

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
setting a module onto a pile cap like

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.630 
setting a module onto a pile cap like
this<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.559> been<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> it's<00:00:56.100> been<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.430> good

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
this so it's been a it's been a good

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.340 
this so it's been a it's been a good

so<00:01:21.540> right<00:01:21.810> now<00:01:21.890> doing<00:01:22.890> what<00:01:23.040> I'm<00:01:23.130> doing<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.610> is

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
so right now doing what I'm doing is is

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.399 
so right now doing what I'm doing is is
excellent<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.630> want<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.869> learn<00:01:24.960> more<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
excellent but I want to learn more and

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.789 
excellent but I want to learn more and
get<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.920> see<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.460> bigger<00:01:26.640> picture

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
get to see the the bigger picture

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.149 
get to see the the bigger picture
there's<00:01:29.509> different<00:01:30.509> if<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.530> looked<00:01:31.979> at<00:01:32.100> a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
there's different if you looked at a

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.039

dollar<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.880> dollar<00:01:33.060> value<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.780> could<00:01:33.960> be

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
dollar and a dollar value this could be

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.630

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
million dollar jobs out there that I'd

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.160 
million dollar jobs out there that I'd
