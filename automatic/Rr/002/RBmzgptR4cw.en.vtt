where<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.800> think<00:00:56.129> minor<00:00:56.370> ones<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> right

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
where I think minor ones on the right

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.240 
where I think minor ones on the right
outside<00:00:57.449> ones<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.199> very<00:00:58.350> back<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.710> an<00:00:58.800> lmg

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
outside ones in the very back on an lmg

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.490 
outside ones in the very back on an lmg
and<00:00:59.430> then<00:00:59.850> one<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.300> up<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> front<00:01:00.989> right

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and then one is up in the front right

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.689 
and then one is up in the front right
behind<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.890> window<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.280> then<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.489> don't<00:01:02.609> know

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
behind the window and then I don't know

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.759 
behind the window and then I don't know
what<00:01:02.820> his<00:01:02.969> word<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.210> they<00:01:03.449> cycle<00:01:03.809> through<00:01:04.049> you

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
what his word but they cycle through you

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.810 
what his word but they cycle through you

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
know you just keep racking up the points

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.910 
know you just keep racking up the points
now<00:01:09.450> there<00:01:09.990> are<00:01:10.140> times<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.619> guess<00:01:10.770> you're

you<00:01:20.909> because<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.320> know<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.710> just

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
you because of you know that you just

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.200 
you because of you know that you just
they<00:01:23.070> can't<00:01:23.310> get<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> line<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.820> sight<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.090> you

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
from the bank from there so you run back

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.410 
from the bank from there so you run back
that<00:01:25.920> side<00:01:26.189> back<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:26.970> another<00:01:27.119> subway

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
that side back then another subway

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.510 
that side back then another subway
station<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.740> pick<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> ammo<00:01:29.280> and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
station and you pick up the ammo and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.910 
station and you pick up the ammo and
basically<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.320> know<00:01:31.439> wash<00:01:31.710> rinse

basically you just you know wash rinse

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.590 
basically you just you know wash rinse
repeat<00:01:32.100> over<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.640> over<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.970> over<00:01:33.030> again<00:01:33.270> and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
repeat over and over and over again and

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.200 
repeat over and over and over again and
we<00:01:33.900> actually<00:01:34.170> ended<00:01:34.380> up<00:01:34.500> getting<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.250> t-1000

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
we actually ended up getting a t-1000

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.330 
we actually ended up getting a t-1000
points<00:01:36.570> doing<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> half<00:01:37.380> hour<00:01:37.530> so

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
points doing this for a half hour so

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.160 
points doing this for a half hour so
it's<00:01:38.880> definitely<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.329> lot<00:01:39.450> quicker<00:01:39.689> than<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
it's definitely a lot quicker than you

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.480 
it's definitely a lot quicker than you
know<00:01:40.290> playing<00:01:40.560> through<00:01:40.829> all<00:01:40.979> ten<00:01:41.220> minute

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
like that that was a normal difficulty

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.330 
like that that was a normal difficulty
like<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.899> said<00:01:46.079> about<00:01:46.200> 80,000<00:01:46.860> points<00:01:47.130> about<00:01:47.280> a

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
like I said about 80,000 points about a

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.280 
like I said about 80,000 points about a
half<00:01:47.490> hour<00:01:47.640> work<00:01:47.970> just<00:01:48.689> doing<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:48.960> over<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
half hour work just doing this over and

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.080 
half hour work just doing this over and
over<00:01:49.409> again<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.890> do<00:01:50.009> get<00:01:50.189> down<00:01:50.369> sometimes<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
over again you do get down sometimes and

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.730 
over again you do get down sometimes and
there's<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.270> few<00:01:51.420> times<00:01:51.570> where<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.200> know<00:01:52.470> once

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
there's a few times where you know once

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.170 
there's a few times where you know once
the<00:01:52.890> police<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.399> are<00:01:53.549> around<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.970> start

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
the police that are around you start

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.490 
the police that are around you start
going<00:01:54.420> down<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.689> lose<00:01:54.840> your<00:01:55.020> suppressing

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
going down you lose your suppressing

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.420 
going down you lose your suppressing
fire<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.860> can<00:01:55.950> get<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.100> little<00:01:56.250> bit

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
fire and it can get a little bit

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.429 
fire and it can get a little bit
difficult<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.149> sketchy<00:01:57.719> at<00:01:57.930> times<00:01:58.140> but<00:01:58.320> if

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
difficult and sketchy at times but if

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.660 
difficult and sketchy at times but if
you<00:01:58.500> keep<00:01:58.619> doing<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.250> while<00:01:59.399> you'll

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
you keep doing this for a while you'll
