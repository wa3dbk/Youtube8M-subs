00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello friends text that I bring to 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.610
 You are a beautiful text from william. 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.280
 shakespeare saying so when I think 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.309
 in you I feel floating 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.910
 I feel myself reaching for the clouds touching the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.770
 stars to live in the sky 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.189
 I just try to overcome the immense longing. 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.480
 It racked my heart but it came 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.060
 along with the sweet memories of your being 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.480
 remembering the moments that together our 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.710
 love was combined in one person 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.800
 It is through this feeling that we 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.360
 I miss living when I'm away 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.770
 from you 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.780
 she is the food of the love she finds herself 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.129
 distant from the delicacy of thy words 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.699
 contrasts with the immensity of your 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.539
 I feel jealous if I bland her 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.019
 their vows and promises of eternal love 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.729
 long distance only serves to unite the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.860
 Our love for longing is for living. 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.330
 absolute certainty that we will stay for 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.049
 always together 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.320
 and in this moment of longing when I think 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.830
 in you when everything is hurting my 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.000
 And I do not think I have more strength. 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.810
 to continue 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.829
 behold, it arose as a presence as a 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.900
 splendor of an angel and involving me with 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:41.360
 a gentle breeze with arrivals all this 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.360
 because I love and I think of you
