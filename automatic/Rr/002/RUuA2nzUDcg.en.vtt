00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 enough of all this see more in a crease 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:11.990
 voice 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.990
 I'm here in the slow block is a 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:22.030
 I'm going to go to this place. 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:26.770
 and we'll see what it gives 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:30.190
 good training what they say is that this game 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:35.470
 block block the block launched hot blocks 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:38.190
 is that it is totally almost never 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:42.700
 I was here in Brazil, it was only 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.930
 released by brazil on channel g 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.170
 if I'm not mistaken it's there, but I am 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:56.879
 crazy showing him a little bit 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.879
 Good, I only have 1 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.100
 you can see that they have some 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.070
 Similarities between a robot blocks you see 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.610
 that he also was they also took the 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.030
 photo of a sky to be able to do is that 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.830
 I also experiment the ground it looks like a 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.060
 way too much of the time that I do not know anymore 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:23.180
 I forgot and you can see the person there 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.170
 it's not so well known it 's that texture 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.170
 normal title 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.479
 I found a lot of area and played 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.570
 I think it 's cool but some things 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.040
 they 're not cool but that time game 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.770
 the time has come 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.259
 in June before profit and is not so late 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.250
 against the block but he's cool guy is 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:49.660
 very good right and slightly in 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.970
 then if emerson deco pepe did not give 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.970
 so do not 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:01.230
 I mean it's annoying but if you have a 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:05.140
 account in the field and 50 is 50 years 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:08.710
 like $ 250 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.260
 you'd be fine of course $ 25 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:18.940
 I'd give you ten reais 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:21.310
 but it's worth spending a little bit of 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:28.680
 cdc in block 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.680
 in this idea that everything has been modified 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.730
 Can not conclude with you, in the version 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:43.090
 demo and how the sung is boring over here here 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.090
 she is not friend of several things 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.270
 It's okay. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.720
 this is my glock escape video 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.630
 or block block 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.700
 I'm going to read, I do not know which one I'll have to 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.280
 to see on the site is that I have no internet 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.740
 will it work to make this video in the flat 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.180
 to run even normal 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.069
 You can see that there are 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.290
 but you are seeing that the waterfall 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:19.540
 is 100 percent comic and 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:23.079
 it looks like it's 11 74 bits and water gets 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.920
 moving is better than facing the 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.879
 box 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.849
 I think we have stroski here too. 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:33.299
 water and fill time will not let you in 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:37.239
 water much of the time of the game then 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:39.909
 basically that's what i wanted to bring 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:43.419
 for you in this game I think a lot 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:46.000
 of the hour and I think it will do many 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.340
 people believe that I am I am 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.799
 brazilian first Brazilian who 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:57.040
 brought about is I'm so kaká 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.260
 Bringing this game to Brazil. 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.400
 unknown 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.900
 almost unknown here so that 's it 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.250

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.520

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.410
