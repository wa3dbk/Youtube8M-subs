00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 before man occupied the land 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.649
 the planet was covered by a 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.400
 continuous extension of prairie forests and 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.370
 deserts 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.129
 but as humanity expands the 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.110
 natural hedge is silhouetted up 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.779
 be reduced in many parts to 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.370
 remnants scattered here and there every 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.550
 once more isolated 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:28.700
 in this new landscape fragmented as 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.290
 they make the species to survive in 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.960
 the times when the coverage of 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.420
 natural vegetation was continuous a 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.490
 animal like the spectacled bear did not have 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.890
 greater obstacles to travel 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.940
 over vast extensions in search of 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.390
 food or couple 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.370
 even a whole population of bears a 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.190
 population large enough 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.399
 to be viable in time either 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.589
 I had space problems despite 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.000
 require a territory as extensive as 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:01.730
 the city of Lima and maybe more 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.620
 but in today's world of spaces 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.440
 ever smaller and smaller 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.960
 fragmented as a population of 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.880
 bears to survive the answer 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.720
 depends on the size of the remnant of 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.590
 natural vegetation in small areas 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.000
 unable to maintain a population 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.510
 viable 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.510
 the bears tend to disappear 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.220
 with each population that leaves the species 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.040
 loses a fraction of its variety 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.940
 genetics and the fragment loses a piece 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.940
 key to its biodiversity 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.820
 in the large remnants with enough 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.500
 space to support populations 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.630
 viable the bears survive but 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.969
 isolated as they are their reproduction is 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.090
 performed within small groups and 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:50.310
 more and more related what to the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.459
 long leads to genetic degeneration 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.469
 of the species making it more vulnerable 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.420
 to environmental changes and 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.880
 diseases 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.830
 we can think of something better than this 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.530
 future for the bear and for the 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.720
 ecosystems in which he lives 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.819
 one of the answers that is sought 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.009
 the problem is the recovery of 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.590
 connectivity lost through the 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.170
 called conservation corridors 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.730
 the conservation corridors are 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.280
 vegetation connections between 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.400
 remnants of native vegetation that 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.560
 they are separated by human activity their 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.300
 main function is to improve the 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.040
 connectivity facilitating the 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.560
 displacement of species from a 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.110
 fragment to another 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.310
 as a network of brokers 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.640
 interconnecting a group of fragments 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.430
 a population of bears can be maintained 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.250
 indefinitely in time 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.349
 even without any of the remnants is 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.370
 big enough to 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:53.190
 maintain a population by itself 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.860
 that's exactly what happens in the 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.500
 north of Peru where it has been proven 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.720
 the same population of bears 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.659
 displaced by natural corridors that 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.269
 the area is connected to the Cutervo National Park 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:09.150
 of private conservation chaparrÃ­ el 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.160
 Laquipampa wildlife refuge and 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.890
 other nearby areas 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.020
 all of them too small for 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.990
 sustain a population on its own 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.660
 viable bears 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.090
 for the bear and for the ecosystems in 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.280
 who lives to protect these runners is 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.150
 as important as preserving 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.490
 own protected areas but the bears and 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.410
 other large mammals are not 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.980
 only ones that can benefit from the 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.840
 runners countless species 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.090
 even the plants and animals more 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.820
 small are affected by the 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.700
 fragmentation by getting caught in 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.660
 islands of natural vegetation in the middle of 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.730
 a sea 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.940
 many times hostile of human activity 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.250
 a flock of parrots certainly not 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.549
 will have trouble moving from a 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.920
 remnant to another but the monkeys or 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.140
 even the turkeys will find that the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.810
 areas of forcadas represent a 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.260
 insurmountable obstacle 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.810
 and then when a fire a plague 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.720
 a drought or any disturbance 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.269
 natural or man-made eliminates 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.669
 a kind of a fragment its own 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.280
 isolation prevents other individuals 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:27.970
 coming from nearby fragments what 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.820
 recolonize other plants over time 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.850
 and animals continue their way and slowly 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.000
 biodiversity is disappearing from 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.010
 these islands that increasingly retain less 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.040
 of what was once a magnificent 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.750
 set of species as a great 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.120
 orchestra that is losing its 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.510
 instruments one by one and that sounds each 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.150
 once more out of tune when thanks to the 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.120
 runners recovers the connectivity of 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.070
 a biodiversity landscape little by little 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.320
 start your return 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.230
 with the runners the same thing happens 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.910
 protected areas despite 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.880
 Its direct beneficiaries are the 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.340
 animals and wild plants are 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.100
 we humans beings 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.250
 final beneficiaries 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.410
 for example the Andean highlands and 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.780
 forests that serve as a habitat for the bear 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.700
 They are also a source of water for 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.409
 human populations living in the 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.659
 down river valleys 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.279
 water is the best known of the 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:31.039
 environmental services that 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:33.139
 ecosystems provide the man but 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:35.869
 there are many others equally important 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:40.300
 like soils medicinal plants 

00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:40.300
 with the regulation of the microclimate 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.630
 but according to the natural ecosystems 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.790
 they lose their biodiversity they lose too 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.830
 its ability to provide services 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.710
 that provides 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.330
 by stopping the loss of biodiversity 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.330
 the runners contribute to maintain 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.740
 functioning ecosystems 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.690
 also contributing to maintain the 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.150
 green infrastructure that allows us to 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.470
 we humans continue to inhabit 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.620
 this planet 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.750
 the task ahead is not easy but it is 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.940
 a challenge that we have to assume if 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.510
 we want to maintain the same base of 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.510
 our existence
