00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
landing on the on the B string then you

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.120 
landing on the on the B string then you
go<00:05:05.530> into<00:05:05.740> this<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.930> this<00:05:08.200> guy<00:05:08.440> to<00:05:08.500> Big<00:05:08.890> Ben

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
you're you're moving to the from the B

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.670 
you're you're moving to the from the B
string<00:05:17.310> 15th<00:05:18.310> fret<00:05:18.610> to<00:05:19.480> the<00:05:19.510> E<00:05:19.660> string<00:05:20.110> 13th

string 15th fret to the E string 13th

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:35.190 
string 15th fret to the E string 13th
and<00:05:20.920> 15th<00:05:21.280> fret

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.150 

and<00:05:36.200> then<00:05:36.410> I<00:05:36.440> move<00:05:36.770> this<00:05:36.980> up<00:05:37.190> to<00:05:38.740> using<00:05:39.740> the<00:05:39.860> the

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
and then I move this up to using the the

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.500 
and then I move this up to using the the
B<00:05:40.340> string<00:05:40.730> on<00:05:41.480> the<00:05:42.080> let's<00:05:42.740> see<00:05:42.890> this<00:05:43.070> is<00:05:43.220> the

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
B string on the let's see this is the

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:50.170 
B string on the let's see this is the
15th<00:05:44.510> 17th<00:05:45.610> 19th<00:05:46.610> 20th<00:05:47.060> spread<00:05:48.760> your<00:05:49.760> bending

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.600 
15th 17th 19th 20th spread your bending
here<00:05:50.420> to<00:05:50.660> get<00:05:52.840> and<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:54.830> reason<00:05:55.160> that<00:05:55.190> I'm<00:05:55.430> not

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
here to get and the reason that I'm not

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
playing the earlier part down is it's

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.590 
playing the earlier part down is it's
just<00:05:57.650> you<00:05:58.610> know<00:05:58.730> you<00:05:58.790> could<00:05:59.030> play<00:06:01.480> but<00:06:02.480> you

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
just you know you could play but you

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.000 
just you know you could play but you

don't really get the same tone out of
the<00:06:04.160> strings<00:06:04.490> which<00:06:04.670> is<00:06:04.820> why<00:06:04.940> I'm<00:06:05.000> playing<00:06:05.210> it

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360
