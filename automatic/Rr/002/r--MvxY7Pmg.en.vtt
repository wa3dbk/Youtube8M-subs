00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.520
 Congratulations on your new Isabella Capri. 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.180
 We would like to show you how you can assemble this awning quickly and easily. 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.910
 To make building even easier and easier, 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.850
 we recommend you use our Aqua Tex impregnation spray, which makes the tent glide easily through the caravan rail 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.850
 and the Hercules Twin tent frame tensioner for easy and good tensioning of the frame poles. 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.500
 The easiest way is to build the awning with two people. 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.420
 First, a Ground Cover carpet is laid in front of the caravan, if available. 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.400
 This is fixed with pegs in the corners. 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.220
 Then insert the draft strip into the rail under the caravan. 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.060
 Install the small coupling rail for fixing the wheel housing seal, 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.700
 to avoid draft through the wheel arch. 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.160
 To set up the tent, the frame on the carpet is first explained. 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.220
 The frame is laid down in such a way that all parts are approximately where you will need them later. 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.240
 Consult the assembly instructions. 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.820
 Some of the frame poles must first be mounted. 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.860
 To slide the tent cloth into the caravan rail easier, it is advisable to first slide this caravan rail 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.020
 spray with a thin layer of Aqua Tex impregnation spray. 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.100
 Now the tent cloth can be slid into the caravan rail. 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.920
 The tent cloth must be unfolded as much as possible 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.160
 and then figure out where to put the tent first. 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.780
 The easiest way is when 1 person moves through the tent and the other enters and guides the tent into the rail. 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.320
 When the tent cloth has been fully retracted and is correctly distributed over the caravan 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.520
 you can start building the frame. 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.139
 First attach all Fix-On blocks to the tent. 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.000
 These come from the Fix-On profile that is mounted next to the tent tendon. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.900
 There is a Fix-On block for every roof bar. 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.980
 When assembling the frame you start with the middle upright. 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.060
 The two front beams are mounted on this. 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.140
 This raises the screen so that you can move more freely under the tent cloth. 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.100
 The roof bar is hung in the Fix-On and then placed in the center cross. 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.420
 The roof bar locks when the bar is turned 90 Â°. 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.360
 Now place the middle upright in the control cord and stretch it to the appropriate height. 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.700
 From the middle you work to the side, here also place the corner posts and put them in the control cord. 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.700
 You can then stretch the corner posts vertically. 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.831
 With an uneven bottom, the height on the left or right can be different. 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.880
 Please pay attention that the Drop Stop barrier is correctly positioned in the corner of the tent, 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.840
 before the tent cloth is put over the tip of the corner piece. 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.660
 The Hercules Twin is used to further stretch the frame. 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.720
 It is adjustable so that it fits on multiple tube diameters. 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.820
 If you use the Hercules Twin, you must put the clamping bracket against the adjusting screw 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.260
 and then loosen the turnbuckle. 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.500
 Thanks to the leverage you can get an optimal tension on the frame. 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.520
 All poles must be tensioned optimally, 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.100
 you start with the uprights then the front beams and finally the roof bars and the extra roof bars. 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.720
 After this you can place the rods of the pet canopy and tension them. 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.960
 Your awning now begins to take its final shape. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.980
 When all have been placed and stretched, the awning must be secured with pegs. 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.160
 You start with the rear corner at the caravan and then the other side at the caravan. 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.640
 After this you do the front corner on one side and then on the other side. 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.580
 The draft flaps are attached in the awning. 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.980
 The pegs are allowed through the Ground Cover carpet. 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.080
 Now you can close the rear corner first and then the outside. 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.980
 Then tension the side walls with pegs, taking care that the tension is evenly distributed. 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.660
 The Isaflex tent rubbers can be turned around the pegs for even better tension. 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.060
 At the entrances the IsaFlex tent rubbers must be stretched crosswise 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.580
 to also maintain optimum tension when the doors are opened. 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.640
 Now the entire front can also be tensioned further. 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.690
 The inward draft flaps can then be attached to further seal the tent. 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.470
 Ground Cover is first used for this construction method 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.770
 then a sail and finally a Bolon awning carpet. 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.180
 The sail stops rising damp, 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.540
 while the awning carpet provides a pleasant and comfortable surface. 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.240
 The sail can possibly be omitted. 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.500
 The Bolon awning carpet is turned on the corners, 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.000
 so that it can assume the right fit. 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.740
 There is a two-part curtain hanging system for the curtains. 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.340
 One part is attached to the cord above the window 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.300
 and the other round parts go through the eyes of the curtains. 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.260
 You decide which side of the curtains to hang in or out. 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.520
 The curtain holders and the curtains are fitted. 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.100
 These curtain holders are used when the curtains in the side wall are closed. 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.700
 Your awning is now fully assembled. 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.640
 The porch rod supplied as standard can be placed in the front between the center stand 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.160
 and corner post are placed. 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.360
 When the front is rolling down, close the curtains so that the window film does not lie directly on the rod. 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.000
 Have fun with your awning.
