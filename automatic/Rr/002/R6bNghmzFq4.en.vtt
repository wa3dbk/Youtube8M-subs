outside this is all i'm going to use on
the<00:02:18.209> lead<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.590> i'm<00:02:19.709> just<00:02:19.739> going<00:02:20.129> to<00:02:22.250> draw<00:02:23.250> sort

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
the lead so i'm just going to draw sort

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.680 
the lead so i'm just going to draw sort
of<00:02:23.760> methyl<00:02:24.360> e<00:02:27.319> and<00:02:28.849> then<00:02:29.849> take<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.269> other<00:02:30.390> side

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
of methyl e and then take the other side

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.910 
of methyl e and then take the other side
and<00:02:31.470> just<00:02:32.040> start<00:02:32.370> smudging<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:33.090> out<00:02:36.829> and<00:02:37.829> i

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
and just start smudging that out and i

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.440 
and just start smudging that out and i
actually<00:02:38.040> find<00:02:38.489> with<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.909> Urban<00:02:39.239> Decay

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
actually find with that Urban Decay

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.039 
actually find with that Urban Decay
primer<00:02:39.629> potion<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.349> makes<00:02:40.560> my<00:02:42.049> it

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
primer potion that it makes my it

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.920 
primer potion that it makes my it
certainly<00:02:43.950> makes<00:02:44.159> this<00:02:44.519> harder<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.329> blend<00:02:45.690> out

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
certainly makes this harder to blend out

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.710 
certainly makes this harder to blend out
this<00:02:46.290> pencil<00:02:47.129> I<00:02:47.340> don't<00:02:48.329> know<00:02:48.390> if<00:02:48.450> that's<00:02:48.599> the

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
this pencil I don't know if that's the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.390 
this pencil I don't know if that's the
case<00:02:48.870> for<00:02:49.109> other<00:02:49.260> pencils<00:02:49.590> or<00:02:49.920> other<00:02:50.099> cream

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
case for other pencils or other cream

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.660 
case for other pencils or other cream
products<00:02:50.819> but<00:02:51.709> like<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.859> said<00:02:52.920> before<00:02:53.190> if<00:02:53.549> you

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
products but like I said before if you

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.059 
products but like I said before if you
want<00:02:53.819> it<00:02:53.909> to<00:02:54.000> stay<00:02:54.239> put<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.569> is<00:02:54.720> worth<00:02:55.069> taking

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
want it to stay put it is worth taking

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.720 
want it to stay put it is worth taking
the<00:02:56.159> extra<00:02:56.400> time<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:57.000> put<00:02:57.239> that<00:02:57.269> on<00:02:57.569> and<00:02:57.780> like

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
the extra time to put that on and like

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.500 
the extra time to put that on and like
spend<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.819> bit<00:02:59.970> longer<00:03:00.239> blending<00:03:02.030> well<00:03:03.030> as<00:03:03.389> you

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
spend a bit longer blending well as you

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.640 
spend a bit longer blending well as you
can<00:03:03.690> see<00:03:03.750> that's<00:03:06.079> kind<00:03:07.079> of<00:03:07.139> creating<00:03:07.620> the

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
can see that's kind of creating the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.000 
can see that's kind of creating the
groundwork<00:03:08.310> for<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:09.049> smoky<00:03:10.049> effect<00:03:10.109> and<00:03:10.769> once

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
groundwork for the smoky effect and once

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.039 
groundwork for the smoky effect and once
I've<00:03:11.190> blended<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.819> first<00:03:12.120> layer<00:03:12.450> out<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.870> just

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
I've blended the first layer out I just

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.990 
I've blended the first layer out I just
keep<00:03:13.290> on<00:03:13.440> applying<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.819> good<00:03:14.970> thing

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
keep on applying and the good thing

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.300 
keep on applying and the good thing
about<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.569> you<00:03:15.780> can<00:03:15.959> really<00:03:16.650> sort<00:03:17.220> of

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
about this is you can really sort of

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.900 
about this is you can really sort of
customize<00:03:18.030> how<00:03:18.739> how<00:03:19.739> dark<00:03:20.129> you<00:03:20.250> want<00:03:20.519> it<00:03:20.579> to<00:03:20.699> be

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
customize how how dark you want it to be

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.319 
customize how how dark you want it to be
and<00:03:21.859> I<00:03:22.859> don't<00:03:23.099> mind<00:03:23.459> either<00:03:23.760> if<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.150> is<00:03:24.299> a

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
and I don't mind either if it is a

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.890 
and I don't mind either if it is a
little<00:03:24.750> messy<00:03:25.139> I<00:03:25.349> kind<00:03:25.769> of<00:03:25.829> like<00:03:26.069> that<00:03:26.900> but

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
little messy I kind of like that but

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.559 
little messy I kind of like that but
obviously<00:03:28.290> this<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.709> just<00:03:28.910> one<00:03:29.910> technique<00:03:30.329> of

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
obviously this is just one technique of

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.390 
obviously this is just one technique of
doing<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.379> can<00:03:31.560> make<00:03:31.739> it<00:03:31.889> as<00:03:32.010> neat<00:03:32.280> as

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
doing it and you can make it as neat as

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.039 
doing it and you can make it as neat as
you<00:03:32.430> like<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:33.000> could<00:03:33.150> even<00:03:33.269> use<00:03:33.449> different

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
you like you could even use different

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.390 
you like you could even use different
colored<00:03:34.290> pencils<00:03:34.650> for<00:03:34.739> this<00:03:34.889> it<00:03:35.040> doesn't<00:03:35.190> have

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
colored pencils for this it doesn't have

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.629 
colored pencils for this it doesn't have
to<00:03:35.489> be<00:03:35.549> black<00:03:36.079> and<00:03:37.079> navy<00:03:37.410> or<00:03:37.889> gray<00:03:38.280> would<00:03:38.489> be

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
to be black and navy or gray would be

00:03:38.639 --> 00:04:18.250 
to be black and navy or gray would be
nice<00:03:38.790> as<00:03:39.030> well

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.040 

okay<00:04:19.040> so<00:04:19.460> as<00:04:19.550> you<00:04:19.700> can<00:04:19.820> stay<00:04:20.210> after<00:04:20.720> a<00:04:20.750> little

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.050 
okay so as you can stay after a little

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.650 
okay so as you can stay after a little
bit<00:04:21.200> of<00:04:21.350> like<00:04:22.340> layering<00:04:22.730> and<00:04:23.060> blending<00:04:23.510> out

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
bit of like layering and blending out

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.740 
bit of like layering and blending out
you<00:04:24.590> get<00:04:25.340> this<00:04:25.610> kind<00:04:25.880> of<00:04:26.000> smoky<00:04:26.300> look<00:04:26.510> and<00:04:26.690> I

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
you get this kind of smoky look and I

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.620 
you get this kind of smoky look and I
have<00:04:26.960> done<00:04:27.200> it<00:04:27.380> quite<00:04:27.800> messily<00:04:28.490> that's<00:04:28.760> how<00:04:29.600> I

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
have done it quite messily that's how I

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.210 
have done it quite messily that's how I
like<00:04:29.960> to<00:04:29.990> do<00:04:30.200> it<00:04:30.290> obviously<00:04:30.680> you<00:04:30.860> could<00:04:31.040> use

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
like to do it obviously you could use

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.310 
like to do it obviously you could use
the<00:04:31.400> same<00:04:31.610> principle<00:04:32.030> but<00:04:32.540> make<00:04:32.870> it<00:04:32.900> neater

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
the same principle but make it neater

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.320 
the same principle but make it neater
and<00:04:33.440> like<00:04:33.800> give<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:34.280> some<00:04:34.610> kind<00:04:34.820> of<00:04:34.850> shape<00:04:35.150> if

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
and like give it some kind of shape if

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.040 
and like give it some kind of shape if
you<00:04:35.360> like<00:04:35.770> but<00:04:36.770> really<00:04:36.920> all<00:04:37.100> smokey<00:04:37.580> eye<00:04:37.730> is<00:04:38.050> to

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
you like but really all smokey eye is to

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.460 
you like but really all smokey eye is to
me<00:04:39.260> my<00:04:39.650> interpretation<00:04:40.400> of<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:40.580> is<00:04:40.670> the<00:04:40.850> color

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
me my interpretation of it is the color

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.630 
me my interpretation of it is the color
concentrated<00:04:42.470> at<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.710> lashes<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:43.520> then

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
concentrated at the lashes and then

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.430 
concentrated at the lashes and then
smoking<00:04:44.240> out<00:04:44.630> I<00:04:44.660> mean<00:04:44.990> that's<00:04:45.110> why<00:04:45.320> it's

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
smoking out I mean that's why it's

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.040 
smoking out I mean that's why it's
called<00:04:45.470> a<00:04:45.680> smoky<00:04:46.100> eye<00:04:46.330> so<00:04:47.330> what<00:04:47.570> I<00:04:47.600> might<00:04:47.810> do<00:04:48.020> is

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
called a smoky eye so what I might do is

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:42.219 
with this as well it's going and make a

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:44.790 
with this as well it's going and make a

no I guess skin showing in there you

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.920 
no I guess skin showing in there you
want<00:05:49.389> your<00:05:49.509> lashes<00:05:49.960> and<00:05:50.409> the<00:05:51.219> upper<00:05:52.119> line<00:05:52.659> to

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.689 

okay<00:06:16.500> so<00:06:17.500> it<00:06:17.650> really<00:06:17.919> is<00:06:18.130> that<00:06:18.160> simple<00:06:18.310> the

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
okay so it really is that simple the

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:20.939 
okay so it really is that simple the
only<00:06:18.970> time<00:06:19.210> consuming<00:06:19.750> thing<00:06:19.990> is<00:06:20.290> the

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
only time consuming thing is the

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:23.820 
only time consuming thing is the
blending<00:06:21.430> and<00:06:21.900> it's<00:06:22.900> up<00:06:23.110> to<00:06:23.260> you<00:06:23.350> how<00:06:23.380> much<00:06:23.620> you

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
blending and it's up to you how much you

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.870 
blending and it's up to you how much you
want<00:06:24.100> to<00:06:24.130> blend<00:06:24.340> anyway<00:06:24.729> so<00:06:26.100> that<00:06:27.100> is<00:06:27.400> the

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
want to blend anyway so that is the

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.030 
want to blend anyway so that is the
completed<00:06:28.479> look<00:06:31.590> obviously<00:06:32.590> you<00:06:32.710> could<00:06:32.860> make

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
completed look obviously you could make

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.870 
completed look obviously you could make
this<00:06:33.160> a<00:06:33.220> lot<00:06:33.550> more<00:06:33.729> dramatic<00:06:34.240> this<00:06:34.540> is<00:06:35.880> pretty

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
this a lot more dramatic this is pretty

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.330 
this a lot more dramatic this is pretty
much<00:06:37.030> just<00:06:37.300> the<00:06:37.570> bare<00:06:38.410> minimum<00:06:38.650> smokiness

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
much just the bare minimum smokiness

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.330 
much just the bare minimum smokiness
that<00:06:39.580> I<00:06:39.639> would<00:06:39.820> do<00:06:39.940> if<00:06:40.090> I<00:06:40.240> was<00:06:40.800> going<00:06:41.800> to<00:06:41.919> go<00:06:42.040> for
