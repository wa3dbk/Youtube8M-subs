and<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.920> pterosaur<00:01:02.190> was<00:01:02.820> with<00:01:03.239> it

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
and so what the pterosaur was with it

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.330 
and so what the pterosaur was with it
was<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:04.110> flying<00:01:04.739> dinosaur<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:07.200> had<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.740> big

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
was a flying dinosaur and it had a big

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.740 
was a flying dinosaur and it had a big
leathery<00:01:08.939> wings<00:01:09.740> very<00:01:10.740> wide<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.750> it's

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
leathery wings very wide and it's

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.580 
leathery wings very wide and it's
supposedly<00:01:13.170> flew<00:01:16.280> so<00:01:17.780> I<00:01:18.780> wanted<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.380> first

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
supposedly flew so I wanted to first

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.429 
supposedly flew so I wanted to first
sight<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.939> experiment<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.810> was<00:01:21.990> done<00:01:22.049> in

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
sight in the experiment that was done in

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.460 
sight in the experiment that was done in
Minneapolis<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.780> 2002<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.049> what<00:01:26.040> this

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
Minneapolis in 2002 and what this

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.670 
Minneapolis in 2002 and what this
experiment<00:01:28.470> was<00:01:29.240> was<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.420> wanted<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.470> take

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
experiment was was they wanted to take

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.390 
experiment was was they wanted to take
something<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:33.320> they<00:01:34.320> knew<00:01:34.619> would<00:01:34.770> fly<00:01:35.040> and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
something that they knew would fly and

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.719 
something that they knew would fly and
they<00:01:36.030> knew<00:01:36.210> would<00:01:36.390> glide<00:01:36.720> as<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.829> control<00:01:38.400> in

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
they knew would glide as the control in

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.249 
they knew would glide as the control in
an<00:01:38.880> experiment<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:41.180> what<00:01:42.180> they<00:01:42.329> decided<00:01:43.049> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
an experiment and what they decided to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.789 
an experiment and what they decided to
use<00:01:43.799> was<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> kite<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:46.140> they<00:01:46.380> took<00:01:46.590> this

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
use was a kite and so they took this

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.490 
use was a kite and so they took this
kite<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:50.090> they<00:01:51.090> took<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.990> top<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
kite and they took it to the top of a

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.300 
kite and they took it to the top of a
four-story<00:01:52.979> building<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:55.200> was<00:01:55.439> 70<00:01:55.829> feet<00:01:55.979> tall

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
four-story building it was 70 feet tall

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.600 
four-story building it was 70 feet tall
and<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.840> they<00:01:57.990> let<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.469> go<00:01:58.649> off<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.219> building

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
and so they let it go off the building

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.899 
and so they let it go off the building
and<00:01:59.909> at<00:02:00.869> two<00:02:01.170> seconds<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.770> was<00:02:01.950> down<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.189> 65

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
and at two seconds it was down to 65

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.959 
and at two seconds it was down to 65
feet<00:02:02.939> at<00:02:03.750> five<00:02:04.259> seconds<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.979> was<00:02:05.280> down<00:02:05.610> to

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
feet at five seconds it was down to

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.150 
feet at five seconds it was down to
about<00:02:06.930> 45<00:02:07.890> feet<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.789> then<00:02:09.450> at<00:02:09.569> seven

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
about 45 feet and then at seven

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.010 
about 45 feet and then at seven
seconds<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:10.730> was<00:02:10.940> all<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.330> way<00:02:11.420> down<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.960> about

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
seconds it was all the way down to about

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.460 
seconds it was all the way down to about
30<00:02:12.530> feet<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:15.220> in<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:17.270> scale<00:02:17.660> drawing<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.290> can

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
30 feet so in the scale drawing you can

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.320 
30 feet so in the scale drawing you can
see<00:02:18.730> how<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.790> kite<00:02:20.270> flew<00:02:20.930> on<00:02:21.890> its<00:02:22.370> own<00:02:22.580> off<00:02:22.880> the

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
see how the kite flew on its own off the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.990 
see how the kite flew on its own off the
building<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:25.610> what<00:02:26.360> they<00:02:26.450> wanted<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.930> do<00:02:27.140> was

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
building and what they wanted to do was

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.210 
building and what they wanted to do was
test<00:02:29.000> out<00:02:29.270> this<00:02:29.480> theory<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.710> pterosaur

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
test out this theory that the pterosaur

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.390 
test out this theory that the pterosaur
was<00:02:31.760> actually<00:02:32.150> real<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:33.070> that<00:02:34.070> it<00:02:34.510> had

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
was actually real and that it had

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.300 
was actually real and that it had
leather<00:02:37.400> wings<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:39.470> what<00:02:39.620> they<00:02:39.710> did<00:02:39.950> was<00:02:40.190> they

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
leather wings so what they did was they

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.080 
leather wings so what they did was they
took<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:42.250> very<00:02:43.250> similar<00:02:45.490> substance<00:02:46.490> a<00:02:46.790> very

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
took a very similar substance a very

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.910 
took a very similar substance a very
similar<00:02:47.360> thing<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:47.960> they<00:02:48.110> put<00:02:48.440> it<00:02:48.560> on<00:02:48.680> the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
similar thing and they put it on the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.280 
similar thing and they put it on the
kite<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.370> let<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:49.700> go<00:02:49.850> so<00:02:50.570> they<00:02:50.750> took<00:02:51.050> a

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
kite and let it go so they took a

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.820 
kite and let it go so they took a
leather<00:02:51.800> jacket<00:02:51.920> out<00:02:52.520> of<00:02:52.790> their<00:02:52.940> closet<00:02:53.420> and

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
leather jacket out of their closet and

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.980 
leather jacket out of their closet and
as<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:54.980> can<00:02:55.370> see<00:02:55.580> they<00:02:55.760> equipped<00:02:56.210> the<00:02:56.660> kite

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
as you can see they equipped the kite

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.870 
as you can see they equipped the kite
with<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.320> leather<00:02:57.530> jacket<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.190> there's

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
with the leather jacket and there's

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.240 
with the leather jacket and there's
still<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.360> same<00:02:59.630> 70<00:03:00.140> feet<00:03:00.320> but<00:03:00.950> at<00:03:01.040> two

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
still that same 70 feet but at two

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.980 
still that same 70 feet but at two
seconds<00:03:01.730> they're<00:03:01.880> already<00:03:02.090> down<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.510> 45

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
seconds they're already down to the 45

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.890 
seconds they're already down to the 45
feet<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.730> five<00:03:04.730> seconds<00:03:05.210> they're<00:03:05.360> down<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.660> 12

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
feet a five seconds they're down to 12

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.780 
feet a five seconds they're down to 12
feet<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.260> at<00:03:06.530> seven<00:03:07.040> seconds<00:03:07.400> they're<00:03:07.610> all

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
feet and at seven seconds they're all

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.610 
feet and at seven seconds they're all
the<00:03:08.090> way<00:03:08.180> down<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.570> ground<00:03:08.720> at<00:03:08.960> zero<00:03:09.350> feet

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
the way down to the ground at zero feet

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.070 
the way down to the ground at zero feet
so<00:03:10.520> in<00:03:10.640> this<00:03:10.790> scarab<00:03:11.120> scale<00:03:11.570> drawing<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:12.050> can

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
so in this scarab scale drawing you can

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.630 
so in this scarab scale drawing you can
see<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.620> whole<00:03:12.830> difference<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:14.830> where<00:03:15.830> that

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
see the whole difference of where that

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.080 
see the whole difference of where that
kite<00:03:16.970> was<00:03:17.240> at<00:03:17.570> each<00:03:18.020> stage<00:03:18.380> of<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.710> experiment

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.350 

after<00:03:23.090> seven<00:03:23.960> seconds<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:25.610> kite<00:03:25.850> was<00:03:26.060> on<00:03:26.240> the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
after seven seconds the kite was on the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.760 
after seven seconds the kite was on the
floor<00:03:26.630> when<00:03:26.870> it<00:03:26.990> was<00:03:27.110> equipped<00:03:27.410> with<00:03:27.620> this

floor when it was equipped with this
leathery<00:03:28.640> wing<00:03:31.120> could<00:03:32.120> it<00:03:32.210> have<00:03:32.330> happened<00:03:32.510> in

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
leathery wing could it have happened in

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.500 
leathery wing could it have happened in
real<00:03:33.320> life<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:34.910> tell<00:03:35.180> me<00:03:35.650> go<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:37.280> your<00:03:38.180> closet

and<00:04:17.239> these<00:04:17.630> bulging<00:04:18.200> eyes<00:04:18.880> which<00:04:19.880> have<00:04:20.000> been

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
and these bulging eyes which have been

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.000 
and these bulging eyes which have been
shown<00:04:20.330> to<00:04:20.540> not<00:04:20.690> be<00:04:20.900> good<00:04:21.020> for<00:04:21.080> flight

shown to not be good for flight

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.150 
shown to not be good for flight
so<00:04:23.100> this<00:04:25.220> dinosaur<00:04:26.510> supposedly<00:04:27.510> flew<00:04:27.750> and

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
so this dinosaur supposedly flew and

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.420 
so this dinosaur supposedly flew and
this<00:04:29.160> dinosaur<00:04:29.670> supposedly<00:04:30.450> existed<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:31.430> it

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
this dinosaur supposedly existed and it

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.560 
this dinosaur supposedly existed and it
was<00:04:33.090> around<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:34.280> you<00:04:35.280> know<00:04:35.430> it<00:04:35.760> doesn't<00:04:36.330> make

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
was around and you know it doesn't make

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.420 
was around and you know it doesn't make
sense<00:04:36.630> this<00:04:37.110> is<00:04:37.320> the<00:04:37.470> type<00:04:37.710> of<00:04:37.740> dinosaur<00:04:38.370> that

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
sense this is the type of dinosaur that

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.200 
sense this is the type of dinosaur that
makes<00:04:38.820> these<00:04:39.000> atheists<00:04:39.350> and<00:04:40.350> these

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
makes these atheists and these

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.900 
makes these atheists and these
paleontologists<00:04:42.210> sit<00:04:42.840> there<00:04:43.020> and<00:04:43.200> say<00:04:43.410> all

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
paleontologists sit there and say all

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.880 
paleontologists sit there and say all
dinosaurs<00:04:44.910> are<00:04:45.090> just<00:04:45.270> like<00:04:45.420> birds<00:04:45.720> oh<00:04:46.110> yeah

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
dinosaurs are just like birds oh yeah

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.310 
dinosaurs are just like birds oh yeah
Birds<00:04:47.250> they're<00:04:47.850> there<00:04:48.300> what<00:04:48.540> dinosaurs<00:04:49.140> are

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
Birds they're there what dinosaurs are

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.290 
Birds they're there what dinosaurs are
now<00:04:49.760> and<00:04:50.760> no<00:04:50.910> it's<00:04:51.240> not<00:04:51.450> true

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
now and no it's not true

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.700 
now and no it's not true
they<00:04:54.300> never<00:04:54.540> flew<00:04:54.900> it<00:04:55.200> they<00:04:55.380> never<00:04:55.560> existed

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
they never flew it they never existed

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.770 
they never flew it they never existed
dinosaurs<00:04:58.710> do<00:04:59.310> not<00:04:59.610> equal<00:04:59.970> birds<00:05:02.480> you<00:05:03.480> can't

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
dinosaurs do not equal birds you can't

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.560 
dinosaurs do not equal birds you can't
just<00:05:04.020> say<00:05:04.200> oh<00:05:04.470> yeah<00:05:05.370> here's<00:05:05.790> this<00:05:06.030> piece<00:05:06.390> of

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
just say oh yeah here's this piece of

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.390 
just say oh yeah here's this piece of
bone<00:05:06.720> in<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:07.110> ground<00:05:07.440> it<00:05:07.740> means<00:05:07.890> that<00:05:08.250> there

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
bone in the ground it means that there

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.520 
bone in the ground it means that there
was<00:05:08.550> a<00:05:08.610> dinosaur<00:05:08.940> that<00:05:09.390> had<00:05:09.660> wings<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:10.290> it<00:05:10.440> was

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
was a dinosaur that had wings and it was

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.980 
was a dinosaur that had wings and it was
made<00:05:10.710> out<00:05:10.740> of<00:05:10.890> leather<00:05:11.100> jackets<00:05:11.220> and<00:05:12.150> whatever

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
made out of leather jackets and whatever

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.690 
made out of leather jackets and whatever
else<00:05:13.290> they're<00:05:13.590> trying<00:05:13.920> to<00:05:14.010> say<00:05:14.280> it<00:05:14.490> doesn't

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
else they're trying to say it doesn't

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.980 
else they're trying to say it doesn't
make<00:05:15.000> sense<00:05:15.060> it<00:05:15.600> doesn't<00:05:15.900> exist<00:05:16.260> so<00:05:16.700> I<00:05:17.700> think

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
make sense it doesn't exist so I think

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.420 
make sense it doesn't exist so I think
with<00:05:18.990> these<00:05:19.170> experiments<00:05:19.650> that<00:05:20.190> have<00:05:20.310> been

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
with these experiments that have been

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.090 
with these experiments that have been
proven<00:05:20.850> and<00:05:21.060> just<00:05:21.570> common<00:05:21.960> sense<00:05:21.990> in<00:05:22.500> general

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
proven and just common sense in general

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.750 
proven and just common sense in general
you<00:05:23.670> can<00:05:23.880> say<00:05:24.440> that<00:05:25.440> there's<00:05:26.190> no<00:05:26.400> way<00:05:26.430> that

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
you can say that there's no way that

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.510 
you can say that there's no way that
this<00:05:26.970> dinosaur<00:05:27.270> this<00:05:27.660> pterosaur<00:05:28.200> ever

this dinosaur this pterosaur ever

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.940 
this dinosaur this pterosaur ever
existed<00:05:29.520> the<00:05:30.030> way<00:05:30.330> that<00:05:30.800> paleontologists<00:05:31.800> are

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
existed the way that paleontologists are

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.450 
existed the way that paleontologists are
saying<00:05:32.520> that<00:05:32.730> they<00:05:32.850> did<00:05:33.180> and<00:05:33.690> at<00:05:34.530> that<00:05:34.740> point<00:05:35.160> I

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
saying that they did and at that point I

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.610 
saying that they did and at that point I
think<00:05:36.210> it's<00:05:36.360> safe<00:05:36.960> to<00:05:36.990> say<00:05:39.260> what<00:05:40.260> else<00:05:40.380> are<00:05:40.590> you

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
think it's safe to say what else are you

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:49.850 
think it's safe to say what else are you
hiding<00:05:45.560> paleontologists<00:05:47.120> if<00:05:48.590> that's<00:05:49.590> not

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
hiding paleontologists if that's not

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.970 
hiding paleontologists if that's not
real<00:05:50.100> know<00:05:50.220> what<00:05:50.370> else<00:05:50.520> isn't<00:05:51.800> I'm<00:05:52.800> gonna

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
real know what else isn't I'm gonna
