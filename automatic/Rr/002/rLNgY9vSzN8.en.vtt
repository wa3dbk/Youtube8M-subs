00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
this off to the side and then we're

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.009 
this off to the side and then we're
going<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:26.950> cook<00:02:27.190> this<00:02:27.489> on<00:02:27.790> another<00:02:28.420> pin<00:02:28.810> in

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
going to cook this on another pin in

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.990 
going to cook this on another pin in
just<00:02:29.260> another<00:02:29.530> minute<00:02:29.799> okay<00:02:30.519> it<00:02:30.700> looks<00:02:30.760> like

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
just another minute okay it looks like

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.490 
just another minute okay it looks like
the<00:02:31.209> muscles<00:02:31.599> have<00:02:31.750> definitely<00:02:32.170> finished

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
the muscles have definitely finished

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.080 
the muscles have definitely finished
cooking<00:02:32.680> so<00:02:33.220> we're<00:02:33.370> going<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.549> take<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.879> pot

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
off to the side take off the lid so we

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.509 
off to the side take off the lid so we
can<00:02:37.060> let<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.330> cool<00:02:37.480> off<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.750> little<00:02:38.049> bit<00:02:38.260> in<00:02:38.530> the
