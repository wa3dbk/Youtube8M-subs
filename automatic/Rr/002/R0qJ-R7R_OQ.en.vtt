00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hi in this video i was talking to you 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.609
 so motivational how to motivate yourself 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.730
 so to take the guitar to play 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.620
 a bit to progress in fact precisely 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.049
 to talk about that I announce you so 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.389
 the opening of my private group actually 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.029
 my private group is what is it so 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.460
 a member area I'm going to 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.050
 so publish each week a video to 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.250
 which in fact I will answer to your 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.350
 questions you rest me on a 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.670
 small form so as it comes 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.170
 to open for the moment there will be that 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.880
 classes from the week 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.520
 next that's why for the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.530
 first month actually I 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.760
 in fact I offer you good access it is 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.550
 at 2 euros but in fact it's just 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.820
 technical costs of setting up but 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.400
 otherwise there is me it for me 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.830
 nothing is right for you you are 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.700
 access so for 2 euros and you in 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:53.250
 speak again just after no to motivate 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.190
 what I'm doing stupidly is that 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.140
 I listen to an antrim song and tell me 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.750
 does the effect so I hear that 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.629
 facts it's a song with a 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.619
 guitarist that I admire that 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.090
 I would like to arrive or indeed any 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.649
 just a song that will create me 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.330
 the enthusiasm of the times we see in the 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.920
 concerts or anywhere we have people 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.690
 actually these plays their song i 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.420
 thought their people they listen to them 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.740
 songs i thought i here they are 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.630
 actually driven by this song 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.560
 so in fact it's not necessarily a 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.270
 very catchy song this is a 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.090
 song that gives you emotions 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.500
 that must be found there certainly 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.820
 one that you can listen to tons 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.650
 and tons of liver is still you 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.540
 have a little thrill or 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.600
 that's what reminds you of things these 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.720
 songs there in fact she creates in order to 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.890
 the enthusiasm that makes you want 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.810
 to get to go play guitar in 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.610
 done to do what is 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.770
 pass in this song 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.240
 for example so this is a solo you 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.369
 admire 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.259
 arif that you like a lot or 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.720
 something like that find this 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.220
 song is good if the song is too 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.740
 hard and if he found one more to 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.659
 your level for a song like that 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.799
 you will see that will motivate you 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.600
 have him taken right after 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.390
 to take the guitar to succeed to play 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.840
 this thing and it works like then I 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.009
 the do made case of the songs that 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.590
 was working well before now that 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.390
 I can play it was for example 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.160
 pink floyd and with a binomial picture bout 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.560
 and where I loved his songs I you 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.930
 still love to but I use it - 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.910
 as enthusiasm because now 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.640
 I know how to play them I know how to make them 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.450
 things I'm getting so I tried to 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.890
 find more songs 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.200
 now it's a little bit more 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.930
 pushed like pieces of satriani 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.670
 steve hay or 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.990
 two males good style it's a little bit more 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.170
 pushes like 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.340
 like our guitarist but try 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.640
 so found his pieces even though it's 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.720
 all stupid it's just for arif where you 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.790
 actually going to see it was something that 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.660
 motivates and so that makes you want to 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.040
 take the guitar and bumps and so 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.190
 also to motivate myself so I come back 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.310
 I spoke at the beginning so my group 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.630

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.290
 it will motivate you because in fact there is 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.900

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.850

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.920
 Why 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.190

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.780
 stuff to work on plus I offer you a 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.870
 training right now with your 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.740
 information that for 2.0 to your 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.320
 first chord grid okay 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.460
 to take back all the bases 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.050
 in this group nothing seems common by 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.510
 the gifts of rhythmic sing in 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.600
 playing guitar solos can be 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.950
 even a little composition 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.410
 why not extracts from pieces or 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.420
 riffs you'll find everything 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.470
 that in my private group and so like 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.320
 I explain it as I launch it 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.450
 I give you access for only 2 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.350
 euros so that's just for the 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.870
 technical fees and so you go 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.460
 have access to that for a month for 2 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.410
 euros after you are free from you 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.350
 unsubscribe when you want there is 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.180
 no problem for that so take advantage of it 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.370
 will not last forever because he 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.310
 there are just fifty places once 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.500
 the 50 places are taken 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.299
 I close the access for a while 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.459
 and I open their act after them but by 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.890

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.030
