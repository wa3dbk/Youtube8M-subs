here<00:00:01.500> is<00:00:01.770> another<00:00:02.129> skin<00:00:02.879> tumor<00:00:05.180> notice<00:00:06.180> most

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
here is another skin tumor notice most

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.750 
here is another skin tumor notice most
of<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.319> dermis<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:08.010> normal

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
of the dermis is normal

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.020 
of the dermis is normal
notice<00:00:09.750> in<00:00:09.960> many<00:00:10.469> parts<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:10.950> epidermis<00:00:11.759> looks

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
notice in many parts the epidermis looks

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.810 
notice in many parts the epidermis looks
pretty<00:00:12.300> normal<00:00:12.809> as<00:00:12.960> well<00:00:13.190> notice<00:00:14.190> here's<00:00:14.759> a

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
pretty normal as well notice here's a

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.180 
pretty normal as well notice here's a
skin<00:00:15.179> appendage<00:00:15.690> which<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> sebaceous

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
skin appendage which is a sebaceous

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.420 
skin appendage which is a sebaceous
gland<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:18.240> hair<00:00:18.449> follicle<00:00:18.890> notice<00:00:19.890> here's

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
gland and a hair follicle notice here's

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.750 
gland and a hair follicle notice here's
a<00:00:20.520> sweat<00:00:21.359> gland<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.050> probably<00:00:22.650> here<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.490> as

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
a sweat gland and probably here it is as

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.410 
a sweat gland and probably here it is as
well<00:00:24.439> the<00:00:25.439> one<00:00:25.650> thing<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.400> probably<00:00:27.060> do

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
well the one thing that I probably do

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.839 
well the one thing that I probably do
not<00:00:27.599> have<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:28.050> direct<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.859> your<00:00:29.010> attention<00:00:29.369> for

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
not have to direct to your attention for

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.870 
not have to direct to your attention for
noticing<00:00:30.390> however<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:32.189> fact<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.550> there

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
noticing however is the fact that there

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.870 
noticing however is the fact that there
is<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> very<00:00:33.780> dense<00:00:34.230> heavy<00:00:34.770> infiltrate<00:00:35.640> of

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
is a very dense heavy infiltrate of

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.500 
is a very dense heavy infiltrate of
these<00:00:36.180> lymphoid<00:00:36.690> looking<00:00:37.200> cells<00:00:38.120> in<00:00:39.120> the

these lymphoid looking cells in the
superficial<00:00:40.850> reticular<00:00:41.850> dermis<00:00:42.290> perhaps

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
extending a little bit into the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.930 
extending a little bit into the
papillary<00:00:45.750> dermis<00:00:46.010> but<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.190> many<00:00:47.370> areas<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
papillary dermis look spared notice

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.660 
papillary dermis look spared notice
however<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.570> these<00:00:52.350> same<00:00:52.710> types<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.340> cells

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
however that these same types of cells

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.930 
however that these same types of cells
look<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.210> they<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:54.780> involving<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.959 

epidermis<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.120> well<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:01.280> terms<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.489> causing

epidermis as well in terms of causing

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.679 
epidermis as well in terms of causing
these<00:01:03.180> little<00:01:03.710> abscesses<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:06.030> use<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
these little abscesses and I use the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.350 
these little abscesses and I use the
word<00:01:06.720> abscess<00:01:07.530> loosely<00:01:08.100> because<00:01:08.369> abscess<00:01:09.180> is

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
word abscess loosely because abscess is

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.020 
word abscess loosely because abscess is
usually<00:01:09.869> are<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:12.950> neutrophils<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.790> case

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
usually are of neutrophils in this case

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.480 
usually are of neutrophils in this case
these<00:01:15.540> little<00:01:15.869> collections<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.650> inflammatory

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
these little collections of inflammatory

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.300 
these little collections of inflammatory
cells<00:01:18.229> infiltrating<00:01:19.229> into<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> dermis<00:01:19.830> are

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
cells infiltrating into the dermis are

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.090 
cells infiltrating into the dermis are
lymphocytes<00:01:20.759> which<00:01:21.360> they<00:01:22.049> shouldn't<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
lymphocytes which they shouldn't do and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.100 
lymphocytes which they shouldn't do and
for<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.939> reason<00:01:24.470> this<00:01:25.470> makes<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.950> malignant

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
for that reason this makes it malignant

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.990 
for that reason this makes it malignant
notice<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.350> there's<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.829> little<00:01:29.159> abscess

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
notice that there's a little abscess

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.760 
notice that there's a little abscess
there<00:01:30.299> there's<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.810> little<00:01:30.990> abscess<00:01:31.530> there

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
there there's a little abscess there

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.260 
there there's a little abscess there
there's<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.159> little<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.579> there<00:01:32.850> there's<00:01:33.180> a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
there's a little one there there's a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.510 
there's a little one there there's a
little<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.689> there<00:01:34.100> notice<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.490> some

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
little one there notice that in some

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.910 
little one there notice that in some
cases<00:01:36.180> these<00:01:36.360> lymphocytes<00:01:37.020> infiltrate<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
cases these lymphocytes infiltrate the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.140 
cases these lymphocytes infiltrate the
epidermis<00:01:38.640> singly<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.720> well<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.790> will<00:01:41.790> admit

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
epidermis singly as well I will admit

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.280 
epidermis singly as well I will admit
that<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.229> lymphocytes<00:01:44.040> themselves<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:45.290> first

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
that the lymphocytes themselves on first

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.800 
that the lymphocytes themselves on first
glance<00:01:46.640> look<00:01:47.640> kinda<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.360> normal

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
glance look kinda like normal

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.410 
glance look kinda like normal
lymphocytes<00:01:49.409> if<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.310> look<00:01:50.520> closer<00:01:50.820> however

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
lymphocytes if you look closer however

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.319 
lymphocytes if you look closer however
at<00:01:51.780> our<00:01:52.049> highest<00:01:52.259> power<00:01:52.710> here<00:01:53.030> some<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.210> them

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
at our highest power here some of them

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.510 
at our highest power here some of them
look<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.689> little<00:01:54.899> dark

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
look a little dark

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.630 
look a little dark
bumpy<00:01:56.689> larger<00:01:57.689> bent<00:01:58.290> these<00:01:58.860> are<00:01:59.070> really<00:01:59.430> not

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
bumpy larger bent these are really not

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.810 
bumpy larger bent these are really not
quite<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.149> normal<00:02:00.659> lymphocytes<00:02:01.820> although

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
quite that normal lymphocytes although

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.469 
quite that normal lymphocytes although
I'll<00:02:02.969> admit<00:02:03.320> they<00:02:04.320> don't<00:02:04.500> look<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.890> horrible

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
I'll admit they don't look that horrible

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.089 
I'll admit they don't look that horrible
but<00:02:06.479> they<00:02:06.600> are<00:02:06.719> behaving<00:02:06.899> horribly<00:02:07.740> they

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
but they are behaving horribly they

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.130 
but they are behaving horribly they
shouldn't<00:02:08.459> be<00:02:08.550> infiltrating<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> epidermis

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
shouldn't be infiltrating the epidermis

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.780 
shouldn't be infiltrating the epidermis
so<00:02:10.289> if<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.560> suspected<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.550> was<00:02:11.760> a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
so if you suspected that this was a

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.760 
so if you suspected that this was a
lymphocytic<00:02:12.480> lymphoma

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
lymphocytic lymphoma

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.830

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
the epidermis you were right and because

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.100

misnomer<00:02:36.220> because<00:02:37.150> it's<00:02:37.390> not<00:02:37.630> mycosis<00:02:38.410> at<00:02:38.590> all

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
misnomer because it's not mycosis at all

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.040 
misnomer because it's not mycosis at all
it's<00:02:39.010> not<00:02:39.100> fungal<00:02:39.730> at<00:02:39.880> all<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.550> cutaneous

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
it's not fungal at all it is a cutaneous

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:50.090 
it's not fungal at all it is a cutaneous
t-cell<00:02:45.150> lymphoma<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:47.320> skin<00:02:47.910> primary

t-cell lymphoma of the skin primary
let's<00:02:51.100> back<00:02:51.370> off<00:02:51.610> a<00:02:51.670> little<00:02:51.940> bit<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.360> see<00:02:52.600> if

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
let's back off a little bit and see if

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.910 
let's back off a little bit and see if
the<00:02:52.870> margins<00:02:53.350> are<00:02:53.590> involved<00:02:55.470> well<00:02:56.470> if<00:02:56.739> this

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
the margins are involved well if this

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.890 
the margins are involved well if this
indeed<00:02:57.489> was<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:59.370> exact<00:03:00.370> surgical<00:03:01.180> margin<00:03:01.690> it

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
indeed was the exact surgical margin it

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.220 
indeed was the exact surgical margin it
looks<00:03:02.170> like<00:03:02.380> it<00:03:02.530> is<00:03:02.680> involved<00:03:03.310> if<00:03:04.060> this<00:03:04.780> indeed

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
looks like it is involved if this indeed

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.050 
looks like it is involved if this indeed
was<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.500> surgical<00:03:06.160> margin<00:03:06.580> of<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.910> other

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
was the surgical margin of the other

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.390 
was the surgical margin of the other
specimen<00:03:07.810> it<00:03:07.930> looks<00:03:08.140> like<00:03:08.350> it's<00:03:08.650> involved<00:03:09.040> as

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
specimen it looks like it's involved as

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.970 
specimen it looks like it's involved as
well<00:03:09.870> but<00:03:10.870> let's<00:03:11.050> take<00:03:11.200> another<00:03:11.530> little<00:03:11.770> look

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
well but let's take another little look

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.370 
well but let's take another little look
at<00:03:12.220> these<00:03:12.459> cells<00:03:12.760> up<00:03:13.390> here<00:03:13.450> they<00:03:14.050> look<00:03:14.260> like

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
at these cells up here they look like

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.990 
at these cells up here they look like
they're<00:03:14.560> kind<00:03:14.770> of<00:03:14.860> sparing<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.489> papillary

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
they're kind of sparing the papillary

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.390 
they're kind of sparing the papillary
dermis<00:03:16.150> here's<00:03:17.020> a<00:03:17.110> little<00:03:17.410> micro<00:03:17.830> abscess

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
dermis here's a little micro abscess

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.090 
dermis here's a little micro abscess
within<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.940> epidermis<00:03:19.630> here<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.590> cells<00:03:20.860> are

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
within the epidermis here the cells are

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.330 
within the epidermis here the cells are
surrounding<00:03:21.730> some<00:03:21.970> blood<00:03:22.239> vessels<00:03:23.190> here<00:03:24.190> are

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
surrounding some blood vessels here are

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.759 
surrounding some blood vessels here are
the<00:03:24.549> cells<00:03:24.959> causing<00:03:25.959> these<00:03:26.080> little<00:03:26.380> micro

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
the cells causing these little micro

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:34.289 
the cells causing these little micro
abscesses<00:03:27.400> again<00:03:29.430> here<00:03:30.430> it's<00:03:30.610> worse<00:03:33.299> looks

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
abscesses again here it's worse looks

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.570 
abscesses again here it's worse looks
like<00:03:34.510> they're<00:03:34.720> kind<00:03:34.930> of<00:03:35.019> spared<00:03:35.500> this<00:03:35.890> little

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
like they're kind of spared this little

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.640 
like they're kind of spared this little
gland<00:03:37.390> here<00:03:37.720> looks<00:03:38.620> like<00:03:38.709> they<00:03:39.010> don't

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
gland here looks like they don't

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.800 
gland here looks like they don't
infiltrate<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.890> hair<00:03:42.220> follicle<00:03:42.850> per<00:03:43.120> se<00:03:43.450> but

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
infiltrate the hair follicle per se but

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.470 
infiltrate the hair follicle per se but
if<00:03:43.959> you<00:03:44.110> notice<00:03:44.350> where<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.549> follicle<00:03:46.090> opens

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
if you notice where the follicle opens

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.229 
if you notice where the follicle opens
up<00:03:46.720> into<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.380> superficial<00:03:48.340> or<00:03:48.760> surface

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
up into the superficial or surface

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.620 
up into the superficial or surface
epidermis<00:03:49.989> we<00:03:50.620> have<00:03:50.830> some<00:03:51.630> malignant

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
epidermis we have some malignant

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:00.240 
epidermis we have some malignant
lymphocytes<00:03:53.410> involving<00:03:54.070> that<00:03:54.280> as<00:03:54.519> well

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.790 

so<00:04:00.990> mycosis<00:04:01.990> fungoides<00:04:02.020> is<00:04:03.010> another<00:04:03.520> name<00:04:03.850> for

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
so mycosis fungoides is another name for

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.150 
so mycosis fungoides is another name for
primary<00:04:05.800> cutaneous<00:04:06.490> t-cell<00:04:07.620> lymphoma<00:04:08.620> thank
