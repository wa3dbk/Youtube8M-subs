00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:11.019
 public radial pulls out already they would get exceeded measure assists that their 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.990
 statistics to the rows of a series of questions that are already putting 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.990
 bravos how is this the story of a public accountant 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:24.119
 and very well not percent lobesia undertake and some doubt but my age 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.439
 and end up being more like you can 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.839
 easier pilot 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.710
 reality they have not progressed to call of zone and until each scene for each 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.369
 entity 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.920
 in the living room how is how to dress the race 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.550
 for me it's good 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.530
 I think that there is a lot of market 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.810
 dennis in my career my profession at hand 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.030
 oo currently demand work 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.480
 tell yourself 2 also michael j related to the race that is improvising 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.469
 if really back around there was for a company an area but there 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.340
 Anyone who has an independent job is working 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:02.559
 need to have 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.320
 consult with an accountant 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.320
 I believe that yes percent use 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.650
 the condor encompasses help end with much affection not only 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.710
 of what is done in number with the accountant of um as you well said 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.430
 rossi to the tax part and other things advice or many things I say 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.900
 work in 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.810
 that in conjunction with another professional from another career 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.140
 sometimes we are not talking to end many companies all this is due 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.740
 what are they? 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.140
 the option and the opportunity became a 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.340
 if you talk to me about what is the different option 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.960
 i 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.649
 the sahara of what is different in a positive aspect that can 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.060
 the by the fact that 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.710
 the nominal each 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.090
 it was an alternative 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.650
 the in did not know the market 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.590
 and that he enjoys a lot as much student will look a lot 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.390
 a student came to him from luxury where 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.960
 and it is that the benefits are very much at the time of 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.940
 - it would be a lot to see which each percent layoff and insert a dinner 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.759
 blunt 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.149
 in the challenge of tavo studying the subject taxes 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:17.369
 but the professor that the president ddd cathedral that if relative malaria does not 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:21.439
 He took advantage of the space to greet her very cordially and 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.720
 in the arc of sessa 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.089
 the bar of the fach was the pink house 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.089
 dollarie are not lying but the pain 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.719
 they took advantage of it is what yes well and have to tell one of the chivas

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.789
 being there that does not decide to do what adeces 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:42.119
 very little we have the opportunity to study and when you have, you have to 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:46.670
 take advantage of it and good father joys that take advantage of aena to study

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.499
 very difficult 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:53.559
 studying and working is very good because it is still related to the career with more 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:54.409
 reason 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:55.769
 so 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.409

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.569
 give it forward very positive 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:01.659

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:02.849

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.900
 that everything is working makes it much easier when you are not studying 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.880
