00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.850
 I could say no to between the waltz and the goya also more air 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.780
 the contemporary

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.949
 on how to say it following 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.499
 of the French mixed with 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.279

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.439
 modesty first of all 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.379
 apart from the elegance that announces 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.919
 one of the things is that after percent 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:56.259

 It really is a pride for the people of Arteaga to have the contralto of Arteaga 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.829
