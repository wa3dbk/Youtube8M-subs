00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.250
 and him apart back we have 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.810
 our pbi worried us 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.359
 we want to represent 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.050

 agreement as is the case 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.910
 if you notice we have the mode activated 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.050
 because we have a liver government 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.020
 very easy we did not want to have those messages that there is not always us 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.670
 activate the airplane mode and we have worked as if it were an ipad wi-fi 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.140
