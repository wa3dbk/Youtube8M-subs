 already want many fine restaurants and 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:13.230
 elegant and pretentious and expensive to match 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.299
 the taste of popular food that is 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.400
 pure mexican pride and good though 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.470
 This is a local and not a place of origin 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.480
 callejero rescues popular dishes from 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.099
 aguascalientes cove and oaxaca with 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.099
 some zealand turn 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.650
 Y 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.270
 cove is a city famous for its 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.520
 gastronomy to street origin brought 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.430
 saucers like the octopus crush the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.680
 manta ray or shrimp to the 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.230
 which is served in tortilla tacos 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.850
 corn as part of their adaptation to 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.949
 Mexico City 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.370
 what is the concept of street origin 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:57.220
 is a place dedicated to the products of 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.010
 Mexican origin and in this case it 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.129
 he opted for street food and good 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.330
 we focus on three places not oaxaca 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.010
 cove and aguascalientes 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.450
 of those places have a lot of food 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.390
 street and very representative 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.860
 in particular, cove and oaxaca because 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.920
 two of the partners are closely linked 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:22.170
 with that city on the coast for wine and 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.700
 gustavo with mezcal in oaxaca no and 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.110
 they are very much related to both 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.420
 the two drinks as with the two 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.490
 cities 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.189
 of Aguascalientes we have as 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.180
 protagonist to the piglet that is served in 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.729
 tacos or in cake the preparation is very 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.040
 special and from oaxaca an extraordinary 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.009
 guacamole sprinkled with grasshoppers 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.960
 besides the famous ideal helps 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.960
 to share because they are huge 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.230
 the famous winemaker hugo d'acosta is a partner 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.570
 and has a line of wines especially 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.450
 designed for street origin a 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.850
 very accessible prices 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.940
 we have dark bottled beer and 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.920
 clear the mezcal is this is a sprat 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.440
 100% of oaxaca from a community that 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.750
 call san juan del rio and we have the other 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.820

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.880
 q brown and we also have the potions 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.500

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.750
 mixtures of grapes does not tell us that grape 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.670
 strike but some very very very videos 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.020
 light very easy to drink and very 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.180
 funny 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.280
 the big window of street origin is 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.900
 a local established and is not in the 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.520
 street is that good besides you're 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.800
 much more comfortable and you can do 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.440
 you can accompany your food 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.160
 with artisanal drinks that marry very 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.160
 very well
