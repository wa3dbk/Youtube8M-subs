make your three doc a 2d Doc a lot of
non<00:00:08.220> Mac<00:00:08.550> users<00:00:09.000> at<00:00:09.210> least<00:00:09.800> they<00:00:10.800> primarily

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
non Mac users at least they primarily

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.999 
non Mac users at least they primarily
have<00:00:11.940> told<00:00:12.179> me<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.960> know<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.380> 2d<00:00:13.650> doc<00:00:13.830> is

have told me that you know the 2d doc is

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.090 
have told me that you know the 2d doc is
stupid<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.849> doesn't<00:00:15.179> look<00:00:15.269> cool<00:00:16.100> that's

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
stupid and it doesn't look cool that's

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.099 
stupid and it doesn't look cool that's
personally<00:00:17.699> my<00:00:17.850> my<00:00:18.300> preference<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.840> like

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
personally my my preference that I like

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.179 
personally my my preference that I like
it<00:00:19.350> because<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.939> know<00:00:21.090> when<00:00:21.800> you<00:00:22.800> don't<00:00:22.980> have

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
it because you know when you don't have

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.310 
it because you know when you don't have
a<00:00:23.250> Mac<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:23.850> see<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.180> 3d<00:00:24.539> doc<00:00:24.869> it's

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.349 
a Mac and you see this 3d doc it's
something<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.830> really<00:00:26.099> isn't<00:00:26.310> offered<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:27.060> a
