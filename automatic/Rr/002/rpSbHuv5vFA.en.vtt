that I add was T's a Fresnel lens this

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.849 
that I add was T's a Fresnel lens this
is<00:00:21.150> nothing<00:00:21.510> more<00:00:21.660> than<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.869> giant<00:00:21.900> magnifying

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
is nothing more than a giant magnifying

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.340 
is nothing more than a giant magnifying
glass<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.760> can<00:00:23.910> focus<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.480> sun's<00:00:24.720> energy<00:00:24.900> into

glass it can focus the sun's energy into

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.859 
glass it can focus the sun's energy into
a<00:00:25.470> single<00:00:25.830> spot<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.220> more<00:00:26.430> than<00:00:26.609> 2,000<00:00:27.480> degrees

didn't<00:00:28.859> quite<00:00:28.949> cook<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.400> egg<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.730> more

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
didn't quite cook the egg and more

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.550 
didn't quite cook the egg and more
instantly<00:00:30.480> charred<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.900> hole<00:00:31.080> straight

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
instantly charred a hole straight

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.180 
instantly charred a hole straight
through<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:33.290> next<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.500> wanted<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.860> see<00:00:34.980> if<00:00:35.070> I

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
through it next I wanted to see if I

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.060 
through it next I wanted to see if I
could<00:00:35.370> fry<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.610> egg<00:00:35.880> with<00:00:36.059> high<00:00:36.239> voltage<00:00:36.450> I

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
could fry the egg with high voltage I

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.650 
could fry the egg with high voltage I
use<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.250> microwave<00:00:38.610> oven<00:00:38.969> transformer<00:00:39.510> to

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
use this microwave oven transformer to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.959 
use this microwave oven transformer to
apply<00:00:39.870> over<00:00:40.170> 3000<00:00:41.070> volts<00:00:41.250> straight<00:00:41.730> through

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
apply over 3000 volts straight through

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.790 
apply over 3000 volts straight through
the<00:00:42.090> center<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.600> egg<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:43.020> thought<00:00:43.649> this

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the center of the egg I thought this

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.290 
the center of the egg I thought this
would<00:00:44.010> definitely<00:00:44.250> be<00:00:44.520> enough<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.940> cook<00:00:45.090> it

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
would definitely be enough to cook it

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.470 
would definitely be enough to cook it
instead<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.649> egg<00:00:46.850> almost<00:00:47.850> well<00:00:48.030> instantly

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
instead the egg almost well instantly

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.439 
instead the egg almost well instantly
blew<00:00:48.690> up<00:00:48.840> shattered

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.459 

alright<00:00:56.449> next<00:00:56.780> I<00:00:56.960> tried<00:00:57.019> to<00:00:57.320> use<00:00:57.440> the

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
alright next I tried to use the

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:58.959 
alright next I tried to use the
extremely<00:00:58.129> high<00:00:58.280> temperature<00:00:58.760> plasma

these eggs a lot with the flamethrower I

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.210 
these eggs a lot with the flamethrower I
don't<00:01:33.289> see<00:01:33.409> how<00:01:33.500> anything<00:01:33.799> could<00:01:34.069> survive

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
don't see how anything could survive

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.990 
don't see how anything could survive
that<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:34.759> for<00:01:34.940> now<00:01:39.280> it<00:01:40.280> couldn't<00:01:40.700> believe

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
that and for now it couldn't believe

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.789 
that and for now it couldn't believe
that<00:01:41.030> not<00:01:41.330> even<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.690> flamethrower<00:01:42.049> would<00:01:42.530> cook

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
that not even a flamethrower would cook

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.010 
that not even a flamethrower would cook
these<00:01:43.220> eggs<00:01:43.429> well<00:01:44.179> I<00:01:44.390> had<00:01:44.539> a<00:01:44.569> couple<00:01:44.780> more

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
these eggs well I had a couple more

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.639 
these eggs well I had a couple more
tricks<00:01:45.200> up<00:01:45.409> my<00:01:45.440> sleeve<00:01:47.080> next<00:01:48.080> I<00:01:48.170> use<00:01:48.289> the<00:01:48.440> same

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
tricks up my sleeve next I use the same

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.740 
tricks up my sleeve next I use the same
microwave<00:01:49.190> oven<00:01:49.459> transformer<00:01:50.149> but<00:01:50.299> I<00:01:50.330> rewound

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
microwave oven transformer but I rewound

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.840 
microwave oven transformer but I rewound
it<00:01:50.929> for<00:01:51.140> high-current<00:01:51.399> this<00:01:52.399> works<00:01:52.640> off<00:01:52.819> the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
it for high-current this works off the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.240 
it for high-current this works off the
same<00:01:53.149> principle<00:01:53.659> as<00:01:53.780> your<00:01:53.929> toaster<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.560> forces

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
same principle as your toaster it forces

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.889 
same principle as your toaster it forces
an<00:01:55.310> extremely<00:01:55.909> high<00:01:56.090> amount<00:01:56.119> of<00:01:56.539> current

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
an extremely high amount of current

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.960 
an extremely high amount of current
through<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.289> small<00:01:57.619> wire<00:01:57.860> turning<00:01:58.519> a<00:01:58.580> red-hot

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
through a small wire turning a red-hot

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.869 
through a small wire turning a red-hot
and<00:01:59.149> generating<00:01:59.660> Heat<00:02:00.220> now<00:02:01.220> I<00:02:01.250> put<00:02:01.519> this<00:02:01.700> wire

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:01.879 
and generating Heat now I put this wire

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:02.979 
and generating Heat now I put this wire
through<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.209> center<00:02:02.509> of<00:02:02.599> an<00:02:02.690> egg<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:02.840> I

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989 
through the center of an egg and I

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.710 
through the center of an egg and I
plugged<00:02:03.289> it<00:02:03.470> in<00:02:04.179> hoping<00:02:05.179> to<00:02:05.300> cook<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.599> egg

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
plugged it in hoping to cook the egg

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.699 
plugged it in hoping to cook the egg
from<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:05.959> inside<00:02:06.349> out

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.540 

unfortunately<00:02:09.709> I<00:02:09.890> would<00:02:10.160> call<00:02:10.369> this<00:02:10.489> a

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
unfortunately I would call this a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.430 
unfortunately I would call this a
failure<00:02:10.910> because<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.540> egg<00:02:11.660> boiled<00:02:12.019> out<00:02:12.319> of

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
failure because the egg boiled out of

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.619 
failure because the egg boiled out of
the<00:02:12.560> two<00:02:12.709> holes<00:02:12.950> I<00:02:13.099> put<00:02:13.340> in<00:02:13.459> it<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.819> it<00:02:14.480> only

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
the two holes I put in it and it only

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.690 
the two holes I put in it and it only
cooked<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.470> small<00:02:16.010> channel<00:02:16.459> through<00:02:16.670> the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
cooked a small channel through the

cooked a small channel through the
center<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.269> egg<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.690> smell<00:02:18.379> was

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
center of the egg and the smell was

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.110 
center of the egg and the smell was
terrible<00:02:21.220> alright<00:02:22.220> next<00:02:22.400> on<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.760> list<00:02:22.879> is

terrible alright next on the list is
hydrochloric<00:02:23.840> acid<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.440> this<00:02:24.890> acid<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:25.400> so

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
hydrochloric acid and this acid is so

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.270 
hydrochloric acid and this acid is so
