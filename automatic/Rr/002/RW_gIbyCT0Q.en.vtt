 that I make a drawing I repeat to you 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.460
 tell me I already prefer a lot 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:33.380
 more realistic galls also like 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:34.940
 animal cars and all that kind of 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.649
 drawing drawings in perspective also 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.250
 I explain to you how to draw in 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.250
 perspective 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.719
 k 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.530
 if you find these tags pretty you 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:24.269
 can say it in the comments and 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.200
 loose a little I like it's a pleasure 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.730
 and if you do not like you have far 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.420
 to be at I do not like they are not there for 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.030
 they are useless I would like 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.459
 that you tell me why you did not 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.579
 not liked in the comments in 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.569
 trying to be as nice as possible 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.180
 because I had the experience of 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.400
 comments not very nice and that makes 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.709
 never pleasure 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.049
 tell me it's not nice but said said 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.040
 why it's not beautiful because because 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.220
 that I seem to be people who say 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:01.409
 it is not nice you suck while I 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.189
 think they're not even better by 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.560
 against if you find that it's not 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:07.319
 beautiful and you good reasons I 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.319
 accept them totally if you intend 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.489
 better than me too and ben give me 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.489
 advice in comments 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.640
 the 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.220
 then I'm going to make tea 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.280
 him 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:26.030
 v who together a heart a lot w 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.280
 I wx wx 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.590
 so here are the tables really are not 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:05:07.070
 complicated the product offered to be more 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:05:07.070
 complicated is the z 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:26.280
 here is the alphabet but now I 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:28.740
 I'm going to color go to everything and that's my 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.389
 alphabet and colored then there I did 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.750
 multicolored but if you write your 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.240
 first name 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.449
 it's often pretty to make two 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.759
 colors you alternate a reading 2 he 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.810
 are the red and the black that go well 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:42.719
 together but black it's a little too much 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.270
 dark and its hiding what you do 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:46.949
 otherwise there is green the yellow too so 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:51.360
 Here it was Charlie played I'm doing 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:54.409
 a little special drawing here before 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.409
 you ciao
