Vancouver<00:00:45.489> British<00:00:45.940> Columbia<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.910> main

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
Vancouver British Columbia the main

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.119 
Vancouver British Columbia the main
ideas<00:00:49.660> for<00:00:49.960> this<00:00:50.079> board<00:00:50.350> was<00:00:50.559> just<00:00:50.860> to<00:00:50.980> make

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
ideas for this board was just to make

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.880 
ideas for this board was just to make
something<00:00:51.449> simple<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:53.879> effective<00:00:54.879> and<00:00:55.890> it

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
something simple but effective and it

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.950 
something simple but effective and it
just<00:00:57.100> worked<00:00:57.309> really<00:00:57.550> well<00:00:57.670> so<00:00:58.210> when<00:00:58.750> we<00:00:58.900> were

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
just worked really well so when we were

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.930 
just worked really well so when we were
we<00:00:59.230> were<00:00:59.320> doing<00:00:59.530> this<00:00:59.650> board<00:00:59.980> we<00:01:00.309> started

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
we were doing this board we started

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.569 
we were doing this board we started
prototyping<00:01:01.540> it<00:01:01.720> three<00:01:02.379> four<00:01:02.739> boards<00:01:03.339> later

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
prototyping it three four boards later

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.359 
prototyping it three four boards later
we<00:01:03.820> finally<00:01:04.089> got<00:01:04.390> it<00:01:04.540> on<00:01:04.629> clock<00:01:04.839> and<00:01:05.140> we<00:01:06.070> really

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
we finally got it on clock and we really

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.370 
we finally got it on clock and we really
we<00:01:06.850> kept<00:01:07.090> it<00:01:07.240> fairly<00:01:07.450> simple<00:01:07.900> but<00:01:08.020> at<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.229> same

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
we kept it fairly simple but at the same

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.670 
we kept it fairly simple but at the same
time<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:09.729> got<00:01:10.240> everything<00:01:10.720> we<00:01:10.840> wanted<00:01:11.170> into<00:01:11.560> it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
time we got everything we wanted into it

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.800 
time we got everything we wanted into it
we<00:01:12.340> really<00:01:12.640> actually<00:01:13.300> took<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.539> lot<00:01:13.750> of

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
we really actually took a lot of

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.120 
we really actually took a lot of
features<00:01:14.140> from<00:01:14.259> other<00:01:14.440> boards<00:01:14.800> I've<00:01:14.950> ridden

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
features from other boards I've ridden

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.120 
features from other boards I've ridden
in<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.399> past<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:16.560> made<00:01:17.560> something<00:01:17.800> that<00:01:18.070> is

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
in the past and made something that is

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.800 
in the past and made something that is
just<00:01:18.220> easy<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.700> ride<00:01:18.880> it<00:01:19.090> it<00:01:19.330> lets<00:01:19.660> you<00:01:19.780> know

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
just easy to ride it it lets you know

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.420 
just easy to ride it it lets you know
where<00:01:20.110> your<00:01:20.259> feet<00:01:20.470> are<00:01:20.619> while<00:01:21.070> you're<00:01:21.250> riding

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
where your feet are while you're riding

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.830 
where your feet are while you're riding
it<00:01:21.759> so<00:01:21.910> you<00:01:21.970> don't<00:01:22.119> really<00:01:22.300> have<00:01:22.479> to<00:01:22.630> worry

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
it so you don't really have to worry

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.630 
it so you don't really have to worry
about<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.590> board<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:24.070> you<00:01:24.130> can<00:01:24.250> just<00:01:24.460> more

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
about the board and you can just more

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.480 
about the board and you can just more
worried<00:01:24.850> about<00:01:24.940> yourself<00:01:25.810> riding<00:01:26.679> it<00:01:27.009> main

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
worried about yourself riding it main

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.100 
worried about yourself riding it main
features<00:01:27.910> of<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.119> board<00:01:28.330> is<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.570> major

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
features of the board is the major

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.320 
features of the board is the major
rocker<00:01:29.560> it<00:01:29.830> has<00:01:29.979> but<00:01:30.369> where<00:01:30.520> your<00:01:30.700> trucks<00:01:30.970> sit

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
rocker it has but where your trucks sit

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.999 
rocker it has but where your trucks sit
it's<00:01:31.539> completely<00:01:32.050> flat<00:01:32.289> so<00:01:32.530> you<00:01:32.560> won't<00:01:32.800> lose

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
it's completely flat so you won't lose

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.830 
it's completely flat so you won't lose
your<00:01:33.039> angles<00:01:33.580> on<00:01:33.820> your<00:01:33.940> trucks<00:01:34.210> what<00:01:34.690> that

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
your angles on your trucks what that

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.419 
your angles on your trucks what that
really<00:01:34.960> does<00:01:35.050> is<00:01:35.320> keep<00:01:35.500> your<00:01:35.619> feet<00:01:35.890> planted

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
really does is keep your feet planted

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.919 
really does is keep your feet planted
when<00:01:37.030> you're<00:01:37.149> doing<00:01:37.360> when<00:01:37.539> you're<00:01:37.660> just

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
when you're doing when you're just

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.290 
when you're doing when you're just
talking<00:01:38.470> or<00:01:38.979> battle<00:01:39.369> stand<00:01:39.640> sitting<00:01:40.000> or<00:01:40.119> doing

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
talking or battle stand sitting or doing

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.940 
talking or battle stand sitting or doing
slides<00:01:40.570> really<00:01:41.170> keeps<00:01:41.470> them<00:01:41.590> in<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.800> right

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
slides really keeps them in the right

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.730 
slides really keeps them in the right
spot<00:01:42.310> then<00:01:42.909> we<00:01:43.030> took<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:43.450> radial<00:01:44.170> concave<00:01:44.590> and

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
spot then we took a radial concave and

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.080 
spot then we took a radial concave and
tweaked<00:01:45.040> them<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.310> bit<00:01:45.490> made<00:01:45.670> them<00:01:45.820> a<00:01:45.909> bit<00:01:46.060> more

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
tweaked them a bit made them a bit more

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.380 
tweaked them a bit made them a bit more
oval<00:01:46.600> eyes<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.790> really<00:01:48.970> keeps<00:01:49.240> the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
oval eyes and that really keeps the

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.060 
oval eyes and that really keeps the
front<00:01:49.570> of<00:01:49.689> your<00:01:49.750> feet<00:01:49.930> really<00:01:50.290> snugged<00:01:50.799> in

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
front of your feet really snugged in

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.580 
front of your feet really snugged in
this<00:01:51.700> boards<00:01:51.970> more<00:01:52.150> for<00:01:52.390> just<00:01:52.659> bombing<00:01:53.200> hills

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
this boards more for just bombing hills

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.080 
this boards more for just bombing hills
and<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.979> lot<00:01:54.189> of<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.369> prototyping<00:01:54.790> that<00:01:54.880> went

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
and a lot of the prototyping that went

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.639 
and a lot of the prototyping that went
into<00:01:55.210> it<00:01:55.390> is<00:01:55.450> mostly<00:01:55.750> just<00:01:56.020> stand<00:01:56.229> up<00:01:56.350> slides

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
into it is mostly just stand up slides

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.010 
into it is mostly just stand up slides
and<00:01:57.009> switch<00:01:57.670> riding<00:01:57.939> and<00:01:58.390> that's<00:01:58.810> why<00:01:58.960> the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
and switch riding and that's why the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.600 
and switch riding and that's why the
mould<00:01:59.320> is<00:01:59.409> completely<00:01:59.890> symmetrical<00:02:00.369> so<00:02:00.549> it

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
mould is completely symmetrical so it

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.950 
mould is completely symmetrical so it
doesn't<00:02:00.880> matter<00:02:01.030> if<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:01.329> throw<00:02:01.540> it<00:02:01.630> down<00:02:01.750> one

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
doesn't matter if you throw it down one

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.270 
doesn't matter if you throw it down one
way<00:02:02.079> or<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.259> other<00:02:02.320> it's<00:02:02.649> gonna<00:02:02.770> be<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.070> same

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
way or the other it's gonna be the same

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.310 
way or the other it's gonna be the same
and<00:02:03.790> so<00:02:04.240> if<00:02:04.390> you're<00:02:04.540> riding<00:02:04.720> switch<00:02:05.110> or

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
and so if you're riding switch or

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.499 
and so if you're riding switch or
regular<00:02:05.680> or<00:02:05.950> goofy<00:02:06.009> or<00:02:06.579> regular<00:02:06.610> it's<00:02:07.360> gonna

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
regular or goofy or regular it's gonna

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.350 
regular or goofy or regular it's gonna
be<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:07.810> same<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.380> so<00:02:08.649> yeah<00:02:09.640> it's<00:02:09.790> it's<00:02:09.940> mostly

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
be the same and so yeah it's it's mostly

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.780 
be the same and so yeah it's it's mostly
just<00:02:10.570> for<00:02:10.690> going<00:02:10.810> fast<00:02:11.079> and<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:13.150> sliding<00:02:14.110> and

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
just for going fast and and sliding and

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.740 
just for going fast and and sliding and
downhill<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.610> board's<00:02:18.850> about<00:02:19.030> 38<00:02:19.450> inches

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
downhill so the board's about 38 inches

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.050 
downhill so the board's about 38 inches
long<00:02:20.049> and<00:02:20.350> then<00:02:20.799> it's<00:02:20.980> it's<00:02:21.340> 10<00:02:21.579> inches<00:02:21.730> wide

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
long and then it's it's 10 inches wide

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.900 
long and then it's it's 10 inches wide
right<00:02:22.360> where<00:02:22.540> your<00:02:22.690> feet<00:02:22.930> sit<00:02:23.610> then<00:02:24.610> it's<00:02:24.790> got
