00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Welcome to New York to ours 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.210
 universally hated rubric tops and flops 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.340
 Have a seat 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.360
 the comments on the shoe I started 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.300
 make the beginning 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.670
 this is the brz you eat 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.250
 performance concept and I already was 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.439
 totally cool on it as 200 ps in baz 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.820
 are not enough there must be more power 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.970
 now here is such a crazy 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.210
 cart with fat rear spoiler with super 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.519
 clad front and side skirts 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.500
 and a class interior beautiful 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.180
 there is so much in there 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.890
 I would like to have everything immediately and 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.649
 then someone from subaru arrives and says 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.300
 No, no, no, that's just a dream 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.950
 So there we do not do anything now 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.600
 That's what I should immediately flop my 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.840
 is still cool thinks if the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.840
 fair 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.390
 the mate of two of the means is yes 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.290
 Gray I wonder what's up 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.150
 to come up with 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.850
 there is a miracle underneath 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.460
 pretty mazda 2 is supposed to be in now 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.100
 this form here the young audience 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.480
 should appeal particularly dynamic 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.050
 that someone else is acting front 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.400
 but if you look at the tail then 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.340
 I wonder what happened there yes 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.850
 that's a mazda2 hatchback now 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.480
 Hatchback horny it's different my 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.480
 flight of the fair 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.890
 what you see here is pure 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.580
 world car the chevy malibu shines in 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.440
 new gloss 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.770
 with the thing here, chevrolet wanted the 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.220
 conquering the world in 2009 was theirs 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.510
 not so successful but now comes 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.810
 The thing here is still a top of the 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.360
 because here we see the new opel 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.800
 insignia becomes exactly on the platform 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.470
 the middle class the next europe 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.570
 offered and the malibu is also available 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.040
 as hybrid we speak 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.190
 probably soon an insignia 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.580
 hybrid with us means whether the fair chevy 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.560
 malibu 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.020
 we come to a flop here in new 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.420
 york this is not my job thats that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.040
 Course 30 that was already in Geneva 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.460
 I think Rattenscharf looks great 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.730
 out 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.950
 great design clear optics beautiful 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.810
 But now over there, what's up? 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.760
 go there 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.360
 look at this is the 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:14.220
 cow x50 straight in fresh face lift 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.280
 get, so to speak, the big brother of 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.540
 curiox 30 all vision helps 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.420
 do not polish 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.090
 The thing looks like one of the first 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.130
 crossover from the nineties completely 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.230
 many are kind of beading and kinking in front somehow 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.160
 So that does not fit all because I ask 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.010
 have me like what have they got 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.770
 designer thought for me facelift 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.770
 infiniti qx56 the flop of the fair 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.250
 Often we are criticized for that 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.569
 We do not choose cars 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.599
 and that's why I am 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.030
 Conscious as top of this fair for one 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:51.769
 base model decided and that of 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.409
 mclaren 570 his name is he and that is 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:58.290
 570 ps the front the family face that 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.680
 but one knows this tail is not that 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.310
 sexy 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.930
 I really want that and that 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.230
 most beautiful thing is he is in fact 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.180
 comparatively cheap at 160000 euro 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.579
 let's go here 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.530
 less you're gonna get no new cars was 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.150
 clear and it can not be me about 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.799
 imagine what strip in the commentary 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.659
 Im going to be going when I say that 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.159
 here is the flop of the fair for me 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.069
 personally no no not the women 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.569
 Of course, this car drives 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.129
 actually a few small issues with 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.569
 the paragraph in america and everything 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.720
 they can come up with this paragraph 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.819
 boost is a pink beetle plus two 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.280
 more special edition here around 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.590
 but are seriously more courage more 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.030
 creativity that's the land of svw you 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.530
 have a concept presented before two 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.269
 years where that is still not 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.629
 ready to go on the road so guys that 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.000
 car here 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.470
 it could not have been that or that 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.680
 But it was only from New York and me 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.680
 legend 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:55.229
 What the young man just wanted to say it 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:57.719
 rather the car likes it is for him 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.429
 top of this fair and I think is 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:01.619
 also on the champagne bottles 

00:04:59.429 --> 00:05:04.489
 otherwise, much of it will not 

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:04.489
 come and some things
