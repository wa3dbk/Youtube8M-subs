well<00:00:05.970> from<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.330> standpoint<00:00:07.049> of<00:00:07.410> offensively

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
well from the standpoint of offensively

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
first I was very glad to see that we

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.410 
first I was very glad to see that we
didn't<00:00:10.769> turn<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:10.950> ball<00:00:11.099> over<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:12.179> made<00:00:12.389> some

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
didn't turn the ball over we made some

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.270 
didn't turn the ball over we made some
big<00:00:12.780> plays<00:00:12.990> really<00:00:13.380> not<00:00:13.530> enough<00:00:13.769> but<00:00:13.980> at<00:00:14.130> least

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
big plays really not enough but at least

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.430 
big plays really not enough but at least
we<00:00:14.700> did<00:00:14.880> get<00:00:15.030> some<00:00:15.089> 20<00:00:15.450> yard<00:00:15.630> plays<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.350> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
we did get some 20 yard plays and the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.420 
we did get some 20 yard plays and the
course<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.859> day<00:00:17.010> through<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.279> couple

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
course of the day through a couple

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.939 
course of the day through a couple
touchdown<00:00:17.940> passes<00:00:18.210> some<00:00:18.570> long<00:00:18.750> runs<00:00:19.020> I

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
touchdown passes some long runs I

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.920 
touchdown passes some long runs I
thought<00:00:20.580> we<00:00:20.730> played<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.180> good<00:00:21.390> tempo<00:00:21.779> with

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
thought we played with good tempo with

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.390 
thought we played with good tempo with
times<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.350> quarterbacks<00:00:22.830> were<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> little<00:00:23.189> bit

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
times the quarterbacks were a little bit

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.160 
times the quarterbacks were a little bit
slow<00:00:23.670> with<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> line<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.240> scrimmage<00:00:24.330> doing

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
slow with the line of scrimmage doing

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.750 
slow with the line of scrimmage doing
too<00:00:25.320> much<00:00:25.439> thinking<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.130> then<00:00:26.220> we<00:00:26.369> would<00:00:26.519> kind

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
too much thinking and then we would kind

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.310 
too much thinking and then we would kind
of<00:00:26.820> pick<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.119> up<00:00:27.240> from<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.140> defensive

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
of pick it up from a defensive

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.490 
of pick it up from a defensive
standpoint<00:00:29.150> defensively<00:00:30.170> kept<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.289> ball<00:00:31.439> in

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
standpoint defensively kept the ball in

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.889 
standpoint defensively kept the ball in
front<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.980> us<00:00:32.130> for<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.460> most<00:00:32.669> part<00:00:32.910> they<00:00:33.690> let

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
front of us for the most part they let

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.110 
front of us for the most part they let
maybe<00:00:34.110> one<00:00:34.350> deep<00:00:34.559> ball<00:00:34.829> thrown<00:00:35.730> over<00:00:35.969> their

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
maybe one deep ball thrown over their

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.060 
maybe one deep ball thrown over their
heads<00:00:36.329> but<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:37.110> know<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.350> course<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.710> 90

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
heads but you know in the course of 90

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.450 
heads but you know in the course of 90
plays<00:00:38.280> that's<00:00:38.520> probably<00:00:39.270> not<00:00:39.450> bad<00:00:40.010> all<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.340> all

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
plays that's probably not bad all in all

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.100 
plays that's probably not bad all in all
I<00:00:41.489> thought<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.969> defense<00:00:42.390> played<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:42.930> good

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
I thought the defense played with good

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.200 
I thought the defense played with good
energy<00:00:43.140> good<00:00:43.500> pursuit<00:00:44.100> got<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> little<00:00:45.090> bit<00:00:45.180> a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
energy good pursuit got a little bit a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.970 
energy good pursuit got a little bit a
little<00:00:45.270> tired<00:00:45.930> at<00:00:46.110> times<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.559> then<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:46.800> come

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
little tired at times but then we come

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.819 
little tired at times but then we come
back<00:00:47.010> strong<00:00:48.079> those<00:00:49.079> plumbers<00:00:49.320> done<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> really

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
back strong those plumbers done a really

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.200 
back strong those plumbers done a really
good<00:00:50.039> job<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.280> these<00:00:50.579> guys<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.820> know<00:00:51.000> it's

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
good job with these guys you know it's

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.479 
good job with these guys you know it's
obviously<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.020> different<00:00:52.489> offensive

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
obviously it's a different offensive

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.910 
obviously it's a different offensive
style<00:00:53.730> than<00:00:54.030> they<00:00:54.120> had<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.510> past<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.110> think

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
style than they had in the past I think

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.319 
style than they had in the past I think
right<00:00:56.070> now<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> couple<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.090> guys<00:00:57.300> that

right now we have a couple of guys that

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.869 
right now we have a couple of guys that
are<00:00:57.750> veteran<00:00:58.710> guys<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.160> are<00:00:59.609> playing<00:00:59.789> very

year<00:01:23.280> well<00:01:23.490> he<00:01:23.759> saw<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.540> know<00:01:24.630> he<00:01:25.049> really

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
year well he saw you know he really

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.469 
year well he saw you know he really
doesn't<00:01:25.710> look<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.580> he<00:01:26.729> has<00:01:26.880> any<00:01:26.909> sort<00:01:27.360> of

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
doesn't look like he has any sort of

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.410 
doesn't look like he has any sort of
lingering<00:01:27.869> effects<00:01:28.290> from<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:29.000> he's<00:01:30.000> becoming

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
lingering effects from it he's becoming

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.960 
lingering effects from it he's becoming
a<00:01:30.900> better<00:01:31.409> pass<00:01:31.799> receiver<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.790> at<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
a better pass receiver I think at the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.420 
a better pass receiver I think at the
beginning<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.420> spring<00:01:33.509> ball<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.650> thought<00:01:35.280> his

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
beginning of spring ball I thought his

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.010 
beginning of spring ball I thought his
hands<00:01:35.670> needed<00:01:35.970> some<00:01:36.150> work<00:01:36.329> he's<00:01:36.570> becoming<00:01:36.900> a

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
hands needed some work he's becoming a

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.600 
hands needed some work he's becoming a
complete<00:01:37.380> guy<00:01:37.560> not<00:01:37.860> only<00:01:37.890> running<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.430> ball

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
complete guy not only running the ball

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.450 
complete guy not only running the ball
well<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.030> also<00:01:39.240> block<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:41.009> know<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> running

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
backs have to have to be pass blockers

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.289 
backs have to have to be pass blockers
you<00:01:43.619> know<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:43.890> don't<00:01:44.040> have<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.430> big<00:01:44.850> fullback<00:01:45.090> to
