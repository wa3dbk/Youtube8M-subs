fret the seventh written the g string so

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.310 
fret the seventh written the g string so
this<00:01:24.640> is<00:01:24.909> what's<00:01:25.090> like<00:01:25.630> so<00:01:25.810> far

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:41.249 

they<00:01:30.650> have<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:31.010> open<00:01:31.190> e<00:01:31.520> one<00:01:31.670> more<00:01:31.820> time

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
and SF red the D string and you slide it

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:36.860 
and SF red the D string and you slide it
back<00:02:25.180> down<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.569> third

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.230 

and<00:02:37.870> for<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.290> second<00:02:38.620> part<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.940> pretty

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
and for the second part it's pretty

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.750
