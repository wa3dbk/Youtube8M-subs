was<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.880> free<00:00:12.240> weekend<00:00:12.750> for<00:00:13.559> black<00:00:13.920> ops<00:00:14.190> 2<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:15.089> I

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
was a free weekend for black ops 2 so I

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.359 
was a free weekend for black ops 2 so I
decided<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.750> download<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:17.130> have

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
decided to download it and I have

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.640 
decided to download it and I have
downloaded<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:18.000> prior<00:00:18.480> but<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.500> wanted<00:00:19.830> to

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
downloaded this prior but I wanted to

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.109 
downloaded this prior but I wanted to
play<00:00:22.650> into<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> benchmark<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.670> time<00:00:23.910> around

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
play into a benchmark this time around

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.240 
play into a benchmark this time around
cuz<00:00:24.660> last<00:00:24.869> time<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.410> failed<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.800> do<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
cuz last time I failed to do that and I

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.310 
cuz last time I failed to do that and I
just<00:00:26.519> got<00:00:26.670> too<00:00:26.820> addicted<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.480> played<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.260> I

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
just got too addicted I played it I

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.660 
just got too addicted I played it I
played<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.800> played<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.550> never

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
played and I played it and I never

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.060 
played and I played it and I never
posted<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.420> benchmark<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.019> guys<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.710> I

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
posted a benchmark for you guys and I

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.850 
posted a benchmark for you guys and I
searched<00:00:32.340> all<00:00:32.550> over<00:00:32.579> YouTube<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:34.559> couldn't

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
searched all over YouTube and I couldn't

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.160 
searched all over YouTube and I couldn't
find<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.280> proper<00:00:35.850> benchmark<00:00:36.329> for<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.660> exact

resolution is 1280 by 720 720 and the
advanced<00:00:48.840> are<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:50.039> highest<00:00:50.340> they<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.610> go<00:00:50.760> -

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
advanced are the highest they can go -

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.779 
advanced are the highest they can go -
the<00:00:51.449> shadows<00:00:51.840> are<00:00:52.020> off<00:00:52.170> because<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:53.520> some<00:00:53.670> odd

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the shadows are off because for some odd

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.090 
the shadows are off because for some odd
reason<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.239> card<00:00:54.570> does<00:00:54.780> not<00:00:55.110> handle<00:00:55.620> shadows

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
reason this card does not handle shadows

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.970 
reason this card does not handle shadows
well<00:00:58.340> we<00:00:59.340> switch<00:00:59.609> teams

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
well we switch teams

mind<00:01:17.120> that<00:01:17.270> this<00:01:17.480> is<00:01:17.690> a<00:01:17.720> 512<00:01:19.390> megabyte<00:01:20.390> card<00:01:20.810> so

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
mind that this is a 512 megabyte card so

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.460 
mind that this is a 512 megabyte card so
it<00:01:22.970> is<00:01:23.090> not<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.390> best<00:01:23.540> performance<00:01:24.110> but<00:01:24.320> it's

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
it is not the best performance but it's

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.460 
it is not the best performance but it's
definitely<00:01:24.890> good<00:01:25.550> performance<00:01:26.150> for<00:01:26.540> 512

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.330 
so I think I've said enough
that<00:02:34.980> game<00:02:35.220> that's<00:02:35.520> anywhere<00:02:36.150> from<00:02:36.510> like

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
that game that's anywhere from like

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.980 
that game that's anywhere from like
ridiculous<00:02:38.340> amount<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.670> frames<00:02:38.970> like<00:02:39.210> 60<00:02:39.840> to

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
ridiculous amount of frames like 60 to

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.560 
ridiculous amount of frames like 60 to
like<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.440> think<00:02:40.860> it's<00:02:41.100> like<00:02:41.180> 240<00:02:42.180> or<00:02:42.210> something

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
like I think it's like 240 or something

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.920 
like I think it's like 240 or something
like<00:02:42.630> that

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
like that

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.770 
like that
I'm<00:02:43.560> coated<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.370> while<00:02:44.490> though<00:02:47.600> this<00:02:48.600> is

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
I'm coated in a while though this is

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.360 
I'm coated in a while though this is

kill<00:04:56.530> switch

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.530 

yeah<00:05:02.230> but<00:05:02.440> this<00:05:02.890> card<00:05:03.220> is<00:05:03.540> phenomenal

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
yeah but this card is phenomenal

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.770 
yeah but this card is phenomenal
performance<00:05:05.080> I'd<00:05:05.320> highly<00:05:05.860> recommend<00:05:05.890> this

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
performance I'd highly recommend this

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.680 
performance I'd highly recommend this
and<00:05:07.780> if<00:05:08.620> you<00:05:08.740> guys<00:05:08.860> don't<00:05:09.100> know<00:05:09.160> the<00:05:09.370> APU<00:05:09.850> with

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
and if you guys don't know the APU with

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.440 
and if you guys don't know the APU with
ap<00:05:10.990> use<00:05:11.170> the<00:05:11.350> GPU<00:05:11.680> and<00:05:11.950> if<00:05:12.310> you<00:05:12.460> are<00:05:12.820> in<00:05:13.090> one

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
ap use the GPU and if you are in one

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.350 
ap use the GPU and if you are in one
chip<00:05:13.720> so<00:05:14.050> you<00:05:14.770> get<00:05:14.920> a<00:05:15.130> bit<00:05:15.520> better<00:05:15.670> performance

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
chip so you get a bit better performance

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.500 
chip so you get a bit better performance
than<00:05:16.420> say<00:05:16.750> a<00:05:17.100> separate<00:05:18.330> integrated<00:05:19.330> graphics

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
than say a separate integrated graphics

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.080 
than say a separate integrated graphics
card<00:05:20.020> with<00:05:20.260> the<00:05:20.560> processor<00:05:21.010> you<00:05:21.790> would<00:05:21.910> get

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
card with the processor you would get

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.060 
card with the processor you would get
better<00:05:23.160> it<00:05:24.160> uses<00:05:24.490> less<00:05:24.640> power<00:05:24.670> but<00:05:25.300> it<00:05:25.720> uh

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
better it uses less power but it uh

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.300 
better it uses less power but it uh
maximizes<00:05:27.070> performance<00:05:28.380> it<00:05:29.380> is<00:05:29.440> a<00:05:29.710> absolute

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
maximizes performance it is a absolute

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.770 
maximizes performance it is a absolute
beast<00:05:32.550> so<00:05:33.550> thank<00:05:34.120> you<00:05:34.240> guys<00:05:34.270> for<00:05:34.450> watching

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
beast so thank you guys for watching

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.880 
beast so thank you guys for watching
very<00:05:35.410> much

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
very much

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.650 
very much
