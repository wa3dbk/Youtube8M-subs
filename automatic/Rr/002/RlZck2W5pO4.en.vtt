00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.030 

we<00:00:00.599> want<00:00:00.780> to<00:00:00.840> divide<00:00:01.110> these<00:00:01.380> two<00:00:01.620> numbers

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
we want to divide these two numbers

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.280 
we want to divide these two numbers
written<00:00:02.220> in<00:00:02.399> scientific<00:00:02.970> notation<00:00:03.290> without

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
written in scientific notation without

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.499 
written in scientific notation without
the<00:00:04.470> use<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.920> calculator<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:06.029> do<00:00:06.150> this<00:00:06.299> we

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
the use of a calculator to do this we

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.089 
the use of a calculator to do this we
can<00:00:06.629> think<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.960> dividing<00:00:07.350> this<00:00:07.500> up<00:00:07.710> into<00:00:07.950> two

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
can think of dividing this up into two

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.339 
can think of dividing this up into two
different<00:00:08.130> fractions<00:00:09.230> connected<00:00:10.230> by

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
different fractions connected by

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.570 
different fractions connected by
multiplication<00:00:10.530> so<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.450> equivalent<00:00:12.750> to

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
multiplication so this is equivalent to

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.680 
multiplication so this is equivalent to
7/2<00:00:14.630> times<00:00:16.010> 10<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.190> twelfth<00:00:17.940> divided<00:00:18.449> by

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
7/2 times 10 to the twelfth divided by

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.830 
7/2 times 10 to the twelfth divided by
10<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.439> seventh

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
10 to the seventh

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.630 
10 to the seventh
so<00:00:21.840> now<00:00:21.960> Willie<00:00:22.140> Turman<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:22.859> quotient<00:00:23.160> and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
so now Willie Turman this quotient and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.099 
so now Willie Turman this quotient and
then<00:00:23.730> we'll<00:00:23.820> determine<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.390> quotient

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
then we'll determine this quotient

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.030 
then we'll determine this quotient
well<00:00:26.039> 7/2<00:00:28.429> the<00:00:29.429> decimal<00:00:29.820> point<00:00:30.090> would<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.269> here

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
well 7/2 the decimal point would be here

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.610 
well 7/2 the decimal point would be here
so<00:00:32.040> there's<00:00:32.250> three<00:00:32.850> twos<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.809> seven<00:00:34.380> three

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
so there's three twos and seven three

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.160 
so there's three twos and seven three
times<00:00:34.860> two<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.190> six<00:00:35.340> we<00:00:36.239> subtract<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:37.020> would

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
times two is six we subtract that would

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.170 
times two is six we subtract that would
be<00:00:37.290> one<00:00:37.530> we're<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.670> have<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.910> add<00:00:39.000> extra

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
be one we're going to have to add extra

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.060 
be one we're going to have to add extra
zeros<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.960> right<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.350> decimal<00:00:40.739> point

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
zeros to the right of this decimal point

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.190 
zeros to the right of this decimal point
so<00:00:41.850> let's<00:00:42.000> go<00:00:42.149> ahead<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.420> move<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.719> up<00:00:42.960> into

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
so let's go ahead and move this up into

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.790 
so let's go ahead and move this up into
our<00:00:43.559> quotient<00:00:44.899> now<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:45.960> can<00:00:46.140> bring<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.530> zero

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
our quotient now we can bring this zero

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.970 
our quotient now we can bring this zero
down<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.610> 10<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.559> ask<00:00:49.710> how

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
down and we have 10 and we can ask how

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.119 
down and we have 10 and we can ask how
many<00:00:50.129> twos<00:00:50.430> are<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.879> 10<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.390> would<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.600> five

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
many twos are on 10 that would be five

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.220 
many twos are on 10 that would be five
five<00:00:53.129> times<00:00:53.399> two<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.670> ten<00:00:54.140> find<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
five times two is ten find the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.720 
five times two is ten find the
difference<00:00:55.530> here<00:00:55.710> which<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.980> zero<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.550> we're

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
difference here which is zero so we're

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.209 
difference here which is zero so we're
done<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.809> quotient<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.379> equal<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.829> three

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
done so this quotient is equal to three

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.359 
done so this quotient is equal to three
point<00:00:59.460> five<00:01:02.870> times<00:01:03.870> now<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.860> determine<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
point five times now to determine the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.609 
point five times now to determine the
quotient<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:06.240> since<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> bases<00:01:07.350> are<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
quotient here since the bases are the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.120 
quotient here since the bases are the
same<00:01:07.650> we<00:01:08.220> subtract<00:01:09.000> our<00:01:09.180> exponents<00:01:09.710> 12<00:01:10.710> minus

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
same we subtract our exponents 12 minus

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.270 
same we subtract our exponents 12 minus
seven<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.670> equal<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.119> five<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:13.560> we<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.799> 10<00:01:14.130> to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
seven is equal to five so we have 10 to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.300 
seven is equal to five so we have 10 to
the<00:01:14.369> power<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.729> five<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.680> quotient<00:01:16.979> is

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
the power of five so this quotient is

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.490 
the power of five so this quotient is
equal<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.700> three<00:01:17.970> point<00:01:18.180> five<00:01:18.509> times<00:01:19.080> 10<00:01:19.409> to

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
equal to three point five times 10 to

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.469 
equal to three point five times 10 to
the<00:01:19.560> fifth<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.100> notice<00:01:20.880> how<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
the fifth and notice how it is in the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.200 
the fifth and notice how it is in the
correct<00:01:21.720> form<00:01:22.020> for<00:01:22.229> scientific<00:01:22.740> notation

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
correct form for scientific notation

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.370 
correct form for scientific notation
remember<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.360> number<00:01:24.600> here<00:01:24.960> has<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.350> be

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
remember this number here has to be

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.230 
remember this number here has to be
greater<00:01:25.500> than<00:01:25.920> or<00:01:25.979> equal<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.189> 1<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.909> less<00:01:27.210> than

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
greater than or equal to 1 and less than

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.560 
greater than or equal to 1 and less than
10<00:01:28.579> let's<00:01:29.579> go<00:01:29.729> ahead<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.970> take<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> look<00:01:30.299> at<00:01:30.420> one

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
10 let's go ahead and take a look at one

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.499 
10 let's go ahead and take a look at one
more<00:01:30.600> example<00:01:32.000> we're<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.180> start<00:01:33.390> by

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
more example we're going to start by

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.840 
more example we're going to start by
doing<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.900> same<00:01:34.170> thing<00:01:34.619> we'll<00:01:35.490> divide<00:01:35.820> this

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
doing the same thing we'll divide this

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.390 
doing the same thing we'll divide this
in<00:01:36.180> half<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.810> let<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.680> as<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> product<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.340> two

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
in half and let it as a product of two

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.179 
in half and let it as a product of two
different<00:01:38.790> fractions<00:01:39.619> so<00:01:40.619> we'll<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.890> two

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
different fractions so we'll have two

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.249 
different fractions so we'll have two
point<00:01:41.490> four<00:01:42.920> divided<00:01:43.920> by<00:01:44.040> four<00:01:44.130> point<00:01:44.790> eight

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
point four divided by four point eight

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.770 
point four divided by four point eight
this<00:01:46.259> will<00:01:46.470> be<00:01:46.590> ten<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.070> seventh<00:01:47.780> divided

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
this will be ten to the seventh divided

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.289 
this will be ten to the seventh divided
by<00:01:49.020> 10<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.619> second<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.670> now<00:01:50.790> we<00:01:50.850> determine

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
by 10 to the second so now we determine

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.179 
by 10 to the second so now we determine
this<00:01:51.420> quotient<00:01:51.720> here<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.530> then<00:01:53.040> this

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
this quotient here and then this

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.670 
this quotient here and then this
quotient<00:01:53.430> here<00:01:53.869> we<00:01:54.869> should<00:01:55.049> recognize<00:01:55.470> this

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
quotient here we should recognize this

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.389 
quotient here we should recognize this
as<00:01:55.979> 1/2<00:01:56.820> or<00:01:57.119> 0.5<00:01:57.920> let's<00:01:58.920> go<00:01:59.070> ahead<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.310> just

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
as 1/2 or 0.5 let's go ahead and just

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.249 
as 1/2 or 0.5 let's go ahead and just
verify<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.780> have<00:02:00.869> two<00:02:01.079> point<00:02:01.380> four<00:02:03.259> divided

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
verify it we have two point four divided

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.719 
verify it we have two point four divided
by<00:02:04.409> four<00:02:04.950> point<00:02:05.670> eight<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:08.369> we'd<00:02:08.459> move<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
by four point eight so we'd move the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.210 
by four point eight so we'd move the
decimal<00:02:09.149> point<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.899> right<00:02:10.020> once<00:02:10.530> here<00:02:10.979> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
decimal point to the right once here and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.850 
decimal point to the right once here and
then<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.580> right<00:02:11.760> ones<00:02:12.060> here

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
then to the right ones here

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.250 
then to the right ones here
then<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.190> decimal<00:02:14.490> point<00:02:14.730> straight<00:02:15.060> up<00:02:15.260> and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
then the decimal point straight up and

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.210 
then the decimal point straight up and
right<00:02:16.380> away<00:02:16.500> we're<00:02:16.710> going<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.890> have<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.070> add<00:02:17.190> a

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
right away we're going to have to add a

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.020 
right away we're going to have to add a
zero<00:02:17.700> here<00:02:18.210> so<00:02:19.310> we<00:02:20.310> can<00:02:20.460> determine<00:02:20.700> how<00:02:20.970> many

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
zero here so we can determine how many

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.430 
zero here so we can determine how many
48<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:21.870> on<00:02:22.080> 240<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.430> happens<00:02:23.820> to<00:02:23.940> be<00:02:24.060> 5<00:02:24.440> 5

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
48 so on 240 that happens to be 5 5

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.100 
48 so on 240 that happens to be 5 5
times<00:02:25.860> 48<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.810> 240<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.040> this<00:02:29.040> difference<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.580> 0

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
times 48 is 240 so this difference is 0

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.360 
times 48 is 240 so this difference is 0
so<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.230> quotient<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.920> 0.5<00:02:32.910> or<00:02:33.270> 0.5<00:02:33.950> times<00:02:34.950> and

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
so this quotient is 0.5 or 0.5 times and

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.370 
so this quotient is 0.5 or 0.5 times and
then<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.150> quotient<00:02:36.630> here<00:02:36.930> since<00:02:37.230> we're

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
then this quotient here since we're

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.340 
then this quotient here since we're
dividing<00:02:37.530> we<00:02:37.920> subtract<00:02:38.400> our<00:02:38.580> exponents<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:39.420> 7

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
dividing we subtract our exponents and 7

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.650 
dividing we subtract our exponents and 7
minus<00:02:40.650> 2<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:41.010> equal<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.280> 5<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.270> 10<00:02:42.540> to

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
minus 2 is equal to 5 so this is 10 to

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.520 
minus 2 is equal to 5 so this is 10 to
the<00:02:42.720> fifth<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:45.420> while<00:02:45.570> this<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.050> quotient

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
the fifth so while this is the quotient

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.100 
the fifth so while this is the quotient
we<00:02:47.520> need<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.760> recognize<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.240> the

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
we need to recognize that the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.260 
we need to recognize that the
significant<00:02:49.800> or<00:02:49.980> mantissa<00:02:50.340> here<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:50.940> not<00:02:51.120> in

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
significant or mantissa here is not in

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.510 
significant or mantissa here is not in
the<00:02:51.360> correct<00:02:51.570> form<00:02:51.900> this<00:02:52.500> number<00:02:52.830> here<00:02:53.070> has<00:02:53.100> to

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
the correct form this number here has to

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.600 
the correct form this number here has to
be<00:02:53.780> greater<00:02:54.780> than<00:02:54.930> or<00:02:55.020> equal<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.440> 1<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:56.130> less

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
be greater than or equal to 1 and less

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.300 
be greater than or equal to 1 and less
than<00:02:56.640> 10<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.360> it's<00:02:57.480> too<00:02:57.690> small<00:02:58.100> so<00:02:59.100> what<00:02:59.190> we'll

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
than 10 so it's too small so what we'll

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.420 
than 10 so it's too small so what we'll
do<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.430> write<00:02:59.930> 0.5<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.260> scientific<00:03:01.860> notation

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
do is write 0.5 in scientific notation

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.050 
do is write 0.5 in scientific notation
and<00:03:02.640> then<00:03:03.150> multiply<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.660> by<00:03:03.780> 10<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.410> fifth

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
and then multiply it by 10 to the fifth

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.430 
and then multiply it by 10 to the fifth
so<00:03:06.060> here<00:03:06.270> we<00:03:06.360> have<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.570> move<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.810> decimal<00:03:06.959> to

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
so here we have to move the decimal to

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.350 
so here we have to move the decimal to
the<00:03:07.500> right<00:03:07.590> one<00:03:08.160> place<00:03:08.989> giving<00:03:09.989> us<00:03:10.140> 5<00:03:10.790> times<00:03:11.790> 10

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
the right one place giving us 5 times 10

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.320 
the right one place giving us 5 times 10
to<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.630> negative<00:03:13.350> 1<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.190> then<00:03:15.060> we<00:03:15.150> have<00:03:15.180> to

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
to the negative 1 and then we have to

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.160 
to the negative 1 and then we have to
multiply<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.780> by<00:03:16.620> 10<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.310> fifth<00:03:18.080> so<00:03:19.080> our

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
multiply this by 10 to the fifth so our

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.890 
multiply this by 10 to the fifth so our
final<00:03:19.410> answer<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.769> going<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.160> be<00:03:20.280> 5<00:03:20.610> times<00:03:21.120> 10

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
final answer is going to be 5 times 10

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.800 
final answer is going to be 5 times 10
to<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.110> negative<00:03:23.070> 1<00:03:23.549> plus<00:03:23.910> 5<00:03:24.390> would<00:03:24.750> be

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
to the negative 1 plus 5 would be

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.130 
to the negative 1 plus 5 would be
positive<00:03:25.200> 4<00:03:25.850> so<00:03:26.850> we<00:03:26.940> have<00:03:27.060> 5<00:03:27.330> times<00:03:27.720> 10<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.080> the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
positive 4 so we have 5 times 10 to the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.740 
positive 4 so we have 5 times 10 to the
fourth<00:03:28.470> as<00:03:28.709> our<00:03:29.250> quotient<00:03:29.790> in<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.450> correct

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
fourth as our quotient in the correct

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.080 
fourth as our quotient in the correct
form<00:03:31.049> for<00:03:31.440> scientific<00:03:31.980> notation<00:03:32.090> so

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
form for scientific notation so

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.120 
form for scientific notation so
sometimes<00:03:33.510> when<00:03:33.660> we<00:03:33.780> divide<00:03:34.140> we<00:03:34.890> have<00:03:35.010> this

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
sometimes when we divide we have this

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.970 
sometimes when we divide we have this
extra<00:03:35.580> step<00:03:35.880> where<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.840> significant<00:03:37.470> dormant

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
extra step where the significant dormant

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.460 
extra step where the significant dormant
issah<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.459> not<00:03:38.730> in<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.600> correct<00:03:39.870> form<00:03:40.170> for

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
issah is not in the correct form for

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.610 
issah is not in the correct form for
scientific<00:03:41.010> notation
