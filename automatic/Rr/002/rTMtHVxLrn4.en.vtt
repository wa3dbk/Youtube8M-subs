Latin is dog Deena concentric ax which
you<00:00:28.579> can<00:00:29.499> see<00:00:30.499> where<00:00:30.739> the<00:00:30.909> concentric<00:00:32.200> rings

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
you can see where the concentric rings

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.840 
you can see where the concentric rings
come<00:00:33.470> from<00:00:33.650> actually<00:00:33.980> that<00:00:34.100> one's<00:00:34.310> a<00:00:34.430> bit<00:00:34.609> um

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
come from actually that one's a bit um

come from actually that one's a bit um
sort<00:00:35.239> of<00:00:35.530> hold<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:36.920> yes<00:00:37.910> very<00:00:38.090> wet<00:00:38.710> inside<00:00:39.710> and

sort of hold and yes very wet inside and
rotten<00:00:40.309> often<00:00:41.000> you<00:00:41.149> can<00:00:41.300> find<00:00:41.329> these<00:00:41.629> quite

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
rotten often you can find these quite

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.509 
rotten often you can find these quite
dry<00:00:42.430> inside<00:00:44.289> but<00:00:45.289> normally<00:00:45.680> you<00:00:45.980> would<00:00:46.160> to

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
dry inside but normally you would to

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.160 
dry inside but normally you would to
sort<00:00:46.760> think<00:00:46.940> now<00:00:47.210> yes<00:00:47.510> see<00:00:47.809> these<00:00:47.960> are<00:00:48.140> very

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
sort think now yes see these are very

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.939 
sort think now yes see these are very
brittle<00:00:49.809> there's<00:00:50.809> these<00:00:50.989> things<00:00:51.289> you<00:00:51.590> watch

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
brittle there's these things you watch

many<00:01:31.729> clothes<00:01:32.000> they<00:01:32.509> just<00:01:32.750> would<00:01:33.439> you<00:01:33.560> get<00:01:33.710> a

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
many clothes they just would you get a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.410 
many clothes they just would you get a
number<00:01:34.040> in<00:01:34.159> there<00:01:34.310> glowing<00:01:34.729> you<00:01:34.969> blow<00:01:35.210> on<00:01:35.360> it

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
number in there glowing you blow on it

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.749 
number in there glowing you blow on it
generally<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.290> he<00:01:36.380> just<00:01:36.590> increases<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:37.579> size

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
generally and he just increases and size

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.310 
generally and he just increases and size
and<00:01:38.000> catches<00:01:38.390> all<00:01:38.570> all<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.960> other<00:01:39.079> stuff

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
and catches all all the other stuff

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
and catches all all the other stuff
around<00:01:39.530> it<00:01:39.770> so<00:01:40.759> that's<00:01:41.000> where<00:01:41.149> you<00:01:41.240> find<00:01:41.390> them

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
around it so that's where you find them

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.030 
around it so that's where you find them
in<00:01:43.340> old<00:01:43.460> logs

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:55.250 

let's<00:01:49.040> get<00:01:49.250> example<00:01:50.470> that<00:01:51.470> focuses

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.280 

you<00:01:56.260> can<00:01:56.440> really<00:01:56.740> see<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.930> rings<00:01:58.930> in<00:01:59.140> there

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
you can really see the rings in there

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.700 
you can really see the rings in there
and<00:01:59.500> that<00:02:00.190> again<00:02:00.700> that's<00:02:00.910> that's<00:02:01.300> wet<00:02:02.160> but<00:02:04.710> if

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
and that again that's that's wet but if

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.520 
and that again that's that's wet but if
it<00:02:05.920> would<00:02:06.040> dry<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.640> would<00:02:07.330> take<00:02:07.570> a<00:02:07.600> spark<00:02:07.990> well

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.140 

just<00:02:11.530> feel<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:11.740> little<00:02:12.010> damp<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.700> touch<00:02:12.910> this

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
just feel a little damp to touch this

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.930 
just feel a little damp to touch this
one<00:02:13.530> I've<00:02:14.530> guide<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.010> for<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.220> day<00:02:15.370> or<00:02:15.430> two<00:02:15.550> I

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
one I've guide it for a day or two I

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.660 
one I've guide it for a day or two I
thought<00:02:16.630> that'd<00:02:16.810> be<00:02:16.959> enough<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:18.310> we<00:02:18.430> can<00:02:18.459> give

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
thought that'd be enough but we can give

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.640 
thought that'd be enough but we can give
it<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.820> go<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:18.970> these<00:02:19.600> basically<00:02:19.870> take<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> spot

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
it a go and these basically take a spot

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.100 
it a go and these basically take a spot
and<00:02:20.980> they<00:02:21.670> glow<00:02:21.910> with<00:02:22.270> an<00:02:22.390> ember<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:22.870> they

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
and they glow with an ember and they

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.720 
and they glow with an ember and they
just<00:02:23.290> sort<00:02:23.680> of<00:02:23.770> naturally<00:02:24.220> look<00:02:24.400> after

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
just sort of naturally look after

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.120 
just sort of naturally look after
themselves<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:26.320> don't<00:02:26.530> have<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.800> do<00:02:26.950> much

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
themselves and you don't have to do much

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.750 
themselves and you don't have to do much
to<00:02:27.190> them<00:02:27.670> in<00:02:28.090> order<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:30.250> let's<00:02:30.459> give<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.640> a

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
to them in order to so let's give it a

00:02:30.760 --> 00:03:08.449 
to them in order to so let's give it a
go

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.309 

the<00:03:09.000> thing<00:03:09.209> this<00:03:09.390> one<00:03:09.599> is<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.810> little<00:03:09.989> damp

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
the thing this one is a little damp

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.059 
the thing this one is a little damp
inside<00:03:11.750> it's<00:03:12.750> been<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.590> bit<00:03:13.799> trickier<00:03:14.189> to<00:03:14.219> catch

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
inside it's been a bit trickier to catch

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.470 
inside it's been a bit trickier to catch
usually<00:03:17.069> I've<00:03:17.159> seen<00:03:17.370> them<00:03:17.579> grow<00:03:17.969> better<00:03:18.269> on

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
usually I've seen them grow better on

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.399 
usually I've seen them grow better on
them<00:03:18.719> on<00:03:19.019> on<00:03:19.409> the<00:03:19.620> round<00:03:20.750> but<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:21.900> one<00:03:22.079> seems

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
them on on the round but this one seems

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.610 
them on on the round but this one seems
to<00:03:22.469> need<00:03:22.739> a<00:03:22.769> bit<00:03:23.489> of<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.670> blow

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
to need a bit of a blow

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.449 
to need a bit of a blow
it's<00:03:25.620> probably<00:03:25.889> because<00:03:26.129> it's<00:03:26.310> early

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
it's probably because it's early

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.970 
it's probably because it's early
February<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.719> know<00:03:28.500> everything

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
February and you know everything

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.399 
February and you know everything
everything's<00:03:29.400> really<00:03:29.639> damn<00:03:30.030> it's<00:03:30.989> probably

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
everything's really damn it's probably

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.580 
everything's really damn it's probably
still<00:03:31.709> upwards<00:03:32.159> you<00:03:32.340> down<00:03:33.290> but<00:03:34.290> as<00:03:34.349> you<00:03:34.469> can

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
still upwards you down but as you can

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.890 
still upwards you down but as you can
see<00:03:36.319> hopefully<00:03:37.319> on<00:03:37.409> camera<00:03:38.629> then<00:03:39.629> you<00:03:39.719> give<00:03:39.840> it

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
see hopefully on camera then you give it

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.690 
see hopefully on camera then you give it
a<00:03:39.959> blow<00:03:40.170> it<00:03:41.040> grows<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:43.010> Ember<00:03:44.010> grows<00:03:44.220> in<00:03:44.459> size

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
a blow it grows the Ember grows in size

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.750 
a blow it grows the Ember grows in size
and<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:47.819> can<00:03:47.970> actually<00:03:48.120> pretty<00:03:48.540> easily<00:03:49.760> catch

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
and you can actually pretty easily catch

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:59.790 
and you can actually pretty easily catch
another<00:03:51.000> piece

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.980 

just<00:04:00.760> like<00:04:00.910> that

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.700 

and<00:04:05.330> you<00:04:06.330> know<00:04:06.450> if<00:04:06.600> you<00:04:06.750> if<00:04:07.110> you've<00:04:07.410> got<00:04:07.620> an

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
and you know if you if you've got an

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.770 
and you know if you if you've got an
abundance<00:04:08.130> of<00:04:08.280> these<00:04:08.430> in<00:04:08.910> in<00:04:09.270> a<00:04:09.390> certain<00:04:09.570> area

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
abundance of these in in a certain area

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.290 
abundance of these in in a certain area
you<00:04:10.020> can<00:04:10.230> use<00:04:10.380> these<00:04:10.710> to<00:04:11.060> click<00:04:12.060> on<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:15.090> can

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
you can use these to click on you can

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.680 
you can use these to click on you can
you<00:04:15.510> can<00:04:15.690> throw<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.410> load<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.680> these<00:04:16.950> together

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
you can throw a load of these together

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.410 
you can throw a load of these together
and<00:04:18.690> use<00:04:18.870> them<00:04:18.990> as<00:04:19.110> coals<00:04:20.630> and<00:04:21.630> that's<00:04:23.420> that's

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
and use them as coals and that's that's

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.910 
and use them as coals and that's that's
one<00:04:24.660> way<00:04:24.840> I've<00:04:24.960> put<00:04:25.140> them<00:04:25.290> out<00:04:25.440> quick<00:04:25.710> if

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
one way I've put them out quick if

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.580 
one way I've put them out quick if
you've<00:04:26.130> snapped<00:04:26.550> one<00:04:26.730> and<00:04:27.180> a<00:04:27.270> half<00:04:27.420> and<00:04:27.780> just

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
you've snapped one and a half and just

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.160 
you've snapped one and a half and just
close<00:04:28.860> it<00:04:29.040> together<00:04:29.280> like<00:04:29.460> that<00:04:29.930> quite<00:04:30.930> tight

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
close it together like that quite tight

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.170 
close it together like that quite tight
only<00:04:32.010> sometimes<00:04:32.250> you<00:04:32.490> can<00:04:32.640> do<00:04:32.760> that<00:04:32.940> if<00:04:33.060> you've

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
only sometimes you can do that if you've

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.640 
only sometimes you can do that if you've
got<00:04:33.360> a<00:04:33.390> big<00:04:33.570> one<00:04:33.600> sometimes<00:04:34.170> the<00:04:34.230> small<00:04:34.470> ones

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
got a big one sometimes the small ones

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.740 
got a big one sometimes the small ones
just<00:04:34.860> you<00:04:35.160> know<00:04:35.340> crumble<00:04:35.730> and<00:04:36.300> crumble<00:04:36.630> to

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
just you know crumble and crumble to

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.950 
just you know crumble and crumble to
bits<00:04:36.930> but<00:04:37.320> that's<00:04:37.530> put<00:04:37.740> that<00:04:37.860> right<00:04:38.070> out<00:04:38.960> but

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
bits but that's put that right out but

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.380 
bits but that's put that right out but
other<00:04:40.170> than<00:04:40.350> that<00:04:40.640> these<00:04:41.640> can<00:04:41.880> be<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:42.030> good<00:04:42.240> way

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
other than that these can be a good way

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.990 
other than that these can be a good way
of<00:04:42.420> carrying<00:04:42.870> in<00:04:42.990> fire<00:04:43.550> you<00:04:44.550> know<00:04:44.670> you<00:04:44.730> could

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
of carrying in fire you know you could

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.110 
of carrying in fire you know you could
protect<00:04:45.420> that<00:04:45.540> in<00:04:45.780> Leafs<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:47.550> just

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
protect that in Leafs and and just

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.500 
protect that in Leafs and and just
making<00:04:48.330> sure<00:04:48.660> that<00:04:48.690> had<00:04:49.110> enough<00:04:49.320> oxygen<00:04:49.920> so

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
making sure that had enough oxygen so

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.630 
making sure that had enough oxygen so
grow<00:04:51.510> naturally<00:04:51.750> and<00:04:52.230> you<00:04:52.290> could<00:04:52.650> carry<00:04:52.890> fire

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
grow naturally and you could carry fire

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.420 
grow naturally and you could carry fire
like<00:04:53.910> that<00:04:54.230> but<00:04:55.230> yeah<00:04:55.440> these<00:04:55.650> are<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:55.890> wonderful

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
like that but yeah these are a wonderful

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.330 
like that but yeah these are a wonderful
thing<00:04:56.610> obviously<00:04:56.940> if<00:04:57.270> you<00:04:57.390> had<00:04:57.890> cinder<00:04:58.890> you

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
thing obviously if you had cinder you

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.030 
thing obviously if you had cinder you
could<00:04:59.490> you<00:05:00.090> know<00:05:00.240> you<00:05:00.300> can<00:05:00.740> start<00:05:01.740> your<00:05:01.830> fire

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
could you know you can start your fire

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.970 
could you know you can start your fire
from<00:05:02.250> that<00:05:02.400> no<00:05:02.580> problem
