00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.140
 r 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.219
 r 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:29.720
 Of course, they do not use a stroke of the pen to the opponent's church 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.890
 I'm just with a cap at the reference times 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.980
 happy faces and on the floor brings the poor 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.980
 the sting 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.060
 CAD hand lift 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.460
 Trip through the face 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.380
 and the opponent is on 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.380
 here again fast 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.570
 my left hand goes immediately to opposing hand the thumb goes there 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.750
 on the back of the hand with your right finger pricks to kill 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.010
 then the right hand also goes to opposing ranks now 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.560
 Both thumbs are on the back of the opponent's hand or are brought here 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.920
 Trip through the face 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.040
 and now the arm is stretched between my legs 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.770
 everyone was fast and with a little variation 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
 the opponent is prone to his stretched arms 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.160
 Finnair introduces 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.660
 Cap and live 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.170
 Trip through the face 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.020
 or now the opponent by means of a living space to his stretched arm 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.020
 brought into a much more favorable prone position 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.520
 Here he can be fixed 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.440
 engraving 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.440
 the opponent is brought down 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.010
 now comes the long want 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.990
 the opponent is placed in prone position 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.950
 and here it is important to make sure that the opponent is permanently on the ground 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.850
 is held 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.369
 his shoulder must not lose contact with the ground steadily 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.369
 Strain with my left leg 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.779
 then the arm is bent 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:18.499
 I know the hand in my create 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:21.419
 and even then does not stop the opponent 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.749
 His shoulder is dislocated and he is burdened with my body 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:27.749
 placed 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:41.169
 Yes
