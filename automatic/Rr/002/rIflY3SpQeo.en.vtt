by free Tris so just click on the hair
it's<00:01:33.800> 20<00:01:34.220> I<00:01:34.459> believe<00:01:34.640> it<00:01:35.000> comes<00:01:35.090> in<00:01:35.300> 22<00:01:35.840> inches

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
it's 20 I believe it comes in 22 inches

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.199 
it's 20 I believe it comes in 22 inches
I'm<00:01:37.039> so<00:01:37.399> it<00:01:37.459> is<00:01:37.610> pretty<00:01:38.000> pretty<00:01:38.270> long<00:01:40.179> what<00:01:41.179> I

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
I'm so it is pretty pretty long what I

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:42.760 
I'm so it is pretty pretty long what I
end<00:01:41.390> up<00:01:41.450> doing<00:01:41.509> was<00:01:41.840> cutting<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.470> hair<00:01:42.649> in

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
end up doing was cutting the hair in

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.559 
end up doing was cutting the hair in
half<00:01:42.950> in<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:43.310> center<00:01:43.670> part<00:01:43.910> so<00:01:44.270> kind<00:01:44.479> of

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
half in the center part so kind of

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:45.699 
half in the center part so kind of
create<00:01:44.780> like<00:01:44.899> a<00:01:44.929> big<00:01:45.229> effect

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:45.709 
create like a big effect

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.699 
create like a big effect
so<00:01:46.160> it's<00:01:47.119> about<00:01:47.330> 11<00:01:47.810> inches<00:01:47.929> once<00:01:48.259> you<00:01:48.380> cut<00:01:48.590> on

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
so it's about 11 inches once you cut on

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.010 
so it's about 11 inches once you cut on
the<00:01:48.830> sides<00:01:49.069> which<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:49.369> can<00:01:49.459> kind<00:01:49.640> of<00:01:49.700> see<00:01:49.989> so<00:01:50.989> I

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
the sides which you can kind of see so I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.839 
the sides which you can kind of see so I
have<00:01:51.319> it<00:01:51.470> so<00:01:51.649> that<00:01:51.860> can<00:01:52.009> pretty<00:01:52.160> much<00:01:52.280> flip<00:01:52.700> it

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:52.849 
have it so that can pretty much flip it

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:57.669 
have it so that can pretty much flip it
over<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.530> side<00:01:54.950> if<00:01:55.459> I<00:01:55.610> want<00:01:55.849> it<00:01:55.970> to

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
over to the side if I want it to

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.359 
over to the side if I want it to
we're<00:01:58.429> like<00:01:58.610> a<00:01:58.640> side<00:01:59.000> bang<00:01:59.239> type<00:01:59.660> thing<00:02:00.369> as

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
we're like a side bang type thing as

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.370 
we're like a side bang type thing as
well<00:02:01.640> as<00:02:01.759> to<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:02.000> other<00:02:02.149> side<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:02.810> I<00:02:02.840> did<00:02:03.200> that

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
well as to the other side so I did that

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.320 
well as to the other side so I did that
and<00:02:03.440> then<00:02:03.739> I<00:02:03.800> also<00:02:03.979> use<00:02:04.429> like<00:02:04.670> there's<00:02:05.090> an

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
and then I also use like there's an

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.100 
and then I also use like there's an
invisible<00:02:05.539> method<00:02:07.569> invisible<00:02:08.569> apartment

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
invisible method invisible apartment

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.960 
invisible method invisible apartment
that<00:02:09.229> used<00:02:09.560> for<00:02:09.800> prochaine<00:02:10.160> braids<00:02:10.429> so<00:02:10.729> the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
that used for prochaine braids so the

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.369 
that used for prochaine braids so the
only<00:02:11.120> thing<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:11.420> do<00:02:11.569> is<00:02:11.720> instead<00:02:12.020> of<00:02:12.200> pulling

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
only thing you do is instead of pulling

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.960 
only thing you do is instead of pulling
all<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.950> hair<00:02:13.129> through<00:02:13.459> when<00:02:13.610> you're<00:02:13.730> nodding

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
all the hair through when you're nodding

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.030 
all the hair through when you're nodding
that<00:02:14.239> you<00:02:14.720> just<00:02:14.989> take<00:02:15.170> half<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:15.890> pull

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
that you just take half of it and pull

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.300 
that you just take half of it and pull
