00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
absolutely covered in grease to protect

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.090 
absolutely covered in grease to protect
it<00:01:10.439> from<00:01:11.220> rust<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.360> storage<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.830> gonna<00:01:13.950> have

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
it from rust and storage you gonna have

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.950 
it from rust and storage you gonna have
to<00:01:14.189> clean<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.460> off<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.479> that's<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
to clean that off and that's the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.230 
to clean that off and that's the
deployment<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> sheath

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
deployment but so that is the sheath

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.870 
deployment but so that is the sheath
that<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.570> comes<00:01:18.810> with<00:01:19.040> ok<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.100> before<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.700> go

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that it comes with ok so before we go

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.179 
that it comes with ok so before we go
further<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.330> need<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.780> discuss<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
further we need to discuss the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.429 
further we need to discuss the
differences<00:01:23.820> between<00:01:24.060> light<00:01:25.020> or<00:01:25.229> medium

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
differences between light or medium

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.390 
differences between light or medium
machetes<00:01:26.240> versus<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> heavy<00:01:27.570> machete<00:01:28.220> versus<00:01:29.220> a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
machetes versus a heavy machete versus a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.760 
machetes versus a heavy machete versus a
hatchet<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.630> think<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.020> things<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:31.380> this

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
hatchet and I think of things like this

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.609 
hatchet and I think of things like this
the<00:01:32.040> light<00:01:32.280> machetes<00:01:32.880> are<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.619> light

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
the light machetes are for light

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.749 
the light machetes are for light
vegetation

all right clearing a trail for many

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.330 
all right clearing a trail for many
miles<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:39.180> reason<00:01:39.540> they're<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:39.750> light<00:01:40.340> so

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
miles the reason they're so light so

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.460

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
right where does this machete fit in you

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.470 
right where does this machete fit in you
know<00:02:15.959> it's<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.469> the<00:02:16.560> middle<00:02:16.920> it's

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
know it's in the middle it's

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.300 
know it's in the middle it's
substantially<00:02:18.480> thicker<00:02:18.810> than<00:02:19.799> those<00:02:20.040> light

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
substantially thicker than those light

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.369 
substantially thicker than those light
machetes<00:02:20.819> next<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.329> it<00:02:21.450> okay<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.959> might<00:02:22.140> have<00:02:22.349> a

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
machetes next to it okay it might have a

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.410 
machetes next to it okay it might have a
similar<00:02:22.920> blade<00:02:23.310> shape<00:02:23.609> but<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.329> is

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
similar blade shape but it is

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.059 
similar blade shape but it is
substantially<00:02:25.140> thicker<00:02:25.409> and<00:02:25.680> it's<00:02:25.829> about

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
substantially thicker and it's about

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.690 
substantially thicker and it's about
one-and-a-half<00:02:27.000> pounds<00:02:27.799> so<00:02:28.799> more<00:02:29.069> mass<00:02:29.370> more

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
one-and-a-half pounds so more mass more

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.899 
one-and-a-half pounds so more mass more
thickness<00:02:30.659> so<00:02:31.439> not<00:02:32.069> only<00:02:32.250> could<00:02:32.459> it<00:02:32.579> take<00:02:32.730> on

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
thickness so not only could it take on

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.819 
thickness so not only could it take on
light<00:02:33.150> vegetation<00:02:33.810> but<00:02:34.079> it<00:02:34.290> can<00:02:34.470> take<00:02:34.650> on

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
light vegetation but it can take on

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.229 
light vegetation but it can take on
saplings<00:02:36.409> branches<00:02:37.409> if<00:02:37.829> you<00:02:38.459> absolutely<00:02:39.030> had

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
saplings branches if you absolutely had

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.679 
saplings branches if you absolutely had
to<00:02:39.269> you<00:02:39.810> know<00:02:39.959> even<00:02:40.889> a<00:02:40.980> small<00:02:41.430> small<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.389> medium

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
to you know even a small small to medium

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.190 
to you know even a small small to medium
size<00:02:42.900> tree<00:02:43.469> if<00:02:43.829> you<00:02:44.400> had<00:02:44.639> to<00:02:44.909> not<00:02:45.689> as<00:02:45.870> good<00:02:46.079> as

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
size tree if you had to not as good as

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.610 
size tree if you had to not as good as
an<00:02:46.349> axe<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.790> know<00:02:47.879> it's<00:02:48.090> in<00:02:48.359> between<00:02:48.620> the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
an axe but you know it's in between the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.289 
an axe but you know it's in between the
hatchet<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.280> light<00:02:50.459> machete<00:02:50.939> it's<00:02:51.180> a

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
hatchet and the light machete it's a

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.479 
hatchet and the light machete it's a
multi-purpose<00:02:51.810> tool<00:02:52.079> all<00:02:52.709> right<00:02:53.189> at<00:02:53.340> this

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
multi-purpose tool all right at this

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.940 
multi-purpose tool all right at this
time<00:02:53.730> let's<00:02:53.970> roll<00:02:54.209> in<00:02:54.359> some<00:02:54.569> footage<00:02:54.950> first

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
time let's roll in some footage first

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.580 
time let's roll in some footage first
chopping<00:02:56.579> chopped<00:02:57.480> up<00:02:57.689> part<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:58.049> that<00:02:58.200> branch

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
chopping chopped up part of that branch

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.409 
chopping chopped up part of that branch
that<00:02:58.739> is<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.040> branch<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.430> fell<00:02:59.760> down<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.329> a

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
that is a branch that fell down in a

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.960 
that is a branch that fell down in a
very<00:03:00.599> heavy<00:03:00.959> storm<00:03:01.409> we<00:03:01.620> had<00:03:01.859> then<00:03:02.669> a<00:03:02.700> little

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
very heavy storm we had then a little

00:03:02.970 --> 00:05:46.500 
very heavy storm we had then a little
bit<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.329> ''but<00:03:03.510> awning

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.490 

all<00:05:47.510> right<00:05:47.690> so<00:05:47.870> what<00:05:47.990> do<00:05:48.050> I<00:05:48.140> think<00:05:48.170> of<00:05:48.410> the

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
all right so what do I think of the

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.970 
all right so what do I think of the
luftwaffe<00:05:48.950> survival<00:05:49.790> machete<00:05:50.300> well<00:05:50.980> pretty

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
luftwaffe survival machete well pretty

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.790 
luftwaffe survival machete well pretty
awesome<00:05:52.460> I<00:05:52.610> would<00:05:52.670> say<00:05:53.260> you<00:05:54.260> know<00:05:54.350> even<00:05:54.380> though

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
awesome I would say you know even though

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.510 
awesome I would say you know even though
it<00:05:54.950> approaches<00:05:55.550> the<00:05:56.120> mass<00:05:56.480> of<00:05:57.100> a<00:05:58.100> light

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
it approaches the mass of a light

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.930 
it approaches the mass of a light
hatchet<00:05:59.500> the<00:06:00.500> edge<00:06:00.650> geometry<00:06:01.100> and<00:06:01.550> the<00:06:01.640> grind

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
hatchet the edge geometry and the grind

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.320 
hatchet the edge geometry and the grind
geometry<00:06:02.630> are<00:06:02.870> different<00:06:03.800> okay<00:06:04.430> a<00:06:04.610> hatchet

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
geometry are different okay a hatchet

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.790 
geometry are different okay a hatchet
has<00:06:06.170> a<00:06:06.200> very<00:06:06.590> broad<00:06:06.950> edge<00:06:07.640> and<00:06:08.240> this<00:06:08.810> comes<00:06:09.680> to

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
has a very broad edge and this comes to

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.820 
has a very broad edge and this comes to
you<00:06:10.250> know<00:06:10.370> it's<00:06:10.820> very<00:06:11.060> it's<00:06:11.720> very<00:06:11.900> fine

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
you know it's very it's very fine

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.400 
you know it's very it's very fine
right<00:06:13.670> so<00:06:13.850> a<00:06:13.880> hatchet<00:06:14.450> you<00:06:14.840> know<00:06:14.930> it<00:06:15.050> tends<00:06:15.290> to

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
right so a hatchet you know it tends to

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.300 
right so a hatchet you know it tends to
just<00:06:15.620> explode<00:06:16.220> almost<00:06:16.730> explode<00:06:17.330> what<00:06:17.600> it<00:06:17.690> hits

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
just explode almost explode what it hits

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.700 
just explode almost explode what it hits
parting<00:06:19.310> it<00:06:19.460> whereas<00:06:20.270> this<00:06:20.510> more<00:06:21.170> tends<00:06:21.500> to

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
parting it whereas this more tends to

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.480 
parting it whereas this more tends to
penetrate<00:06:22.750> deeply<00:06:23.750> into<00:06:23.900> what<00:06:24.380> it<00:06:24.710> hits<00:06:24.980> okay

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
penetrate deeply into what it hits okay

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.160 
penetrate deeply into what it hits okay
so<00:06:25.550> yeah<00:06:25.880> you<00:06:26.150> got<00:06:26.300> to<00:06:26.420> chop<00:06:26.630> with<00:06:26.930> this<00:06:27.140> a

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
so yeah you got to chop with this a

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.080 
so yeah you got to chop with this a
little<00:06:27.590> different<00:06:28.340> than<00:06:28.550> you<00:06:28.670> would<00:06:28.820> chop

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
little different than you would chop

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.960 
little different than you would chop
with<00:06:29.330> a<00:06:29.360> hatchet<00:06:29.600> but<00:06:30.440> in<00:06:30.620> a<00:06:30.770> pinch<00:06:31.100> this<00:06:31.730> can

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
with a hatchet but in a pinch this can

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.410 
with a hatchet but in a pinch this can
take<00:06:32.210> on<00:06:32.950> you<00:06:33.950> know<00:06:34.040> smaller<00:06:34.580> trees<00:06:35.090> or

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:35.420 
take on you know smaller trees or

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.920 
take on you know smaller trees or
thicker<00:06:36.110> branches<00:06:36.700> pretty<00:06:37.700> well<00:06:38.090> that<00:06:38.870> I

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
thicker branches pretty well that I

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.750 
thicker branches pretty well that I
might<00:06:39.170> say<00:06:39.350> why<00:06:39.530> don't<00:06:39.710> you<00:06:39.770> chop<00:06:40.010> up<00:06:40.040> some<00:06:40.520> you

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
might say why don't you chop up some you

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.050 
might say why don't you chop up some you
know<00:06:40.880> soft<00:06:41.210> vegetation<00:06:41.990> with<00:06:42.170> it<00:06:42.320> too<00:06:42.730> it<00:06:43.730> can

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
know soft vegetation with it too it can

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.450 
know soft vegetation with it too it can
do<00:06:44.330> that<00:06:44.510> it<00:06:44.780> does<00:06:45.050> have<00:06:45.230> the<00:06:45.440> length<00:06:45.680> but<00:06:46.340> the

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
do that it does have the length but the

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.950 
do that it does have the length but the
bottom<00:06:46.730> line<00:06:46.760> is<00:06:46.970> something<00:06:47.480> like<00:06:47.600> this<00:06:47.750> is

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
bottom line is something like this is

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.220 
bottom line is something like this is
never<00:06:48.290> going<00:06:48.590> to<00:06:48.710> break<00:06:49.690> just<00:06:50.690> from<00:06:50.930> soft

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.230 
never going to break just from soft

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.070 
never going to break just from soft
vegetation<00:06:51.980> so<00:06:52.130> I<00:06:52.160> wanted<00:06:52.640> to<00:06:52.900> show<00:06:53.900> it

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
vegetation so I wanted to show it

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.660 
vegetation so I wanted to show it
actually<00:06:54.590> doing<00:06:54.770> something<00:06:55.100> that<00:06:55.340> would<00:06:55.490> be

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:55.670 
actually doing something that would be

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.210 
actually doing something that would be
more<00:06:56.360> difficult<00:06:56.420> for<00:06:57.080> it<00:06:57.500> how<00:06:57.890> would<00:06:57.950> this

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
more difficult for it how would this

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.150 
more difficult for it how would this
fare<00:06:58.550> in<00:06:58.790> a<00:06:58.910> hand<00:06:59.210> to<00:06:59.360> hand<00:06:59.800> it<00:07:00.800> would<00:07:01.010> be

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 
fare in a hand to hand it would be

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:07.060 
fare in a hand to hand it would be
pretty<00:07:01.460> brutal<00:07:02.530> it<00:07:03.530> has<00:07:04.070> the<00:07:04.400> reach<00:07:04.640> and<00:07:06.070> yeah

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070 
pretty brutal it has the reach and yeah

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.970 
pretty brutal it has the reach and yeah
I'm<00:07:07.400> guessing<00:07:07.610> it<00:07:07.910> would<00:07:08.030> be<00:07:08.090> a<00:07:08.180> to<00:07:08.510> hit<00:07:08.780> a<00:07:09.080> to

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:09.980 
I'm guessing it would be a to hit a to

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.470 
I'm guessing it would be a to hit a to
hit<00:07:10.220> affair<00:07:10.700> the<00:07:11.510> first<00:07:11.840> hit<00:07:12.110> goes<00:07:12.440> for<00:07:12.770> a<00:07:13.480> hand

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:14.480 
hit affair the first hit goes for a hand

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.150 
hit affair the first hit goes for a hand
or<00:07:14.660> an<00:07:14.780> arm<00:07:14.990> or<00:07:15.320> a<00:07:15.380> leg<00:07:15.710> and<00:07:16.220> then<00:07:16.540> once<00:07:17.540> there

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 
or an arm or a leg and then once there

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.490 
or an arm or a leg and then once there
they're<00:07:19.160> vulnerable<00:07:19.520> the<00:07:20.030> next<00:07:20.360> hit<00:07:20.570> well

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:21.500 
they're vulnerable the next hit well

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.620 
they're vulnerable the next hit well
it's<00:07:22.370> not<00:07:22.520> going<00:07:22.669> to<00:07:22.760> go<00:07:22.880> through<00:07:23.120> a<00:07:23.180> helmet

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:23.630 
it's not going to go through a helmet

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.570 
it's not going to go through a helmet
right

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:25.580 
right

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.180 
right
the<00:07:26.419> next<00:07:26.720> hit<00:07:26.870> is<00:07:26.900> probably<00:07:27.319> going<00:07:27.560> through

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.190 
the next hit is probably going through

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.640 
the next hit is probably going through
the<00:07:28.370> collarbone<00:07:28.940> or<00:07:28.970> side<00:07:29.840> of<00:07:30.050> the<00:07:30.169> neck<00:07:30.410> and

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:30.650 
the collarbone or side of the neck and

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.100 
the collarbone or side of the neck and
that<00:07:31.160> would<00:07:31.370> be<00:07:31.520> all<00:07:31.669> she<00:07:31.910> wrote<00:07:31.940> so<00:07:32.389> yeah<00:07:32.629> this

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.110 
that would be all she wrote so yeah this

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.930 
that would be all she wrote so yeah this
would<00:07:33.289> be<00:07:33.319> pretty<00:07:33.560> fearsome<00:07:34.159> all<00:07:34.610> right<00:07:34.759> well

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:34.940
