 sea ​​that took by according to the creator that 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.150
 I think that was what the kingdom was I do not know 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.530
 how much the name but it took them 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.800
 three and a half years 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.659

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.890
 It's good to do load 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.269
 basically adds a realism 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.150
 inspired to minecraft something that you 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.700
 they will say moscow how can you add 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.740
 Realism and there's no real engine 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.479
 life known for me to be cáccamo 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.520
 guys like where we really have 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.750
 to load or be filled in this and 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.840
 let's shit basically works I do not know 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.400
 an odorless tablet or community toilet 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.170
 in the country and perfect that we are going to do 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.240
 with it good we are going to put it in the 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.400
 floor basically and we will give you 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.200
 perfect water with water with a bucket of 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.880
 water once done this we are not going to stop 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.190
 up we're going to grab a stack of 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.200
 paper and let's say we already have a 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.690
 our basic needs seated 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.160
 obviously we are going to clean our asses 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.900
 basically and how do we do that good 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.940
 basically we go seconds lic to the toilet 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.950
 to clean we are going to make three 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.810
 uses of water and well basically we 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.420
 we fill in as you can see we are going to fill 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.950
 the water we are going to clean up again and 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.540
 well so basically we put all the 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.759
 day that has been winning and cleaning us but 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.380
 we put some pipes because this is not going 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.619
 to become a good lie in 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.930
 perfect said this many will say external 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.550
 lime no no no no the world has a world 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.470
 of discovery has a lot of 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.239
 hidden secrets and basically what 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.360
 let's see now is with our shit 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.459
 a block of shits and a block of whore 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.160
 shit or be a block of liars 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.959
 because we basically do all the 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.459
 possible fuck in the world without eating 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.150
 obviously because good because we 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.970
 what we do 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.860
 things that we invent from nothing 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.209
 let's make a basically good oven 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.340
 I do not do it because I have the 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.500
 creative but let's make an oven what 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.760
 let's put and grab a bucket of the 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.980
 Maguana looks like any with wisdom 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.040
 But at the same time, what's harder is going to 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.900
 burn our shits and if we go to 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.879
 burn our fucking shit we're going to 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.010
 be so for example to have to be 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.530
 efficient obviously we're going to grab 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.349
 a lot of pinche lava we are going to do 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.090
 well and let's put a lava one and let's go 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.760
 to put shit yeah guys girls guys 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.129
 it is an awesome for burning shit 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.549
 that is, do not imagine you were 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:00.349
 good eat they build floating in the 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.930
 toilet is taken as told by the 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.519
 they release everything and once done that they give it 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.439
 They give the chain in a new one to be 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.450
 the street is not what they put together they do not put a 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.519
 bag and put it in the oven or yes yes 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.750
 what the oven and heat it because 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.920
 because we are just and then I do not know 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.530
 who shit heats 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.319
 well let's grab our ingots 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.830
 we're going to make a table 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.060
 kraft eo and they will say now that we do that 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.950
 we have one and perfect 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.569
 our perfect and dark toilet that 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.569
 we do perfect with being a block of 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.880
 perfect condensed shit very large sheet 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.100
 q condensed shit for what it's good 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.280
 if it was not enough for you to basically contain 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.500
 your fucking block shit burn it in a 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.269
 oven to have craps blocks of 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.920
 fucking bullion good now for having 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.590
 a fucking building block 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.420
 literally or a block of shit and 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.640
 Well let's leave it over here by 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.160
 example and let's have a house of my 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.500
 literally water is a house of 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.750
 villanova guys and good as you can see 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.810
 It is much more beautiful and decorative than 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.970
 diamond ie compare the abstract 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.400
 and that of these blocks as you can see 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.400
 it's a wonder cidh is great 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.599
 let's go now 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.340
 to determine this and many will say or Moscow 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.239
 cows calves no no no no 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.400
 mold has many surprises 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.169
 hidden for us and one of them 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.269
 is for example the possibility of 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.830
 release a completely made armor 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.340
 of shit but a hormone only 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.400
 student weapons and weapons weapons weapons 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.350
 Armor and tools made 100% of 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.690
 fucking shit to see let's grab this 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.760
 over here and we're going to leave it here and 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.840
 they want to use good armor because 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.030
 it's because there's no perfect there and we're going 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.130
 to give us a pair of pants and we 're going to wear 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.620
 and Cubans will tell me to take me out 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.210
 half heart because basically it's a 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.770
 shit is to say will protect me half 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.450
 only new heart now the boys 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.950
 as you can see in the improvement dwells the 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.090
 fucking game and flame also has 10 of 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.250
 hurt 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.800
 10 children can be called has 6 of 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.470
 years and this one has 10 or a shit 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.750
 we are doing with our lives but 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.340
 the boys does not matter is not that it affects 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.750
 very much the truth but well let's kill 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.789
 I miss you and how can we die at 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.650
 instantly because it is a power does not 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.360
 leave with a fucking gun is a 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.700
 fucking set would basically be 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.920
 good to eat the shit but good 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.230
 it's a pretty effective way in 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.430
 present that we are talking about 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.710
 totally shit that does not work for 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.240
 No shit fucking though if we go 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.950
 to perform well if it serves because good 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.990
 it adds weapons and weapons that are much 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.880
 better than the diamond so in a way 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.590
 if it serves and it will be a block 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.590
 decoration that is beautiful the truth 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.920
 and good to see now if with this mode and 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.500
 reviewed 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.850
 let's go to basically how to install 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.220
 because there are many people who are late 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.080
 and do not know how to install a shit 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.910
 literally and it's good to see if we're going to 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.910
 go install and we'll see 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.040
 some guys to see basically what there is 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.020
 what to do is download the mod that is 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.000
 in the description if you are going to see a link 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.720
 there basically go in and download the 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.380
 mod 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.090
 the mod is called 71.3 bar 1.7 point 10 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.960
 because this wall evaluation too 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:15.390
 is for 1.5 and for 1.6 if I do not 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.520
 I'm with 1.8 but some guys to see 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.580
 let's move forward what we want the hit 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.500
 kaká pop mode so let's go back now axis 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.449
 let's go to that is a way to tell 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.759
 but let's give it to run and where 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:30.659
 says open let's write percent 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:32.699
 percent perfect percent data app 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:34.259
 let's hit enter and not improve this 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.210
 folder that is called perfect roaming 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.229
 let's give it minecraft point and let's 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.610
 go to the folder is called mod 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:40.560
 obviously that having the forge for the 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.120
 version 1.7 points previously installed 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.770
 that the description will also suffice 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.050
 let's give open mods and let's put 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.729
 the mod hit and we're going to hit it in that 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.439
 folder and these guys that we'll have the 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:51.180
 little world kaka mod practice 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:52.710
 installed to be able to use it and now 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.330
 guys there's not much more to say I hope 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.639
 they liked this review because for 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.900
