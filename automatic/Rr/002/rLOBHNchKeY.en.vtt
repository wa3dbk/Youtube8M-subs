00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.390
 Greetings to all of us here we are again 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.570
 with a new video this time 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.750
 we present a video the view of 'toy 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:26.349
 story ' that disney pixar has just released 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.189
 for the Android operating system a 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:33.430
 three- dimensional game a game of 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.219
 puzzle where you have to help gandhi 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.120
 with your favorite toy next to books and 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:42.010
 the other characters in the movie to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.170
 kill the aliens through the 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.879
 use of first level logic as 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.579
 can appreciate here consists of 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.890
 drag the finger to aim lift 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.550
 or to launch and finish the 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.190
 aliens let's put on continue and 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.440
 as you can appreciate here simply 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.710
 you try surely have three 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.059
 shots of you trying to use these 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.619
 shots for 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.960
 end three Indians in the middle 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:14.280
 in less time possible I will walk here 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.979
 you have to use these shots to point 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.390
 shoot and earn point to pass 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.390
 to the other level 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.000
 the first levels are easier but 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.520
 as you go forward the 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.399
 more difficult thing here is an option if 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.380
 you want to play the stage again for 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.990
 get better score and you should use 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.080
 the same logic and try to use less 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:44.289
 shot to knock down a bigger possible 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:46.509
 of these as a finalized level we are going to 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.060
 move on to the other so they can see 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.360
 also here touch the tab to go 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.220
 left to right to look better 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.009
 place to throw here with this 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.119
 inflection look for the position better than 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.310
 have if you shoot you can be able to 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:08.130
 all fall at the same time and so use 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.130
 less shots and more effectiveness 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.240
 in this also the same thing we can use 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.610
 the arrows 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.300
 the wood is here the beach and 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:40.280
 look for a better angle to throw and 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:45.380
 have higher score and better accuracy 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:50.320
 to look for the point here 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.320
 what are we going to look for and are we going to launch 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.980
 let's see if we paint ourselves killing everything 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:58.909
 once you have to look for a better score and 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.819
 better angle to launch one as they have 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:04.159
 seen now with a single shot 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.549
 if you want more score and you may see 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.930
 the three star scores 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.209
 will unblock before again I repeat the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.290
 very entertaining game is a game of 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:18.019
 thought what and try 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.800
 unlock level using logic let's 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:24.020
 to look for the angle 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.790
 best angle to only use 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.990
 fewer possible launches and thus win 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.990
 best score 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.060
 It seems that it has not been like an effort 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.060
 let's try again 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.410
 now it seems that yes 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:57.020
 let's try the last batch it seems 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.020
 that has fallen all 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.290
 they just got out he tried it after 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.230
 Tells you bad luck next time 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.400
 try to finish looking for the arrow and 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.400
 look for the best angle angle to 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.400
 shoot 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.260
 still to try again to see yes 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.150
 the star 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.150
 may all be over 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.300
 now it seems that we have achieved 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.600
 it's a well-entertaining game the game of 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:53.090
 thought of using logic to win 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.120
 in this case as we have used two or three 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.539
 attempts we have not won much star 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.430
 so for that it gives you a recommendation 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:03.560
 here gives you a recommendation where 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.870
 says the golden blocks are worth many 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.240
 riveros points all as you can see 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.539
 without looking for the best angle in a single 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.660
 can you shot up the 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:15.979
 aliens and gain level and also under 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.349
 stars as you can appreciate here 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.240
 we have won 33 stars and by winning 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:23.150
 three stars higher score better 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.080
 effectiveness you can unlock the 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.259
 other levels 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.130
 you have to look better better angle for 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:30.130
 can knock it down 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:38.310
 over here we will look for better angle 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:41.400
 to get here and here is your suggestion 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:44.900
 you have to try to throw they arrived 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:48.340
 to these pictures 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.000
 so that everything falls at once and you can 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.000
 do not 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:56.020
 I will try again to see if I already 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:58.869
 you can knock them down all the 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:02.499
 launch has been very smooth has to 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:05.349
 be a little stronger because we have 

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:07.330
 four opportunity at this level now 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:09.789
 we will be able to move from level to final 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.229
 the level but less score and 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:13.989
 only one star because we have 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:16.629
 exhausted all the releases the truth 

00:06:13.989 --> 00:06:18.879
 It is a very relaxing game, very fun 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:21.550
 to play this device 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:23.050
 Android we will get to use as 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.229
 shows the last level that is 13 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.629
 but they are all the same dynamics which 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:31.599
 are you going to try to use less 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:34.360
 possible launches for you to do 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:36.610
 drop all these strange beings or 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.649
 aliens in - possible launch 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:42.189
 this for example is the same as 

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:44.589
 others must try to achieve what 

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:47.019
 he gave himself away and that wick is on 

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:50.180
 so there's an explosion and it ends with 

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:52.440
 all in less possible releases 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.360
 there has been an exclusion but it has not 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:58.110
 killed everything so they're going to have to use 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:01.170
 more releases but you like this 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:03.000
 video review and that you can try it on 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.640
 your device does not think to write it 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.510
 will give in case you like the video and we 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.510
 we see a next
