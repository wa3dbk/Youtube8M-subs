Bang<00:01:20.659> -<00:01:21.409> I<00:01:21.439> guess<00:01:21.830> it's<00:01:22.540> it's<00:01:23.540> not<00:01:24.200> purely<00:01:24.740> an<00:01:24.950> a

be<00:01:32.810> different<00:01:33.350> in<00:01:33.469> that<00:01:33.500> I<00:01:33.890> was<00:01:34.609> really

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
be different in that I was really

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.429 
be different in that I was really
interested<00:01:35.299> in<00:01:35.840> how<00:01:35.899> it<00:01:36.590> was<00:01:36.799> a<00:01:36.829> cube<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:37.939> that

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
interested in how it was a cube and that

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.510 
interested in how it was a cube and that
the<00:01:39.439> cube<00:01:40.039> opens<00:01:40.729> up<00:01:40.939> and<00:01:41.950> there's<00:01:42.950> this<00:01:43.189> thing

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
the cube opens up and there's this thing

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.950 
the cube opens up and there's this thing
where<00:01:43.729> you're<00:01:43.939> looking<00:01:44.390> at<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.719> bang<00:01:44.929> bang

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
where you're looking at the bang bang

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.569 
where you're looking at the bang bang
room<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.890> it's<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.909> really<00:01:47.299> is<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.420> solid

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
room and it's it really is a solid

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.139 
room and it's it really is a solid
object<00:01:49.579> and<00:01:50.499> then<00:01:51.499> when<00:01:51.619> it<00:01:51.710> opens<00:01:52.069> up<00:01:52.310> there's

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
object and then when it opens up there's

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:54.639 
object and then when it opens up there's
this<00:01:53.479> thing<00:01:53.810> where<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.049> kind<00:01:54.380> of<00:01:54.439> like

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
this thing where it kind of like

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.980 
this thing where it kind of like
disappears<00:01:55.399> like<00:01:55.819> in<00:01:55.969> a<00:01:56.030> way<00:01:56.149> it's<00:01:56.390> an<00:01:56.569> object

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
disappears like in a way it's an object

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.399 
disappears like in a way it's an object
that<00:01:57.079> does<00:01:57.380> disappear<00:01:58.719> and<00:01:59.719> then<00:01:59.929> these<00:02:00.049> walls

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
that does disappear and then these walls

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.899 
that does disappear and then these walls
hang<00:02:01.009> out<00:02:01.280> in<00:02:01.609> this<00:02:02.710> kind<00:02:03.710> of<00:02:03.740> floating<00:02:04.369> you're

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
hang out in this kind of floating you're

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.809 
hang out in this kind of floating you're
like<00:02:05.090> they're<00:02:05.240> floating<00:02:05.600> in<00:02:05.960> space<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.979> want

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
like they're floating in space and want

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.400 
like they're floating in space and want
to<00:02:07.850> build<00:02:08.119> this<00:02:08.240> room<00:02:08.569> which<00:02:08.810> completely

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
to build this room which completely

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:18.670 
to build this room which completely
disassembled<00:02:10.280> them<00:02:10.490> and<00:02:12.190> came<00:02:13.190> apart<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:17.680> think

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
disassembled them and came apart I think

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.230 
disassembled them and came apart I think
with<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.280> madhouse<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.780> spinning<00:02:21.290> box<00:02:22.240> what

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
with the madhouse the spinning box what

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.809 
with the madhouse the spinning box what
happens<00:02:23.750> when<00:02:23.990> you're<00:02:24.170> inside<00:02:24.650> if<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.340> ride

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
happens when you're inside if you ride

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.740 
happens when you're inside if you ride
the<00:02:25.850> thing<00:02:27.250> you're<00:02:28.250> physically<00:02:28.970> moving<00:02:29.270> at

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
the thing you're physically moving at

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.540 
the thing you're physically moving at
one<00:02:30.140> speed<00:02:30.560> or<00:02:30.830> at<00:02:30.980> one<00:02:31.220> too

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
one speed or at one too

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.940 
one speed or at one too
direction<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.120> perceptually<00:02:32.930> it's<00:02:33.290> spinning

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
direction and perceptually it's spinning

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.210 
direction and perceptually it's spinning
in<00:02:34.070> another<00:02:34.370> speeders<00:02:35.030> perceptually<00:02:35.960> it's

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
in another speeders perceptually it's

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.740 
in another speeders perceptually it's
spinning<00:02:37.220> in<00:02:37.370> an<00:02:37.490> opposite<00:02:38.030> direction<00:02:38.090> from

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
spinning in an opposite direction from

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.860 
spinning in an opposite direction from
where<00:02:38.990> you're<00:02:39.170> physically<00:02:39.830> spinning

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.650 

consequently<00:02:44.870> you<00:02:45.680> perceptually<00:02:46.660> think

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
consequently you perceptually think

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.170 
consequently you perceptually think
you're<00:02:47.930> standing<00:02:48.440> still<00:02:48.850> but<00:02:49.850> of<00:02:49.940> course

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
you're standing still but of course

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.470 
you're standing still but of course
physically<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:51.650> are<00:02:51.860> spinning<00:02:52.330> thought<00:02:53.330> you

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
physically you are spinning thought you

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.110 
physically you are spinning thought you
could<00:02:53.660> be<00:02:53.810> spinning<00:02:54.260> at<00:02:54.410> forty<00:02:55.100> rpms<00:02:55.610> a<00:02:55.790> minute

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
could be spinning at forty rpms a minute

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.180 
could be spinning at forty rpms a minute
which<00:02:56.930> is<00:02:56.960> pretty<00:02:57.350> fast<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:59.870> it's<00:03:00.230> splitting

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
which is pretty fast so it's splitting

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.930 
which is pretty fast so it's splitting
your<00:03:01.670> how<00:03:02.480> you<00:03:02.840> perceive<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.440> world<00:03:03.790> there<00:03:04.790> is

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
your how you perceive the world there is

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:12.300 
your how you perceive the world there is
a<00:03:04.970> body<00:03:05.270> experience<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:09.490> perceptual<00:03:10.490> viewing

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
a body experience and perceptual viewing

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.810 
a body experience and perceptual viewing
experiences<00:03:13.310> that<00:03:14.180> make<00:03:14.420> sense<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:16.310> does<00:03:16.580> make

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
experiences that make sense it does make

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:25.320 
experiences that make sense it does make
sense<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:22.210> alter<00:03:23.210> or<00:03:23.450> question<00:03:24.160> architecture

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330

conventions<00:03:40.160> again<00:03:41.770> you<00:03:42.770> know<00:03:42.890> sometimes

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430

it's naive sometimes it isn't that is
something<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.600> runs<00:03:50.750> through<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.320> work<00:03:51.500> and

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
something that runs through the work and

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.700 
something that runs through the work and
