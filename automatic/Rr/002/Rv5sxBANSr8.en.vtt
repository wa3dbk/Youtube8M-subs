00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
so see what I mean by I'll make sure

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:53.020 
so see what I mean by I'll make sure
your<00:05:46.460> noodles<00:05:46.790> are<00:05:46.910> not<00:05:47.000> danced<00:05:47.330> off<00:05:50.350> mmm<00:05:52.030> it's

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
and you don't need salt cuz I think the

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:08.530 
and you don't need salt cuz I think the
sauce<00:06:00.650> has<00:06:00.970> enough<00:06:01.970> sodium<00:06:02.210> in<00:06:02.480> there<00:06:07.420> did<00:06:08.420> you

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.540 
sauce has enough sodium in there did you

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.610 
sauce has enough sodium in there did you
have<00:06:08.660> chicken<00:06:09.110> and<00:06:09.290> shrimp
