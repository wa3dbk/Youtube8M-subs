00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:38.629 
slaying at the same time I don't know I

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:40.659 
slaying at the same time I don't know I
thought<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.199> game<00:04:39.469> was<00:04:39.740> like<00:04:39.860> easy<00:04:40.189> enough<00:04:40.490> as

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
thought the game was like easy enough as

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:41.200 
thought the game was like easy enough as
it<00:04:40.789> is

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
it is

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.070 
it is
I<00:04:41.240> don't<00:04:41.990> think<00:04:42.259> we<00:04:42.379> really<00:04:42.680> need<00:04:42.830> that<00:04:43.159> that

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080

here's<00:04:45.080> what<00:04:45.560> it<00:04:45.680> is<00:04:45.710> I<00:04:45.830> guess<00:04:46.310> it<00:04:46.759> could<00:04:46.939> be

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
here's what it is I guess it could be

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.059 
here's what it is I guess it could be
quite<00:04:47.180> useful<00:04:47.300> I<00:04:47.900> didn't<00:04:48.409> really<00:04:48.590> like<00:04:48.800> doing

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 
quite useful I didn't really like doing

quite useful I didn't really like doing
smoking<00:04:49.550> kills<00:04:49.759> but<00:04:50.120> it<00:04:50.960> was<00:04:51.110> worth<00:04:51.289> it<00:04:51.789> so<00:04:52.789> if

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:52.939 
smoking kills but it was worth it so if

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:56.070 
smoking kills but it was worth it so if
you're<00:04:53.090> a<00:04:53.120> level<00:04:53.449> 40<00:04:53.930> if<00:04:54.169> you<00:04:54.409> have<00:04:54.529> 40<00:04:55.370> defense

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
you're a level 40 if you have 40 defense

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.929 
you're a level 40 if you have 40 defense
you<00:04:57.080> can<00:04:57.110> get<00:04:57.469> your<00:04:57.620> hands<00:04:57.949> on<00:04:58.069> a<00:04:58.129> full<00:04:58.669> Slayer
