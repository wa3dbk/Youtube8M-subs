00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 of our machine parts still 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.690
 need bearings to rotate in 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.700
 household appliances industrial machines and 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:15.929
 motor vehicle parts such as 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:18.210
 alternators event inhas this is what 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.730
 is called the groove radial bearing 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.769
 deep it has steel balls that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.470
 moving within tracks calls 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.750
 scrolling the scrolling rails 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.210
 are opened in a game already even if steel of 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.859
 high ball resistance are made 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.930
 of the same type of asthma 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.719
 first they prepare to shape 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.460
 to the rings in the right thickness they 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.309
 insert the lower ring 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.739
 in the outer ring the game then goes through 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.079
 one chopping pain altering the width 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.989
 up to the right thickness 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.980
 the template checks the width of each ring 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.320
 in the exit 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.879
 now and for the inner rings and 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.770
 to wear out your 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.430
 outer circumference and 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.430
 separated 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.470
 the outer ring enters the defor- 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:10.290
 models its outer surface to a 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.720
 diameter circle and a precise one 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.090
 water-based liquid and prevents the ring 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.240
 warm up which would cause warpage 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.070
 the ring is worn out through a 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.070
 jig that checks the diameter 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.039
 then the outer ring rail goes 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.649
 for a roughing a set of wheels of 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.450
 stone with oil cooler model Ã  

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.820
 surface precisely until 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.039
 correct circumference and size 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.500
 the inner ring and the scrolling rail 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.319
 goes through a machine similar to now 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.720
 the rings go to the polish a stone 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.520
 abrasive lubricated with oil 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.659
 surface of the steel until you see a 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.630
 reflection 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.810
 see one before and after 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.030
 next stop wash they cover the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.849
 rings with thick oil on a stone. 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.840
 fine grades clean the rails with which 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:06.670
 they throw elsewhere in the factory they 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.899
 classify the steel balls according to 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.970
 with the size 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.760
 these balls began as threads of 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.829
 machine cuts them into pieces and 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.410
 one form turns them into balls 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:19.180
 coarse balls go to 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.430
 a thinning that removes the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.380
 then other machines 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.690
 they leave round and give a finish of 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.720
 mirror this whole process takes 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.750
 some days the balls go through a 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.350
 furnace to harden and then are 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.480
 clean with a solvency bath 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.720
 after several quality checks 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.389
 the finished balls will be returned 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.510
 these receptacles feed the machine 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:48.880
 automatic mounting 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.519
 the ball feeder sends the balls 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.799
 through tubes to a ball propellant that 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.260
 provides the right amount of balls in the 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.530
 scroll rings of the inner rings and 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:04.079
 external now limited to a splitter 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.079
 balls also positions taxes 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.630
 then comes the ball cage a 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.850
 metal cage that holds the balls in the 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.920
 position and back on rails 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.890
 the first machine and install half the 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.480
 half cage with rivet holes at 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.670
 next machine positions 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:46.790
 the other half of the cage 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:49.310
 the half with the rivets the mark on the forehead 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.440
 and then rotating the sleeve joint with 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.630
 rivets the two halves of the 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.560
 balls the bearing is now fully 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.560
 mounted 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.760
 now it goes to a solvent bath 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.430
 and then for a series of tests 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.980
 automatic quality control 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.540
 this noise and vibration tester 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.700
 rolling bearing performs 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.650
 silently some types of 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.380
 bearings are lubricated with grease 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.900
 a machine exists grace of mode 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.090
 uniform on the bearing rails after 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.290
 inserts a rubber seal to contain the 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.419
 grease a final control test of 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.460
 quality an automated scale 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.130
 discards bad bearings that do not have 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.770
 the weight required for good goes to a 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:42.110
 that brands with information such as 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.110
