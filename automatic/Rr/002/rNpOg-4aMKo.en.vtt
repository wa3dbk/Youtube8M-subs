We've updated our Mobile Banking app
for iPhone and Android. 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.220
So if you already use Mobile Banking,
you'll find it quicker and easier to use;

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.130
and it's also very secure.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.380
You'll be able to use it to log in more
simply than ever before, using just three

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.640
characters from your memorable
information. 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.890
To do this, you'll just need to complete
some security steps the first time you use

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.750
the app, so we associate your mobile
device with your Internet Banking profile.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.920
After that, you can quickly log in to view
all your UK personal accounts and

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.130
balances, easily review your transaction
history and transfer money between your

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.590
eligible accounts in just a few simple
steps

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.490
And you'll find setting up payments to
new and existing payees is now much

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.970
easier too

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.430
You can also use the app to find Bank of
Scotland branches and ATMs, or other

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.670
ATMs on the LINK network

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.200
And whenever you have any questions
about using it, help is available within the

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.750
app. 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.760
We'll also show you messages to keep
you posted on any news.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.600
