also have the place right here so you

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.030 
also have the place right here so you
kids<00:02:17.870> have<00:02:18.019> cooling<00:02:18.440> for<00:02:18.560> your<00:02:18.680> power<00:02:18.860> supply

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
kids have cooling for your power supply

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.430 
kids have cooling for your power supply
so<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.400> can<00:02:19.549> put<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:19.940> fans<00:02:20.209> towards<00:02:20.629> it<00:02:20.750> and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
so you can put the fans towards it and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.750 
so you can put the fans towards it and
also<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.860> bottom<00:02:22.159> of<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.340> which<00:02:22.519> we're<00:02:22.640> going

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
also the bottom of it which we're going

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.130 
also the bottom of it which we're going
to<00:02:22.849> go<00:02:22.940> into<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.209> little<00:02:23.299> bit<00:02:23.450> has<00:02:23.659> a<00:02:23.690> little<00:02:23.989> air

to go into a little bit has a little air

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.550 
to go into a little bit has a little air
filter<00:02:25.629> so<00:02:26.629> it's<00:02:26.750> pretty<00:02:26.900> neat<00:02:27.170> right<00:02:27.319> there

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560

filter so it's pretty neat right there
and<00:02:27.890> I'll<00:02:28.010> keep<00:02:28.159> it<00:02:28.280> clean<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:29.750> is<00:02:29.840> slide<00:02:30.080> in

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
and I'll keep it clean this is slide in

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.570 
and I'll keep it clean this is slide in
slide<00:02:30.500> out<00:02:30.709> so<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.010> don't<00:02:31.190> actually<00:02:31.280> have<00:02:31.459> to
