00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.190
 the example of the crowd the polls already 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.080
 Tuesday, May 27 south touched 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.590
 finally galley consistent rippling 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.740
 on the coast there beach break break out 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.330
 sets of up to five feet and xandÃ£o still 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.460
 due to the tide that did not fill well 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.199
 there's still going to be more at the bottom of the page 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.230
 and here in the peak of matinhos condition is 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.570
 very very good early on with the tide 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.059
 but I know that it has begun to fill the tide 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.969
 the ripple remains consistent though 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.739
 the series takes a little bit higher 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.770
 mainly on the underside of the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.200
 is hitting where it goes there near 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.329
 of the fisherman with walls in Brazil 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.230
 check out the images in the sci fi site 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.559
 parana 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.949
 the galley went in to talk look pump 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.840
 Look at the wall opening the peak of tiny 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.590
 Look there they are down there goes 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.590
 reform 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.350
 There's a gallop picking up 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.590
 this is it 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.590
 did not finally touch 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.200
 look dilma half breaking carioca pedro 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.140
 with other images is the good of 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.700
 another series there behind lazio 9 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.290
 the bunch, that's it guys coming in there 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.070
 it's a series but it's an intermediate wave 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.420
 there is a somewhat irregular fault 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.330
 here on the stone side 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.970
 she gives that reformed one and that 's where 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.000
 I'll try to record one there 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.940
 down to the guys singing a series 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.690
 irregular there behind the stone reported 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.980
 a good wall here on the side is like this 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.480
 some forming good walls there 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.930
 I'm going to try to record one for 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:57.280
 you look at the image of the brave beach 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.020
 he only leaned against it a little 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.900
 irregular according to the direction of the 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.700
 yellow population beginning to fill the 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.410
 proportional in some moments in the 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.700
 walls but still opening it was 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.700
 closing everything well 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.060
 what I said here the regular team 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.870
 still because the moment has costanzo nÃ© 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:24.280
 but there the right opened there already we will have 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.280
 plus a rocking swing at rowan 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.820
 enough ripple in the area 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.650
 you can regulate but the tide will fill 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.890
 enough then I will improve the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.890
 rights 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.310
 and that's when past information gets dirty 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.310
 best surf site Parana 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.730
 she's going into the series there plus one 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.730
 Brave recording here 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.970
 is that the wave is still balanced 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:08.560
 closing fast but rather size 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.560
 consistency in series a and b
