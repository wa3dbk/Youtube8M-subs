00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
well i think had two of the biggest

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
they broke those long runs that was a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.840

around<00:00:56.120> I<00:00:56.330> think<00:00:56.659> that's<00:00:56.839> where<00:00:57.050> they<00:00:57.110> can

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:57.229

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:58.810 
around I think that's where they can
have<00:00:57.409> some<00:00:57.559> success<00:00:57.589> against<00:00:58.100> Green<00:00:58.309> Bay<00:00:58.339> now

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
have some success against Green Bay now

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
you look at the first matchup they were

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.630 
you look at the first matchup they were
able<00:01:00.170> to<00:01:00.350> throw<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.589> football<00:01:00.739> at<00:01:01.100> ease

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
able to throw the football at ease

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.009 
able to throw the football at ease
against<00:01:01.970> Green<00:01:02.180> Bay<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.449> problem<00:01:02.780> was<00:01:02.900> they

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
against Green Bay the problem was they

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.930 
against Green Bay the problem was they
couldn't<00:01:03.229> run<00:01:03.440> to<00:01:03.830> chew<00:01:04.040> off<00:01:04.159> the<00:01:04.190> clock<00:01:04.519> this

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.160 
couldn't run to chew off the clock this
is<00:01:05.120> where<00:01:05.300> I<00:01:05.330> think<00:01:05.630> they<00:01:05.720> can<00:01:05.750> have<00:01:06.020> an

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
is where I think they can have an

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.600 
is where I think they can have an
advantage<00:01:06.470> by<00:01:06.920> running<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.430> football

after<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.630> quarterback<00:01:14.659> think<00:01:15.590> that's<00:01:15.770> the

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
after the quarterback think that's the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.110

Turner<00:02:52.659> who's<00:02:52.900> still<00:02:53.140> trying<00:02:53.379> to<00:02:53.440> get<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.560> the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
Turner who's still trying to get to the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.520 
Turner who's still trying to get to the
line<00:02:53.799> of<00:02:53.920> scrimmage<00:02:53.950> right<00:02:54.340> now<00:02:54.519> so<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.090> think

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
line of scrimmage right now so I think

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.080

have some success success as well and
running<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.569> football<00:02:58.720> now<00:02:59.319> you<00:03:00.280> have<00:03:00.370> to

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
running the football now you have to

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.619

going to be vital against the green bay
packers<00:04:12.819> i<00:04:13.150> think<00:04:13.329> val<00:04:13.510> is<00:04:13.660> going<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:13.870> have<00:04:13.989> a

packers i think val is going to have a

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.750 
packers i think val is going to have a
better<00:04:14.290> game<00:04:14.590> than<00:04:14.620> he<00:04:15.040> did<00:04:15.190> against<00:04:15.639> the

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
better game than he did against the

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.670 
better game than he did against the
falcons<00:04:16.209> so<00:04:16.599> safety<00:04:16.959> plate<00:04:17.169> has<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:17.560> be

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
falcons so safety plate has to be

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.830 
falcons so safety plate has to be
important<00:04:18.250> when<00:04:18.370> stopping<00:04:18.880> with<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.419> Giants

here Giants could have won the match up

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.740 
here Giants could have won the match up
in<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.220> earlier<00:04:27.580> meeting<00:04:27.910> this<00:04:28.030> season<00:04:28.240> i'm

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
in the earlier meeting this season i'm

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.909 
in the earlier meeting this season i'm
actually<00:04:28.990> going<00:04:29.289> with<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.500> Giants<00:04:29.800> in<00:04:29.860> this

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
actually going with the Giants in this

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.310 
actually going with the Giants in this
game<00:04:30.099> against<00:04:30.490> still<00:04:30.789> week<00:04:31.479> 13<00:04:31.960> or<00:04:32.169> we

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
game against still week 13 or we

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.930 
game against still week 13 or we
whenever<00:04:32.680> they<00:04:32.800> played<00:04:33.039> and<00:04:33.250> now<00:04:33.580> I<00:04:33.849> think

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
whenever they played and now I think

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.670 
whenever they played and now I think
they<00:04:34.240> still<00:04:34.479> match<00:04:34.780> up<00:04:35.020> well<00:04:35.199> with<00:04:35.229> the<00:04:35.500> Green

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
they still match up well with the Green

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.589 
they still match up well with the Green
Bay<00:04:35.830> Packers<00:04:35.860> I<00:04:36.460> think<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:36.880> Giants<00:04:37.270> go<00:04:37.419> up<00:04:37.479> to

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
Bay Packers I think the Giants go up to

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.420 
Bay Packers I think the Giants go up to
Green<00:04:37.780> Bay<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:38.199> play<00:04:38.590> a<00:04:38.620> well<00:04:38.979> balanced

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
Green Bay and play a well balanced

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.790 
Green Bay and play a well balanced
offensive<00:04:39.580> game<00:04:40.330> and<00:04:40.570> I<00:04:40.930> think<00:04:41.139> it<00:04:41.470> that<00:04:41.590> extra

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
offensive game and I think it that extra

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.529 
offensive game and I think it that extra
stop<00:04:42.159> on<00:04:42.370> defense<00:04:42.400> due<00:04:42.909> to<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.120> plate<00:04:43.360> of

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
stop on defense due to the plate of

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.510 
stop on defense due to the plate of
