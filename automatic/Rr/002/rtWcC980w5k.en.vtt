00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello everyone with you company but the tiger 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.790
 and today we'll talk about acer laptop 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.950
 aspire v5 572 g is pretty interesting 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.509
 ultrabook because it's 15-inch and 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.759
 It has good gaming 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.830
 features official logo 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.750
 ultrabook is nowhere on the body there but 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.310
 in general, and 30 minutes of work because he 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.140
 thin light compact in general 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.560
 he meets almost all conditions 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.000
 here is a 15 6 inch display full hd gps and 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.980
 at the same time matte that is, the display for 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.849
 such a machine is just awesome plus it 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.619
 inexpensive 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.090
 as for performance here 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.790
 intel core low voltage processor 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.260
 third generation video card gt 750m 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.149
 That is, in theory, everything should be in games 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.890
 more or less pretty very light and 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.140
 thin machine is really exactly 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.750
 ultrabook plastic case from all 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.910
 sides matte cover and now see 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.980
 to ports then here is not very much like 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.949
 in all ultrabooks there are only 3 yusb and 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.750
 with 2 usb version 2 0 and on the back 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.760
 there is a special gd connector on the side 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.260
 which is in a smaller asterisk with this 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.090
 A special connector to it is an adapter 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.250
 until the normal thickness of the body 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.350
 is about 21 millimeters and what 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.250
 concerns weight it is about two 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.600
 kilo that is for 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.119
 a fifteen inch laptop that's all 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.330
 great and now look at gt games 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.369
 750m to ddr3 with us and in general it 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.170
 The video card is quite good but here 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.180
 that most likely rests on the process and 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.009
 crisis 3 is the lowest setting and 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.140
 as you can see it still sags 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.780
 frames that is you will not play in krayzis 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.890
 3 normal on this machine hitman 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.080
 absolution on medium settings 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.939
 more or less playable but again 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.430
 here the whole process is punished because 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.680
 core i5 3330 7th is low voltage 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.270
 processor its frequency is only 18 gigahertz 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.880
 basic but there turbo boost of course is 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.280
 but he does not save the situation tomb raider 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.740
 2013 at medium settings is quite on 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.720
 the background goes bad and if you note this 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.729
 If you lower the resolution, then everything will be 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.130
 much better this metro like you 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.689
 lowest benchmark squat their magnet 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.630
 the number of frames is just ridiculous there 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.049
 1517 is not playable but if lowered 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.969
 a resolution of 1280 by 800 drags the next 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.250
 there will be a screenshot yes as you can see already 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.370
 becomes the average number of frames 35 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.620
 that is, already playable 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.900
 battlefield 3 again get 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.060
 we test at medium settings and in 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.310
 In general, 25 26 is also not that is, you 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.480
 seriously playing in the battlefield then you are not 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.280
 You can play at low settings 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.440
 graphics or lower resolution 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.940
 world of tanks mean settings here 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.650
 here that exactly rests on the process a 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.780
 because tanks processor dependent 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.550
 the grail of the process is still weak 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.280
 on medium settings it is less possible 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.410
 play look at the synthetic test 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.390
 and I do a little pores primacy of the whole 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.890
 this machine is not for and somehow if you are looking 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.660
 gaming laptop then this thing is not for you 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.160
 It is suitable only for you 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.350
 if you want to play games and 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.610
 really care about the size and weight here 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.320
 I am really thin and light apparatus 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.940
 which is easy to carry and well 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.400
 which allows you to play some games 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.020
 in dota there tanks would buy a little while 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.700
 for serious games it is better to look for something 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.160
 with a normal process or even with more 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.080
 powerful video card if the games are for you 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.730
 are not the main task then this 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.410
 the machine is just great because again 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.000
 do the same on thin and light and 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.200
 productive enough for everyone 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.150
 main tasks that you can 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.580
 use now look at the display 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.980
 as can be said here 15 6 inches 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.470
 matt display full hd resolution and 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.450
 the display here is ps i.e. such a length 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.070
 the price will turn out without display it is quite and 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.810
 quite cool I wouldn't say that 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.860
 the best without display of all that we are 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.230
 he saw in general it is enough 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.000
 Mediocre quality but still angles 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.380
 He has a much better review than in the so-called. and 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.680
 plus it is matte does not glare and 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.730
 color rendering is quite good 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.959
 the speaker system is here again 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.970
 pretty mediocre level 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.590
 ultrabooks have practically all acoustics 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.510
 does not shine except there asus zenbook 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.010
 which at least something is less here in 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.440
 In general, then the usual speakers are nothing 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.590
 we donâ€™t have to expect anything special from them 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.000
 So 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.920
 display and sound we figured out now 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.720
 look at the keyboard workspace 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.160
 there is one interesting part of the case 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.530
 us plastic as we said 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.150
 matt not really koneva stick 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.400
 fingerprints in general everything is enough 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.320
 ok here is a small area for us and 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.940
 as for the keyboard it is good 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.680
 fixed nowhere bends but 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.180
 keys very very small move that is 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.900
 the keyboard is almost flat there 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.670
 literally 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.680
 millimeter 2 millimeters are not heated 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.390
 now the most interesting detail as 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.010
 can see at the top something is missing 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.420
 But there is not enough power button here 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.129
 which would be nice to be 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.900
 it is here instead of the button 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.400
 inclusions is on the left side this 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.110
 very small button and when we take 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.819
 laptop for carrying like this for example 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.530
 student he is very often not by chance 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.900
 clicked and I even put in the options 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.370
 disconnect and the touchpad is quite normal here 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.539
 pressed naturally anywhere 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.609
 supports multitouch 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.080
 and everything is quite good with them as for 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.039
 working area temperatures you can 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.080
 see them on screen 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.360
 very well heated middle part but 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.470
 being nervous is cool enough but we 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.240
 plastic black 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.860
 there is also a lot of ventilation 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.690
 holes they suck air a 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.610
 blown burning exhaust back their 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.680
 two fans 2 exhaust ports 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.690
 here two speakers is the speaker at 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.130
 us is at the bottom and in order to 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.139
 get in we need to spin 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.210
 just an astronomical number of screws 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.229
 answer everywhere I do not remember how many but them 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.910
 lots and lots 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.860
 after that the cover can be removed on 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.139
 removed all entirely and we fall 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.880
 inside our laptop 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.250
 we start with the cooling system here 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.259
 we have two fans and as for 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.599
 noise there is a cube very well made noise under 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.070
 load simple they can barely hear the rustle 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:04.690
 as for the temperature inside 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.870
 no one can see them on screen 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.610
 average temperature of 67 degrees and up to 88 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.110
 all this bounce but in general 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.389
 pretty good for such a machine 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.060
 considering its manufacturer carp there everything 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:19.000
 know pir battery here battery on 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.979
 3000 650 milliampere hours or 53 two 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.870
 1000 hours of decay laptop lasted 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.090
 about 5 hours with standard mode 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.770
 can count on 3-4 hours to 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.199
 hard drive 500 hard drive 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.159
 gigabyte 5400 rpm from 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.780
 seagate companies 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:33.430
 he has a feature that's thin 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.840
 hard drive its thickness is only 7 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.520
 millimeters i.e. standard hard 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.650
 drives do not fit here need to look 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.070
 thin only look at the operational 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.289
 memory 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.240
 total laptops we have preinstalled 8 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.610
 gigabyte one of the varieties is free here 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.409
 planochka stands at 4 GB and more 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.419
 four gigabytes stitched on the mother 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:49.840
 a fee near the garden is located and swap them 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.760
 can't 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.349
 for those who want to install when 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.909
 hoarding a laptop right here 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.889
 there is an empty so the slot 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:58.330
 emin there you can buy it sata ssd and 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.800
 set because instead of 7 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.659
 meter hard drive you are unlikely 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.900
 find create lies lies 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:05.550
 The speakers here are just a plug AV 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.560
 there are two cute speakers with 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.720
 each side of the significant made by 2 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.870
 probably better look a little more 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.150
 externally on acer aspire v5 572 g laptop 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.490
 quite stylish machine is very thin 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.020
 easy and this is its main advantage then 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.060
 there is the fact that it is such a morning 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.860
 ordinary but it is unofficially ultrabook but 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.080
 i still call here like this 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.270
 Excellent display ips matrix with good 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.639
 viewing angles matte full hd resolution 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.470
 everything is just fine small minus it 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.300
 the fact that there are practically no ports on the sides 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.910
 they are all behind but + button
