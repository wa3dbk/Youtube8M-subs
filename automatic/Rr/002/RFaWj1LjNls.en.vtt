testers did not like it now think about
this<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.510> when<00:00:33.690> they<00:00:33.780> do<00:00:33.840> test<00:00:34.350> when<00:00:35.040> they

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
this is that when they do test when they

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.830 
this is that when they do test when they
have<00:00:35.250> testers<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.850> everything<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.360> would

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
have testers and everything I would

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
imagine some of the times they get new

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.670 
imagine some of the times they get new
people<00:00:39.120> they<00:00:39.239> get<00:00:39.390> their<00:00:39.600> family<00:00:40.079> or<00:00:40.320> people

that they can trust to go in in test
games<00:00:44.120> besides<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.480> point<00:00:45.719> they<00:00:46.140> decided<00:00:46.680> to

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
games besides that point they decided to

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.250 
games besides that point they decided to
cut<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.160> because<00:00:47.309> Halo<00:00:48.149> Force<00:00:48.420> learning<00:00:48.960> curve

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
cut it because Halo Force learning curve

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.709 
cut it because Halo Force learning curve
made<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.920> more<00:00:50.100> MIT<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.460> more<00:00:50.670> accessible<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
made it more MIT and more accessible to

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.410 
made it more MIT and more accessible to
the<00:00:51.870> mass<00:00:52.170> market<00:00:52.680> now<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.910> kind<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.149> bad

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the mass market now this is kind of bad

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.119 
the mass market now this is kind of bad
and<00:00:54.690> good<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.110> both<00:00:55.260> ways<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.770> good<00:00:55.920> for

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
and good in both ways it's good for

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.700 
and good in both ways it's good for
business<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.760> good<00:00:57.000> recruiting<00:00:57.660> people<00:00:58.050> but

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
business is good recruiting people but

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.229 
business is good recruiting people but
it's<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.100> question<00:00:59.609> if<00:00:59.730> they're<00:00:59.879> going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.180> add

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
it's a question if they're going to add

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.869 
it's a question if they're going to add
more<00:01:00.570> complex<00:01:01.140> weapons<00:01:01.530> than<00:01:01.710> Halo<00:01:01.890> 5<00:01:02.190> will

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
more complex weapons than Halo 5 will

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.670 
more complex weapons than Halo 5 will
they<00:01:03.030> actually<00:01:03.239> bring<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.870> gun<00:01:04.080> called<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
they actually bring a gun called the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.660 
they actually bring a gun called the
stasis<00:01:05.070> gun<00:01:05.460> or<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:07.710> or<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.280> guess<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.580> how

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
stasis gun or and and or I guess is how

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.460 
stasis gun or and and or I guess is how
you<00:01:08.729> would<00:01:08.880> say<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> grapple<00:01:09.600> harpoon<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.260> Halo

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
you would say a grapple harpoon for Halo

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.920 
you would say a grapple harpoon for Halo
4<00:01:10.860> sounds<00:01:11.520> very<00:01:11.670> interesting<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.420> really<00:01:12.720> hope

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.780 
4 sounds very interesting I really hope
they<00:01:13.110> do<00:01:13.320> bring<00:01:13.560> these<00:01:13.740> mysterious<00:01:14.220> weapons

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790

release<00:01:46.829> date<00:01:47.189> now<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.759> isn't<00:01:48.090> really<00:01:48.360> that

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
release date now that isn't really that

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.090 
release date now that isn't really that
doesn't<00:01:48.810> really<00:01:49.079> mean<00:01:49.380> much<00:01:49.409> at<00:01:49.770> all<00:01:49.890> of

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
doesn't really mean much at all of

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.740 
doesn't really mean much at all of
course<00:01:50.340> they<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.610> release<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> game<00:01:51.180> but

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
course they can release the game but

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.719 
course they can release the game but
think<00:01:51.960> about<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.259> they<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.409> started<00:01:53.130> halo<00:01:53.399> 5

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
think about it they just started halo 5

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.359 
think about it they just started halo 5
scripting<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.689> concept<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.560> back<00:01:55.829> last

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
scripting and concept in back last

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.999 
scripting and concept in back last
summer<00:01:56.880> or<00:01:57.180> as<00:01:57.750> far<00:01:58.020> as<00:01:58.140> we<00:01:58.290> know<00:01:58.500> anyways<00:01:58.829> they

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
summer or as far as we know anyways they

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.469 
summer or as far as we know anyways they
may<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.280> started<00:01:59.610> doing<00:01:59.850> more<00:02:00.090> things<00:02:00.149> than

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
may have started doing more things than

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.240 
may have started doing more things than
that<00:02:00.630> assuming<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.469> they're<00:02:01.649> using<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.070> Halo

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
that assuming that they're using a Halo

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.039 
that assuming that they're using a Halo
4<00:02:02.460> inch<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:02.850> also<00:02:03.090> they're<00:02:03.570> also<00:02:03.840> caught

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
4 inch and they also they're also caught

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.100 
4 inch and they also they're also caught
up<00:02:04.170> with<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.909> hey<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.719> splat

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
have anything to do will they possibly

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.920 
have anything to do will they possibly
release<00:02:25.710> a<00:02:25.920> trailer<00:02:26.520> for<00:02:26.730> Halo<00:02:26.850> 5<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.660> might

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
release a trailer for Halo 5 that might

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.810 
release a trailer for Halo 5 that might
release<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:29.000> 2015<00:02:30.000> or<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.360> mean<00:02:30.660> 2014's

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
release in 2015 or I mean 2014's

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.980 
release in 2015 or I mean 2014's
December<00:02:32.820> because<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.420> seems<00:02:33.660> like<00:02:33.870> the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
December because that seems like the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.630 
December because that seems like the
most<00:02:34.020> reasonable<00:02:34.620> thing<00:02:34.950> they're<00:02:35.310> going<00:02:35.550> to

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
most reasonable thing they're going to

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.830 
most reasonable thing they're going to
be<00:02:35.760> possibly<00:02:36.450> talking<00:02:37.080> about<00:02:37.320> Halo<00:02:37.560> 5<00:02:37.980> and

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
be possibly talking about Halo 5 and

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.430 
be possibly talking about Halo 5 and
maybe<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:40.140> course<00:02:40.410> most<00:02:40.890> likely<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.460> Xbox<00:02:41.910> 720

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
maybe of course most likely the Xbox 720

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.540 
maybe of course most likely the Xbox 720
kind<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.500> losing<00:02:43.740> my<00:02:43.830> focus<00:02:44.040> here<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.400> little

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
kind of losing my focus here a little

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.520 
kind of losing my focus here a little
bit<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:44.730> we'll<00:02:45.030> go<00:02:45.180> ahead<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.570> start<00:02:45.780> talking

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
bit so we'll go ahead and start talking

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.100 
bit so we'll go ahead and start talking

reminds<00:03:11.580> me<00:03:11.610> of<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:12.180> halo<00:03:12.630> 3<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.560> guess<00:03:14.160> going

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
reminds me of the halo 3 I guess going

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.180 
reminds me of the halo 3 I guess going
on<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.090> steam<00:03:15.390> page<00:03:15.690> thing<00:03:16.080> which<00:03:16.770> was

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
on to the steam page thing which was

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.330 
on to the steam page thing which was
actually<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:18.060> hoax<00:03:19.020> it<00:03:19.350> wasn't<00:03:19.770> real<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.190> it

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
actually a hoax it wasn't real and it

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.010 
actually a hoax it wasn't real and it
was<00:03:20.520> just<00:03:20.880> for<00:03:21.209> something<00:03:21.540> else<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.990> just

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
was just for something else it just

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.870 
was just for something else it just
turned<00:03:22.470> out<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.650> Microsoft<00:03:23.310> said<00:03:23.520> they<00:03:23.670> have

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
turned out that Microsoft said they have

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.840 
turned out that Microsoft said they have
no<00:03:24.030> plans<00:03:24.300> for<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.990> will<00:03:25.170> 3<00:03:25.350> going<00:03:25.650> on<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:26.100> PC

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
no plans for it will 3 going on the PC

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.180 
no plans for it will 3 going on the PC
or<00:03:27.030> steam<00:03:27.360> so<00:03:28.050> of<00:03:28.290> course<00:03:28.530> this<00:03:28.709> could<00:03:28.980> be<00:03:29.160> a

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
or steam so of course this could be a

a<00:05:33.000> trailer<00:05:33.479> every<00:05:33.690> year<00:05:33.930> because<00:05:34.260> remember

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
a trailer every year because remember

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.339 
a trailer every year because remember
the<00:05:35.220> trailer<00:05:35.639> if<00:05:35.880> they<00:05:36.030> release<00:05:36.330> it<00:05:36.539> this<00:05:36.810> e3

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:39.260

that<00:05:37.530> would<00:05:37.860> be<00:05:37.949> about<00:05:38.130> two<00:05:38.430> years<00:05:38.669> ago<00:05:38.880> that

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
they released it on 2011 so something to

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.969 
they released it on 2011 so something to
think<00:05:42.360> about<00:05:42.479> that<00:05:42.810> they're<00:05:42.960> not<00:05:43.440> releasing<00:05:43.740> a

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979
