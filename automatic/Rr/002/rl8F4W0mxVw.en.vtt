00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello friends how are you guillermo 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.420
 of larrivey and this time I'm going to 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.150
 show a preview of how is the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.469
 4.3 version of android for the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.320
 high-end samsung devices which 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.470
 Are these Samsung Galaxy S3 Samsung 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.990
 galaxy no and samsung galaxy no two 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.300
 international versions we get from 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.730
 let's say this group to samsung 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.119
 galaxy s 4 is a newer device 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.420
 whose android 4.3 update already 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.219
 is on the street but not like that in 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.180
 devices that I mentioned before and 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.960
 that samsung forgiveness had promised 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.030
 update by jumping to version 4.2 like this 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.340
 what we're going to do is show you 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.030
 on the samsung galaxy no 2 device 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.039
 a filtered version of android 4.3 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.039
 let's get directly into the device 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.379
 but 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.570
 no no 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.960
 we are in the device then what 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.020
 first thing we notice is that the screen 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.170
 Lock is similar to that of the Samsung 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.650
 galaxy s 4 then unlocked the 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.950
 device and here the only visual change 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.729
 what are we gonna see 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.850
 let me say focus a little bit the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.580
 camera is let's say 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.490
 to highlight everything is the same however 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.280
 let's say you can see that here the buttons 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.409
 of the home are different from those 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.630
 we were used to and they are 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.980
 similar to those of the galaxy us 3 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.170
 additionally let's see the 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.880
 configuration let me show you something else 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.400
 what is this 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.130
 let's say this menu is similar to what 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.140
 we had let me focus a little better 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.660
 so they see the whole device is similar to 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.740
 the screen that we had 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.810
 traditionally but these two are added 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.400
 buttons that has to do here with the 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.140
 configuration and here with activate or 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.890
 deactivate 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.460
 the functions of the menu 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.750
 If shortcuts and say to 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.340
 configuration notice that the 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:30.430
 configuration here is already ready 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:34.690
 according to different flaps as is the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.990
 samsung galaxy s 4 if we are going to have everything 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.900
 what is the connection corresponding 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.630
 nfc is that via devices nearby 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.860
 they wrote link we see after we have 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.760
 everything that has to do with the 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.130
 device if with the configuration of 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.100
 indicator screen device 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.170
 of led and others that we were already 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.989
 let's say we already had it in the versions 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.590
 previous everything that has to do with 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.370
 user accounts and finally what 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.440
 what does it have to do 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.239
 let's say with the storage battery 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.190
 and what was not classified in 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.400
 previous 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.970
 categories let's then know about 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:20.380
 of the device piquense android version 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:23.800
 4.3 galaxy moat gtm 7000 version of 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.350
 the base band is mi6 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.870
 up here let's say is what we can see 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.480
 and what we can notice in terms of 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.410
 changes in the graphic interface but 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.930
 besides this error have other things like that 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.240
 that as it is a red cardboard is to say that 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.900
 they grab the filtered version of what is 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:48.220
 Android 4.3 and they installed some 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:52.040
 mods of the galaxy no 13 say what 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.450
 first we can notice this is 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.330
 everything that has to do with note of 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.459
 action files plays samsung or some 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.100
 things I was taking them out let's say some 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.150
 things can be drawn into the aroma 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.939
 install this rum 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.390
 here we have the sketch box and some 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:13.170
 other things more than samsung 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:17.010
 yes but I think that what more 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:21.390
 have fun with the samsung galaxy mods 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.520
 note 3 is this let me put again and 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:27.509
 what does it have to do with 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.419
 look with the command of airs and 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:33.840
 notice there we have another album version 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:37.560
 write it on lcd finder 'screen and 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.270
 pencil window the more features 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.580
 interesting I think about this and the ones that 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.009
 I'm going to show quickly you have to see 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.680
 with the action note 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:49.050
 the action note is not left to us 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.539
 take this out lets us associate a 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.669
 determined of command with some action 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:56.720
 in that place if a certain notice 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:05:00.389
 of drawing a robber touched this button 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.949
 let's say and tell me what happens when I draw 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.139
 an arroba I want you to work the mail 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.940
 whenever I open this email, I do not like 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.050
 I have configured the actions of 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.539
 mail I will not have any mail 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.030
 yes with which I will not have anything 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:16.550
 still and save me the address note 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.010
 here we are not going to keep it 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.840
 but I could keep that action and in 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.520
 second place what I think too 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.100
 very interesting is the pencil window 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.280
 pencil window basically what 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.560
 allows me to draw a window here and 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.320
 is going to ask me what application I want 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.230
 open let's see on youtube 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.030
 finally let's draw another window 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.580
 pencil 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.500
 here 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:46.600
 if we were going to open then the whatsapp 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:51.130
 and notice that you are bandaged in 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:54.580
 let's say move and there are the 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:57.909
 go moving through the screen like this 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:01.030
 which what we say makes them 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:04.409
 open multiple screens and this let's say 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.849
 is not similar to what they already had in the 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:09.490
 multi windows because the world continues 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:12.069
 being yes what allows us to handle and 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.139
 They drew multiple screens and look 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:16.360
 here we have the multi window the 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:18.550
 multi configuration with no change and 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.129
 as I have a mode I have all the 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:24.310
 applications and not just some 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:27.250
 applications but really this rom 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.960
 I have to say that it really works 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.380
 very well we have 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.479
 we have not found any side does 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:38.389
 a couple of days that I'm using it 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:40.940
 I really do not have any kind of complaint 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:43.639
 in this respect we are going to close this 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:46.729
 screen if we are going to make this screen 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:48.770
 here and then some additional question 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:50.500
 that I'm going to show you for example the 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.360
 sketch book 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:56.599
 if we have here 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.090
 I do not know where I have it here the sketch yes 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:01.160
 who can make a drawing command can 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.169
 to incorporate 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.449
 websites and send by 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:09.750
 mail and draw over really 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:12.900
 let's say that I think the truth is worth 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:15.539
 the penalty and let's say look at me let me show 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.550
 that is something else that finder ' what 

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:20.370
 allows us to search the device 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:24.360
 and in all the notes that we were making 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:26.430
 allows us to search for content if you look 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.340
 like I do not have anything because I just 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:31.259
 make a clean installation of a 

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.840
 updated version of the rom that I had not 

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:37.569
 I have nothing but can search for music 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:39.939
 or we have for any other 

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:41.830
 category they have in that place to 

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:44.409
 as they go using it so good 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:47.349
 that's all I hope that that has 

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:50.339
 liked and I make them a little more anxious 

00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:52.539
 respect you have to wait when the 

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:54.939
 official update although I have to 

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:56.740
 to say that it's going to cost me a bit to go to 

00:07:54.939 --> 00:07:59.860
 the official update because this rom 

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:03.099
 It is very very good and the samsung mods 

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:05.409
 galaxy no 3 really are very attractive 

00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:07.209
 so good as always if you liked it 

00:08:05.409 --> 00:08:09.099
 the video gives you a like if you did not like it 

00:08:07.209 --> 00:08:12.369
 leave recommendations so that 

00:08:09.099 --> 00:08:14.830
 next is better and we are seeing each other 

00:08:12.369 --> 00:08:16.629
 in the next video thank you and I do not know
