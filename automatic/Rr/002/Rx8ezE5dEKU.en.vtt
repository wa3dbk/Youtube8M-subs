show you how to get in it okay guys I'm

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.869 
show you how to get in it okay guys I'm
back<00:00:50.930> this<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.199> how<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.980> get<00:00:53.219> into<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> ditch

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
back this is how you get into the ditch

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.069 
back this is how you get into the ditch
so<00:00:54.140> you<00:00:55.140> need<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.559> go<00:00:56.360> this<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.629> kind<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.020> a

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
so you need to go this is kind of like a

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.380 
so you need to go this is kind of like a
barrier<00:00:58.500> here<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.609> need<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.940> go<00:01:00.059> bit

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
barrier here so you need to go bit

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.139 
barrier here so you need to go bit
beneath<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.649> bit<00:01:01.980> beneath<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.699> bit<00:01:02.940> behind

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
beneath it a bit beneath it a bit behind

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.719 
beneath it a bit beneath it a bit behind
it<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.750> then<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.530> aim<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:05.309> part<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
it and then you aim for this part of the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.179 
it and then you aim for this part of the
tree<00:01:06.000> here<00:01:06.270> shoot<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.170> paralyzer<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.979> jump

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
tree here shoot your paralyzer and jump

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.120 
tree here shoot your paralyzer and jump
towards<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.200> if<00:01:10.200> you're<00:01:10.409> lucky<00:01:10.619> you'll

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
towards it and if you're lucky you'll

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.039 
towards it and if you're lucky you'll
get<00:01:11.340> into<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.930> can

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
get into it like that and then you can

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.980 
get into it like that and then you can
move<00:01:13.170> forward<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.619> little<00:01:13.799> bit<00:01:13.950> still<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.990> then

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
move forward a little bit still and then

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.670 
move forward a little bit still and then
basically<00:01:16.290> guys<00:01:16.920> that's<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.460> you're<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.030> if
