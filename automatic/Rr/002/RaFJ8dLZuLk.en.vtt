a little bit later and then prepare for
that<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.840> think<00:01:01.199> seeing<00:01:01.859> how<00:01:02.010> early<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.460> both

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
that I think seeing how early the both

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.429 
that I think seeing how early the both
teams<00:01:02.910> were<00:01:03.059> here<00:01:03.270> today<00:01:03.570> for<00:01:03.629> their<00:01:04.019> ice<00:01:04.170> time

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
they'll be here early anyways I think

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.020 
they'll be here early anyways I think
for<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.540> fans<00:01:06.810> from<00:01:07.380> what<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.590> saw<00:01:08.030> yesterday

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
for the fans from what I saw yesterday

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.760

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
here bright and early so that doesn't

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.120 
here bright and early so that doesn't
really<00:01:12.360> matter<00:01:12.659> but<00:01:13.380> again<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:13.799> look<00:01:13.979> at

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
really matter but again we look at

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.800
