00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:10.770 

now<00:01:03.850> they

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.690 

that's<00:01:11.409> a<00:01:11.560> really<00:01:11.860> good<00:01:12.010> place<00:01:12.280> to<00:01:12.460> win<00:01:12.610> it

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.310 
that's a really good place to win it

nil<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:17.650> pretty<00:01:18.610> evenly<00:01:19.000> matched<00:01:19.090> sides

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.150 

well<00:01:26.050> I<00:01:26.110> guess<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.440> pressures<00:01:26.770> off<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:26.920> bit

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
well I guess the pressures off a bit

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.680 
well I guess the pressures off a bit
today<00:01:27.310> this<00:01:28.180> is<00:01:28.240> a

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
today this is a

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.720 
today this is a
max<00:01:29.050> between<00:01:29.440> two<00:01:29.680> sides<00:01:30.010> are<00:01:30.220> well-known<00:01:30.670> for

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
max between two sides are well-known for

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.910 
max between two sides are well-known for
their<00:01:30.940> goal<00:01:31.210> scoring<00:01:31.570> potential<00:01:32.230> so<00:01:32.770> I<00:01:32.800> think

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
their goal scoring potential so I think

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.470 
their goal scoring potential so I think
the<00:01:33.130> crowd<00:01:33.370> could<00:01:33.610> be<00:01:33.760> in<00:01:33.880> for<00:01:33.910> an<00:01:34.180> enjoyable

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
the crowd could be in for an enjoyable

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.780 
the crowd could be in for an enjoyable
day<00:01:34.800> one<00:01:35.800> or<00:01:35.890> two<00:01:36.010> of<00:01:36.160> the<00:01:36.250> players<00:01:36.490> here

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
day one or two of the players here

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.400 
day one or two of the players here
relaxing<00:01:37.330> a<00:01:37.390> little<00:01:37.420> because<00:01:37.930> they<00:01:38.080> know<00:01:38.260> it's

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
relaxing a little because they know it's

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.470 
relaxing a little because they know it's
not<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.620> same<00:01:38.950> heat<00:01:39.160> of<00:01:39.340> competition<00:01:39.580> Ally

the<00:01:44.950> firm<00:01:45.130> layout<00:01:45.370> disputed<00:01:45.880> as<00:01:46.000> good<00:01:46.480> and

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
the firm layout disputed as good and

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.210 
the firm layout disputed as good and
she'll<00:01:46.810> occasion<00:01:47.260> you<00:01:47.350> do<00:01:47.470> most<00:01:47.650> of<00:01:47.860> the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
she'll occasion you do most of the

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.500 
she'll occasion you do most of the
competitiveness<00:01:48.820> of<00:01:48.970> your<00:01:49.180> late<00:01:49.300> but<00:01:49.420> it

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
competitiveness of your late but it

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.120 
competitiveness of your late but it
certainly<00:01:49.690> gives<00:01:49.930> applause<00:01:50.290> maybe<00:01:50.830> perhaps

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
certainly gives applause maybe perhaps

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.890 
certainly gives applause maybe perhaps
to<00:01:51.340> try<00:01:51.520> one<00:01:51.700> or<00:01:51.790> two<00:01:51.910> things<00:01:51.940> it's<00:01:52.690> here

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
to try one or two things it's here

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.690 
to try one or two things it's here
because<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.230> little<00:01:53.560> bit<00:01:53.650> more<00:01:53.770> like<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.520> wind

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
because a little bit more like the wind

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.160 
because a little bit more like the wind
on<00:01:54.880> we're<00:01:55.000> doing<00:01:55.180> a<00:01:55.240> really<00:01:55.480> competitive<00:01:55.780> game

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
on we're doing a really competitive game

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.690 
on we're doing a really competitive game
and<00:01:56.380> in<00:01:56.650> terms<00:01:56.770> from<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.070> finest<00:01:57.400> point<00:01:57.580> of

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
and in terms from the finest point of

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.880 
and in terms from the finest point of
view<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:58.840> certainly<00:01:59.230> looking<00:01:59.440> forward<00:01:59.500> to

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
view it's certainly looking forward to

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.200 
view it's certainly looking forward to
it<00:01:59.950> they<00:02:00.250> won't<00:02:00.490> look<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:00.850> this<00:02:00.910> has<00:02:01.060> been<00:02:01.090> a

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
it they won't look and this has been a

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:08.639 
it they won't look and this has been a
failure<00:02:01.450> that's<00:02:01.720> for<00:02:01.900> sure

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.919 

yeah<00:02:09.250> well<00:02:09.459> both<00:02:09.640> managers<00:02:10.119> have<00:02:10.239> been<00:02:10.269> pretty

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
yeah well both managers have been pretty

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.690 
yeah well both managers have been pretty
careful<00:02:11.230> about<00:02:11.470> their<00:02:11.799> team<00:02:12.040> selection<00:02:12.549> today

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
careful about their team selection today

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.610 
careful about their team selection today
they've<00:02:13.150> given<00:02:13.599> it<00:02:13.750> plenty<00:02:13.840> of<00:02:14.140> thought<00:02:14.170> it

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
they've given it plenty of thought it

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.770 
they've given it plenty of thought it
was<00:02:14.769> obviously<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.159> little<00:02:15.250> bit<00:02:15.489> of<00:02:15.780> tactical

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
was obviously a little bit of tactical

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.330 
was obviously a little bit of tactical
thinking<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.290> go<00:02:17.439> on<00:02:17.620> here<00:02:17.890> because<00:02:17.980> they<00:02:18.189> know

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
thinking to go on here because they know

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.580 
thinking to go on here because they know
each<00:02:18.489> other<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:18.790> well<00:02:19.000> but<00:02:19.480> we've<00:02:20.200> seen<00:02:20.439> the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
each other so well but we've seen the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.259 
each other so well but we've seen the
two<00:02:20.769> lineups<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.459> we've<00:02:21.640> seen<00:02:21.849> the<00:02:22.000> crowd

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
two lineups and we've seen the crowd

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:31.559 
two lineups and we've seen the crowd
looking<00:02:22.689> very<00:02:23.470> enthusiastic

of<00:03:10.520> football<00:03:10.880> this<00:03:11.000> week<00:03:11.270> this<00:03:11.360> is<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.540> friendly

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
of football this week this is a friendly

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.930 
of football this week this is a friendly
match<00:03:12.200> between<00:03:12.230> two<00:03:12.860> well<00:03:13.130> supported<00:03:13.610> clubs

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
match between two well supported clubs

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.910 
match between two well supported clubs
and<00:03:14.240> I<00:03:14.660> guess<00:03:14.870> I'll<00:03:15.050> you'd<00:03:15.260> have<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.560> say<00:03:15.740> that

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
and I guess I'll you'd have to say that

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.020 
and I guess I'll you'd have to say that
from<00:03:16.010> what<00:03:16.160> we<00:03:16.280> know<00:03:16.430> about<00:03:16.580> them<00:03:16.850> they're

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
from what we know about them they're

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.460 
from what we know about them they're
pretty<00:03:17.240> evenly<00:03:17.600> matched<00:03:17.690> I<00:03:18.170> don't<00:03:18.410> think

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
pretty evenly matched I don't think

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.170 
pretty evenly matched I don't think
there's<00:03:18.710> any<00:03:18.860> talk<00:03:19.010> about<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.310> joint<00:03:19.580> force

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
there's any talk about that joint force

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.280 
there's any talk about that joint force
either<00:03:20.420> plead<00:03:20.660> against<00:03:21.020> each<00:03:21.110> other

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
either plead against each other
