that sentiment seems to be shared by

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.460 
that sentiment seems to be shared by
many<00:01:57.700> in<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:57.970> Muslim<00:01:58.330> world<00:01:58.360> a<00:01:58.870> good

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
many in the Muslim world a good

I<00:02:02.320> think<00:02:03.100> what<00:02:03.370> Muslims<00:02:04.330> would<00:02:04.750> like<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.260> see

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
I think what Muslims would like to see

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.669 
I think what Muslims would like to see
is<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:07.000> America<00:02:07.870> should<00:02:07.900> be<00:02:08.200> an<00:02:08.320> honest

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
is that America should be an honest

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.180 
is that America should be an honest
broker<00:02:09.660> should<00:02:10.660> be<00:02:11.070> fair<00:02:12.070> to<00:02:12.820> all<00:02:12.970> sides<00:02:13.270> and

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
broker should be fair to all sides and

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.880 
broker should be fair to all sides and
once<00:02:15.190> they<00:02:15.430> see<00:02:15.490> said<00:02:15.910> once<00:02:16.330> they<00:02:16.600> see<00:02:16.660> that

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
once they see said once they see that

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.110 
once they see said once they see that
especially<00:02:17.890> from<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.459> President<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
especially from the President of the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.750
