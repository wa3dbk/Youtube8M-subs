 a series where he taught the much more 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.519
 crazy the many weirdest I find 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.760
 is a series that added once every 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.589
 much is worth does not have a continuity of 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.179
 every week for example guys I already know that 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.519

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.260
 for those guys, I wanted to do it 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.690
 in fact these guys are going to start 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.879
 with the second episode since the mods 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.980

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.870
 that I bring right now in your hand if 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.149

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.040
 episode where he teaches the sword of 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.450
 minecraft as it is the first episode of 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.920
 the expensive ones but it's not what you 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.570
 I bring today guys but 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.360
 what I'm going to show you right now 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.380
 we will throw ourselves and I think we are going to 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.509
 flip as I fix the Chinese that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.880
 we have here is something spectacular 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.600
 we have the optimum is prime of the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.940
 transformers completely gta 5 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.509
 ballet look guys the detail is 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.850
 completely spectacular or is it 100% 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.250
 to the detail basically is that I when 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.990
 I 've seen it, I've been freaking out 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.630
 guys and as you can see there is no voltage 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.880
 it's not uncommon to be here in the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.979
 jumps as you are watching and wanted 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.649
 share it with you since I believe 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.960
 that is the most crazy wolf mod I've ever 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.409
 seen for the moment in gta 5 and it deserves 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.869
 I teach because I brought the Bozar 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.700

 transfer guys 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.580

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.910
 bit 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.100

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.390
 This one is not, but it's not guys, because this is 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.220

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.820
 share it you know that this series does not 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.050
 it influences nothing to the channel I am going to say 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.870
 because there is always someone who sells more 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.060
 some mod mods I do not know what does not influence in 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.640
 nothing to the channel just once every 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.220
 So much I teach you the many more 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.530

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.140
 crazy mod that I bring you guys 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.480

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.530
 it is valÃ¨ncia is very very well done 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.540
 we could try to warm up a little bit 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.180
 back and so we can see well the 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.760
 but, as you can see, it's super 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.280
 well done is very very very decided me 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.950

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.290
 to be 800 lateral director to this 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.330
