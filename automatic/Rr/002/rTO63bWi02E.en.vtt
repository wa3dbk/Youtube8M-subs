00:00:10.617 --> 00:00:17.418
If I do net play drop, then there will be recovery steps.

00:00:17.418 --> 00:00:20.320
it can be 4, can be 5

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:31.676
forehand look - 1 2 3 4 5 or if shuttle comes closer 1 2 3 4

00:00:31.676 --> 00:00:37.445
because its net play, I have more time, opponent have more time

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:44.912
so, I have to make more steps to make the timing right

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:47.078
