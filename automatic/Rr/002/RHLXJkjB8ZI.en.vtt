blender 2.5 as a video file or a movie

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.450 
blender 2.5 as a video file or a movie
file<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:12.380> if<00:00:13.380> you've<00:00:13.559> ever<00:00:13.679> tried<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.070> do<00:00:14.280> that

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
file and if you've ever tried to do that

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.700 
file and if you've ever tried to do that
before<00:00:14.610> or<00:00:15.179> export<00:00:15.929> an<00:00:15.990> animation<00:00:16.289> you'll

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
before or export an animation you'll

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.640 
before or export an animation you'll
notice<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.869> exports<00:00:18.869> as<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> series<00:00:19.500> of

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
notice that it exports as a series of

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.849 
notice that it exports as a series of
still<00:00:19.859> images<00:00:20.060> which<00:00:21.380> aren't<00:00:22.380> really<00:00:22.470> good

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
still images which aren't really good

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.009 
still images which aren't really good
for<00:00:23.100> anything<00:00:23.220> unless<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.029> have<00:00:24.359> software<00:00:24.900> to

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
for anything unless you have software to

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.220 
for anything unless you have software to
compile<00:00:25.890> them<00:00:26.099> together<00:00:26.599> into<00:00:27.599> an<00:00:27.840> animation

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
compile them together into an animation

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.889 
compile them together into an animation
but<00:00:29.220> if<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:30.119> don't<00:00:30.330> then<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.859> can<00:00:32.040> easily

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
but if you don't then you can easily

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.540 
but if you don't then you can easily
make<00:00:33.899> blender<00:00:34.350> just<00:00:34.649> put<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.309> video

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
make blender just put it in the video

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.680 
make blender just put it in the video
file<00:00:35.790> by<00:00:36.000> itself<00:00:37.790> so<00:00:38.790> first<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.270> need<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.540> go

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
file by itself so first you need to go

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.310 
file by itself so first you need to go
to<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.640> properties<00:00:41.640> window<00:00:41.989> under<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.760 
to the properties window under the
render<00:00:43.770> tab<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.390> down<00:00:45.390> near<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.930> output

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
render tab and down near the output

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.560 
render tab and down near the output
section<00:00:48.289> you<00:00:49.289> can<00:00:49.440> adjust<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> settings<00:00:50.570> by

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
section you can adjust the settings by

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.900 
section you can adjust the settings by

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
default it's on PNG I had to move to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.400 
default it's on PNG I had to move to
QuickTime<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:55.010> over<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.989> movie

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410

file<00:00:58.710> formats<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.550> any<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.270> these<00:01:00.449> will

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
file formats you can any of these will

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.670 
file formats you can any of these will
export<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:01.949> as<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.430> video<00:01:03.090> file<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.989> I'm<00:01:04.409> just

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
export it as a video file so I'm just

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.399 
export it as a video file so I'm just
going<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.830> choose<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:06.080> guess<00:01:10.159> h.264<00:01:11.810> no<00:01:12.810> not

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
going to choose I guess h.264 no not

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.340 
going to choose I guess h.264 no not
that<00:01:13.530> uh<00:01:15.020> oops

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
that uh oops

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.300 
that uh oops
QuickTime<00:01:17.070> how<00:01:17.250> about<00:01:17.689> so<00:01:18.890> you<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:20.040> adjust

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
QuickTime how about so you can adjust

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.440 
QuickTime how about so you can adjust
your<00:01:20.369> quality

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
your quality

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.740 
your quality
I'll<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.070> set<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.400> 100<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.090> if

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
I'll have it I have it set on 100 and if

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.010 
I'll have it I have it set on 100 and if
your<00:01:24.900> animation<00:01:25.320> has<00:01:25.470> audio<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:27.020> choose

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
your animation has audio you can choose

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.069 
your animation has audio you can choose
an<00:01:28.170> audio<00:01:28.320> codec<00:01:28.759> but<00:01:29.759> mine<00:01:30.360> doesn't<00:01:30.659> it's

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
an audio codec but mine doesn't it's

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.830 
an audio codec but mine doesn't it's
just<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.650> cube<00:01:32.640> but<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> then<00:01:35.540> once<00:01:36.540> you've<00:01:36.659> got

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
just a cube but so then once you've got

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.690 
just a cube but so then once you've got
all<00:01:36.869> we've<00:01:37.350> got<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.680> configured<00:01:38.100> correctly<00:01:38.250> oh

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
all we've got it configured correctly oh

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.960 
all we've got it configured correctly oh
and<00:01:39.509> your<00:01:40.229> output<00:01:40.409> folder<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.460> where<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
and your output folder is where the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.719 
and your output folder is where the
animations<00:01:42.420> could<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.750> exported<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.729> you'll

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
animations could be exported to you'll

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.870 
animations could be exported to you'll
need<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.030> forget<00:01:45.210> about<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.890> so<00:01:46.890> go<00:01:47.700> up<00:01:47.729> to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
need to forget about that so go up to

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.100 
need to forget about that so go up to
the<00:01:48.149> render<00:01:49.100> section<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:51.000> click<00:01:51.420> animation

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
the render section and click animation

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.980 
the render section and click animation
and<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.649> will<00:01:52.829> render<00:01:53.159> your<00:01:53.280> animation<00:01:53.990> but

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
and that will render your animation but

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.649 
and that will render your animation but
I've<00:01:55.799> already<00:01:56.189> done<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:57.149> can<00:01:57.299> see<00:01:57.420> right
