00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
like that skill level in America is

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.270 
like that skill level in America is
still<00:03:20.390> really<00:03:21.290> nowhere<00:03:21.530> near<00:03:21.860> what<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.070> is<00:03:22.160> in

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
still really nowhere near what it is in

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.280 
still really nowhere near what it is in
Europe<00:03:22.580> so<00:03:22.820> i<00:03:23.060> think<00:03:23.690> i'd<00:03:23.810> like<00:03:23.960> to<00:03:24.050> see<00:03:24.200> his

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
Europe so i think i'd like to see his

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.810 
Europe so i think i'd like to see his
american<00:03:24.740> to<00:03:24.890> actually<00:03:25.190> go<00:03:25.310> over<00:03:25.340> there<00:03:25.700> and

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
american to actually go over there and

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.520 
american to actually go over there and
and<00:03:26.240> live<00:03:26.480> over<00:03:26.690> there<00:03:26.810> be<00:03:27.020> competitive<00:03:27.500> with

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
and live over there be competitive with

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.140 
and live over there be competitive with
those<00:03:27.800> guys<00:03:28.010> because<00:03:28.220> there's<00:03:28.460> only<00:03:28.580> been<00:03:28.790> one

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
those guys because there's only been one

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150 
those guys because there's only been one
that's<00:03:29.660> done<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:30.050> and<00:03:30.200> it's<00:03:30.440> really<00:03:30.980> difficult

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
that's done it and it's really difficult

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.650 
that's done it and it's really difficult
but<00:03:31.520> i<00:03:31.550> think<00:03:31.790> that<00:03:31.970> if<00:03:32.240> the<00:03:32.390> right<00:03:32.540> person

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
but i think that if the right person

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.960 
but i think that if the right person
goes<00:03:33.020> back<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.410> tries<00:03:33.530> again<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:34.700> can<00:03:34.820> happen

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
goes back and tries again it can happen

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.360 
goes back and tries again it can happen
and<00:03:35.270> just<00:03:36.110> try<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.320> get<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.740> more<00:03:36.920> exposure<00:03:37.130> we

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
and just try to get the more exposure we

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.920 
and just try to get the more exposure we
get<00:03:37.490> to<00:03:37.610> more<00:03:37.730> people<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.240> get<00:03:38.360> involved<00:03:38.630> in

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
get to more people to get involved in

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.630 
get to more people to get involved in
America<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.500> better<00:03:39.740> chance<00:03:40.040> we<00:03:40.130> have<00:03:40.220> at<00:03:40.370> go

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
America the better chance we have at go

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.880 
America the better chance we have at go
that
