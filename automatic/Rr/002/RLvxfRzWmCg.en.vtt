this video but as you can see the shed

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.920 
this video but as you can see the shed
now<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.619> painted<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.880> still<00:00:18.510> do<00:00:18.630> not<00:00:18.660> have<00:00:18.900> a

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
now is painted I still do not have a

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.650 
now is painted I still do not have a
front<00:00:19.170> for<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:20.550> my<00:00:20.820> next<00:00:21.029> video<00:00:21.330> there'll

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
front for it in my next video there'll

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.529 
front for it in my next video there'll
be<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.810> front<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.859> shed<00:00:23.180> but<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.240> also

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
be a front on this shed but I also

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.980 
be a front on this shed but I also
singled<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.369> painted<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.930> think<00:00:27.930> I

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
singled it and painted it I think I

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.740 
singled it and painted it I think I
already<00:00:28.080> said<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.500> as<00:00:28.619> well<00:00:29.449> well<00:00:30.449> also

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
already said that as well well also

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.359 
already said that as well well also
underneath<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.740> shed

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
underneath the shed

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.700 
underneath the shed
I<00:00:32.399> finished<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.870> back<00:00:34.079> wall<00:00:36.290> the<00:00:37.290> back<00:00:37.469> wall

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
I finished the back wall the back wall

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.970 
I finished the back wall the back wall
wasn't<00:00:38.070> there<00:00:38.250> nor<00:00:38.610> was<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.910> painted<00:00:39.950> so<00:00:40.950> I

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
wasn't there nor was it painted so I

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.650 
wasn't there nor was it painted so I
still<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> few<00:00:41.610> things<00:00:41.760> left<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.239> do<00:00:42.420> under

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
still have a few things left to do under

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.500 
still have a few things left to do under
here<00:00:42.980> one<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.430> add<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.850> solar<00:00:45.059> panel<00:00:45.480> to

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
here one is to add the solar panel to

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.940 
here one is to add the solar panel to
the<00:00:45.629> battery<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.010> will<00:00:47.190> recharge<00:00:47.670> itself

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
the battery so it will recharge itself

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.319 
the battery so it will recharge itself
currently<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.160> have<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.820> charge<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.300> battery

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
currently I have to charge the battery

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.549 
currently I have to charge the battery
with<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> battery<00:00:52.410> charger<00:00:52.860> every<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.579> often<00:00:53.760> I

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
with a battery charger every so often I

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.979 
with a battery charger every so often I
also<00:00:55.559> did<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> few<00:00:55.949> more<00:00:56.070> things<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
also did a few more things to the

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.319 
also did a few more things to the
filtration<00:00:57.989> board<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.760> you<00:00:59.760> can<00:00:59.879> see<00:01:00.059> there's

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
filtration board as you can see there's

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.740 
filtration board as you can see there's
a<00:01:00.710> large<00:01:01.710> blue<00:01:02.039> filter<00:01:02.489> an<00:01:02.670> additional<00:01:03.420> large

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
a large blue filter an additional large

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.940 
a large blue filter an additional large
blue<00:01:04.049> filter<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:05.930> also<00:01:06.930> made<00:01:07.170> one<00:01:07.200> other<00:01:07.590> change

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
blue filter I also made one other change

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.789 
blue filter I also made one other change
I'll<00:01:08.250> get<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.820> second<00:01:09.500> but<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:10.680> on

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
I'll get to that in a second but here on

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.370 
I'll get to that in a second but here on
this<00:01:11.010> large<00:01:11.250> blue<00:01:11.909> filter<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:13.200> first

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
this large blue filter in the first

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.910 
this large blue filter in the first
video<00:01:13.530> there<00:01:13.920> was<00:01:14.040> only<00:01:14.159> one<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:16.140> ceramic

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
video there was only one the ceramic

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.370 
video there was only one the ceramic
filter<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:18.090> ceramic<00:01:18.540> filter<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.080> still

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
filter and that ceramic filter is still

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.370 
filter and that ceramic filter is still
the<00:01:19.740> last<00:01:20.640> filter<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.390> one<00:01:21.600> here<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.140> last

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the last filter this one here this last

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.140 
the last filter this one here this last
blue<00:01:22.770> filter<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.689> new<00:01:25.140> blue<00:01:25.439> filter<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.150> a

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
blue filter so the new blue filter is a

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.480 
blue filter so the new blue filter is a
5<00:01:27.630> micron<00:01:28.100> carbon<00:01:29.100> filter

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
5 micron carbon filter

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.200 
5 micron carbon filter
in<00:01:31.299> my<00:01:31.450> last<00:01:31.659> video<00:01:31.810> I<00:01:32.020> mentioned<00:01:32.170> that<00:01:32.619> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
in my last video I mentioned that the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.430 
in my last video I mentioned that the
this<00:01:34.210> Rusco<00:01:34.750> spin-down<00:01:35.229> filter<00:01:35.680> here<00:01:36.100> is

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
this Rusco spin-down filter here is

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.020 
this Rusco spin-down filter here is
about<00:01:38.440> a<00:01:38.500> 12<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.070> 15<00:01:39.640> micron<00:01:40.150> filter<00:01:41.580> so<00:01:42.580> this

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
about a 12 to 15 micron filter so this

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.289 
about a 12 to 15 micron filter so this
next<00:01:43.240> one<00:01:43.360> is<00:01:43.570> a<00:01:43.600> 5<00:01:43.869> micron<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.640> it'll<00:01:45.970> you<00:01:46.270> know

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
next one is a 5 micron so it'll you know

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.840 
next one is a 5 micron so it'll you know
it<00:01:46.509> will<00:01:46.630> catch<00:01:46.869> a<00:01:47.170> little<00:01:47.560> bit<00:01:47.680> more<00:01:48.250> dirt<00:01:48.520> or

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
it will catch a little bit more dirt or

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.899 
it will catch a little bit more dirt or
particles<00:01:49.810> or<00:01:50.369> whatever<00:01:51.369> may<00:01:51.550> be<00:01:51.610> in<00:01:51.820> the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
particles or whatever may be in the

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.170 
particles or whatever may be in the
water<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.479> it<00:01:53.080> will<00:01:53.290> allow<00:01:53.619> all<00:01:54.399> my<00:01:54.790> filters

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
water and it will allow all my filters

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.609 
water and it will allow all my filters
to<00:01:55.330> last<00:01:55.509> longer<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.050> I'll<00:01:56.140> have<00:01:56.259> to<00:01:56.380> clean

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
to last longer and I'll have to clean

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.910 
to last longer and I'll have to clean
them<00:01:56.770> less<00:01:57.040> often<00:01:58.110> that's<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.350> pro<00:01:59.590> of<00:01:59.619> that

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
them less often that's the pro of that

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.160 
them less often that's the pro of that
the<00:02:00.130> con<00:02:00.340> is<00:02:00.640> I<00:02:00.880> had<00:02:01.210> to<00:02:01.240> pay<00:02:01.659> additional<00:02:01.899> money

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
the con is I had to pay additional money

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.440 
the con is I had to pay additional money
for<00:02:02.979> this<00:02:03.190> filter<00:02:03.429> and<00:02:03.910> it<00:02:04.090> requires

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
for this filter and it requires

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.020 
for this filter and it requires
additional<00:02:04.690> time<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:05.649> addition<00:02:06.580> this<00:02:06.700> is<00:02:06.880> the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
additional time and addition this is the

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.770 
additional time and addition this is the
one<00:02:07.210> filter

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
one filter

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.050 
one filter
I<00:02:07.810> believe<00:02:08.350> I<00:02:08.470> cannot<00:02:08.800> just<00:02:09.130> reclaim<00:02:09.700> I<00:02:09.729> have

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
I believe I cannot just reclaim I have

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.360 
I believe I cannot just reclaim I have
to<00:02:10.209> actually<00:02:10.360> order<00:02:10.720> more<00:02:11.440> filters<00:02:11.830> for<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.220> I

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
to actually order more filters for it I

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.729 
to actually order more filters for it I
may<00:02:13.120> not<00:02:13.300> be<00:02:13.540> correct<00:02:13.810> on<00:02:13.989> that<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.200> have<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.530> do

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
may not be correct on that I have to do

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.170 
may not be correct on that I have to do
a<00:02:14.769> little<00:02:14.890> bit<00:02:15.100> more<00:02:15.130> checking<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.880> research

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
a little bit more checking and research

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.259 
a little bit more checking and research
but<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:16.989> believe<00:02:17.410> I<00:02:18.130> just<00:02:18.519> have<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:19.030> buy<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.150> new

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
but I believe I just have to buy a new

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.970 
but I believe I just have to buy a new
filter<00:02:19.720> for<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:20.019> one<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:21.820> can<00:02:21.970> see<00:02:22.000> how<00:02:22.269> so<00:02:22.660> I

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
filter for this one you can see how so I

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.020 
filter for this one you can see how so I
just<00:02:23.980> put<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.280> little<00:02:24.430> screw<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.880> wood

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
just put a little screw in the wood

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.479 
just put a little screw in the wood
there<00:02:25.269> so<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.570> can<00:02:25.750> have<00:02:25.930> my<00:02:26.170> handle<00:02:27.130> for<00:02:27.310> these

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
there so I can have my handle for these

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.500 
there so I can have my handle for these
big<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:29.050> blue<00:02:29.260> housing<00:02:29.739> filters<00:02:30.330> one<00:02:31.330> other

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
big the blue housing filters one other

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.819 
big the blue housing filters one other
thing<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:32.050> did<00:02:32.860> was<00:02:33.330> change<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.829> filter

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
thing that I did was change the filter

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.050 
thing that I did was change the filter
in<00:02:36.070> this<00:02:37.079> spin-down<00:02:38.079> filter<00:02:38.790> there<00:02:39.790> was<00:02:40.030> a

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
in this spin-down filter there was a

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.199 
in this spin-down filter there was a
hundred<00:02:40.630> mesh<00:02:40.870> this<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.380> my<00:02:41.590> first<00:02:42.209> filter

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
hundred mesh this is my first filter

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.900 
hundred mesh this is my first filter
going<00:02:43.780> into<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.200> system<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:45.400> filter<00:02:45.730> the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
going into the system the filter the

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.479 
going into the system the filter the
prefilter<00:02:46.950> for<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.070> pump<00:02:49.590> well<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.829> upgraded

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
prefilter for the pump well I upgraded

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.050 
prefilter for the pump well I upgraded
this<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.049> 250<00:02:53.049> mesh<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:54.370> second<00:02:54.730> one<00:02:54.850> was<00:02:55.030> a

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
this to a 250 mesh the second one was a

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.910 
this to a 250 mesh the second one was a
500<00:02:55.660> mesh<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.440> was<00:02:56.940> 100<00:02:57.940> here<00:02:58.239> 500<00:02:59.079> there<00:02:59.769> in

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
500 mesh so it was 100 here 500 there in

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.370 
500 mesh so it was 100 here 500 there in
the<00:03:00.010> middle<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.370> then<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.060> 1000<00:03:01.870> mesh<00:03:02.019> there<00:03:02.260> at

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
the middle and then a 1000 mesh there at

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.259 
the middle and then a 1000 mesh there at
the<00:03:02.500> end<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:03.579> now<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:03.970> is<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.290> 250<00:03:05.290> mesh<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:06.269> 500

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
the end so now it is a 250 mesh a 500

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.940 
the end so now it is a 250 mesh a 500
mesh<00:03:07.799> then<00:03:08.799> a<00:03:08.880> 1000<00:03:09.880> mesh<00:03:10.060> now<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.140> 1000<00:03:11.799> mesh

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
mesh then a 1000 mesh now that 1000 mesh

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.030 
mesh then a 1000 mesh now that 1000 mesh
is<00:03:12.130> about<00:03:12.400> 12<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.850> 15<00:03:13.000> microns<00:03:13.930> then<00:03:14.739> it<00:03:14.890> goes

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
is about 12 to 15 microns then it goes

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.750 
is about 12 to 15 microns then it goes
down<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.519> a<00:03:15.549> 5<00:03:16.480> micron<00:03:16.810> carbon<00:03:17.410> filter<00:03:17.950> then

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
down to a 5 micron carbon filter then

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.880 
down to a 5 micron carbon filter then
after<00:03:19.060> that<00:03:19.180> 5<00:03:19.420> micron<00:03:19.900> carbon<00:03:19.930> filter<00:03:20.709> in

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
after that 5 micron carbon filter in

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.180 
after that 5 micron carbon filter in
that<00:03:21.370> last<00:03:21.730> blue<00:03:22.209> housing<00:03:22.690> is<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:23.560> ceramic

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
that last blue housing is the ceramic

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.819 
that last blue housing is the ceramic
filter<00:03:25.019> that<00:03:26.019> is<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.549> 0.9<00:03:27.549> micron<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:29.019> then

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
filter that is a 0.9 micron and then

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.009 
filter that is a 0.9 micron and then
after<00:03:30.100> that<00:03:30.220> of<00:03:30.430> course<00:03:30.459> it<00:03:31.000> was<00:03:31.209> my<00:03:31.390> UV<00:03:31.810> light

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
after that of course it was my UV light

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.680 
after that of course it was my UV light
you'll<00:03:32.470> have<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.739> check<00:03:32.920> that<00:03:32.950> out<00:03:33.130> on<00:03:33.430> the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
you'll have to check that out on the

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.020 
you'll have to check that out on the
other<00:03:34.690> video<00:03:35.070> so<00:03:36.070> my<00:03:36.220> next<00:03:36.400> video

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
other video so my next video

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.740 
other video so my next video

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
I have all have a pressure tank a sink

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.290 
I have all have a pressure tank a sink
and<00:03:40.989> I'll<00:03:41.739> also<00:03:41.919> have<00:03:42.070> a<00:03:42.250> front
