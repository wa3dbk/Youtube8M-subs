00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
eighth frame and two of those balls will

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.839 
eighth frame and two of those balls will
also<00:02:00.959> count<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.319> the<00:02:01.410> seventh<00:02:01.770> frame<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.819> you

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:02.849 
also count in the seventh frame so you

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:04.999 
also count in the seventh frame so you
add<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.270> first<00:02:03.479> two<00:02:03.660> balls<00:02:04.020> plus<00:02:04.380> 10<00:02:04.709> to<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
add the first two balls plus 10 to the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.449 
add the first two balls plus 10 to the
previous<00:02:05.459> frame<00:02:05.729> which<00:02:05.940> is<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.119> seventh<00:02:06.539> frame

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
previous frame which is a seventh frame

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.400 
previous frame which is a seventh frame
so<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.849> eighth<00:02:09.000> frame<00:02:09.390> Tony<00:02:09.780> gets<00:02:10.020> up<00:02:10.200> in

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
so in the eighth frame Tony gets up in

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.290 
so in the eighth frame Tony gets up in
the<00:02:10.500> first<00:02:10.740> ball<00:02:10.950> he<00:02:11.130> throws<00:02:11.340> five<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.180> we

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
the first ball he throws five so we

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.970 
the first ball he throws five so we
write<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.870> strike<00:02:13.140> in<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.650> seventh

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
write that in the strike in the seventh

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.030 
write that in the strike in the seventh
frame<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.940> second<00:02:15.330> ball<00:02:15.450> he<00:02:15.690> throws<00:02:15.930> two<00:02:16.290> so

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
frame the second ball he throws two so

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.860 
frame the second ball he throws two so
those<00:02:17.220> two<00:02:17.490> bonus<00:02:17.910> balls<00:02:18.150> are<00:02:18.360> added<00:02:18.690> together

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
those two bonus balls are added together

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.180 
those two bonus balls are added together
so<00:02:19.500> 10<00:02:19.890> plus<00:02:20.489> 7<00:02:20.730> makes<00:02:21.300> 17<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.170> that's<00:02:22.680> why<00:02:22.980> he

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
so 10 plus 7 makes 17 and that's why he

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.940 
so 10 plus 7 makes 17 and that's why he
has<00:02:23.370> 67<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.330> seventh<00:02:24.780> frame<00:02:24.989> in<00:02:25.349> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
has 67 in the seventh frame in the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.400 
has 67 in the seventh frame in the
eighth<00:02:26.069> frame<00:02:26.459> he<00:02:26.730> throws<00:02:27.000> another<00:02:27.360> ball<00:02:27.630> for

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
eighth frame he throws another ball for

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.309 
eighth frame he throws another ball for
a<00:02:28.440> total<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:28.830> 8<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.520> in<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.760> eighth<00:02:29.910> frame<00:02:30.319> we'd

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
a total of 8 so in the eighth frame we'd

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.860 
a total of 8 so in the eighth frame we'd
score<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.709> normally<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:32.940> we<00:02:33.090> add<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.569> 8

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
score it normally and so we add that 8

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.790 
score it normally and so we add that 8
from<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.440> 67<00:02:35.130> for<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.340> total<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.819> 75<00:02:36.800> spares

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
from the 67 for a total of 75 spares

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.790 
from the 67 for a total of 75 spares
follow<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.310> similar<00:02:38.670> format<00:02:39.620> basically<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.709> the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
follow a similar format basically in the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.410 
follow a similar format basically in the
second<00:02:41.160> ball<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.459> knock<00:02:41.640> down<00:02:41.819> all<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:42.090> pins

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
second ball you knock down all the pins

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.410 
second ball you knock down all the pins
and<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.840> draw<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.230> slash<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.459> take<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.700> look<00:02:44.940> Kim

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
and you draw a slash so take a look Kim

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.610 
and you draw a slash so take a look Kim
has<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> spare<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.650> her<00:02:46.830> ninth<00:02:47.099> frame<00:02:47.550> in<00:02:48.620> the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
has a spare in her ninth frame in the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.470 
has a spare in her ninth frame in the
tenth<00:02:49.920> frame<00:02:50.129> and<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.489> first<00:02:50.730> ball<00:02:51.000> she

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
tenth frame and the first ball she

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.229 
tenth frame and the first ball she
knocks<00:02:51.720> down<00:02:52.020> five<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:53.340> we<00:02:53.459> add<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.849> total

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
knocks down five so we add that total

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.030 
knocks down five so we add that total
from<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.450> first<00:02:54.810> ball<00:02:55.050> plus<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.560> tenth<00:02:55.830> she

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
from the first ball plus the tenth she

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.270 
from the first ball plus the tenth she
already<00:02:56.310> knocked<00:02:56.580> down<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:57.660> add<00:02:57.810> 15<00:02:58.740> which<00:02:59.250> is

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
already knocked down to add 15 which is

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.030 
already knocked down to add 15 which is
91<00:03:00.150> in<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.450> ninth

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
91 in the ninth

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.399 
91 in the ninth
then<00:03:01.849> there's<00:03:02.120> normal<00:03:02.480> scoring<00:03:02.840> for<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.049> next

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
then there's normal scoring for the next

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.160 
then there's normal scoring for the next
frame<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.069> she<00:03:04.129> has<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.430> ten<00:03:04.790> box<00:03:05.060> for<00:03:05.719> a<00:03:05.750> total

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
frame so she has a ten box for a total

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.500
