on<00:01:38.049> they're<00:01:38.229> still<00:01:38.530> hot<00:01:38.860> because<00:01:39.789> you<00:01:39.939> wanted

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
on they're still hot because you wanted

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.990 
on they're still hot because you wanted

to mount the cheese about a quarter cup

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.340 
to mount the cheese about a quarter cup
of<00:01:43.479> grated<00:01:43.960> Parmesan<00:01:44.649> cheese<00:01:45.009> a<00:01:45.929> little<00:01:46.929> bit

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
of grated Parmesan cheese a little bit

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.760 
of grated Parmesan cheese a little bit
of<00:01:47.380> salt<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:48.070> pepper<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:50.229> to<00:01:50.259> use<00:01:50.500> sea

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
of salt and pepper I like to use sea

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.319 
of salt and pepper I like to use sea
salt<00:01:50.799> in<00:01:51.369> this<00:01:51.579> because<00:01:51.939> it<00:01:52.060> gives<00:01:52.179> it

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
salt in this because it gives it

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.080 
salt in this because it gives it
wonderful<00:01:52.840> flavor<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:53.590> then<00:01:54.549> you<00:01:54.670> just<00:01:54.850> take

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
wonderful flavor and then you just take

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.149 
wonderful flavor and then you just take
a<00:01:55.119> potato<00:01:55.539> masher<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:56.229> you<00:01:56.560> can<00:01:56.740> match<00:01:56.890> the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
a potato masher and you can match the

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.370 
a potato masher and you can match the
right<00:01:57.340> in<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.759> bowl<00:01:57.909> of<00:01:58.720> course<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.170> could

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
right in the bowl of course you could

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.590 
right in the bowl of course you could
add<00:01:59.649> things<00:02:00.009> like<00:02:00.189> we<00:02:00.490> put<00:02:00.700> in<00:02:00.759> traditional

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
add things like we put in traditional

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.529 
add things like we put in traditional
mashed<00:02:01.810> potatoes<00:02:02.409> like<00:02:02.679> milk<00:02:02.979> or<00:02:03.310> cream<00:02:03.670> our

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
mashed potatoes like milk or cream our

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.949 
mashed potatoes like milk or cream our
butter<00:02:04.599> but<00:02:05.289> I<00:02:05.319> think<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:05.799> flavor<00:02:06.159> of<00:02:06.340> the

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
butter but I think the flavor of the

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.749 
butter but I think the flavor of the
sweet<00:02:07.959> potato<00:02:08.380> after<00:02:08.830> it's<00:02:09.009> been<00:02:09.160> roasted<00:02:09.640> is

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
sweet potato after it's been roasted is

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.880 
sweet potato after it's been roasted is
so<00:02:09.970> wonderful<00:02:10.539> it<00:02:10.780> really<00:02:10.810> doesn't<00:02:11.680> need<00:02:11.830> a

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
so wonderful it really doesn't need a

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.309 
so wonderful it really doesn't need a
lot<00:02:12.190> more<00:02:12.250> I<00:02:12.819> like<00:02:13.060> them<00:02:13.269> a<00:02:13.299> little<00:02:13.510> lumpy<00:02:14.110> if

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
lot more I like them a little lumpy if

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.080 
lot more I like them a little lumpy if
you<00:02:14.470> like<00:02:14.680> really<00:02:15.010> smooth<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.700> course<00:02:15.940> you
