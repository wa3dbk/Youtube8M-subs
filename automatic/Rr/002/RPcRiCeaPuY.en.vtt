00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.820 
dark elixir storage pretty fast because
that<00:01:24.330> dark<00:01:24.540> elixir<00:01:24.720> storage<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.229> really<00:01:25.470> tanky

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
that dark elixir storage is really tanky

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.039 
that dark elixir storage is really tanky
however<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.640> think<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.090> could<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.450> saved<00:01:27.689> that

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
however I think I could have saved that

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.210 
however I think I could have saved that
rage<00:01:28.259> spell<00:01:28.470> until<00:01:28.650> they<00:01:28.770> got<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> center

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
rage spell until they got to the center

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.690 
rage spell until they got to the center
here<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:30.090> would<00:01:30.240> had<00:01:30.360> much<00:01:30.930> more<00:01:30.960> success

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
here and we would had much more success

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.359 
here and we would had much more success
but<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:32.850> did<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.299> good<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.689> raid<00:01:34.369> luckily

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
but we did do good on this raid luckily

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.280 
but we did do good on this raid luckily
the<00:01:35.579> Queen<00:01:35.820> actually<00:01:36.240> dragged<00:01:36.540> some<00:01:36.930> i<00:01:37.020> some

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
using one queen or one hero which is

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.990 
using one queen or one hero which is
awesome<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:11.160> saves<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.520> lot<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.700> gems

awesome it saves you a lot of gems
however<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:12.989> very

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
however this is very

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.160 
however this is very
elixir<00:02:14.860> costs<00:02:15.640> heavy<00:02:16.120> like<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.630> costs<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.110> much

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
elixir costs heavy like it costs so much

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.480 
elixir costs heavy like it costs so much
i<00:02:17.440> think<00:02:17.470> it's<00:02:17.740> i'm<00:02:18.460> using<00:02:18.850> like<00:02:20.070> 464<00:02:21.070> thousand

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
i think it's i'm using like 464 thousand

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.940 
i think it's i'm using like 464 thousand
elixir<00:02:21.910> on<00:02:22.090> each<00:02:22.210> rate<00:02:22.720> it's<00:02:22.900> pretty<00:02:23.110> crazy<00:02:23.290> so

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
elixir on each rate it's pretty crazy so

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.950 
elixir on each rate it's pretty crazy so
we<00:02:24.100> did<00:02:24.250> get<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.490> two<00:02:24.640> star<00:02:24.850> there<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.180> ended<00:02:25.900> it

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
we did get the two star there I ended it

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.570 
we did get the two star there I ended it
right<00:02:26.110> away<00:02:26.230> only<00:02:26.590> four<00:02:26.770> trophies<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:27.190> just

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
right away only four trophies I just

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.010 
right away only four trophies I just
thought<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.730> was<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:27.970> really<00:02:28.060> easy<00:02:28.420> base<00:02:28.720> to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
thought that was a really easy base to

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.240 
thought that was a really easy base to
go<00:02:29.170> ahead<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:29.440> attack<00:02:29.710> here<00:02:29.980> we<00:02:30.100> have<00:02:30.220> a

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
go ahead and attack here we have a

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.430 
go ahead and attack here we have a
little<00:02:30.460> bit<00:02:30.610> more<00:02:30.730> trophies<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.330> we're<00:02:32.320> going

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
little bit more trophies and we're going

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.510 
little bit more trophies and we're going
to<00:02:32.470> be<00:02:32.560> writing<00:02:32.740> this<00:02:32.860> space<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:33.280> reason<00:02:33.460> I

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
to be writing this space the reason I

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.370 
to be writing this space the reason I
chose<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.940> tuck<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.270> space<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.750> because<00:02:35.170> he

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
chose to tuck the space is because he

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.290 
chose to tuck the space is because he
had<00:02:35.740> all<00:02:36.010> his<00:02:36.040> pretty<00:02:36.490> much<00:02:36.700> all<00:02:36.880> his<00:02:37.000> Archer

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
had all his pretty much all his Archer

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.630

much<00:02:52.480> damage<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.870> dragons<00:02:53.440> it's<00:02:53.620> ridiculous<00:02:54.160> I

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
much damage to dragons it's ridiculous I

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.940 
much damage to dragons it's ridiculous I
think<00:02:55.330> they're<00:02:55.450> like<00:02:55.600> 87<00:02:56.020> damage<00:02:56.410> per<00:02:56.560> second

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950
