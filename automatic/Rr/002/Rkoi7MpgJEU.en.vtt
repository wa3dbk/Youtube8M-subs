00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.200
 good afternoon friends youtube in this 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.219
 Occasion we will see how to paint the caliper 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.440
 of our car in this case then 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:17.180
 we have this a caliper that is 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.060
 totally dark totally new 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.920
 and what we are going to do then is to paint it 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.890
 of a red color like but before it was 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.710
 red but it's good for me to have a 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.630
 better aesthetics that is what we need 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.150
 Well first of all, good here with 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.790
 cat to lift his car 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.800
 a 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.800
 a key to get the goods out of their 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.240
 car as a rag a rag to 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.660
 clean what would come with our 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.510
 caliper paintings and he used this painting that 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:51.250
 It is automotive auto shower spray 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:55.070
 this is red color of the brand doubled 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:59.300
 the this degreaser 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.900
 and a metal brush to carve the o 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.140
 calipers 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.300
 this fruit and that I have a section 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.670
 yellow but it can be periodic paper 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.280
 to catch all our pieces 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.920
 around the bear caliper and nothing no 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.720
 it stains us with paint color 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.330
 but first we have first then that 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.050
 nothing that we will not be does not come to you 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.050
 the degreaser 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:31.250
 we want them to be done with degreaser 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.100
 As you can see this red leave to 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.000
 easy entering for 5 minutes and 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.000
 then rinse 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.659
 good because we let the 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.030
 degreaser we will use our 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.770
 metal brush or certain metal and 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.189
 we will find what our 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.189
 caliper 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.680
 so that the ember is removed for 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.210
 that remove everything that does not serve us or 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.510
 that can make our painting 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.340
 fall 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.490
 let's see if we are going to have very well 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.920
 obviously this will not remove everything but 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.080
 that removes most things is more 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.149
 that enough the majority of the fat of 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.390
 what leaves the brakes to our car 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.420
 when we brake 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.050
 we have to give it a very good 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.050
 brushed 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.340
 how youtube friends can see me 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.400
 here and nothing brushed I'm not 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.769
 focusing the caiber with water as they can 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.250
 see after I pass my brush 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:37.280
 metallic and degreaser 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.530
 and the calpe returns to take a red color 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.480
 that I used to have now that I'm going to 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.030
 do before doing the painting I'm going to 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.580
 wallpapering this whole area and I'm going to start 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.030
 to paint this one thing that was imported 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.400
 very important to speed up the work 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.650
 I have a vacuum cleaner with the 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.140
 vacuum cleaner that we are going to do then the 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.080
 vacuum cleaner has the function of in law of 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.910
 spiral throwing air 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.150
 with that we will make our caliper 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.610
 seventh fastest between now that is 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.350
 wet and also when we receive 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.580
 paint will dry sooner than 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.580
 will streamline our work 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.450
 and I'm going to start accepting with the 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.450
 vacuum cleaner and then we're going to paper 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.920
 or not 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.260
 and it's dry as you can see and it's been 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.540
 another that drains the color now 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.350
 we proceed to paper our end to 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.560
 do not stain what we're going 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.160
 good friends of youtube and I already have 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.160
 papered 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.650
 As you can see this one, it's already here 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.450
 the paper I have a paper too and 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.659
 paper here I'm doing the chalice 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.019
 but now it only takes us to start 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.019
 paint 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.440
 good friends as I said this 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.520
 and we started painting 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.740
 try to make short movements and 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.080
 do not leave a lot of time the painting about 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.880
 the caliber because we know will fight already 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.980
 once we gave the first layer 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.900
 we passed what would be our 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.910
 blowtorch I adore in my house I have a 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.170
 vacuum to dry faster 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.170
 the painting and be able to continue 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.300
 good friends here 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.280
 very good here is the second layer and 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.280
 we are going to approach again with our 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.280
 respirator 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.210
 good friends here the second one has dried 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:55.160
 stage and we are going to apply 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.160
 the third and last part 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.870
 ready now we believe and we will see the 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.580
 results 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.950
 good friends well here we have the 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.850
 result of our caliber as they can 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.770
 see this nothing was stained from behind what 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.350
 yes it got stained because it was this part of 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.090
 our album like to see here but not 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.360
 worry about that painting that is here 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.190
 around the caliper if the brake without 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.750
 weight no 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.910
 sergia I'm not anti braking it's just going to 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.670
 clean and it will only be painted what 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.840
 what is our quality 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.780
 it's just locating the rest 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.280
 it will be stained because it will be cleaned 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.800
 automatically or just as you can see 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.260
 it is a good result for a short 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.970
 working time all this is going to 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.960
 remove and will only be left now let's 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.610
 ride the rim 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.979
 and so good friends here we have the 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.590
 final result the kingdom is a little dirty 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:03.169
 but with the cleaning it would be a lot 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.840
 best 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:09.400
 that would be our red caliper with 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:13.669
 our caliper in red and aesthetically 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:16.659
 it will be much better of everything and we 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:16.659
 we see until the next
