00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.280
Ahhhh!!!!!!

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.460
Welp, I'm not living in this place anymore!

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.580
How Ghostbusters Should Have Ended

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.340
Roarrr!

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.170
I have a radical idea.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.850
The door swings both ways.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.030
We could reverse the particle flow
through the gate.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.710
How?

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.100
We'll cross the streams

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.100
Excuse me, Egon, you said crossing the streams was bad.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.180
Not necessarily.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.140
There's definitely a very slim chance we'll survive.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.160
How slim?

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.420
I don't know.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.379
Slim.

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.449
You said our molecules would explode at
the speed of light.

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.889
That's a little beyond slim, Egon.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.960
Stop that!

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.020
Fine!

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.020
It's either cross the streams or die by
Ray's marshmallow man.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.420
Rooarrrrr!!!

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.940
I love this plan. I'm excited to be a
part of it. Let's do it!

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.120
Ohhhh!!!!!

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.080
Boooomm!!

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.570
And then all the Ghostbusters died.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.060
Apparently crossing the streams is very
bad.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.640
Back to you, Chuck.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.410
Are you a god??

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.280
Yes...

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.460
Oh okay, well that's good.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.180
Uh huh, well...

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.480
We're all God's here.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.300
uh come on down and
we'll introduce you to everyone

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.710
What a relief! I thought I was the only one left.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.680
You know I've been living in this crazy---

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.040
Get the trap door!! Get the trap!!

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.780
Ahhhhh!!!

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.890
Well, that was surprisingly easy.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.630
Yea, good thing I said yes.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.510
Anyone else hungry for marshmallows? Aldo

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.580
I am.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.610
Yea, I could go for some marshmallows too.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.340
(grunting)

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.330
Ok, you're kinda scaring me so I'm just gonna knock you out with this Thorazine

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.930
I brought along with me and--

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.030
You brought Thorazine on our date??

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.640
Uh, uh...

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.580
Yeah...

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.820
What kind of a creep are you??

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.730

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.700
