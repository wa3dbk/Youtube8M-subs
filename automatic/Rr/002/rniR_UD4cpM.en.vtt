I<00:00:14.300> also<00:00:15.300> my<00:00:15.570> victory<00:00:16.020> question<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.740> take<00:00:17.550> on

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
I also my victory question to take on

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.740 
I also my victory question to take on
chalk<00:00:19.200> on<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:20.040> we've<00:00:20.640> developed<00:00:20.910> an<00:00:21.210> app<00:00:21.420> that

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
chalk on so we've developed an app that

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.679 
chalk on so we've developed an app that
can<00:00:22.500> show<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.860> the<00:00:23.369> level<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.760> radiation<00:00:24.180> of

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
can show you the level of radiation of

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.790 
can show you the level of radiation of
your<00:00:25.380> phone<00:00:25.880> okay<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:26.939> can<00:00:27.300> see<00:00:27.540> if<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.500> level

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
your phone okay you can see if the level

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.310 
your phone okay you can see if the level
is<00:00:28.920> low<00:00:29.220> or<00:00:29.580> moderate<00:00:30.030> or<00:00:30.330> high<00:00:30.630> at<00:00:30.960> every

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
is low or moderate or high at every

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.770 
is low or moderate or high at every
point<00:00:31.650> before<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.730> call<00:00:33.030> before<00:00:33.330> you<00:00:33.540> make<00:00:33.750> a

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
point before a call before you make a

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.310 
point before a call before you make a
call<00:00:34.050> or<00:00:34.550> ordering<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.760> call<00:00:36.000> that's<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.870> main

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
call or ordering a call that's the main

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.520 
call or ordering a call that's the main
thing<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.650> our<00:00:38.010> app<00:00:38.370> do<00:00:39.320> maybe<00:00:40.320> we<00:00:40.500> should

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
thing that our app do maybe we should

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.270 
thing that our app do maybe we should
explain<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.489> our<00:00:41.970> reader<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.629> radiation<00:00:43.500> may

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
explain to our reader that radiation may

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.490 
explain to our reader that radiation may
vary<00:00:44.570> yeah<00:00:45.570> sure<00:00:45.930> depending<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.350> your

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
vary yeah sure depending on your

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.350 
vary yeah sure depending on your
location<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.250> way<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.430> hold<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.910> phone<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
location the way you hold the phone and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.410 
location the way you hold the phone and
so<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.540> so<00:00:48.720> yeah<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.710> course<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.640> basically

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
so on so yeah of course so basically

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.310 
so on so yeah of course so basically
radiation<00:00:52.079> varies<00:00:52.500> from<00:00:53.280> many<00:00:54.239> states<00:00:54.690> it

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
radiation varies from many states it

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.530 
radiation varies from many states it
depends<00:00:55.829> where<00:00:56.040> you<00:00:56.250> located<00:00:56.700> it<00:00:57.030> depends<00:00:57.420> how

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
depends where you located it depends how

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.650 
depends where you located it depends how
far<00:00:57.840> are<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.110> from<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.469> cellular<00:00:59.219> tower

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
far are you from the cellular tower

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.440 
far are you from the cellular tower
depends<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.899> network<00:01:01.050> coverage<00:01:01.860> and

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
depends on the network coverage and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.440 
depends on the network coverage and
various<00:01:03.450> other<00:01:03.690> parameters<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.520> take<00:01:05.789> into

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
various other parameters so we take into

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.109 
various other parameters so we take into
consideration<00:01:07.440> all<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.009> and<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.700> show<00:01:09.090> a

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
consideration all of that and we show a

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.529 
consideration all of that and we show a
very<00:01:09.479> very<00:01:09.960> simple<00:01:10.410> and<00:01:10.740> intuitive

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
very very simple and intuitive

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.150 
very very simple and intuitive
indication<00:01:12.539> about<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.410> level<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.770> radiation

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
indication about the level of radiation

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.240 
indication about the level of radiation
so<00:01:15.090> many<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.780> us<00:01:15.930> are<00:01:16.140> concerned<00:01:16.830> with<00:01:17.039> this

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
so many of us are concerned with this

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.880 
so many of us are concerned with this
issue<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:18.209> know<00:01:18.390> about<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.959> we<00:01:19.470> know<00:01:19.619> there<00:01:19.800> is

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
issue we know about it we know there is

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.449 
issue we know about it we know there is
a<00:01:19.920> great<00:01:20.190> research<00:01:20.610> about<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:21.990> not

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459 
a great research about it and it's not

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:26.960 
a great research about it and it's not
it's<00:01:23.459> not<00:01:23.640> conclusive<00:01:23.880> yet<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:25.580> the<00:01:26.580> best

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
it's not conclusive yet but the best

it's not conclusive yet but the best
thing<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.270> do<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:28.619> order<00:01:28.800> to<00:01:29.130> handle<00:01:29.399> that<00:01:29.759> is

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
thing to do in order to handle that is

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.490 
thing to do in order to handle that is
is<00:01:32.340> no<00:01:33.149> it's<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.539> take<00:01:33.720> precautionary

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
is no it's to take precautionary

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.559 
is no it's to take precautionary
measures<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:35.310> mean<00:01:35.550> is<00:01:35.819> to<00:01:36.119> talk<00:01:36.330> more

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
measures I mean is to talk more

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:38.900 
measures I mean is to talk more
responsibly<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.500> that's<00:01:38.160> what<00:01:38.369> our<00:01:38.399> app

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
responsibly and that's what our app

enables to users users can see for the
first<00:01:43.920> time<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.640> level<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.030> radiation

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
first time the level of radiation

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.800 
first time the level of radiation
they're<00:01:45.840> exposed<00:01:46.289> to<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.119> our<00:01:48.119> app<00:01:48.450> gives

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
they're exposed to and our app gives

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.900 
they're exposed to and our app gives
some<00:01:49.050> smart<00:01:49.380> suggestions<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.220> tips<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.700> how

some smart suggestions and tips of how

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.580 
some smart suggestions and tips of how
to<00:01:50.970> handle<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:52.550> ok<00:01:53.550> so<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:53.880> beat<00:01:54.090> me

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
to handle that ok so just beat me

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.410 
to handle that ok so just beat me
so<00:01:55.159> I<00:01:55.189> look<00:01:55.369> at<00:01:55.429> my<00:01:55.520> phone<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:55.759> it<00:01:55.909> says<00:01:56.149> your

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
so I look at my phone and it says your

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.050 
so I look at my phone and it says your
phone<00:01:56.719> radiation<00:01:57.079> is<00:01:57.380> high<00:01:57.619> activate<00:01:58.609> speaker

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
phone radiation is high activate speaker

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.969 
phone radiation is high activate speaker
or<00:01:59.119> headset<00:01:59.359> the<00:02:00.109> reason<00:02:00.409> I<00:02:00.469> told<00:02:00.649> me<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:00.859> do

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
or headset the reason I told me to do

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.590 
or headset the reason I told me to do
that<00:02:01.159> is<00:02:01.399> because<00:02:01.579> it<00:02:01.880> wasn't<00:02:02.179> green<00:02:02.390> before

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
that is because it wasn't green before

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.450 
that is because it wasn't green before
it<00:02:02.960> was<00:02:03.140> green<00:02:03.380> before<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.950> would<00:02:04.039> tell<00:02:04.219> me<00:02:04.310> go

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
it was green before it would tell me go

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.459 
it was green before it would tell me go
back<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.939> where<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.149> were<00:02:05.299> or<00:02:06.020> if<00:02:06.079> I<00:02:06.350> was

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
back to where you were or if I was

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:07.749 
back to where you were or if I was
holding<00:02:06.679> the<00:02:06.890> phone<00:02:07.009> like<00:02:07.189> this<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:07.490> would<00:02:07.609> tell

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
holding the phone like this I would tell

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.669 
holding the phone like this I would tell
me<00:02:07.850> put<00:02:08.000> your<00:02:08.090> phone<00:02:08.269> straight<00:02:08.599> so<00:02:09.080> now<00:02:09.319> they

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.890 
me put your phone straight so now they
know<00:02:09.860> that's<00:02:10.009> not<00:02:10.220> going<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.429> help<00:02:10.569> so<00:02:11.569> it

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
know that's not going to help so it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.509 
know that's not going to help so it
tells<00:02:12.080> me<00:02:12.200> activate<00:02:12.590> speakerphone<00:02:13.099> so<00:02:13.129> I<00:02:13.310> put

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
during our last call there was actually

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.430 
during our last call there was actually
the<00:02:26.120> whole<00:02:26.239> time<00:02:26.390> was<00:02:26.540> on<00:02:26.630> high<00:02:26.750> radiation<00:02:27.019> and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
the whole time was on high radiation and

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.160 
the whole time was on high radiation and
then<00:02:28.040> suddenly<00:02:28.340> here<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:29.239> wasn't<00:02:29.510> absorbing<00:02:30.079> it

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
then suddenly here I wasn't absorbing it

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.630 
then suddenly here I wasn't absorbing it
because<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.410> wasn't<00:02:30.620> next<00:02:30.799> to<00:02:30.920> my<00:02:31.069> ear<00:02:31.250> remember

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
because I wasn't next to my ear remember

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.490 
because I wasn't next to my ear remember
at<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.760> beginning<00:02:31.880> of<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.299> call<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.750> then<00:02:33.410> I

at the beginning of the call and then I
put<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.739> phone<00:02:33.920> next<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.220> my<00:02:34.310> ear<00:02:34.519> and<00:02:34.730> that's

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
put the phone next to my ear and that's

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.050 
put the phone next to my ear and that's
radiation<00:02:36.739> that<00:02:36.829> I<00:02:36.920> was<00:02:37.010> absorbing<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.610> then

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
radiation that I was absorbing and then

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.490 
radiation that I was absorbing and then
it<00:02:38.150> told<00:02:38.269> me<00:02:38.390> going<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.810> speak<00:02:39.019> of<00:02:39.140> funds<00:02:39.290> I'm<00:02:39.440> a

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
the radiation level is high but i wasn't

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.000 
the radiation level is high but i wasn't
getting<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:45.049> because<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:45.470> wasn't<00:02:45.680> next<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:45.890> my

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
a vertical and it goes back down to

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.330 
a vertical and it goes back down to
green<00:02:59.540> it's<00:03:00.290> pretty<00:03:00.470> cool<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:00.829> sometimes<00:03:01.190> it's

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
green it's pretty cool so sometimes it's

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.610 
green it's pretty cool so sometimes it's
very<00:03:01.579> very<00:03:01.819> easy<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.329> lower<00:03:02.480> radiation<00:03:02.870> you

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
very very easy to lower radiation you

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.039 
very very easy to lower radiation you
just<00:03:03.799> need<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.010> little<00:03:04.220> ping<00:03:04.549> and<00:03:04.790> then<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:05.840> can
