 two 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.239

 I'm Celtic interviews watching the credit channel from now I'll talk to you 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.089
 about the reason why the preventor is a thousand times better than the path itself 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:27.240
 I'll start with his son of a thousand whores 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.630
 from mothers to their children 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.630
 find your own thematic channel in your favor 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.080
 I can not stand to suffer 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.760
 building surfactant 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.760
 key concept supporting all 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.960
 I apologize for the inconvenience but I already took care of it within the xv 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.090
 here we go again hello human origel grow and now I will talk to you about the 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.320
 why reggaeton shit is better than rock and anime hahaha xd ya 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.290
 they had believed it, regelton roel is the most horrible thing in the world and for something 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.060
 this country is still fucked by them 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.080
 although I'm not leaving the subject this time I'll tell you a crisis 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.840
 happening well known since there are only videos about this but the 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.400
 story is not very defined of course talked about the legend that has 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.730
 given 1 million 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.790
 personally it takes a lot of time to find information about this and 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.690
 that I did not find anything more than vicious teachers of this crisis is enough but 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.370
 nothing of the story I do not know how I got to the point of being in a German forum 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.180
 hahaha if a German about that story I do not know anything about German but for 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.830
 the way the four videos were, I assumed it was the story 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.270
 that I went to the good friend 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.860
 said translation tool to understand the story although I must say 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.220
 which is a little long so this video your trip through two xp parts since 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.460
 I have the test videos but good 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.650
 I really suspect that this legend originated in that country because it was the 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.480
 only forum that I found the history of eta 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.750
 therefore this story could be false but it was the only story that I could 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.860
 find so do not touch my balls telling me it's fake xd 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.860
 point without further ado I will begin with my transformation 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.829
 aa r 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.870
 magnificent the transformation has been completed I know it sounds like I have 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.589
 a shot in the throat but this has been 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:25.529
 now I will tell you what I found in the German forum but I repeat this story 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:29.749
 it might not be 100% real but because it's a well-known story but it's not 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:31.369
 resume at this time 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:35.229
 now if someone has the gift chronicle more that approaches so well 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.079
 so please pay attention you have decided to put the 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.230
 headphones and is listening to Pauline blonde and the cyber that does not go down to his 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.959
 similar to the songs of the lemon band because gel that will be will begin its 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.950
 chronic and I recommend you watch this video with the lights off at home and 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:52.790
 preferably 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.120
 at midnight with a good fine of 80 and xd cookies 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.189
 this begins 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.199
 in many they will ask what Saturday in dunedin 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.519
 this game the hill that came to my hands 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.079
 I know it will be a pretty strange story but please, how do you 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.079
 had raised before listen carefully xd 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:15.699
 a friend gave me a copy of red green pokémon the reason for this is 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:18.440
 because he had acquired the game months before but 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.210
 I thought I was lost but once I found him he tried to play but he says that 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.120
 after a few minutes he got bored a lot that he got to the point of sending 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.259
 game form so it is 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:32.059
 when they ask me for cartridges and a console and when I turned it on I noticed that it was a bit 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:35.840
 distorted of the logo of gentry pérez manetti very important 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.580
 the game had a game of only three minutes of play and the name of the 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.489
 player that the Spanish provision perhaps accused him in that way by the 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.939
 name of the version that was green or red 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:47.650
 although I really wanted to 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.360
 think a new game so before starting the delivery departure of 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.450
 my friend had already noticed that he had not even left town 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.239
 Palestinian and not pass the event where the teacher gave you the pokémon 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.379
 initial but you see a curious fact 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.290
 the player was in his bed in his bedroom something normal of the game but 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.150
 the various managers that the camera was in the middle of the room something very 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.209
 weird because it is frequent to be in the body of the player who suck at the best 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.230
 it was a bad programming of 200 programmers pérez 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.910
 it was not very important 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.880
 the left side of the plant was dark in color while the other end 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.840
 it was lighter and this is not called a party so I should say people 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.690
 palette the strangest thing is that the melody of the town was not produced as 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.349
 it was to be expected it was a melody that congealed blood itself but good 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.460
 in the backpack there is a level 10 pokémon 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.759
 he was a kid 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.189
 his nickname was mel solitude in Spanish for those who do not know English xd 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.219
 it really was impossible because you did not have more than three minutes of play 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:51.539
 so that you get to have a Pokémon like that from that nickname was a very 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.219
 strange although you could notice that it was badly written but it was not much 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:59.370
 importance since the most penetrating hahaha penetrating was the fact that the 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.919
 The building that I had in my backpack was very different from the ones I knew 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.400
 he had a smile and the famous whining this one had the face of worry and 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.759
 sadness his nature the ball lgg a convincing his moves was tackled 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.080
 Nightmare scream 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.499
 what the hell 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:20.110
 I get out of bed to go to the television after pressing the 

00:05:20.109 --> 00:05:22.360
 button to see if he worked he did it 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.940
 it worked but not wanting and that paralyzed for a moment the text said here not 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:28.759
 we love you that was not good 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:32.990
 therefore it could not do much the exit stairs like the floor 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.589
 previous there was a television but suddenly a balloon with a sign 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:38.710
 exclamation that said everything 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.270
 what does the network mean 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.370
 pressed the button here comes up another television balloon that says no me 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.339
 leave 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:48.929
 I had no choice but to leave the house because I had nothing more than 

00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:52.339
 do so I'm in town paddle or rather empty 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:56.879
 after what I expected was a place 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:00.979
 large mist the pastor was red and the house that had just 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:04.669
 get out of there was halved there are doors that surround the road 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:08.740
 that closed my way and the melody that produces me is that of the abandoned house and 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.979
 I realize that there is a path on this one and that today there is a sign 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.249
 I approach is that when you press the button to reveal a new one with a text that says 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:18.499
 watch 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:21.750
 I do not give importance but the other end there is another way 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.320
 thanks south except I can not get to it because the door prevents me 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.369
 walk through the same area 

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:31.669
 she suddenly appears well-thirteen she seems to be standing at the door and her 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:35.879
 body is purely white with an open mouth that could hardly be seen in the 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:39.929
 screen but the eyes was notorious the color of his eyes that were bleeding 

00:06:39.929 --> 00:06:43.610
 I really did not feel like interacting with him but he suddenly talks to me 

00:06:43.609 --> 00:06:44.430
 telling me 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.639
 you can not do it better 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:47.879
 what the fuck 

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:49.180
 Apparently premiere 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.369
 since he was making fun of me 

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:55.619
 send the fuck is cnpc and I went my way in tying that the grass is 

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:58.419
 it turned black but the red road was still 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.620
 yesterday I was walking towards the end of the route where there was a small center door 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.069
 at the door and it shows that it is something completely within the framework of the game 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:10.399
 the character appears in a whitish flash at school was like the house 

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:14.399
 of the town paleta but without black board and a small desk with a book 

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:15.399
 about her 

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:19.429
 When you approach the table to find the book, there is a balloon where 

00:07:19.429 --> 00:07:21.499
 You can read the following 

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:23.009
 I was so sounded 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:27.419
 his eyes filled with sadness made me so unhealthy so it hurts 

00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:31.029
 I wanted to help him so I did it 

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:35.349
 argument that the balloon disappeared where this phrase appeared to me an mtc
