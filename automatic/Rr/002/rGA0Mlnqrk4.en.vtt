I think you got to go this way I think

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.580 
I think you got to go this way I think
that's<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.010> only<00:02:42.069> way<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.370> do<00:02:42.519> it<00:02:43.410> all<00:02:44.410> right

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
that's the only way to do it all right

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.520 
that's the only way to do it all right
so<00:02:45.220> all<00:02:45.549> right<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:45.850> b<00:02:46.299> is<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.810> do<00:02:46.989> that<00:02:47.170> all

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
so all right so b is to do that all

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.460 
so all right so b is to do that all
right<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:48.459> makes<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.730> lot<00:02:48.760> more<00:02:48.910> sense<00:02:49.209> now

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
memories i think it might be you like

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.150 
memories i think it might be you like
how<00:05:20.460> like<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.720> fan<00:05:21.960> is<00:05:22.169> on<00:05:22.200> the<00:05:22.440> ground<00:05:22.650> almost

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
how like the fan is on the ground almost

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.279 
how like the fan is on the ground almost
that's<00:05:23.430> supposed<00:05:23.669> to<00:05:23.729> be<00:05:23.760> a<00:05:23.820> shadow<00:05:24.030> oh<00:05:24.360> yeah

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
that's supposed to be a shadow oh yeah

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.909 
that's supposed to be a shadow oh yeah
look<00:05:26.010> at<00:05:26.160> that<00:05:26.690> so<00:05:27.690> there<00:05:28.169> was<00:05:28.320> nothing<00:05:28.440> here

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
look at that so there was nothing here

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.270 
look at that so there was nothing here
at<00:05:29.099> all<00:05:30.169> that<00:05:31.169> was<00:05:31.320> kind<00:05:31.680> of<00:05:31.740> a<00:05:31.830> waste<00:05:31.979> of<00:05:32.099> time

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
at all that was kind of a waste of time

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.600 
at all that was kind of a waste of time
but<00:05:32.789> uh<00:05:33.260> yeah<00:05:34.260> I<00:05:34.620> guess<00:05:34.740> that<00:05:35.160> wraps<00:05:35.340> up

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
but uh yeah I guess that wraps up

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.940 
but uh yeah I guess that wraps up
