troops<00:01:04.809> so<00:01:06.000> usually<00:01:07.000> I<00:01:07.299> wouldn't<00:01:07.600> go<00:01:07.659> for<00:01:07.810> this

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
troops so usually I wouldn't go for this

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.980 
troops so usually I wouldn't go for this
is<00:01:08.049> like<00:01:08.170> this<00:01:08.320> but<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:10.119> base<00:01:10.360> had<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.630> lot<00:01:10.960> of

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
is like this but this base had a lot of

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.350 
is like this but this base had a lot of
dark<00:01:11.259> elixir<00:01:11.530> which<00:01:11.860> is<00:01:12.130> always<00:01:12.580> very<00:01:12.820> useful

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
dark elixir which is always very useful

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.790 
dark elixir which is always very useful
so<00:01:13.570> I<00:01:13.600> thought<00:01:13.899> I<00:01:14.200> would<00:01:15.040> on<00:01:15.580> I<00:01:16.409> would<00:01:17.409> braid<00:01:17.649> it

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
so I thought I would on I would braid it

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.880 
so I thought I would on I would braid it
um<00:01:19.440> use<00:01:20.440> the<00:01:20.740> Giants<00:01:21.610> to<00:01:21.759> distract<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.930> cannon

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
um use the Giants to distract the cannon

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.210 
um use the Giants to distract the cannon
and<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:26.200> know<00:01:26.259> just<00:01:26.320> using<00:01:27.039> the<00:01:27.100> wall

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
and you know just using the wall

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.850 
and you know just using the wall

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
elixir really as if you guys know it's

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.350 
elixir really as if you guys know it's
very<00:01:45.159> hard<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.460> get<00:01:45.640> dark<00:01:46.000> elixir<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:47.250> having

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
very hard to get dark elixir and having

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.940 
very hard to get dark elixir and having
its<00:01:49.360> 400<00:01:50.020> in<00:01:50.110> this<00:01:50.229> base<00:01:50.440> or<00:01:51.899> yeah<00:01:52.899> it's<00:01:53.560> worth

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
its 400 in this base or yeah it's worth

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.550 
its 400 in this base or yeah it's worth
going<00:01:54.250> all<00:01:54.490> out<00:01:54.520> even<00:01:55.149> if<00:01:55.720> I<00:01:55.840> don't<00:01:56.050> get<00:01:56.380> all

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
going all out even if I don't get all

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.320 
going all out even if I don't get all
the<00:01:56.709> resources<00:01:56.979> I'm<00:01:57.429> just<00:01:57.640> basically<00:01:58.119> going

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
the resources I'm just basically going

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.270 
the resources I'm just basically going
for<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.539> dark<00:01:58.690> elixir<00:01:58.869> so<00:01:59.739> I<00:01:59.770> deploy<00:02:00.130> the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
for the dark elixir so I deploy the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.660 
for the dark elixir so I deploy the
minions<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.759> help<00:02:01.030> clean<00:02:01.630> up<00:02:01.660> all<00:02:02.500> that<00:02:02.670> those

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
minions to help clean up all that those

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.760 
minions to help clean up all that those
buildings<00:02:04.179> in<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.360> bottom<00:02:04.630> just<00:02:04.750> so<00:02:04.989> the

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
buildings in the bottom just so the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.889 
buildings in the bottom just so the
troops<00:02:06.069> will<00:02:06.250> slowly<00:02:06.459> get<00:02:07.270> closer<00:02:07.599> to<00:02:07.780> the

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
troops will slowly get closer to the

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.260 
troops will slowly get closer to the
center<00:02:08.640> unfortunately<00:02:09.640> my<00:02:09.700> heel<00:02:09.849> gets<00:02:10.060> called

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
center unfortunately my heel gets called

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.869 
center unfortunately my heel gets called
by<00:02:10.390> this<00:02:10.450> Tesla<00:02:10.810> so<00:02:11.590> it's<00:02:11.920> not<00:02:12.099> good<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.580> their
