00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.870
 in minecraft this time to start a 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.099
 new series a new series that the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.650
 I really wanted to start a 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.120
 new series of mods and well this is 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.960
 locomotion installed I have the forge 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.690
 minimum clear for dragon boats is added 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.760
 a dragon that you can climb up to retract 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.720
 antetÃ­tulo that this we will see enough 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.900
 later the truth 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.450
 floating ruins then you will remember 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.120
 I do not know if you'll remember there 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.880
 of the second series of motorcycles that we put 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.710
 in a kind of islands flying is 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.100
 pretty cool because this is the way 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.710
 cloud in ruins floating wins example 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.420
 is adding some stone species 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.460
 precious or some emeralds something like that 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.430
 to make us armor weapons and so on 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.140
 the milan air in this mod 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.380
 is the one that I would like to focus on 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.550
 because he never quite understood it and how 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.400
 I know some of you who 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.780
 we control a lot of mods to see if 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.300
 among all we can make a series 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.310
 quite from hsinchu the one that is based on the 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.070
 mineral of this to see what we can 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:09.320
 get with those villages minecraft plus 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:14.300
 this adds a kind of ruins too 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.210
 some minerals he receives book for 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.470
 know the little things we're going to do 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.950
 wild are the shelves are 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.900
 cool we could put the objects is 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.400
 in it it's pretty cool 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.880
 this to catch the spaces and the tri 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:33.250
 captain hector clear now the question I 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.340
 I would like you to tell me jce 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.260
 I'm going to put on this chest that I 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.060
 You said that other bikes want me 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.470
 ok they have to be the ones that are for 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.930
 1.4 points but the truth would be fine 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.780
 go adding mods later also because 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.890
 I will not put it to allow tricks 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.680
 in case I ever have to get in 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.270
 creative either to climb somewhere 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.530
 or whatever it is we're going to put 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.930
 guillermo simply is already 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.909

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.830

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.400

 I just wanted to know what you think to tell me 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.770
 also some ways that you 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.919
 you want to see but taking into account that 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.390
 here there are sheep I will not take advantage 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:04.210
 I will not waste 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:07.479
 the opportunity to get 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.190
 die wool balls and others and I have 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.360
 bed 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.980
 I do not intend to waste that opportunity 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.370
 here 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.370
 to 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.959
 but bejar 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.650
 some who also have seeds 3 

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:23.590
 little seeds look 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.790
 here 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.790
 but here they come here 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:33.390
 cojones is fucking silly 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.100
 it usually happens that sheep do not like it 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.990
 die well then we already have for a 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:41.990
 bed because I want you to tell me that 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.990
 It seems 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:53.890
 like the host 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:56.410
 now now the ax in the tri capi 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.740
 Hector is spent according to the wood that 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.740
 lame 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.400
 according to the way you take from the tree if 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.190
 It is very big, because it is spent more 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.530
 simply 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.270
 and the end of your opinion that you 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.400
 it would look like a new series of mods 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.740
 and above all that the firm that many 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.750
 struts 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.100
 you already know the modes that I have installed 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.860
 more or less 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:24.380
 now not the truth that they do not look like ruins 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.380
 Floating is a new culture 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.960
 cojones here is the map 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.740
 to the west we go in this direction but 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.979
 there 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:40.490
 but I'm good and again had 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:42.200
 created quite a lot of problems because I'm 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.540
 seeing 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.670
 but good if you know why is it 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.310
 happening this but also put in the 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.860
 comments that I do not know if I said 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.650
 I guess if I do not know but I usually 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.260
 read me all the comments all is 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.220
 everyone 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.220
 and also something weird 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.090
 how I do this lets me see what 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:06.729
 you see as something weird 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.260
 in the jungle but good 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:11.610
 the tenth to see what you think 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.750
 you see 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.060
 It's not like I say goodbye from here inside 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:18.639
 what are they 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.639

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.470
 you already know how to put in the comments that 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:32.700
 it seems to us your many favorites to 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.700
 see if we can install them 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.730
 bye
