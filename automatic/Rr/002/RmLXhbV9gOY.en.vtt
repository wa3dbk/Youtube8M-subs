00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.110
 hello darlings welcome to science 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:12.210
 curious and today and didi good experiment 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.059
 This is the third and last video of this 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.320
 small series that I did for growth 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.270
 about microscopic organisms I go 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.320
 complete showing the few 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.199
 protozoa I found there is I 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.580
 say that it was not very successful 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.179
 to find protozoa in this sample of 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.250
 Water 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.190
 but since I'm kind of out of time I did not go 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.520
 look for another show then I'll go 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.410
 leave to make a video addendums I 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.320
 When you have more time to meet 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.989
 more protozoa I do but anyway I 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.059
 I think it's a video worth the same 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.920
 I hope you like it then. 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.920
 follow the protozoa that I found 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:14.310
 Î', Î', Î', Î', Î' 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.840
 The first protozoan wants to show 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.729
 you are of the order between kida of the family and 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.940
 70 origin that is 80 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.680
 it is very common and if you try to repeat 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.759
 this experience is very likely that you 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.759
 finds him too 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.250
 while going through some images 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.069
 of the recordings that I did I want 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.140
 remember that the material used in the 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:43.950
 experience is actually a sample of 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.780
 Water 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.970
 in my case when there is water in a park 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.950
 of curitiba park barigui and a 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.069
 microscope as I said there in the first 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.690
 video who is the video tutorial about 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:56.190
 microscopes then only these two by 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.479
 this I did not put in the video one 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.479
 separate part for materials 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.280
 this individual can be considered 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.379
 both something as a protozoan but as 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.000
 I was weak as a protozoan to whom 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.700
 had enough something I put with the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.629
 protozoan of the order and plenary 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.690
 family 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:40.239
 kaka if this is a pacu sp that in 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.640
 truth is a legislative emblem haze 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.310
 it can be considered both for the 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.720
 about something like I already said 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:53.260
 because she performs photosynthesis but she 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:54.940
 also has a good trophic sound line 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.940
 it was just the ones I had to show 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.440
 for yourself and if you want to meet 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.659
 a little more of the diversity of 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.400
 Protozoa I suggest you continue 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.480
 watching the video to check 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.640
 explanation 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.030
 in today's video we look for the 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.030
 protozoa 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.840
 protozoa are organisms 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.060
 unicellular mobile and even eukaryotic 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.519
 the fixed ones they can still move 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.069
 a curiosity is that the name products or 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.280
 means first animals 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.689
 the body of most protozoa 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.430
 consists of a single cell 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.569
 even though many species form 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.220
 colonies 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.769
 the body of the protozoa is usually 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.069
 limited only by the cell membrane 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.349
 The rigidity or flexibility of the body is 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.510
 related to the written belt that is 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.510
 located well below the cell median 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.600
 the cytoskeleton is composed almost always 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.670
 of protein filaments such as the retina 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.280
 microtubules and vesicles such as 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.980
 alveoli or combinations of the three as 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.620
 you can see in the image beside 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.110
 the skeletal site and the cell membrane in 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.530
 together form a film a type of 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.849
 body wall of user products 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.830
 diversity 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.489
 the designers exhibit a diversity 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.780
 remarkable and plays an ecological role 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.269
 of the total number of 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.669
 described species of proteins a little 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.490
 less than half are protozoa that 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.070
 gives something around 90 and 2000 I separated 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.780
 here in a didactic way and not a 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.790
 taxonomic form to talk about 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.860
 diversity of user products 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.990
 this didactic form takes into account 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.419
 the way he moves to 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.250
 we can highlight the 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.470
 flagellated protozoa 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.130
 of this group are representatives 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.900
 important as leishmaniasis 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.180
 causes of leishmaniasis 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.240
 the cruzi trypanosome causing the disease 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.960
 and the trips lick the house of the 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.840
 garden and another group are aided 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.419
 as bears we saw in the video and 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.590
 also there are the Mercian 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.780
 rebounds 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.660
 as it is not yet quite critical that 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.729
 cause disease in man and still coin 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.840
 that it does not cause disease and lives in 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.880
 intestinal flora 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.830
 besides these there are still the choirs 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.870
 users that are produced in the form of 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.010
 spores such as the plasmodium that causes 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.139
 malaria 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.550
 Good guys, it's more or less what I 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.380
 I had to pass it on to you. 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.940
 If you liked the explanation, what do you do? 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.410
 a simple curious access download 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.660
 pointed out with 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.419
 If you liked the accompanying video 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.460
 our materials subscribe to the channel and 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.680
 if you want to help in the short disclosure 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.389
 The favorite is the video, I'm staying here. 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.780
 Find you next time. 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.780
 until then
