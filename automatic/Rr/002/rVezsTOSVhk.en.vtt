00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
setup with the 7970 compared to like the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.130 
setup with the 7970 compared to like the
6870<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.369> 6950<00:01:30.119> where<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.360> got<00:01:30.509> dual<00:01:30.810> DVI

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
6870 in the 6950 where you got dual DVI

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.770 
6870 in the 6950 where you got dual DVI
and<00:01:31.409> then<00:01:31.619> mini<00:01:31.799> display<00:01:32.220> port<00:01:32.250> an<00:01:32.700> HDMI<00:01:33.030> in

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
and then mini display port an HDMI in

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.690 
and then mini display port an HDMI in
this<00:01:34.320> case<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.799> actually<00:01:35.009> comes<00:01:35.490> prepared

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
this case it actually comes prepared

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.850 
this case it actually comes prepared
with<00:01:36.450> mini<00:01:37.350> displayport<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.400> DVI<00:01:39.860> active

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
with mini displayport to DVI active

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.240 
with mini displayport to DVI active
adapter<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:42.000> well<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.700> hdmi<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.060> DVI<00:01:46.250> adapter

adapter as well as a hdmi to DVI adapter
as<00:01:47.399> well<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:48.090> what<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.329> would<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.750> you

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
as well so what you would do is you

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.569 
as well so what you would do is you
pretty<00:01:49.079> much<00:01:49.140> would<00:01:49.409> go<00:01:49.560> from<00:01:49.979> your<00:01:50.399> mini

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
pretty much would go from your mini

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.840 
pretty much would go from your mini
display<00:01:51.030> for<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.490> active

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
display for it to the with the active

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.840 
display for it to the with the active
adapter<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.420> DVI<00:01:54.720> using<00:01:55.560> also<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.159> DVI<00:01:56.460> port

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
