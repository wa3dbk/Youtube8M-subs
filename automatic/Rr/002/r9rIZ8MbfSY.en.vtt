00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.450
 and the little ones and curling and we get 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.950
 found in the known strong on the beta of 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.320
 world war and north for a boss who's been 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.610
 tested recently the boss is called etc 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.950
 the living mountain 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.799
 it's a beautiful thing that is focused on the 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.690
 stuffing or dps and it's a boss who at 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.119
 my opinion took the place of crane in fact 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.250
 you'll see why just now 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.990
 first its description in the codex which 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.060
 tells us that stubborn is an incarnation 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.160
 ancient chaotic forces that has 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.419
 carved reliefs of dre north text us 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.890
 was corrupt and served by the 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.939
 terrible horrible case that is struggling to 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.840
 maintain their hold on this 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.950
 imposing force of nature 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.030
 which is nice enough that there is 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.960
 bleached offers actually you 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.430
 see two o'clock that tooth a 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.149
 big heart server there is a small 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.980
 small 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.000
 who are therefore well known in the 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.530
 territory of others when I do not know 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.239
 too much if the two are allied or whatever 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.030
 finally short if you apologize I said 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.559
 that he was a big fat boss dps the 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.000
 This is because there is you now 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.829
 to analyze a tectonic uplift 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.840
 who does when he gets to 100 energy 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.969
 at the end of his cycle and at the end of this 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.230
 thing he's going to regain 20% of his life in 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.660
 any case for now in heroic mode 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.039
 on the test it's 20% of his life but 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.689
 I imagine that in mythical and other this 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.920
 will be much more it will be to see and they 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.479
 invoke others during the first 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.210
 phase of the fight and what happens in 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.799
 done with your that you know it's a 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.630
 boss once one kills him will separate 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.520
 in two and once we kill both 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.759
 fragments they will split into four 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.530
 so the idea is already there is a check 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.520
 dps since you have to kill him before they 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.140
 channel the uplift too often 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.600
 where he will channel them a second 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.950
 times we miss squeaks of dps and the 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.720
 blow it starts to hurt a lot on the 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.060
 raid since it is a big water and 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.159
 the big problem we have with that actually 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.479
 is that they win beef steak 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.680
 which makes them inflict more and 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.869
 more damage and growing bigger and bigger 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.329
 more which means that less quickly we 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.549
 kills him faster wins stack more 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.840
 hymn to the top in addition to that you 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.530
 see he has group species id 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.939
 coming out of the ground 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.140
 there is a line a very big pillars that 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.270
 will get out of the ground and that one shot 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.380
 anyone below and you see at 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.579
 case level that has very small 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.719
 pillars that appear the only thing 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.920
 what they do is make us a little 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.750
 little damage and we eject 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.189
 I honestly think that these pillars there 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.240
 who are in the cac should do the double 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.829
 even triple the damage that 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.270
 because at the moment I'm picking myself up and 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.619
 I lose in any case he has he has 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.370
 no stage because there it is kind to 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.380
 more than 30 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.729
 when he does not have a stack of his stuff he 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.360
 inflicts us almost no damage and 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.320
 in the end we do not avoid them and we are not 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.570
 not really able or not the two 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.830
 avoid that it's a shame I'm going 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.870
 take it and make me more or less 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.860
 for one shot no I take two hundred 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.760
 twenty thousand damage while they 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.340
 call 30 stack 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.900
 it should honestly it should never 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.860
 happen they should chat us but 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.120
 where I said it looks a bit like 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.040
 segou brÃ¼hl see how they grow 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.530
 like that and grill right now it's not 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.970
 too much the case on the grill that we have to 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.100
 the rushmore foundry and I find it nice 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.680
 to have a boss like that that grows 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.820
 a lot but again he 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.960
 gets bigger than if we do the fight of 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.060
 no matter how there you go see 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.890
 we will make a pool widely 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.440
 better widely better in the sense 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.700
 where we will just drop the boss 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.860
 another mechanics that I talked about these 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.720
 species of red clouds there he 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.100
 select a player and this player is going 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.410
 swing a trail of red clouds 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.670
 on his way so the idea that we have 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.290
 given that we find ourselves in a 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.150
 situation where the boss of high quality 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.160
 is that we have to go into a 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.040
 sense and it has to be people who is it 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.000
 and area the red clouds and the pillars 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.350
 groups and they emit more 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.750
 or less behind c 'is not present in the 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.430
 way and we have no problem is a 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.659
 other 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.980
 you 're fighting is that the helpers 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.450
 that they invoke at the beginning of the fight he 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.250
 invokes them only when he is 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.079
 still in texture itself from the 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.150
 moment you once and who separates into 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.230
 two edges to appear is Ca 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.519
 there are not very very dangerous the 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.930
 berserker the only thing that does its 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.450
 two rural dependent children at all 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.219
 chance and he's doing damage on his 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.139
 way honestly it's not 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:35.939
 especially dangerous even it's not 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.989
 dangerous at all and the other what makes 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.739
 is that they channel a gift from the 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.480
 earth that will make me texture the gift of 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.799
 the land here we see is what the 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.000
 time that must finally make the stanc 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.799
 it's getting on the road to 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.909
 which intercept the light itself 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.129
 one of the oxen obviously do not need them 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:51.359
 take too much and it prevents the boss 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.439
 win too stack the scramble is that at the 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.540
 Inventory levels it's called 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:57.599
 creativeness I believe the estac of the boss who 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.189
 does it inflict more damage there 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.230
 not at all since we abounded ps there 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.730
 you see that he is killed he is transformed 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.409
 in a pile of sand it's pretty cute 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.480
 donkeys are dying too 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.010
 and suddenly two minutes ago that you etc. 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.810
 who appears what is called splinters 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.389
 of textures at that time helps 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.280
 will stop appearing but what has 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.209
 very nice trait precisely because the 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.769
 fight is not rhino currently 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.419
 on the beta it's the skills are 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.070
 not very very dangerous and others and 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.620
 the damage does not increase so much 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.330
 towards the end it's probably some 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.830
 thing that will have to fix what 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.000
 is really nice is that when there is 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.860
 two bursts and you what happens 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.630
 there are twice the small areas on the 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.159
 soil that will appear ah yes there are some 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.539
 two times there are big areas 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:35.039
 on the floor that will appear there are 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.169
 twice the tectonic uprisings 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.479
 there are twice the accession estac which 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.099
 rises since the accretion estac in 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.440
 does it increase the damage are based 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.970
 also on the number of end dates 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.220
 of the year the number of textures between 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.509
 quotation marks that are in place is what 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.680
 means that the high etc. you 100 wins 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.419
 1 when he is alone when there is 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.919
 two texts he wins 2 and when there 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.159
 has four tidal 4 and so 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.780
 after 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:56.400
 so technically it's supposed to increase 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.060
 the damage load we are going to take 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.039
 during the fight 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.599
 currently it does not do more than that 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.889
 so these problems for that the fight 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.710
 is a little easy there you see we have 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.680
 killed one of the splinters 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.910
 and suddenly we made appear 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.350
 spaces is called shrapnel I'm coming 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.970
 no granules have made appear 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.840
 objective granules so there you see where 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.640
 I wanted to take to the level of 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.600
 skills there are four groups i right 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.160
 they appear on the warm floor 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.540
 subject bubbles for penetrations and 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.500
 it's really nice because we 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.570
 realizes we do not have a lot of 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.500
 place at the level of the fight since it is 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.240
 areas that will stay for a moment 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.650
 still one of the big pillars it remains 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.360
 really long time small appliances 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.520
 if we eject leave but leo it 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.960
 stays a long, long time and 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.490
 it becomes really nice the only one 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.560
 problem again is that it's 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.290
 a little too easy addons not enough 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.300
 of pv the small granules so should 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.830
 to have a little more pv than that and 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.970
 but it does not change at the level of 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.230
 design stuff is really nice 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.550
 it's super nice to do it's 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.880
 really the big buzz good of nag 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.870
 it's survive and smashed up pretty fast 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.160
 we still take a lot of damage to 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.970
 level of the raid at that moment but I 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.360
 think there were dead 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.330
 and I do not know if they still have 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.050
 water reserve has not stopped watching 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.700
 well and they will have more really 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.170
 a lot a lot of mana actually it's 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.550
 that makes them more complicated at 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.020
 level of the red clouds obviously 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.040
 it's like a plus the texture over to 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.120
 of clouds and I think that at the level of the 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.470
 stratum what to do is do it 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.600
 especially not kill the two bursts at the same 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.470
 time is when both the 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.210
 two eyes that they appear after 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.190
 we had done there is a kung glow 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.500
 fu cus and when he hands in the area the 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.790
 little ones from that shine there because 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.050
 that if we end up with 8 declare 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.250
 same time in my opinion we can not 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.670
 survive all the areas that are going 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.080
 appear 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:29.010
 I honestly think we can not 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.110
 survive there the granules they have 1 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:34.590
 millions of pv roughly and considering the 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.180
 rise is good not very very dangerous 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.860
 what I point out in passing that all 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.940
 the areas that are put there they are 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.260
 put a certain level of energy 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.360
 abnormally large areas 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.520
 finally groupies coming out of the ground 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.949
 arrives at 25 texture energy 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.050
 and when he's at 100 he's doing the ex the 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:53.560
 tectonic stuff that will him the 2 1% if 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.699
 we do not kill him before then of the 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.710
 luck because there if you look at the 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.599
 only see that testing for texture is 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.250
 finished and we will be tp outside 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:02.409
 of the area probably about twenty 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.849
 seconds after killing the boss so we 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:06.220
 touch of wood the boss is really 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:07.210
 nice it's good we can all I 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.830
 think it's good we can test 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.699
 absolutely every phase because 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.229
 that's the kind of bumps worries have 

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:12.909
 tested that phase 1 without having the 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:14.319
 others would not be very interesting 

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:16.419
 so that's why now 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:17.440
 boss is too easy I do not know 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:18.699
 exactly but in all cases it's 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.500
 a boss who promises to be really nice 

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:21.849
 when it will be good you are at the level of 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.110
 damage and the rest that's going to be 

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:24.940
 really really really cool 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.199
 to get to the end and have all these 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.789
 areas that appear should happen 

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:28.389
 all that stuff and still have to 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:31.509
 faster 

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:32.650
 kill the texture granules so I'm 

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:36.729
 glad to see that it's going to be very, very 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:38.020
 nice in all cases the pounds if the 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:40.030
 video did not hesitate you anymore 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.830
 subscribe to the channel and subscribe to 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.580
 my stream since most of these 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.870
 raid tests 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.759
 in any case for the moment all these 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.009
 tests should his stream and evenings 

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:50.020
 where the wizzards decides to test the 

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:51.159
 content so here I really show you 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.330
 some hens 

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:53.860
 at the style level it's an hour and 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.270
 half of hens of reflections 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.500
 discussions at the strategy level and 

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.370
 This is so it can be as 

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.229
 interesting to see 

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.349
 and I find you next 

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:01.349
 time
