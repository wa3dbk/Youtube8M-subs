your tools with you that's the red bag
hanging<00:01:19.190> below<00:01:19.600> it<00:01:20.600> weighs<00:01:20.810> about<00:01:20.990> 30<00:01:21.350> pounds

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
hanging below it weighs about 30 pounds

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.590 
hanging below it weighs about 30 pounds
and<00:01:22.159> you<00:01:22.220> pull<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:22.490> up<00:01:22.730> behind<00:01:23.060> you<00:01:23.330> all<00:01:23.540> the

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
and you pull it up behind you all the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.969 
and you pull it up behind you all the
way<00:01:24.080> to<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.350> top<00:01:26.409> it's<00:01:27.409> a<00:01:27.530> lot<00:01:27.710> like<00:01:27.950> a

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
way to the top it's a lot like a

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.520 
way to the top it's a lot like a
spacewalk<00:01:28.720> where<00:01:29.720> you<00:01:29.840> have<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.170> remember<00:01:30.350> to

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
spacewalk where you have to remember to

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.900 
spacewalk where you have to remember to
bring<00:01:30.710> everything<00:01:31.310> you're<00:01:31.490> going<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.790> need

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
bring everything you're going to need

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:38.890 
bring everything you're going to need
because<00:01:32.630> it's<00:01:32.930> a<00:01:33.020> long<00:01:33.290> way<00:01:33.590> down<00:01:37.720> once<00:01:38.720> you

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
because it's a long way down once you

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.950 
because it's a long way down once you
reach<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.350> top<00:01:39.380> of<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.830> tower<00:01:40.270> itself<00:01:41.270> it's

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
reach the top of the tower itself it's

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:54.040 
reach the top of the tower itself it's
time<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.530> go<00:01:42.650> outside

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.200 

this<00:01:54.740> is<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.070> pole<00:01:55.310> that<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.730> antennas

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
this is the pole that the antennas

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.590 
this is the pole that the antennas
mounted<00:01:56.660> on<00:01:56.810> top<00:01:57.050> of<00:01:57.290> it<00:01:58.160> is<00:01:58.490> there<00:01:58.790> for<00:01:59.090> extra

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
mounted on top of it is there for extra

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.840 
mounted on top of it is there for extra
height<00:02:02.770> this<00:02:03.770> is<00:02:03.950> called<00:02:04.190> free<00:02:04.520> climbing

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
height this is called free climbing

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.440 
height this is called free climbing
meaning<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:05.900> no<00:02:06.170> safety<00:02:06.680> lines<00:02:06.890> are<00:02:07.100> used

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
meaning that no safety lines are used

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.170 
meaning that no safety lines are used
it's<00:02:08.450> easier<00:02:08.990> faster<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:10.010> most<00:02:10.850> tower

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
it's easier faster and most tower

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.110 
it's easier faster and most tower
workers<00:02:11.800> climb<00:02:12.800> this<00:02:13.040> way

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.000 

it's<00:02:17.120> good<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.540> take<00:02:17.690> a<00:02:17.750> break<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.680> look

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
it's good to take a break and look

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.190 
it's good to take a break and look
around<00:02:19.160> while<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:19.820> rest<00:02:22.570> free<00:02:23.570> climbing<00:02:23.900> is

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
around while you rest free climbing is

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.920 
around while you rest free climbing is
more<00:02:24.500> dangerous<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.190> course<00:02:25.300> but<00:02:26.300> OSHA<00:02:26.510> rules

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
more dangerous of course but OSHA rules

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.800 
more dangerous of course but OSHA rules
do<00:02:27.290> allow<00:02:27.410> for<00:02:27.590> it

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
do allow for it

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.290 
do allow for it
attaching<00:02:29.980> climbing<00:02:31.150> attaching<00:02:32.150> and

removing safety lines every few feet

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.170 
removing safety lines every few feet
slows<00:02:34.970> progress<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:35.930> tiring<00:02:37.000> here<00:02:38.000> you

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
slows progress and is tiring here you

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:57.600 

this<00:06:49.570> is<00:06:49.780> the<00:06:49.930> tricky<00:06:50.260> part<00:06:50.770> getting<00:06:51.400> on<00:06:51.520> top
