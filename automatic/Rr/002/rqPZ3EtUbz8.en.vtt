recant<00:00:43.960> you<00:00:44.050> can<00:00:44.230> really<00:00:44.380> tell<00:00:44.559> the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
recant you can really tell the

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.370 
recant you can really tell the
difference<00:00:44.710> when<00:00:45.190> you<00:00:45.309> put<00:00:45.970> visual<00:00:46.329> apps<00:00:46.540> and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380

you can see the colors more it's more
vivid<00:01:23.259> if<00:01:23.439> you<00:01:23.590> will<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.630> let's<00:01:25.840> let's<00:01:26.109> play

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
vivid if you will so let's let's play

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.950 
vivid if you will so let's let's play
around<00:01:26.560> with<00:01:26.859> it

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:42.070 

there<00:01:33.680> we<00:01:33.890> go

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:55.320 

let's<00:01:42.680> go<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:45.970> visit<00:01:46.970> Jupiter

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.330 

so<00:01:56.080> there<00:01:56.590> aren't<00:01:56.710> actually<00:01:57.100> slight

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
so there aren't actually slight

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.680 
so there aren't actually slight
differences<00:01:57.880> between<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:01.150> last<00:02:01.330> version

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
differences between the the last version

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.680 
differences between the the last version
of<00:02:02.140> solar<00:02:02.800> walk<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.370> the<00:02:03.460> new<00:02:03.640> version<00:02:03.820> you

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
of solar walk and the new version you

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.870 
of solar walk and the new version you
can<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:04.960> can<00:02:05.140> tell<00:02:05.350> I'm<00:02:05.530> I'm<00:02:06.340> testing<00:02:06.850> the

can you can tell I'm I'm testing the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.300 
can you can tell I'm I'm testing the

exact same apps one of them is optimized

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.340 
exact same apps one of them is optimized
for<00:02:09.340> for<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.390> second<00:02:10.720> generation<00:02:10.810> iPad<00:02:11.530> and

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
for for the second generation iPad and

is optimized for third generations there

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:28.070 
is optimized for third generations there
are<00:02:17.800> slight<00:02:18.220> differences<00:02:20.670> let<00:02:21.670> me<00:02:22.000> make<00:02:22.270> it

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.230 

there<00:02:29.080> we<00:02:29.260> go<00:02:29.440> all<00:02:30.310> right<00:02:32.430> if<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.670> see<00:02:33.940> this<00:02:34.060> in

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
person you can actually see that the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.370 
person you can actually see that the
details<00:02:38.830> on<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:40.120> planet<00:02:40.570> actually<00:02:41.170> show

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
details on this planet actually show

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.190 
details on this planet actually show
much<00:02:41.620> better<00:02:41.920> on<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.310> third<00:02:42.550> generation

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
much better on the third generation

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.090 
much better on the third generation
where<00:02:44.200> versus<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.980> second<00:02:45.430> one<00:02:46.770> so<00:02:47.770> this<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.010> a

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
where versus the second one so this is a

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.600 
where versus the second one so this is a
basic<00:02:48.340> demonstration<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:50.220> yeah<00:02:51.220> even<00:02:51.490> do

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
basic demonstration that yeah even do

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.949 
basic demonstration that yeah even do
some<00:02:51.790> people<00:02:52.060> don't<00:02:52.240> want<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.390> upgrate<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.780> the

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
some people don't want to upgrate to the

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.220 
some people don't want to upgrate to the
tool<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.340> latest<00:02:54.730> iPad<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.900> screen

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
tool to the latest iPad the screen

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.560 
tool to the latest iPad the screen
quality<00:02:56.500> does<00:02:56.920> make<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.190> difference<00:02:57.510> now<00:02:58.510> as

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
quality does make a difference now as

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.850 
quality does make a difference now as
far<00:02:58.870> as<00:03:00.209> there<00:03:01.209> are<00:03:01.300> dark<00:03:02.019> talks<00:03:02.350> about<00:03:02.650> how

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
far as there are dark talks about how

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.540 
far as there are dark talks about how
the<00:03:02.920> latest<00:03:03.580> generation<00:03:03.760> iPad<00:03:05.070> heats<00:03:06.070> up<00:03:06.340> when

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
the latest generation iPad heats up when

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.840 
the latest generation iPad heats up when
you<00:03:06.760> when<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.180> try<00:03:07.510> visualize<00:03:08.019> when<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.380> are

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
you when you try visualize when you are

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.050 
you when you try visualize when you are
graphics<00:03:10.410> intensive<00:03:11.410> apps<00:03:11.830> I<00:03:12.160> haven't<00:03:12.910> really

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
know what consumer reports was was

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.160 
know what consumer reports was was
testing<00:03:30.209> but<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:31.239> haven't<00:03:31.540> been<00:03:31.750> able<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:31.989> get

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
testing but I haven't been able to get

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.710 
testing but I haven't been able to get
hundred<00:03:32.470> sixteen<00:03:32.830> degrees<00:03:33.010> as<00:03:33.720> they

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
hundred sixteen degrees as they

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:43.690 
hundred sixteen degrees as they
suggested<00:03:35.200> in<00:03:35.290> their<00:03:35.440> report<00:03:38.190> let's<00:03:39.190> test

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.030 

it's<00:03:44.700> son<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.840> beautiful<00:03:46.440> here<00:03:46.620> that<00:03:46.830> let's

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
it's son is beautiful here that let's

00:03:47.040 --> 00:04:07.870 
it's son is beautiful here that let's
let's<00:03:47.460> test<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.880> here<00:03:49.460> there<00:03:50.460> we<00:03:50.640> go

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.580 

so<00:04:08.480> yeah<00:04:08.600> I<00:04:08.630> haven't<00:04:08.990> I<00:04:09.080> haven't<00:04:09.110> played<00:04:09.470> with

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
so yeah I haven't I haven't played with

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.620 
so yeah I haven't I haven't played with
the<00:04:09.770> settings<00:04:09.980> of<00:04:10.220> any<00:04:10.430> of<00:04:10.550> these<00:04:10.670> have<00:04:10.940> so<00:04:11.270> you

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
the settings of any of these have so you

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.120 
the settings of any of these have so you
can<00:04:11.750> see<00:04:11.870> there<00:04:12.020> are<00:04:12.080> small<00:04:12.380> differences<00:04:12.590> I'm

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
can see there are small differences I'm

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.730 
can see there are small differences I'm
doing<00:04:13.370> exactly<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:14.030> exact<00:04:14.270> same<00:04:14.480> thing<00:04:14.780> one

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
doing exactly the exact same thing one

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.229 
doing exactly the exact same thing one
of<00:04:15.830> them<00:04:15.920> has<00:04:16.100> different<00:04:16.489> graphics<00:04:16.910> a<00:04:17.000> little

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
of them has different graphics a little

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.160 
of them has different graphics a little
bit<00:04:17.360> so<00:04:17.720> I<00:04:18.610> assume<00:04:19.610> that's<00:04:19.760> part<00:04:20.060> of<00:04:20.150> their<00:04:20.330> the

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
bit so I assume that's part of their the

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.430 
bit so I assume that's part of their the
developers<00:04:21.650> plan<00:04:21.920> to<00:04:22.570> optimize<00:04:23.570> it<00:04:23.960> for<00:04:23.990> for

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
developers plan to optimize it for for

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:32.710 
developers plan to optimize it for for
the<00:04:24.500> latest<00:04:24.740> generation<00:04:31.270> so<00:04:32.270> that's<00:04:32.450> that's

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
the latest generation so that's that's

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.860 
the latest generation so that's that's
pretty<00:04:33.020> much<00:04:33.170> pretty<00:04:33.740> much<00:04:33.860> it<00:04:34.570> you<00:04:35.570> can't

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
pretty much pretty much it you can't

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.080 
pretty much pretty much it you can't
really<00:04:36.050> tell<00:04:36.350> for<00:04:37.010> for<00:04:37.220> some<00:04:37.400> apps<00:04:37.670> you<00:04:37.850> don't

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
really tell for for some apps you don't

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.390 
really tell for for some apps you don't
really<00:04:38.270> need<00:04:38.540> that<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:39.560> improved<00:04:39.920> display

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
really need that the improved display

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.570 
really need that the improved display
but<00:04:41.000> obviously<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.600> does<00:04:41.780> make<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.020> difference

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
but obviously it does make a difference

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.950 
but obviously it does make a difference
is<00:04:43.990> it<00:04:44.990> worth<00:04:45.800> upgrading<00:04:45.980> to<00:04:46.340> ipad<00:04:46.730> 3<00:04:47.060> just

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
is it worth upgrading to ipad 3 just

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.170 
is it worth upgrading to ipad 3 just
because<00:04:48.260> of<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.440> screen<00:04:48.710> that<00:04:49.340> that<00:04:49.760> really

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
because of the screen that that really

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.350 
because of the screen that that really
depends<00:04:50.660> on<00:04:50.810> what<00:04:50.870> you<00:04:51.140> want<00:04:51.320> to<00:04:51.380> do<00:04:52.360> some

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
depends on what you want to do some

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.060 
depends on what you want to do some
