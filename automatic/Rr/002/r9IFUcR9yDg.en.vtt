turn<00:02:02.120> the<00:02:02.240> flashlight<00:02:02.570> on<00:02:02.870> and<00:02:02.930> off<00:02:03.200> however

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
turn the flashlight on and off however

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.390 
turn the flashlight on and off however
the<00:02:04.370> detent<00:02:04.790> on<00:02:05.120> this<00:02:05.870> is<00:02:06.050> not<00:02:06.200> very<00:02:06.470> not<00:02:07.370> very

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
the detent on this is not very not very

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.359 
the detent on this is not very not very
positive<00:02:07.760> so<00:02:08.479> it<00:02:08.780> tends<00:02:08.989> to<00:02:09.079> kind<00:02:10.069> of<00:02:10.159> wiggle

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
positive so it tends to kind of wiggle

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.940 
positive so it tends to kind of wiggle
around<00:02:10.579> a<00:02:10.879> bit<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.209> in<00:02:11.840> turn<00:02:12.109> causes

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
around a bit and in turn causes

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.920 
around a bit and in turn causes
the<00:02:13.069> light<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.459> liquor<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.030> causes<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.780> light

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
the light of liquor and causes the light

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.699 
the light of liquor and causes the light
to<00:02:15.310> sometimes<00:02:16.310> fail<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:16.849> work<00:02:17.150> at<00:02:17.269> all<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:17.660> if<00:02:18.620> I

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
to sometimes fail to work at all so if I

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.280 
to sometimes fail to work at all so if I
put<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:18.980> here<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.879> on<00:02:20.360> mode<00:02:20.870> we<00:02:21.050> should<00:02:21.230> be

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
put it here in the on mode we should be

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.240 
put it here in the on mode we should be

able to turn the light on

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.660 
able to turn the light on
okay<00:02:22.970> there's<00:02:23.209> hi<00:02:24.280> that's<00:02:25.280> really<00:02:25.489> stable

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
okay there's hi that's really stable

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.000 
okay there's hi that's really stable
right<00:02:25.910> now<00:02:26.060> but<00:02:26.360> if<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.599> you<00:02:27.349> see<00:02:27.560> if<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:27.769> just

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
right now but if I you see if I just

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.740 
right now but if I you see if I just
kind<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.280> move<00:02:28.610> this<00:02:28.790> right<00:02:28.970> light<00:02:29.360> around<00:02:29.599> a

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
kind of move this right light around a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.970 
kind of move this right light around a
little<00:02:29.930> bit<00:02:30.019> this<00:02:30.110> tail<00:02:30.319> clicky<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:30.709> can<00:02:30.830> see

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
little bit this tail clicky you can see

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.640 
little bit this tail clicky you can see
it<00:02:31.099> fluctuate<00:02:32.030> extremely<00:02:32.989> bad<00:02:33.200> there<00:02:33.500> and

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
it fluctuate extremely bad there and

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.530 
it fluctuate extremely bad there and
that's<00:02:33.769> just<00:02:33.830> from<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.400> slightest<00:02:35.090> movement

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
that's just from the slightest movement

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.660 
that's just from the slightest movement
it's<00:02:36.349> not<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.620> camera<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.160> is<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.489> light

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
it's not the camera that is the light

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.460 
it's not the camera that is the light
flickering<00:02:38.090> it's<00:02:38.360> not<00:02:38.540> changing<00:02:38.989> modes

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
flickering it's not changing modes

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.250 
flickering it's not changing modes
it's<00:02:40.180> simply<00:02:41.180> fluctuating<00:02:42.049> in<00:02:42.319> high<00:02:42.650> mode

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
it's simply fluctuating in high mode

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.309 
it's simply fluctuating in high mode
that's<00:02:45.260> just<00:02:45.849> not<00:02:46.849> good<00:02:47.120> for<00:02:47.480> me<00:02:47.599> I<00:02:47.810> don't<00:02:47.989> I

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
that's just not good for me I don't I

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.190 
that's just not good for me I don't I
don't<00:02:48.830> like<00:02:49.099> my<00:02:49.970> flashlight<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.510> flicker

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
don't like my flashlight to flicker

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.830 
don't like my flashlight to flicker
I<00:02:51.230> think<00:02:51.950> that's<00:02:52.160> shows<00:02:52.910> that<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.329> switch<00:02:53.690> is

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
I think that's shows that that switch is

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.729 
I think that's shows that that switch is
not<00:02:53.959> very<00:02:54.170> reliable

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
not very reliable

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.240 
not very reliable
in<00:02:54.890> fact<00:02:55.670> sometimes<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.660> switch<00:02:56.959> oh<00:02:57.290> there<00:02:58.190> we

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
in fact sometimes the switch oh there we

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.390 
in fact sometimes the switch oh there we
go

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
go

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.759 
go
causes<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.090> light<00:02:59.269> not<00:02:59.900> to<00:03:00.049> function<00:03:00.230> at<00:03:00.590> all

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
causes the light not to function at all

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.289 
causes the light not to function at all
you<00:03:01.040> can<00:03:01.160> see<00:03:01.280> there's<00:03:01.489> in<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.760> circle<00:03:02.120> mode

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
you can see there's in the circle mode

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.289 
you can see there's in the circle mode
which<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.900> unlocked<00:03:03.560> mode<00:03:03.829> and<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:05.150> light

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
which is the unlocked mode and the light

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.360 
which is the unlocked mode and the light
will<00:03:05.420> not<00:03:05.540> function<00:03:05.780> so<00:03:06.200> me<00:03:06.319> though<00:03:06.709> came<00:03:07.220> on

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
will not function so me though came on

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.860 
will not function so me though came on
let's<00:03:07.610> move<00:03:07.730> around<00:03:08.000> there<00:03:08.360> we<00:03:08.450> go<00:03:08.569> we<00:03:08.660> got<00:03:08.780> it

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
let's move around there we go we got it

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.319 
let's move around there we go we got it
on<00:03:08.930> again<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:10.280> cycle<00:03:10.700> through<00:03:10.819> the<00:03:10.880> modes<00:03:10.910> you

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
on again so cycle through the modes you

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:12.759 
on again so cycle through the modes you
press<00:03:11.569> the<00:03:11.690> tail<00:03:11.870> clicky<00:03:12.230> part<00:03:12.500> of<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.680> way

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
press the tail clicky part of the way

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.720 
press the tail clicky part of the way
down<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:14.060> we<00:03:14.120> can<00:03:14.209> get<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.390> light<00:03:14.569> to<00:03:14.690> function

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
down so we can get the light to function

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.809 
down so we can get the light to function
low<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:17.859> can<00:03:18.859> get<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.100> go<00:03:19.130> through<00:03:19.370> there's<00:03:19.700> a

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
low I can get it to go through there's a

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.650 
low I can get it to go through there's a
strobe<00:03:20.180> it's<00:03:20.959> fairly<00:03:21.260> hard<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.650> cycle<00:03:22.069> through

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
strobe it's fairly hard to cycle through

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.509 
strobe it's fairly hard to cycle through
the<00:03:23.660> functions<00:03:24.319> on<00:03:24.470> this<00:03:24.650> light<00:03:25.069> because<00:03:25.340> you

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
the functions on this light because you

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.390 
the functions on this light because you
don't<00:03:25.730> push<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:26.000> down<00:03:26.120> part<00:03:26.569> of<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:26.690> way<00:03:26.810> and

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
don't push it down part of the way and

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.330 
don't push it down part of the way and
you<00:03:28.400> have<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.609> cycle<00:03:28.790> them<00:03:29.150> very<00:03:29.510> quickly<00:03:29.720> and

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
you have to cycle them very quickly and

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.039 
you have to cycle them very quickly and
sometimes<00:03:31.340> because<00:03:31.670> of<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.850> tail<00:03:32.030> clicky<00:03:32.389> it

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
sometimes because of the tail clicky it

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.240 
sometimes because of the tail clicky it
doesn't<00:03:33.440> understand<00:03:33.829> that<00:03:34.010> you're<00:03:34.100> still

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
doesn't understand that you're still

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.740 
doesn't understand that you're still
cycling<00:03:34.730> through<00:03:34.910> so<00:03:35.299> a<00:03:35.329> lot<00:03:35.450> of<00:03:35.510> times<00:03:35.630> you

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
cycling through so a lot of times you

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.970 
cycling through so a lot of times you
get<00:03:35.840> stuck<00:03:36.079> like<00:03:36.109> you<00:03:36.380> saw<00:03:36.560> me<00:03:36.590> there<00:03:36.829> and<00:03:36.920> a

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
get stuck like you saw me there and a

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.599 
get stuck like you saw me there and a
loop<00:03:37.160> between<00:03:37.519> low<00:03:38.329> and<00:03:38.359> high<00:03:38.600> or<00:03:38.780> simply<00:03:39.350> high

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
loop between low and high or simply high

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.979 
loop between low and high or simply high
so<00:03:40.609> I'm<00:03:40.730> not<00:03:40.850> sure<00:03:40.910> if<00:03:41.239> this<00:03:41.359> is<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.540> problem

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
so I'm not sure if this is a problem

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.309 
so I'm not sure if this is a problem
with<00:03:42.200> this<00:03:42.739> particular<00:03:43.370> flashlight<00:03:44.120> or<00:03:45.079> if

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
with this particular flashlight or if

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.930 
with this particular flashlight or if
it's<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.590> problem<00:03:45.920> with<00:03:46.069> this<00:03:46.190> tail<00:03:46.519> switch<00:03:46.790> in

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
it's a problem with this tail switch in

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.360 
it's a problem with this tail switch in
general<00:03:47.329> but<00:03:48.049> overall<00:03:48.410> I<00:03:48.560> don't<00:03:48.920> like<00:03:49.130> the

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
general but overall I don't like the

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.990 
general but overall I don't like the

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
design of this tail switch it feels kind

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.430 
design of this tail switch it feels kind

of cheap ish to me and I don't think

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.949 
of cheap ish to me and I don't think
it's<00:03:54.560> going<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:54.709> be<00:03:54.859> reliable<00:03:55.430> you<00:03:56.269> know<00:03:56.690> if

however I've had have some problems with

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.390 
sure fires multiple mode switches but
these<00:04:20.239> old<00:04:20.479> single<00:04:20.900> mode<00:04:21.049> switches<00:04:21.500> are<00:04:21.859> seem

these old single mode switches are seem

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.560 
these old single mode switches are seem
to<00:04:22.460> be<00:04:22.520> pretty<00:04:22.729> bulletproof<00:04:22.970> so<00:04:24.490> overall<00:04:25.490> I'm

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
to be pretty bulletproof so overall I'm

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.390 
to be pretty bulletproof so overall I'm
not<00:04:26.750> very<00:04:27.260> satisfied<00:04:27.710> with<00:04:27.740> this<00:04:27.890> light<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:28.310> I

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
not very satisfied with this light and I

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.800 
not very satisfied with this light and I
would<00:04:28.550> have<00:04:28.700> a<00:04:28.730> hard<00:04:28.910> time<00:04:29.090> recommending<00:04:29.690> it

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
would have a hard time recommending it

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.420 
would have a hard time recommending it
simply<00:04:30.320> because<00:04:30.530> I<00:04:30.620> don't<00:04:30.800> trust<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.190> switch

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
simply because I don't trust the switch

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.030 
simply because I don't trust the switch
on<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:31.840> and<00:04:32.840> I<00:04:32.930> actually<00:04:33.170> will<00:04:33.500> be<00:04:33.560> returning

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
on it and I actually will be returning

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.920 
on it and I actually will be returning
this<00:04:34.160> light<00:04:34.430> because<00:04:34.700> I<00:04:34.790> feel<00:04:35.000> it's<00:04:35.150> defective

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
this light because I feel it's defective

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.420 
this light because I feel it's defective
so<00:04:36.940> if<00:04:37.940> anyone<00:04:38.300> is<00:04:38.330> curious<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:39.220> would<00:04:40.220> like

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430

so if anyone is curious and would like
me<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.910> exchange<00:04:41.690> this<00:04:42.020> light<00:04:42.260> instead<00:04:42.530> of

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
whether it's just this light or this

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.940 
whether it's just this light or this
whole<00:04:47.450> series<00:04:47.750> that<00:04:48.080> has<00:04:48.230> problems<00:04:48.620> with<00:04:48.770> the

whole series that has problems with the

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.920 
whole series that has problems with the
switch<00:04:49.190> I'd<00:04:50.060> be<00:04:50.240> more<00:04:50.420> than<00:04:50.450> willing<00:04:50.630> to<00:04:50.780> do

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
switch I'd be more than willing to do

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.680

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
exchange this instead of return it so I

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.070

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
it's just this individual model I'd

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.100 
it's just this individual model I'd
certainly<00:05:02.090> glad<00:05:02.420> to<00:05:02.540> do<00:05:02.660> that<00:05:02.690> but<00:05:02.960> I'm<00:05:03.050> only

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
gonna do that if someone's interested

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.880

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
because overall I don't feel like this

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.120 
because overall I don't feel like this
is<00:05:07.130> a<00:05:07.550> light<00:05:08.180> that<00:05:08.360> I<00:05:08.420> would<00:05:08.750> enjoy<00:05:09.410> carrying

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
it's kind of edgy you can see that those

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.210 
it's kind of edgy you can see that those
are<00:05:13.970> real<00:05:14.120> square<00:05:14.480> and<00:05:14.810> the<00:05:15.740> pocket<00:05:16.100> clip

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
corners and stuff on it so it's not real

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.580 
corners and stuff on it so it's not real
it's<00:05:20.090> okay<00:05:20.450> in<00:05:20.570> hand<00:05:20.810> but<00:05:20.960> it's<00:05:21.050> not<00:05:21.170> extremely

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
it's okay in hand but it's not extremely

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.290 
it's okay in hand but it's not extremely
comfortable<00:05:21.920> and<00:05:22.190> it's<00:05:22.970> certainly<00:05:23.210> not

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
comfortable and it's certainly not

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.950 
comfortable and it's certainly not
comfortable<00:05:23.870> on<00:05:23.960> pocket<00:05:25.240> so<00:05:26.240> overall

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
comfortable on pocket so overall

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.570
