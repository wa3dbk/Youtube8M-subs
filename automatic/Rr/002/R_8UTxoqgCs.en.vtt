00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.870
 The goods were more than welcome and the demand from Asia and it was stronger 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.730
 middle east he is already a spanish for children and i can't explain 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.110
 about our security is strong 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.919
 and what you can do with it 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.349
 these stitches can already be used against the front of the choir 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.279
 is very easy to apply, as you will see 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.090
 with us put the liberation for the back of the window with a 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:30.029
 transparent of oil 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.310
 and we have that stitch for the back of the job transparent with 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.480
 the white foil on the back 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.700
 First of all to have shown hundreds of stitches in front of it 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.890
 chorus its shares actually that is very simple 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.500
 those wooden stitches as you see 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.530
 any of the operation broke into the car 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.280
 and now this week packs nicely 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.960
 and now maybe a little less neat 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.960
 why on the front one of the requirements 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.250
 that's how the seat is at the front 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.100
 but maybe i'm saying tap the front i'll definitely on the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.390
 back so that no one has to cross the kickoff under pressure 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.780
 then we tackle transparent stitches 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.710
 this one stands out a bit less 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.060
 because there is no wind at the back 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.570
 but jv stuck that people want to put the delivery in front 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.600
 we will certainly be sitting there at the back of the glass 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.940
 but now says I want a transparent stitches against the back of 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.700
 brahms to me just as clearly as it can certainly be at the front spokesperson 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.720
 Which 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.720
 both cross over with a white background 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.790
 one of them hit at the back 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.060
 pick it up so you can see the difference 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.940
 but they also grab 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.970
 so was the sickness absence is the first very easy to apply 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.140
 and herewith possessions of all three 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.610
 with the result 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.540
 Thank you and goodbye
