so<00:00:01.949> in<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.220> last<00:00:02.399> video<00:00:02.580> I<00:00:02.760> told<00:00:02.970> you<00:00:03.149> all<00:00:03.330> you

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
so in the last video I told you all you

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.829 
so in the last video I told you all you
can<00:00:03.600> convert<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:05.190> hexadecimal<00:00:06.029> number<00:00:06.420> to

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
can convert a hexadecimal number to

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.799 
can convert a hexadecimal number to
binary<00:00:07.170> number<00:00:07.440> system<00:00:07.519> now<00:00:08.519> we<00:00:08.580> now<00:00:09.570> we<00:00:09.599> are

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
binary number system now we now we are

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.570 
binary number system now we now we are
going<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.170> do<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.440> opposite<00:00:10.740> from<00:00:11.010> binding<00:00:11.460> on

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
going to do the opposite from binding on

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.049 
going to do the opposite from binding on
the<00:00:11.700> system<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.330> EXA<00:00:12.719> decimal<00:00:13.679> number<00:00:13.889> system

0 0 1 as 1 and it continues up to 9 and
then<00:00:31.289> after<00:00:31.650> 9<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.009> becomes<00:00:32.340> alphabet<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.600> goes

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
then after 9 it becomes alphabet it goes

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.920 
then after 9 it becomes alphabet it goes
alphabetical<00:00:34.590> up<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.890> F<00:00:35.120> now<00:00:36.120> up<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.630> 9<00:00:36.809> it

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
this is it in the table that is 1 1 0 1

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.050 
this is it in the table that is 1 1 0 1
1<00:01:45.920> 1<00:01:46.920> 0<00:01:47.430> 1<00:01:48.530> alright<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:49.920> written<00:01:50.250> here<00:01:50.610> it

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
1 1 0 1 alright it's not written here it

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.710 
1 1 0 1 alright it's not written here it
means<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.140> middle<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.070> one<00:01:53.720> if

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
means it's in the middle of this one if

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.080 
means it's in the middle of this one if
you<00:01:54.960> go<00:01:55.770> by<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.219> 1<00:01:57.200> 1<00:01:58.200> 1<00:01:58.469> 0<00:01:58.799> 1<00:01:58.829> will<00:01:59.159> come<00:01:59.369> at<00:01:59.549> T

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
you go by this 1 1 1 0 1 will come at T

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.690 
you go by this 1 1 1 0 1 will come at T
so<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:00.930> will<00:02:01.110> write<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.320> number<00:02:01.890> as<00:02:04.250> d

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
so we will write this number as d

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.029 
so we will write this number as d
and<00:02:06.820> this<00:02:06.970> zero<00:02:07.330> zero<00:02:07.630> one<00:02:07.960> zero<00:02:08.410> okay<00:02:08.800> now<00:02:08.979> we
