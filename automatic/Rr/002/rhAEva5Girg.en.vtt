the<00:02:17.230> injury<00:02:17.800> how<00:02:18.520> what's<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.120> answer

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.300 

what<00:02:22.510> proof<00:02:22.720> do<00:02:22.930> we<00:02:22.990> need<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.500> education<00:02:24.190> and

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
what proof do we need is education and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.100 
what proof do we need is education and
development<00:02:24.700> solve<00:02:25.030> evil<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.570> West<00:02:25.780> and

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
then what is that nothing we have all

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.990 
then what is that nothing we have all
the<00:02:28.900> evidence<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.500> world<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:30.220> education

the evidence in the world that education

00:02:31.000 --> 00:03:08.230 
the evidence in the world that education
