00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.309
 hello welcome my cakes 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.619
 Today I want to give you a recipe 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.610
 it is a kind of game 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.130
 salmon roll 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.470
 You can do this dish quite well 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.529
 serve appetizer or just like that 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.820
 a cold plate here everything buffet 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.770
 and you only need very few 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.450
 ingredients for this role is very fast 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.940
 made and is also very good 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.190
 Prepare what you need for ingredients 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.510
 I'll show you that for the dough now 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.010
 you need four eggs 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.970
 I 've already separated you 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.100
 protein and yolk you need 225 grams 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.660
 spinach since I can freeze it 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.550
 but also take fresh spinach 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.050
 you need pepper nutmeg and salt 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.350
 and you need something for the filling 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.050
 Smoked salmon and 200 grams speak it like this 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.800
 Now you give the protein in one now 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.329
 bowl 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.030
 Now comes a good pinch of salt 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:11.950
 look after that will be nice 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:14.420
 stiffly beaten briefly to the side 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.640
 as already mentioned you can too 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.680
 fresh spinach use should 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.200
 then blanch her briefly before 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.240
 hot water but I like to use 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.280
 frozen spinach because the vitamins 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.590
 just received are there namely 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.940
 frozen right after the harvest and 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.000
 actually you know with fresh spinach 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.090
 never really long ago 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.380
 stood in the store or just fresh 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.210
 was delivered 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.010
 so I like to take that 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.049
 frozen but if you like the other 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.810
 take word is okay too , of course 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.220
 you have to and leaf spinach and the 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.320
 take care of the yolks 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.210
 they are now being mixed together 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.380
 and I just do it with us 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.229
 faster and easier 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.310
 thermomix asks now comes the easy 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.850
 leaf spinach pure 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.780
 the yellow egg then comes when 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.820
 be a little fat and a little nutmeg the 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.869
 Of course it does not have to be, but I think 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.869
 that fits 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.480
 because for two weeks a bit no 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:19.400
 Paparazzo's goal is mine too 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.940
 machine and leave it about 20 to 30 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.040
 Stir in seconds at level six and 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.630
 that's what it looks like if you are 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.519
 No appointments and the recipe 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.410
 you want to try it anyway 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.269
 of course, make sure you take 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.190
 just the wand blender and purÃ©es the 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.690
 spinat well and then you can do that 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.700
 either with wandmixer with the eggs 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.739
 traverse or simply with one 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.110
 hand mixer so just do it 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.239
 you do not need it as you want it 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:49.850
 I take a thermomix for that 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:53.000
 my doctor this yolk spinach master 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:58.400
 clean and then it will be once carefully 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.620
 I simply raised my 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.630
 angular baking mold you can then completely 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.220
 use normal baking sheet but you 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.599
 I know I like to take this one 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.160
 lohmar abba kramen 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.680
 that's like a biscuit role 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.680
 then I can later nice it rausholen 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.070
 is all very square on the corners and 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.350
 Well 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.329
 when did i forget to mention that 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.250
 he still needs some parmesan 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.690
 Do not do it but you can find me 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.970
 I think that fits in quite well now 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.540
 because I just hound here 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.540
 bit ripe 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:41.459
 just that spinach day on it nice 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:44.030
 evenly and then carefully 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.030
 exude 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.090
 is it then at 200 degrees about ten to 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.680
 twelve minutes in the oven 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:59.660
 after twelve minutes sitting with me then 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:02.320
 I'll get to the facts 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.320
 have to 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.530
 you make a baking paper 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.880
 is on top and then could namely 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.440
 to crash the whole thing once 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.970
 and if it should live, it is easy 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.660
 would like to continue a oven 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.660
 not quite before 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.140
 cool it down now 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.030
 the spinach plate I am now 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.420
 cooled and now I will the 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.420
 cream cheese still sit a bit but you 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:50.070
 theoretically you can also violate your herb 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:54.390
 just use a bit now 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:05:00.840
 club and then could also herbs 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:03.750
 take a bit of basil and salt 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.770
 you need about the cream already 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.860
 So little bit of cream cheese said 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.760
 and then it comes here on the plate 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.840
 and I understand that just now 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.840
 with my palette 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.860
 as already mentioned, you can too 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.960
 Use herbal offenses 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.250
 I did not have you now I have 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.470
 therefore not used 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.020
 I now found the variant with normal 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.460
 cream cheese and some pepper approve 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.340
 Of course I would not because 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.780
 simply the saxo intense in taste 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.670
 is that you just do not have any 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.290
 It takes a lot more to taste more 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.490
 dominant reason is but actually 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.310
 If only the cream cheese 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.340
 on it, however, strokes without pepper 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.860
 Just decide it for you 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.660
 Tasty you would like to have that 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.930
 then just comes the German max 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.930
 chandler 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.949
 once caught up firmly 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:14.550
 there you can calm down the baking paper 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:14.550
 to take help and promise 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.620
 and then really that's again what so 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.229
 and then it can be for half 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.900
 hour in the fridge 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:36.069
 after half an hour I take it 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:40.419
 Roll off the fridge and put 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:42.009
 with the cut edge down so and 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:45.250
 then I just cut myself here 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:50.979
 piece off I would say so 1.5 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:52.330
 to two inches thick and if you are 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:54.400
 in between the knife clean again 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.539
 then you do not have any freshness 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.539
 Traces training 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:07.020
 and then that he can on her 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.020
 to serve dishes 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:20.580
 then the rolls are already finished 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.310
 As I already said, I could do the job 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:25.140
 Well prepare the day before in 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.430
 store the refrigerator and just briefly water 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.470
 would then cut open 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.210
 that is actually a very good one 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.560
 recipe whatever you go somewhere 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.570
 can take you because you actually the 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.420
 roll on the piece can take and then 

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.440
 right on the spot just now cuts 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.450
 I wish you much fun 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.160
 Hope that you have the recipe 

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.540
 liked and then we'll see each other 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.070
 next time with another one 

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:47.270
 recipe 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.270
 see you, bye
