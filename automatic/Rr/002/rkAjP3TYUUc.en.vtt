00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.139
 I'm connected with the Ichioka station though 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.989
 New York 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:18.900
 And although it is Japan, I first clarified the difference 

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:22.109
 I think it would be better First of all, New York is 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.109
 E-mail classic with well-concerned 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.779
 Or a little mannish eyes 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.310
 To the whole world 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.950
 A little ninth time 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.770
 Are women Japanese 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.910
 After that, it looks like this young 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.890
 This is 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.540
 sorry but 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.150
 Though it is a question 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.570
 Japanese like 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.680
 If you look at this meeting 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.800
 Even with Madonna style, it's pretty cute with 39 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.800
 If you look at the image after all from the perspective of foreigners 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.550
 I found it in the middle of the world 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.380
 each 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.550
 20 years old 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.880
 So that Japan 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.190
 Even if you try to go to action suddenly ignoring 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.740
 It is hard to come by 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.200
 Still it is my own existence 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.880
 How to introduce foreign ones 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.880
 I think that is the point 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.200
 Conservatory in front of New York Fukuzonoyama 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.720
 Life with ms 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.730
 Feminine with hand-rolled items 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.440
 It is these Japan's reiko though 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.690
 The difference with the style is 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.360
 Every single change 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.870
 It looks like it's doing quite well 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.290
 Those 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.180
 There is not really a miracle 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.580
 But there is a feeling of borrowing such advertising power 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.120
 I'm just posting 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.760
 Abuse such as money comes out 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.920
 Relatively strongly concerned even just a little while ago 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.750
 Rice this 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.240
 In the case of a Japanese person 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.049
 It's so easy to hold 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.159
 How much burden on the active exchange of ideas is estimated 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.159
 After all the anniversary 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.759
 It conveys the image like Paris 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:21.840
 Also as this feature 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.220
 It's an eco-volume feeling What kind of name is attached to architecture 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.909
 Are 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.749
 No correction 6 Dutch 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:31.609
 Become a silhouette that goes around there and take a picture balance 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:31.889
 Was 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.129
 Very cute 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.629
 It can be said that it is quite mature 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.790
 Overall it seems like an adult 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.319
 But among that that old Tosa is so easy though 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.319
 It is an additional idea 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:50.629
 Different now 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.729
 Prefecture 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:54.519
 It is characteristic that there is
