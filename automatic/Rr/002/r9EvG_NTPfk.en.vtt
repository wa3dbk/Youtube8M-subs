00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:15.369 
relaxed so I'm just going to go ahead

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.279 
relaxed so I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:00:15.609> show<00:00:15.730> you<00:00:15.820> the<00:00:15.910> difference<00:00:16.269> so<00:00:16.480> first<00:00:17.109> of

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 
and show you the difference so first of

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.230 
and show you the difference so first of
all<00:00:17.380> I<00:00:17.439> need<00:00:17.590> to<00:00:17.769> show<00:00:17.980> everyone<00:00:18.279> how<00:00:18.490> you<00:00:18.519> pull

all I need to show everyone how you pull
normally<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.830> this<00:00:20.950> is<00:00:21.100> on<00:00:21.220> these<00:00:21.369> regular

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
normally so this is on these regular

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.370 
normally so this is on these regular
deadlifts<00:00:22.180> stunts<00:00:22.570> and<00:00:22.900> you'll<00:00:22.990> see<00:00:23.140> that<00:00:23.289> his

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
deadlifts stunts and you'll see that his

deadlifts stunts and you'll see that his
lower<00:00:23.590> back<00:00:23.830> is<00:00:24.039> arched<00:00:24.520> ways<00:00:25.390> upper<00:00:25.750> back<00:00:25.930> and

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
shoulders remain relaxed and this

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.720 
shoulders remain relaxed and this
shortens<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:29.500> range<00:00:29.680> of<00:00:29.830> motion<00:00:30.160> so<00:00:30.340> go<00:00:30.609> ahead

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
shortens the range of motion so go ahead

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.360 
shortens the range of motion so go ahead
and<00:00:30.850> pull<00:00:31.060> a<00:00:31.090> bit<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.859> you'll<00:00:32.980> see<00:00:33.129> that<00:00:33.280> at

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
and pull a bit and you'll see that at

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.760 
and pull a bit and you'll see that at
the<00:00:33.489> top<00:00:33.730> his<00:00:34.449> shoulders<00:00:34.899> are<00:00:34.930> then<00:00:35.170> pulled

retracted<00:00:43.510> almost<00:00:44.499> trying<00:00:44.710> to<00:00:44.800> achieve<00:00:45.069> the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
retracted almost trying to achieve the

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.680 
retracted almost trying to achieve the
same<00:00:45.399> position<00:00:45.940> you<00:00:46.030> get<00:00:46.210> on<00:00:46.300> the<00:00:46.389> bench<00:00:46.569> press

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
same position you get on the bench press

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.979 
same position you get on the bench press
for<00:00:47.489> whereas<00:00:48.489> on<00:00:48.579> the<00:00:48.670> bench<00:00:48.850> press<00:00:48.969> it'll<00:00:49.479> cut

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
for whereas on the bench press it'll cut

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.029 
for whereas on the bench press it'll cut
your<00:00:50.109> range<00:00:50.260> of<00:00:50.350> motion<00:00:50.620> on<00:00:50.649> a<00:00:50.739> deadlift

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
your range of motion on a deadlift

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.379 
your range of motion on a deadlift
that'll<00:00:51.249> lengthen<00:00:51.399> it<00:00:51.639> so<00:00:51.670> go<00:00:51.940> ahead<00:00:52.030> and<00:00:52.149> do

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:52.389 
that'll lengthen it so go ahead and do

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:54.869 
that'll lengthen it so go ahead and do
ensure<00:00:52.659> the<00:00:52.839> position<00:00:53.260> just<00:00:53.760> retract<00:00:54.760> your

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
ensure the position just retract your

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.430 
ensure the position just retract your
shoulder<00:00:54.969> blades<00:00:55.449> yeah<00:00:55.690> you<00:00:55.749> see<00:00:56.019> under<00:00:56.260> can't

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
shoulder blades yeah you see under can't

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.340 
shoulder blades yeah you see under can't
even<00:00:56.620> really<00:00:56.739> get<00:00:56.949> down<00:00:57.069> to<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.280> Valor<00:00:58.229> yeah

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
even really get down to the Valor yeah

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.459 
even really get down to the Valor yeah
and<00:00:59.589> then<00:00:59.739> pull<00:00:59.979> from<00:01:00.159> there<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:02.109> thing<00:01:02.350> is

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
and then pull from there the thing is

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.439 
and then pull from there the thing is
it's<00:01:03.399> not<00:01:03.639> going<00:01:03.789> to<00:01:03.850> happen<00:01:03.969> with<00:01:04.239> heavier

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
it's not going to happen with heavier

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.399 
it's not going to happen with heavier
weight<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:07.360> what<00:01:07.750> do<00:01:07.810> you<00:01:07.869> reckon<00:01:08.080> under<00:01:08.290> when

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
weight you what do you reckon under when

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.540 
weight you what do you reckon under when
you<00:01:08.500> get<00:01:08.620> to<00:01:08.710> seven<00:01:08.980> eight<00:01:09.100> hundred<00:01:09.160> pounds

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
you get to seven eight hundred pounds

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.590 
you get to seven eight hundred pounds
you<00:01:09.610> won't<00:01:09.790> be<00:01:09.850> able<00:01:09.970> to<00:01:10.030> hold<00:01:10.210> that<00:01:10.420> position

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
you won't be able to hold that position

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.790 
you won't be able to hold that position
would<00:01:10.960> you<00:01:11.760> know<00:01:12.760> so<00:01:13.630> so<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.170> bottom<00:01:14.410> line<00:01:14.590> is

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
would you know so so the bottom line is
