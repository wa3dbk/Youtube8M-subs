 by the way in the NATO monkeys stump not this charger onboard 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.000
 48 volts 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.640
 and is that ours 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.640

 that does not make noise 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.770
 7 efe 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.010
 in a standard transmission mexico changes 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.010
