00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.610
 hello everybody today I made one 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.070
 Braid 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.170
 a little alternative because with games 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.630
 which dropped from the track ho 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.240
 made of small braids that it is 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.720
 integrated into the main track 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.439
 creating this effect to be able to 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.960
 to achieve 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:37.719
 I used rubber bands like this 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:40.480
 and debitucci d'oca like these if you 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.640
 like to leave tutorials in the next 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.410
 Hello 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.410
 we take from section of hair 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:01:00.460
 divide beyond what we begin ad 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:01:03.130
 weave them at this point this plays 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:08.020
 let's drop it was replace with 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:11.220
 another and above we add one 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.220
 small lock of hair 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.040
 at this point momentarily 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:48.840
 we block the track with the spouts 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:50.520
 goose in this name and those locks 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.020
 that we have dropped 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.020
 we create braids 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:40.049
 at this point we block them with 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:42.540
 the elastic so for all the plays at 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:49.650
 this point we take again the trace that 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:55.250
 temporarily we had blocked and 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.250
 we begin to add braids 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:32.120
 block the braid with an elastic band e 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.120
 this because on the final stretch
