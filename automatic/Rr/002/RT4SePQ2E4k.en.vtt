00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.749 

line<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.630> whole<00:01:44.869> there<00:01:45.829> we<00:01:45.920> go<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.310> then

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
line the whole there we go and then

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.999 
line the whole there we go and then
twist<00:01:47.149> these<00:01:47.299> are<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.539> legs<00:01:47.719> so<00:01:48.679> do<00:01:48.770> they<00:01:48.890> go

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
twist these are the legs so do they go

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.330 
twist these are the legs so do they go
around<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.399> belt<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.840> now<00:01:50.960> he's<00:01:50.990> in<00:01:51.439> cougar

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
around the belt and now he's in cougar

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.959 
around the belt and now he's in cougar
mode

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
mode

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.490 
mode
I<00:01:53.000> guess<00:01:54.789> so<00:01:55.789> in<00:01:56.090> order<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.390> transform<00:01:57.259> him

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
I guess so in order to transform him

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.200 
I guess so in order to transform him
we're<00:01:57.770> going<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.220> turn<00:01:58.490> these<00:01:58.670> little<00:01:58.789> arms

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
we're going to turn these little arms

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.639 
we're going to turn these little arms
down<00:01:59.600> and<00:02:00.579> then<00:02:01.719> rotate<00:02:02.719> these<00:02:02.960> around<00:02:03.020> and

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
down and then rotate these around and

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.120 
down and then rotate these around and
they'll<00:02:04.579> cover<00:02:04.850> up<00:02:05.030> his<00:02:05.179> hands<00:02:05.770> like<00:02:06.770> this

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
they'll cover up his hands like this

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.969 
they'll cover up his hands like this
then<00:02:08.090> we're<00:02:08.360> going<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.720> pop<00:02:09.410> this<00:02:09.709> off

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
then we're going to pop this off

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.039 
then we're going to pop this off
completely<00:02:13.269> pull<00:02:14.269> his<00:02:14.450> head<00:02:14.690> all<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.019> way

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
completely pull his head all the way

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:15.699 
completely pull his head all the way
back

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
back

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.009 
back
tell<00:02:16.700> him<00:02:16.910> make<00:02:17.090> sure<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.299> tell<00:02:17.630> him<00:02:17.840> this

the<00:05:42.099> go<00:05:42.460> ramp<00:05:42.699> back<00:05:53.910> there<00:05:54.910> we<00:05:55.000> go<00:05:55.120> and<00:05:55.419> then

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
the go ramp back there we go and then

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.659 
the go ramp back there we go and then
twist<00:05:56.260> the<00:05:56.410> arms<00:05:56.740> so<00:05:57.729> he's<00:05:58.180> backing<00:05:58.449> Kouga<00:05:59.669> you

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
twist the arms so he's backing Kouga you

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:02.070 
twist the arms so he's backing Kouga you
know<00:06:00.760> or<00:06:00.910> if<00:06:00.970> you<00:06:01.090> want<00:06:01.240> I<00:06:01.330> guess<00:06:01.510> display<00:06:01.930> them

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
know or if you want I guess display them

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.770 
know or if you want I guess display them
like<00:06:02.229> this<00:06:02.500> maybe<00:06:03.280> next<00:06:03.520> to<00:06:03.849> like<00:06:04.150> a<00:06:04.270> big<00:06:04.539> yard

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
like this maybe next to like a big yard

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.159 
like this maybe next to like a big yard
Kouga<00:06:05.320> or<00:06:05.620> any<00:06:06.190> other<00:06:06.490> cooler<00:06:06.909> figure<00:06:07.270> I<00:06:07.510> don't

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
Kouga or any other cooler figure I don't

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.700 
Kouga or any other cooler figure I don't
really<00:06:08.320> know<00:06:08.470> of<00:06:08.500> other<00:06:08.740> Kruger<00:06:09.130> figures

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
really know of other Kruger figures

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.279 
really know of other Kruger figures
because<00:06:11.710> I<00:06:12.430> wasn't<00:06:12.849> into<00:06:13.690> this<00:06:13.810> back<00:06:14.020> around

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
because I wasn't into this back around

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:17.399 
because I wasn't into this back around
cougar<00:06:14.830> time<00:06:15.039> so<00:06:15.550> I<00:06:16.539> guess<00:06:17.080> that<00:06:17.289> would<00:06:17.380> be

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:17.409 
cougar time so I guess that would be

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:21.930 
cougar time so I guess that would be
cool<00:06:17.740> too<00:06:17.979> I<00:06:18.250> I<00:06:18.430> don't<00:06:18.880> know<00:06:19.330> but<00:06:20.289> um<00:06:20.940> you

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
cool too I I don't know but um you

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.480 
cool too I I don't know but um you

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.040 
know they're there I mean they're pretty
good<00:06:24.729> they're<00:06:24.789> fairly<00:06:25.210> cheap<00:06:25.599> I<00:06:25.810> don't<00:06:25.960> know

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
good they're fairly cheap I don't know

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.170 
good they're fairly cheap I don't know
if<00:06:26.139> they're<00:06:26.349> still<00:06:26.560> that<00:06:26.770> cheap<00:06:27.099> now<00:06:27.520> that

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
if they're still that cheap now that

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.230 
if they're still that cheap now that
decades<00:06:28.780> a<00:06:28.990> little<00:06:29.199> bit<00:06:29.289> over<00:06:29.680> but<00:06:30.550> and<00:06:31.120> they

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
decades a little bit over but and they

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.899 
decades a little bit over but and they
have<00:06:31.419> I<00:06:31.449> mean<00:06:31.720> all<00:06:32.470> sander<00:06:33.159> articulations

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:33.909 
have I mean all sander articulations

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:36.270 
have I mean all sander articulations
those<00:06:34.060> arms<00:06:34.479> can<00:06:34.720> move<00:06:34.979> you<00:06:35.979> know<00:06:36.099> and<00:06:36.190> his

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
those arms can move you know and his

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.029 
those arms can move you know and his
legs<00:06:36.690> have<00:06:37.690> poseability<00:06:38.289> so<00:06:38.710> I<00:06:38.740> mean

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 
legs have poseability so I mean

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:40.589 
legs have poseability so I mean
especially<00:06:39.520> because<00:06:39.639> it<00:06:39.849> has<00:06:39.970> to<00:06:40.090> transform

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:40.599 
especially because it has to transform

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:42.930 
especially because it has to transform

good plus if you collect the cards it's
I<00:07:06.620> mean<00:07:07.430> I<00:07:07.580> think<00:07:07.639> I've<00:07:08.180> gone<00:07:08.780> through<00:07:09.020> all<00:07:09.139> the

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:09.229 
I mean I think I've gone through all the

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:10.719 
I mean I think I've gone through all the
gone<00:07:09.380> bright<00:07:09.650> sides<00:07:09.919> likely<00:07:10.190> to<00:07:10.280> remember<00:07:10.490> but

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:10.729 
gone bright sides likely to remember but

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:12.070 
gone bright sides likely to remember but
I<00:07:10.789> think<00:07:11.180> it's<00:07:11.330> might<00:07:11.570> be<00:07:11.600> the<00:07:11.780> only<00:07:11.870> way<00:07:12.020> to

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 
I think it's might be the only way to

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.379 
I think it's might be the only way to
get<00:07:12.350> these<00:07:13.160> cards<00:07:14.650> so<00:07:15.910> you<00:07:16.910> know<00:07:17.060> that's

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:17.389 
get these cards so you know that's

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:22.930 
get these cards so you know that's
that's<00:07:17.750> also<00:07:18.020> something<00:07:19.810> but<00:07:21.729> thanks<00:07:22.729> to<00:07:22.850> the

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:22.940 
that's also something but thanks to the

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.790 
that's also something but thanks to the

these all go up one behind the other
or<00:07:34.490> just<00:07:34.880> interspersed<00:07:35.419> between<00:07:35.539> other
