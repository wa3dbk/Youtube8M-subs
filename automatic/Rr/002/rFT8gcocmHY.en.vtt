00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
were one on one in a million but case

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.050

you<00:01:49.740> know<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:49.979> were<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.280> really<00:01:50.610> really

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
you know we were like really really

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.170 
you know we were like really really
stunned<00:01:51.869> at<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.200> response<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.829> we<00:01:53.009> got<00:01:53.180> so

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
the be under a microscope yeah I mean

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.720 
the be under a microscope yeah I mean
it's<00:02:09.750> still<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.590> think<00:02:10.649> we're<00:02:11.009> all<00:02:11.129> we're<00:02:11.550> just

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
it's still I think we're all we're just

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.750 
it's still I think we're all we're just
taking<00:02:12.060> it

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
taking it

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.479 
taking it
taking<00:02:12.909> it<00:02:13.000> step<00:02:13.180> by<00:02:13.239> step<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:14.220> trying<00:02:15.220> not<00:02:15.310> to

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
taking it step by step and trying not to

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.160 
taking it step by step and trying not to
think<00:02:15.640> too<00:02:15.760> much<00:02:15.970> about<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.360> stuff<00:02:16.420> i<00:02:16.810> would

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
think too much about that stuff i would

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.140 
think too much about that stuff i would
think<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.409> we're<00:02:17.590> probably<00:02:17.829> we<00:02:18.819> still<00:02:19.030> have

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
think that we're probably we still have

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.600 
think that we're probably we still have
a<00:02:19.180> very<00:02:19.390> long<00:02:19.629> way<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.870> go<00:02:20.079> but<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.739> was<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.489> was

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
a very long way to go but it was it was

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.100 
a very long way to go but it was it was
a<00:02:21.640> lot<00:02:21.819> easier<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.329> book<00:02:22.569> shows<00:02:22.599> this<00:02:23.049> year
