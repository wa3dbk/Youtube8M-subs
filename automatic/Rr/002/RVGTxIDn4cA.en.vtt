00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.019
 what's up everybody speaks to them next 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.700
 book guys first of all very many 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.009
 thank you for joining me in these minutes 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.500
 This video will last and this time 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.270
 I bring you the best class for repair 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.210
 that as you know guys this is a weapon 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.470
 new and is exclusive at the moment for the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.750
 that we buy the season pass or 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.599
 originally however this weapon 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.119
 will be available in the next dlc as 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.640
 part of that content download and one 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.160
 guys to be true this is a very weapon 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.329
 very very good personally and the best 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.610
 everything is that as you see in the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.649
 description of this weapon says that it is a 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.870
 weapon that has a hybrid life 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.239
 integrated that can be used as your rifle 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.100
 and as an assault rifle so nothing else 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.649
 when you lift your life with the joystick 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.809
 right of our control becomes 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.360
 in an assault rifle and when lowering this 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.649
 Mira becomes a submachine gun like 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.270
 always remember that silvio you liked or 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.070
 it was helpful do not forget to click on 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.780
 I like the button and share the video 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.609
 with your friends since that would help me 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.309
 very much to keep bringing videos 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.840
 incredible call of duty so the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.190
 guys already going directly to the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.710
 class as you can see 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.020
 I carry it with large chargers and with 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.390
 mouth brake this weapon is very very very 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.850
 precise guys because let's say you have 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.500
 a very minimal recoil so it's not 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.630
 necessary that we put the handle 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.020
 vertical since I tell you that this weapon 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.060
 it brings a very minimal recoil so what 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.730
 what it does need is bullets because 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.830
 let's say he shoots them very fast has 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.330
 much cadence like his rifle so without 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.940
 doubt in large chargers will make you 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.650
 missing and the muzzle brake is more than anything 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.750
 when you want to use it as an order of 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.420
 assault since this gives you a reach 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.670
 greater and have more damage your bullets to 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.130
 long distance but also what 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.390
 You can use it like a rifle and you have a 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.220
 great truth I almost always 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.230
 the use as a submachine gun and it goes great 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.460
 even at long distance and good as 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.860
 can see guys in high school not 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.440
 we have nothing is lethal so I like it 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.020
 the centex or the c4 but unfortunately 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.640
 in this call of duty ghosts the c4 does not 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.890
 is also with the white posts 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.440
 I prefer to put some centex and 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.179
 guys as advantages we have here 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.040
 basically we have all the advantages 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.810
 the first one is speed that is 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.150
 basically the prestidigitation for 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.510
 recharge faster since that helps you 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.069
 especially in a submachine gun like the repair 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.810
 stealth also because this we're not what 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.239
 you can stop using just because 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.890
 If you hear the steps, they will know 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.810
 where are you and in this call of the go is 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.120
 they listen to more can not the steps like this 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.340
 that without a doubt in stealth we put on 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.370
 deadly silence in resistance we have 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.140
 two advantages and here it changes a bit this 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.000
 because as always we have tremor 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.260
 basically for the body fighting to 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.359
 body so we can say no to you 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.459
 raise your sights and this will make you 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.049
 you can win practically all the 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.000
 hand-to-hand combat and 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.920
 additionally we have the shield 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.290
 protector that this is basically because 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.329
 There is a quantity and amount of quantity 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.730
 of improvised explosives left by the 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:00.329
 people very close to their goals and others 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.939
 so you're practically super immune 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.980
 to those those things from the explosives and 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.200
 others with the protective shield goes great 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.879
 the truth and I always use it since 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.489
 little because it has saved me so many 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.829
 times life so in team by 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.780
 last we have fully charged and this 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.639
 basically to have bullets if you 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.470
 do you want to get some streak or just 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.510
 you do not know how to get out of some gusts of 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.129
 jump or even a burn 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.829
 So, the streak that I bring you 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.959
 of assault as you can see in the first 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.159
 is the little dog in the second is the gene for 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.110
 combat that is a helicopter that 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.519
 let's say it's not very effective to say 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.220
 but you can get one that 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.870
 work and finally my favorite streak 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.390
 the truth because you can make a 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.549
 massacre with this serious on if you know 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.049
 use because we're going very well and not 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.459
 it's so simple to destroy and what it does 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.010
 is that it is very lethal so no doubt 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.049
 drive on as third advantage as 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.120
 third streak but still small channel 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.730
 sixth is basically the class is a weapon 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.159
 spectacular as I'm telling you, it's very, very 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.540
 well it's super mobile and I would say that 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.280
 it's even a little che is the truth 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.530
 but well that 's a matter of 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.150
 opinions and perceptions guys like that 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.340
 that what I can tell you is that it goes very 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.349
 well this weapon is certainly within 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.340
 my rifles not inside my rifles 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.720
 favorites 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.000
 Maybe it's my favorite after 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.409
 regret because I regret too 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.209
 it's going very well but let's go to this one 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.760
 they ask for anything to put in especially because 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.019
 you can make an assault rifle type 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.299
 of guys I hope you liked the 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.639
 video and if it was like that you will appreciate it very much 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.199
 if you can leave a like and add 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.599
 favorites so I say goodbye I'm 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.380
 Mark next and see you in the next 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:30.830
 video 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.830
 goodbye
