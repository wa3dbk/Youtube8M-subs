00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 many fighting games have existed for 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.569
 over the years but there is one that is 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.760
 my favorite best well said all 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.950
 games of his saga are my favorites 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.769
 I'm talking neither more nor less than super 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.719
 smash bros in the game you can control 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.359
 to characters from various franchises of 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.310
 nintendo like for example mario pikachu 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.380
 link and among others but after playing 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.150
 very many times the three games that have 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.580
 gone out until now I realized something 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.029
 and if the whole game is the imagination of 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.039
 child 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.289
 some will not understand what I mean 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.600
 with that of a child's imagination 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.940
 but good now I explain them good as 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.010
 I already said super smash bros maybe it's the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.379
 imagination of a child playing with his 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.930
 mario's toys link is teapot but 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.420
 why do I think this below them 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.910
 I will say the reasons number one reason in 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.250
 production of super smash bros 64 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.590
 we can see clearly how the hand bone 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.690
 master hand takes mario from his trunk and 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.489
 leaves on a table but Mario does not move 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.350
 then master hand also takes out 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.600
 pikachu and also leaves it on the table 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.609
 but this one also does not move then master 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.470
 hand looks for a box of handkerchiefs and other 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.300
 things and puts it around mario and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.270
 pikachu next closest 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.220
 a dream of 321 and then mario and pikachu 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.380
 they come alive and the handkerchiefs and the rest 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.300
 things become real objects 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.400
 then we could say that the 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.500
 Game characters are toys of a 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.720
 child and the stage would be the table with 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.670
 the other things then the child is 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.650
 imagining that their toys come alive 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.780
 and they fight among themselves and that the table is a 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.120
 scenario where this fight will be caused 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.570
 then master hand would be the hand of 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.700
 child reason number 2 new characters in 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.010
 super smash bros melee in super smash 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.650
 we can see more characters but for 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.720
 Well, surely the child is 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.940
 I was bored of always playing with 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.400
 the same toys then decided 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.290
 buy more toys reason number 3 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.150
 adventure mode and so on 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.160
 obviously the child was not going to play 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.380
 always on the table in your room 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.330
 then the adventure mode would be about 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.460
 that the child brings his toys to the house 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.500
 of your friends and friends should also 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.360
 ie have toys should also have 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.760
 scenarios created with your imagination 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.830
 then the adventure mode would be that the 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.929
 child takes his toys to the house of his 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.450
 friends and he brings his toys along with 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.430
 him and the multiplayer mode and the rest 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.950
 as I said the boy's friends also 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.900
 they must have toys and obviously they were going to 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.819
 imagine that their toys fight like 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.709
 for example the child has a toy 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.200
 mario and his friend have one of lÃºcar yo 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.360
 then the child and his friend imagine that 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.489
 his mario toy is fighting against 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.769
 your place toy and without master hand is 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.310
 the boy then because the super smash 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.769
 bros 64 did not appear craft and jan the boy 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.930
 that is, master hand, I only had 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.000
 a glove and that's why it was only more 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.580
 canine kraft and jan then who 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.799
 would be craft and jan one of the friends of 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.080
 boy maybe he also had a glove and 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.209
 that's why he decided to be like the companion of 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.090
 your friend or the master partner 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.040
 hand reason number 4 super characters 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.780
 smash bros melee that did not appear in 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.790
 brawn who has not happened has 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.549
 a toy and then you lose it and not what 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.680
 find the child must also have passed him 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.230
 who lost his doctor mario toys 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.269
 youtube picchu and the others then by 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.610
 that does not appear those toys in brawn 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.440
 because they were simply lost and the 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.450
 brawn's new characters were 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.549
 new toys that the child bought in 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.470
 this case the child bought toys from 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.500
 sonic snake and another one 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.450
 number 5 story mode and the others with 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.190
 his toys the child could imagine 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.320
 any story that came to him 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.600
 the head and the history of super smash 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.520
 bros brawl was that the boy created a 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.620
 story where your toys have to 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.990
 fight against a powerful enemy or 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.300
 taboo and what child's toy would be taboo 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.400
 maybe even bourg is the toy that 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.380
 the boy loved more and that's why he decided 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.270
 make him very powerful and the enemy of his 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.220
 story there with all that I have 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.850
 said surely you will draw your 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.850
 own theories
