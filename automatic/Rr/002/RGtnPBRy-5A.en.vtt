and<00:01:52.070> let<00:01:53.070> me<00:01:53.159> tell<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.759> started<00:01:54.240> like

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and let me tell you this I started like

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.380 
and let me tell you this I started like
four<00:01:55.049> years<00:01:55.229> ago<00:01:55.640> yeah<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.670> think<00:01:56.820> four<00:01:57.149> years

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
four years ago yeah I think four years

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.999 
four years ago yeah I think four years
ago<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:59.610> since<00:02:00.240> then<00:02:00.390> I've<00:02:00.780> never<00:02:01.110> felt<00:02:01.710> any

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
ago and since then I've never felt any

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.690 
ago and since then I've never felt any
kind<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.969> back<00:02:03.240> pain<00:02:03.570> whatsoever<00:02:04.520> till<00:02:05.520> this

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
kind of back pain whatsoever till this

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.230 
kind of back pain whatsoever till this
day

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
day

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.449 
day
so<00:02:07.250> that<00:02:08.250> was<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> good<00:02:08.610> thing<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.599> yeah<00:02:10.459> but

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
so that was a good thing and yeah but

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.470 
so that was a good thing and yeah but
for<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.849> guys<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.420> understand<00:02:13.200> more<00:02:13.530> now<00:02:14.480> I've

for you guys to understand more now I've

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.839 
for you guys to understand more now I've
put<00:02:15.840> in<00:02:15.930> some<00:02:16.200> some<00:02:16.890> x-rays<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.580> i'm<00:02:17.700> going

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
put in some some x-rays that i'm going

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.449 
put in some some x-rays that i'm going
to<00:02:17.910> show<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.090> right<00:02:18.360> now<00:02:18.739> and<00:02:19.739> i'm<00:02:20.099> just<00:02:20.250> going

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
to show you right now and i'm just going

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.610 
to show you right now and i'm just going
to<00:02:20.489> explain<00:02:20.880> some<00:02:21.420> some<00:02:21.989> of<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.230> thingies

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
to explain some some of the thingies

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.850 
to explain some some of the thingies
that<00:02:22.650> goes<00:02:23.160> on<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.640> x-ray<00:02:23.940> so<00:02:24.840> yeah<00:02:25.170> here

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
that goes on to the x-ray so yeah here

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.650 
that goes on to the x-ray so yeah here
goes<00:02:26.099> check<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:26.940> out<00:02:28.610> alright<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:29.910> here's<00:02:30.450> the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
goes check it out alright so here's the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.860 
goes check it out alright so here's the
x-rays<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.349> we<00:02:31.470> talked<00:02:31.709> about<00:02:32.660> now<00:02:33.660> as<00:02:33.780> you

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
x-rays that we talked about now as you

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.120 
x-rays that we talked about now as you
can<00:02:33.959> see<00:02:34.019> right<00:02:34.140> here<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:34.800> curve

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
can see right here this is the curve

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.059 
can see right here this is the curve
just<00:02:35.819> like<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.569> know<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.750> straight<00:02:37.319> back<00:02:37.830> bone

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
just like you know a straight back bone

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.090 
just like you know a straight back bone
and<00:02:38.340> then<00:02:38.489> there's<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.850> curve<00:02:39.180> right<00:02:39.510> here<00:02:39.569> and

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
and then there's a curve right here and

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.960 
and then there's a curve right here and
continue<00:02:41.100> straight<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.459> little<00:02:41.760> bit<00:02:41.880> and

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
continue straight a little bit and

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.210 
continue straight a little bit and
there's<00:02:42.150> another<00:02:42.390> curve<00:02:42.720> now<00:02:43.500> here's<00:02:44.040> another

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
there's another curve now here's another

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.990 
there's another curve now here's another
view<00:02:45.350> this<00:02:46.350> over<00:02:46.650> here<00:02:46.799> is<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.190> second<00:02:47.610> x-ray

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
view this over here is the second x-ray

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.500 
view this over here is the second x-ray
so<00:02:48.959> this<00:02:49.080> is<00:02:49.200> actually<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:50.489> lower<00:02:50.790> region<00:02:51.330> of

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
so this is actually the lower region of

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.020 
so this is actually the lower region of
the<00:02:51.569> backbone<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.530> here's<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.340> second<00:02:53.819> curve

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
the backbone and here's the second curve

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.580 
the backbone and here's the second curve
as<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.569> can<00:02:54.690> see<00:02:54.870> it's<00:02:55.019> an<00:02:55.170> opposite

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
as you can see it's an opposite

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.220 
as you can see it's an opposite
direction<00:02:57.500> let's<00:02:58.500> see<00:02:58.650> another<00:02:58.739> one<00:02:59.280> hold<00:02:59.910> on

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
direction let's see another one hold on

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.080 
direction let's see another one hold on
okay<00:03:01.230> here<00:03:01.560> we<00:03:01.590> go<00:03:01.709> now<00:03:02.459> this<00:03:02.580> is<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.760> upper

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
okay here we go now this is the upper

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.080 
okay here we go now this is the upper
region<00:03:03.390> again<00:03:04.250> but<00:03:05.250> this<00:03:05.370> was<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.610> front<00:03:06.000> view

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
region again but this was a front view

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.410 
region again but this was a front view
that's<00:03:06.750> why<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:06.989> you<00:03:07.769> know<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.069> side<00:03:08.819> changed

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
that's why the you know the side changed

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.870 
that's why the you know the side changed
the<00:03:10.230> other<00:03:10.320> one<00:03:10.530> was<00:03:10.709> a<00:03:10.739> back<00:03:11.010> view<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.609> the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
the other one was a back view so the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.370 
the other one was a back view so the
chair<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.209> side<00:03:12.420> was<00:03:12.630> like<00:03:12.900> correctness

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
chair the side was like correctness

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.699 
chair the side was like correctness
though<00:03:13.590> here's<00:03:14.579> another<00:03:14.840> view<00:03:15.840> which<00:03:16.530> is<00:03:16.680> a

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
though here's another view which is a

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.500 
though here's another view which is a
side<00:03:17.010> view<00:03:17.040> but<00:03:17.609> as<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:17.970> can<00:03:18.060> see<00:03:18.239> it's<00:03:18.359> not

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
side view but as you can see it's not

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.060 
side view but as you can see it's not
clear<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.049> can't<00:03:19.290> see<00:03:19.410> any<00:03:19.560> curves<00:03:19.829> right

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
clear you can't see any curves right

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.509 
clear you can't see any curves right
here<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:21.470> here's<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.650> last<00:03:22.859> one<00:03:23.100> this<00:03:23.459> is

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
here and here's the last one this is

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.759 
here and here's the last one this is
also<00:03:23.910> another<00:03:24.120> side<00:03:24.540> view<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.109> can<00:03:25.739> see

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
also another side view you can see

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.470 
also another side view you can see
here's<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.070> tailbone<00:03:26.549> so<00:03:26.760> this<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.150> lower

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
here's the tailbone so this is the lower

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.819 
here's the tailbone so this is the lower
side<00:03:27.810> view<00:03:28.109> and<00:03:28.620> that's<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.609> so<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:31.650> know<00:03:31.769> you

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
side view and that's it so you know you

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.500 
side view and that's it so you know you
guys<00:03:32.160> had<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.430> see<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:32.730> in<00:03:32.910> order<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.150> believe
