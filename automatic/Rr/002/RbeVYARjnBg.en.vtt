00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:03.120
 according to his grave 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.120
 here's why 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.369
 do not agree santa cruz 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:13.369
 we can register 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:18.159
 but if you have a bottle 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.499
 at this price level 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:29.339
 the odd years 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.339
 recently a multihull 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.320
 a little deeper 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.470
 in those moments that matter 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.210
 more than a souvenir windows this 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.210
 when we always ask earlier 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.950
 and therefore the populations 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.290
 you could not 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.810
 they support 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.320
 so the costumes are dead 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.580
 looking at this set 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.940
 in selection 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.000
 pilot 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.460
 down 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.430
 in the ranking this 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.130
 wouters the selection 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.960
 and the emotional side at home too 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.220
 so the time 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.790
 he therefore had no further 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.790
 citing close sources 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.720
 8 hours 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.540
 I hurt myself 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.210
 for this you have to pay 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.660
 him who was my arm the socialists but these new prices 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.960
 for the courts 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.200
 but if I have to go 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.280
 new supports 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.510
 this well for his 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.510
 these constructions 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.890
 what sauce we 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.890
 for all he can for now only to this content 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.830
 the manceaux 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.020
 we have to start over it's for when 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.029
 you have to give slaps 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:13.029
 it's a step forward 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:18.649
 how much our plate 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.199
 therefore the threshold of 6% 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.199
 for the theme of employment 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.709
 ok we do not know 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.409
 Protoscar 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.409
 but this time the old name 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.569
 the tps 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.569
 it befits his hands 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.029
 for the stock market 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:49.029
 all employees 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:53.839
 the pied-noirs where he would hit 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.529
 the comments of m 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.529
 below the programs of these advances 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.989
 if the elections 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.039
 it's the coach 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:15.959
 once it's done 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.579
 so the times 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.579
 emissaries water 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.469
 I know your heads
