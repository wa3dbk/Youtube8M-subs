lettuce for salads i wanted to explain
it<00:00:09.750> but<00:00:10.019> it's<00:00:10.920> difficult<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.519> explain<00:00:11.910> that

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
it but it's difficult to explain that

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.889 
together and just run the water down
inside<00:00:40.110> all<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.860> these<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.629> then<00:00:42.629> when<00:00:42.780> it's

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
inside all of these and then when it's

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.110 
inside all of these and then when it's
flashed<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.559> turn<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.040> upside<00:00:44.100> down<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.760> that

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
flashed I turn it upside down so that

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.910 
flashed I turn it upside down so that
some<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.539> water<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.930> drain<00:00:46.050> out<00:00:46.260> drain

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
some of the water can drain out drain

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.610 
some of the water can drain out drain
off<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.399> do<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> salad<00:00:48.629> spinner<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.260> that

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
off I do have a salad spinner and that

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.470 
off I do have a salad spinner and that
really<00:00:49.860> helps<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:52.050> student<00:00:52.379> X<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.860> water<00:00:53.070> off

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
really helps the student X to water off

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.209 
really helps the student X to water off
so<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.510> use<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.140> salad<00:00:55.530> spinner<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.010> makes

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
so I use a salad spinner and that makes

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.860 
so I use a salad spinner and that makes
it<00:00:56.370> keep<00:00:56.550> longer<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.239> keep<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> lettuce

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
it keep longer we can keep the lettuce

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.029 
it keep longer we can keep the lettuce
for<00:00:58.170> 5<00:00:58.379> days<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.949> more<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.430> doesn't<00:00:59.760> get

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
for 5 days and more and it doesn't get

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.840 
for 5 days and more and it doesn't get
brown<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.699> edges<00:01:02.809> nearly<00:01:03.809> as<00:01:03.899> fast<00:01:04.820> when<00:01:05.820> I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
brown on the edges nearly as fast when I

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.080 
brown on the edges nearly as fast when I
use<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.299> salad<00:01:06.659> spinner<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.490> after<00:01:09.000> I've

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
just do my hands then okay so there is

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.280 
just do my hands then okay so there is
our<00:01:49.079> list<00:01:49.290> for<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> salad<00:01:50.990> so<00:01:51.990> some<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.170> these

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
our list for a salad so some of these

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.370 
our list for a salad so some of these
pieces<00:01:52.500> are<00:01:52.710> kind<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.979> big<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.990> it's<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.140> good

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
pieces are kind of big but it's a good

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.170 
pieces are kind of big but it's a good
mixture<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.310> find<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.759> makes<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.000> good

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
mixture and I find that it makes a good

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.719 
mixture and I find that it makes a good
