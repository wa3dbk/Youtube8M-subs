from the field to the office and a lot

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.660 
from the field to the office and a lot
of<00:01:10.049> times<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.530> larger<00:01:10.860> operations<00:01:11.430> might

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
of times the larger operations might

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.240 
of times the larger operations might
have<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.750> know<00:01:12.780> five<00:01:13.200> ten<00:01:13.530> employees<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.200 
understand it's very time consuming to
do<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:20.159> makes<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.549> very<00:01:20.580> easy<00:01:20.790> it's

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210

farm so maybe a few hundred feet but
let's<00:02:30.090> say<00:02:30.270> if<00:02:30.420> you're<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.930> smaller<00:02:31.260> operation

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
let's say if you're a smaller operation

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.920 
let's say if you're a smaller operation
and<00:02:32.250> don't<00:02:32.850> want<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.060> pay<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.510> money<00:02:33.660> for<00:02:33.750> the

and don't want to pay the money for the
modem<00:02:34.230> maybe<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.370> drive<00:02:35.700> your<00:02:35.970> equipment

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
into the the shed at night once you

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.380 
into the the shed at night once you
approach<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.750> Wi-Fi<00:02:40.320> area<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.940> would<00:02:42.210> then

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
approach that Wi-Fi area it would then

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.450 
approach that Wi-Fi area it would then
send<00:02:42.660> all<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.990> data<00:02:43.050> from<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.800> display<00:02:44.310> or

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
send all that data from that display or

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.730 
send all that data from that display or

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
office wirelessly so you don't

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.330 
office wirelessly so you don't
necessarily<00:02:48.720> have<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.290> be<00:02:49.530> out<00:02:49.770> in<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.130> field

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
necessarily have to be out in the field

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.370 
necessarily have to be out in the field
you<00:02:50.790> know<00:02:51.210> there's<00:02:51.630> different<00:02:51.750> ways<00:02:52.020> there's

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
you know there's different ways there's

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.720 
you know there's different ways there's
this<00:02:52.530> depends<00:02:53.070> how<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.250> want<00:02:53.490> to<00:02:53.520> approach

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
this depends how you want to approach

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.600 
this depends how you want to approach
that<00:02:54.030> connected<00:02:54.450> farm<00:02:54.660> solution<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:56.220> make

your farm wireless or connected out
what's<00:02:59.070> it<00:02:59.220> going<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.370> cost<00:02:59.900> well<00:03:00.900> actually

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
what's it going to cost well actually

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.500 
what's it going to cost well actually
this<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.340> really<00:03:02.610> cool<00:03:02.790> part<00:03:03.060> about<00:03:03.090> how

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
this is the really cool part about how

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.720 
this is the really cool part about how
we're<00:03:03.660> introducing<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.260> new<00:03:04.320> product<00:03:04.730> if

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
we're introducing this new product if

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.460 
we're introducing this new product if
you<00:03:05.910> have<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.330> farm<00:03:06.630> works<00:03:06.840> office<00:03:07.260> software

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
you have the farm works office software

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.160 
you have the farm works office software
so<00:03:08.010> bare<00:03:08.250> minimum<00:03:08.730> you'd<00:03:09.480> have<00:03:09.630> about<00:03:09.840> six

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
so bare minimum you'd have about six

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.630 
so bare minimum you'd have about six
hundred<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.500> fifty<00:03:10.770> dollars<00:03:11.160> into<00:03:11.430> the

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
hundred and fifty dollars into the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.630 
hundred and fifty dollars into the
software<00:03:12.090> package<00:03:12.420> in<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.690> office<00:03:13.400> if<00:03:14.400> you

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
software package in the office if you

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.610 
software package in the office if you
have<00:03:14.880> an<00:03:15.120> FM<00:03:15.390> X<00:03:15.600> display<00:03:16.080> we're<00:03:16.470> actually

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
have an FM X display we're actually

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.650 
have an FM X display we're actually
giving<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.190> device<00:03:17.610> connection<00:03:18.239> for<00:03:18.420> free

giving you a device connection for free

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.479 
giving you a device connection for free
so<00:03:19.019> you<00:03:19.050> can<00:03:19.230> actually<00:03:19.650> test<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:20.010> out<00:03:20.130> on<00:03:20.190> that

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
so you can actually test it out on that

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.110 
so you can actually test it out on that
FM<00:03:20.820> x<00:03:21.000> or<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.930> handheld<00:03:22.200> computer<00:03:22.820> if<00:03:23.820> you
