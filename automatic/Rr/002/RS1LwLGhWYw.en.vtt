they<00:00:29.340> use<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.849> think<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.119> was<00:00:30.210> about<00:00:30.300> three

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
they use I think it was about three

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.049 
they use I think it was about three
pound<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.380> took<00:00:31.949> about<00:00:32.130> six<00:00:32.550> days<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.969> get

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059

guided on the instructions so the next

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.420 
guided on the instructions so the next
packet<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.210> orange<00:02:00.659> one<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.590> add<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
packet is the orange one so add to the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.969 
packet is the orange one so add to the
larger<00:02:02.969> try<00:02:03.180> again<00:02:03.509> with<00:02:03.990> two<00:02:04.560> scoops<00:02:04.860> of

once you have a smooth consistency like

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.720 
once you have a smooth consistency like
this<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.600> want<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.990> divide<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.890> mixture<00:02:19.070> in

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
this you want to divide the mixture in

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.450 
this you want to divide the mixture in
between<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:21.050> different<00:02:21.650> components<00:02:22.280> in

between the a different components in
the<00:02:22.610> black<00:02:22.880> train<00:02:23.150> like<00:02:23.540> this<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.170> then<00:02:24.800> into

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
the black train like this and then into

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.890 
the black train like this and then into
each<00:02:25.340> one<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:25.760> need<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.030> top<00:02:26.240> it<00:02:26.420> with<00:02:26.450> one<00:02:26.780> of

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
each one you need to top it with one of

each one you need to top it with one of
the<00:02:26.990> prawns<00:02:34.960> next<00:02:35.960> you<00:02:36.020> need<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.170> place<00:02:36.440> this
