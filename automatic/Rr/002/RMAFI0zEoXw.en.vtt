00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
like a batman symbol it's pretty cool

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.280 
like a batman symbol it's pretty cool
and<00:02:52.959> i<00:02:53.739> started<00:02:54.130> wearing<00:02:54.400> um<00:02:54.810> curved<00:02:55.810> barbells

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
and i started wearing um curved barbells

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.040 
and i started wearing um curved barbells
and<00:02:56.620> my<00:02:57.070> septum<00:02:57.790> instead<00:02:58.570> of<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:59.850> traditional

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
and my septum instead of the traditional

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.870 
and my septum instead of the traditional
captive<00:03:02.050> bead<00:03:02.410> hoops<00:03:02.709> and<00:03:03.100> horseshoes<00:03:03.610> I

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.430 
think it looks I like the way it looks
um<00:03:07.180> this<00:03:07.810> is<00:03:08.020> actually<00:03:08.610> like<00:03:09.610> a<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:10.440> belly

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
um this is actually like a a belly

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.650 
um this is actually like a a belly
button<00:03:11.680> length<00:03:12.040> curved<00:03:12.850> barbell<00:03:13.269> I'm<00:03:13.510> gonna

try to put a an eyebrow ring length
curved<00:03:17.530> barbell<00:03:17.950> it'll<00:03:18.910> probably<00:03:19.120> like<00:03:19.780> bring

the<00:03:20.590> balls<00:03:20.799> closer<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.310> I<00:03:21.340> think<00:03:21.549> it'll<00:03:21.670> look

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
the balls closer and I think it'll look

for now um so I think that's just about
it<00:03:28.470> nothing<00:03:29.470> much<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.799> really<00:03:30.010> happening
