really get a case and that's unfortunate

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.130 
really get a case and that's unfortunate
it's<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.309> because<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.610> size<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:33.059> gut<00:00:33.300> but

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.350 

but<00:03:29.410> actually<00:03:29.560> taking<00:03:30.250> too<00:03:30.459> long<00:03:30.610> to<00:03:30.670> load<00:03:31.030> but

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
but actually taking too long to load but

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.960 
but actually taking too long to load but
yeah<00:03:31.569> that's<00:03:31.720> pretty<00:03:31.930> much<00:03:32.050> it<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:33.760> could

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
yeah that's pretty much it you could

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.240 
yeah that's pretty much it you could
choose<00:03:34.180> ups<00:03:34.750> if<00:03:35.050> you<00:03:35.170> wanted<00:03:35.530> faster<00:03:35.980> shipping

choose ups if you wanted faster shipping

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.880 
choose ups if you wanted faster shipping
but<00:03:36.700> I<00:03:36.910> think<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.300> costs<00:03:37.660> a<00:03:37.720> lot<00:03:37.870> more<00:03:38.170> so<00:03:38.590> the

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
but I think it costs a lot more so the

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.150 
but I think it costs a lot more so the
standard<00:03:39.190> shipping<00:03:39.400> prices<00:03:40.300> I<00:03:40.510> if<00:03:41.379> I<00:03:41.620> remember

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
standard shipping prices I if I remember

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.910

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
correctly it's around 12 bucks so the

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.570
