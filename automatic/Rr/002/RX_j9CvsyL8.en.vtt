so and there you notice over here that
you<00:00:24.779> have<00:00:25.820> one<00:00:26.820> hard<00:00:27.119> drive<00:00:27.240> two<00:00:28.230> hard<00:00:28.470> drives

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
you have one hard drive two hard drives

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.440 
you have one hard drive two hard drives
the<00:00:29.580> memory<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:31.800> wireless<00:00:32.489> card<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.390> is

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the memory the wireless card and that is

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.590 
the memory the wireless card and that is
your<00:00:33.809> mSATA<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.610> computer<00:00:36.210> actually<00:00:36.300> has

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
your mSATA so this computer actually has

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.000 
your mSATA so this computer actually has
three<00:00:37.110> different<00:00:39.230> areas<00:00:40.230> for<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.829> put

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
three different areas for you to put

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.220 
three different areas for you to put
storage<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.120> because<00:00:42.540> well<00:00:43.280> honesty<00:00:44.280> honestly

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
storage in because well honesty honestly

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.270 
storage in because well honesty honestly

Dell has this done is they intended for
the<00:00:54.600> M<00:00:54.989> SATA<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:56.100> be<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.550> cachet<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> main

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the M SATA to be a cachet for the main

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.500 
the M SATA to be a cachet for the main
terabyte<00:00:58.890> drive<00:00:59.550> will<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.210> keep<00:01:00.359> your

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
terabyte drive will you keep your

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.569 
terabyte drive will you keep your
operating<00:01:00.899> system<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.920> they<00:01:02.160> want<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.489> to

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
operating system so they want you to

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.369 
operating system so they want you to
have<00:01:02.670> your<00:01:02.820> OS<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.270> one<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> drives<00:01:04.110> and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
have your OS on one of the drives and

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.120 
have your OS on one of the drives and
then<00:01:04.830> use<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> mSATA<00:01:05.670> has<00:01:06.060> your<00:01:06.479> caches<00:01:07.049> so

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
then use the mSATA has your caches so

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.530 
then use the mSATA has your caches so
some<00:01:08.130> certain<00:01:08.430> files<00:01:08.610> will<00:01:08.760> load<00:01:09.270> quicker

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
some certain files will load quicker

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.780 
some certain files will load quicker
what<00:01:10.260> I've<00:01:10.409> done<00:01:10.619> what<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> people<00:01:11.280> online<00:01:11.369> of

them is that they said no we would like
to<00:01:14.280> please<00:01:15.170> install<00:01:16.170> an<00:01:16.500> operating<00:01:16.590> system<00:01:17.009> on

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
to please install an operating system on

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.450 
to please install an operating system on
the<00:01:17.610> end<00:01:17.759> SATA<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.439> day<00:01:20.189> 1

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the end SATA so that we can have day 1

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.280 
the end SATA so that we can have day 1
and<00:01:20.729> day<00:01:20.790> 2<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.270> storage

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
and day 2 for storage

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.740 
and day 2 for storage
hence<00:01:22.830> putting<00:01:23.340> one<00:01:23.640> terabyte<00:01:24.030> there<00:01:24.299> one

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
hence putting one terabyte there one

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.260 
hence putting one terabyte there one
tear<00:01:24.990> right<00:01:25.110> there<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.680> your<00:01:26.220> OS<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.880> this

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
tear right there and your OS on this

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.560 
tear right there and your OS on this
Drive<00:01:27.540> now<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.900> comes<00:01:28.110> with<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> 32<00:01:29.159> gig<00:01:29.610> one

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
Drive now it comes with a 32 gig one
