00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
but I thought that if I were to

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.320 
but I thought that if I were to
incorporate<00:01:19.290> those<00:01:19.560> colors<00:01:20.070> into<00:01:20.549> the

incorporate those colors into the
pollies<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:22.110> well<00:01:22.290> um<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.750> thought<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.990> it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
pollies as well um I thought that it

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.960 
pollies as well um I thought that it
would<00:01:25.200> look<00:01:25.350> cool<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.799> they<00:01:25.860> will<00:01:26.009> pop<00:01:26.220> off<00:01:26.250> so

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
would look cool and they will pop off so

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.399 
would look cool and they will pop off so
