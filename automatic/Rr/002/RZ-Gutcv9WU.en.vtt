00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
shelf button which is what I've done so

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.990 
shelf button which is what I've done so
we'll<00:00:26.730> just<00:00:27.619> click<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.609> comes<00:00:29.760> up<00:00:29.910> at

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
we'll just click it and it comes up at

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.370 
we'll just click it and it comes up at
the<00:00:30.029> window<00:00:30.330> there's<00:00:30.539> no<00:00:30.630> node<00:00:30.929> selected

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the window there's no node selected

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.209 
the window there's no node selected
because<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.679> don't<00:00:31.800> have<00:00:31.859> anything<00:00:32.040> selected

node then reset the editor to start

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.700 
node then reset the editor to start
creating<00:00:35.880> views<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:36.960> hit<00:00:37.110> OK<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.590> UI

comes<00:00:38.070> up<00:00:38.219> we're<00:00:39.000> just<00:00:39.149> going<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.329> use<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
comes up we're just going to use the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.319 
comes up we're just going to use the
default<00:00:39.629> settings<00:00:40.140> for<00:00:40.230> nail<00:00:40.879> select<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
default settings for nail select the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.970 
default settings for nail select the
kind<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.719> node<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.320> want<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.800> actually

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
kind of node that you want to actually

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.790 
kind of node that you want to actually
control<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.270> we're<00:00:45.870> gonna<00:00:46.050> do<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> transform

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
control and we're gonna do a transform

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.760 
control and we're gonna do a transform
node<00:00:47.960> right<00:00:48.960> there<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.530> see<00:00:49.649> it's

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
node right there so you can see it's

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.950 
node right there so you can see it's
transform<00:00:50.160> node<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.789> we'll<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.570> go<00:00:51.690> reset

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
transform node and we'll just go reset

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.340 
transform node and we'll just go reset
editor<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:54.180> say<00:00:54.420> right<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.930> sets<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
editor so say right here it sets to the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.500 
editor so say right here it sets to the
transform<00:00:55.770> node<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.879> lists<00:00:57.300> all<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
transform node and it lists all the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.819 
transform node and it lists all the
attributes<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> transform<00:00:58.559> node<00:00:58.590> right

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
attributes of the transform node right

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.700 
attributes of the transform node right
in<00:00:58.949> here<00:00:59.449> so<00:01:00.449> now<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.989> start<00:01:01.199> creating<00:01:01.530> our

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
in here so now we can start creating our

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.060 
in here so now we can start creating our
views

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
views

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.509 
views
so<00:01:02.660> let's<00:01:03.660> first<00:01:03.960> go<00:01:04.170> for<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.559> let's<00:01:05.159> bring<00:01:05.369> in

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
so let's first go for the let's bring in

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.370 
so let's first go for the let's bring in
that<00:01:06.299> we're<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> an<00:01:06.840> abuse

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that we're going to the an abuse

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.740 
that we're going to the an abuse
so<00:01:07.740> put<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> plus<00:01:08.250> sign<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.729> bring<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
so put the plus sign to bring it in to

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.270 
so put the plus sign to bring it in to
the<00:01:09.840> view<00:01:10.049> list<00:01:10.520> along<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.790> scale<00:01:13.280> now

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the view list along with the scale now

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.160 
the view list along with the scale now
along<00:01:14.580> with<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.030> translation<00:01:17.509> translate<00:01:18.509> and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
along with the translation translate and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.070 
along with the translation translate and
the<00:01:19.860> visibility<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:24.270> now<00:01:24.390> what<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.659> need<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.869> do

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
the visibility so now what we need to do

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.870 
the visibility so now what we need to do
is<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.320> want<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.500> order<00:01:25.650> these<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.340> how<00:01:26.549> we<00:01:26.610> list

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
is we want to order these so how we list

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.830 
is we want to order these so how we list
them<00:01:27.000> here<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.270> how<00:01:27.360> they're<00:01:27.540> going<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.780> be

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
them here is how they're going to be

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.719 
them here is how they're going to be
displayed<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> attribute<00:01:28.829> editor<00:01:28.920> I've

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
displayed in the attribute editor I've

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.340 
displayed in the attribute editor I've
always<00:01:30.030> liked<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> translate<00:01:30.750> rotate<00:01:30.900> scale

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
always liked the translate rotate scale

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.920 
always liked the translate rotate scale
so<00:01:31.829> we'll<00:01:32.100> select<00:01:32.310> those<00:01:32.549> two<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.060> bring<00:01:33.810> them

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
so we'll select those two and bring them

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.310 
so we'll select those two and bring them
down

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
down

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.819 
down

sake of discussions we'll use the insert

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.639 
sake of discussions we'll use the insert
a<00:01:41.909> new<00:01:42.030> attribute<00:01:42.180> group<00:01:42.600> right<00:01:43.259> at<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.470> top

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
a new attribute group right at the top

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.499 
a new attribute group right at the top
to<00:01:44.460> create<00:01:44.610> an<00:01:44.759> attribute<00:01:44.880> group<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.479> a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
and there we go now we've created our

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.700 
and there we go now we've created our
animal<00:01:52.150> now<00:01:52.720> we<00:01:52.960> want<00:01:53.140> our<00:01:53.260> effects<00:01:53.500> for<00:01:53.650> you

to share a lot in common with this so

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.360 
to share a lot in common with this so
what<00:01:56.320> we're<00:01:56.440> gonna<00:01:56.500> do<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:56.920> we're<00:01:57.070> going<00:01:57.250> to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
what we're gonna do is we're going to

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.420 
what we're gonna do is we're going to
actually<00:01:58.410> we<00:01:59.410> can't<00:01:59.680> cut<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.070> paste<00:02:00.250> from

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
actually we can't cut and paste from

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.360 
actually we can't cut and paste from
this<00:02:00.610> UI<00:02:00.790> what<00:02:01.780> we<00:02:01.930> can<00:02:02.170> do<00:02:02.350> is<00:02:02.470> we<00:02:02.620> can<00:02:02.770> delete

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
this UI what we can do is we can delete

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.560 
this UI what we can do is we can delete
the<00:02:04.090> effects<00:02:04.360> view<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:07.110> then<00:02:08.110> copy<00:02:08.380> this<00:02:08.619> view

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
the effects view and then copy this view

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.140 
the effects view and then copy this view
s<00:02:10.570> effects<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:12.370> give<00:02:12.490> us<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.670> starting<00:02:13.000> point

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
s effects to give us a starting point

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.850 
s effects to give us a starting point
now<00:02:13.630> we<00:02:13.720> have<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.870> duplicate<00:02:14.380> of<00:02:14.410> this<00:02:14.560> view

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
now we have a duplicate of this view

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.590 
now we have a duplicate of this view
this<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.430> completely<00:02:15.790> separate<00:02:16.150> from<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.450> we

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
this is completely separate from this we

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.850 
this is completely separate from this we
can<00:02:16.720> do<00:02:16.780> whatever<00:02:16.960> we<00:02:17.080> want<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.470> this<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.650> it

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
can do whatever we want to this and it

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.530 
can do whatever we want to this and it
won't<00:02:17.980> come<00:02:18.130> across<00:02:18.370> will<00:02:19.090> be<00:02:19.210> one<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.390> those

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
won't come across will be one of those

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.850 
won't come across will be one of those
same<00:02:19.720> things<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:20.020> come<00:02:20.170> across<00:02:20.410> for<00:02:20.590> effects

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
same things to come across for effects

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.640 
same things to come across for effects
but<00:02:21.010> we<00:02:21.040> also<00:02:21.250> wanted<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.640> add<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:22.410> way<00:02:23.410> I'm

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
but we also wanted to add a way I'm

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.410 
but we also wanted to add a way I'm
sorry<00:02:24.070> you<00:02:24.610> have<00:02:24.790> text<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.090> light<00:02:25.210> something

sorry you have text to light something
first<00:02:25.660> well<00:02:26.260> add<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.470> group<00:02:27.100> called<00:02:28.560> display

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
first well add a group called display

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.260 
first well add a group called display
because<00:02:30.220> it's<00:02:30.370> going<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:30.610> affect<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:30.910> display

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
because it's going to affect the display

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.870 
because it's going to affect the display
and<00:02:31.870> we're<00:02:32.650> including<00:02:32.980> visibility<00:02:33.610> in<00:02:33.730> that

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
and we're including visibility in that

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.450 
and we're including visibility in that
also<00:02:34.480> will<00:02:34.750> have<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:36.360> overrides<00:02:38.160> color<00:02:39.160> and

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
also will have the overrides color and

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.570 
also will have the overrides color and
the<00:02:40.360> override<00:02:40.960> enable<00:02:41.680> will<00:02:42.280> bring<00:02:42.460> those

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
the override enable will bring those

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.130 
the override enable will bring those
across<00:02:42.850> we<00:02:43.210> can<00:02:43.330> bring<00:02:43.540> more<00:02:43.570> than<00:02:43.780> one<00:02:43.930> thing

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
across we can bring more than one thing

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.560 
across we can bring more than one thing
across<00:02:44.350> once<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.850> we'll<00:02:45.970> just<00:02:46.120> change<00:02:46.360> the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
across once and we'll just change the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.120 
across once and we'll just change the
order<00:02:46.600> so<00:02:47.170> let's<00:02:47.410> get<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:49.450> up<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:50.130> then

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
order so let's get that up and then

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.400 
order so let's get that up and then
there<00:02:51.520> we<00:02:51.610> are<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:52.000> now<00:02:52.510> for<00:02:52.840> lighting<00:02:53.110> all

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
there we are and now for lighting all

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.640 
there we are and now for lighting all
we're<00:02:53.920> going<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.340> do<00:02:55.020> we<00:02:56.020> just<00:02:56.260> want<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.530> have

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
we're going to do we just want to have

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.430 
we're going to do we just want to have
the<00:02:56.830> visibility<00:02:57.370> even<00:02:58.080> though<00:02:59.080> it's<00:02:59.200> just<00:02:59.260> a

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
the visibility even though it's just a

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.690 
the visibility even though it's just a
transform<00:02:59.950> we'll<00:03:00.160> just<00:03:00.340> control<00:03:00.610> the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
transform we'll just control the

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.220 
transform we'll just control the
visibility<00:03:00.820> from<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:01.420> air<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:01.780> we'll<00:03:02.080> bring

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
visibility from the air so we'll bring

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.750 
visibility from the air so we'll bring
it<00:03:02.350> across<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:03.070> we<00:03:03.610> now<00:03:03.760> have<00:03:03.790> our<00:03:05.760> three

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
it across and we now have our three

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.910 
it across and we now have our three
views<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.840> then<00:03:07.989> what<00:03:08.110> we're<00:03:08.260> gonna<00:03:08.350> do<00:03:08.620> is<00:03:10.920> set

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
views so then what we're gonna do is set

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.010 
views so then what we're gonna do is set
feedback<00:03:12.310> just<00:03:13.209> so<00:03:13.270> we<00:03:13.360> see<00:03:13.390> what's<00:03:13.720> kind<00:03:13.959> of

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
feedback just so we see what's kind of

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.440 
feedback just so we see what's kind of
happening<00:03:17.400> bring<00:03:18.400> up<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.670> script<00:03:18.910> editor<00:03:19.060> and

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
happening bring up the script editor and

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.030 
happening bring up the script editor and
we're<00:03:19.600> now<00:03:19.690> going<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:19.959> create<00:03:20.080> our<00:03:20.260> views<00:03:20.560> and

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
we're now going to create our views and

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.910 
we're now going to create our views and
just<00:03:21.340> say<00:03:21.430> create<00:03:21.700> template<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:23.260> get<00:03:23.830> little

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
just say create template and get little

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.710 
just say create template and get little
window<00:03:24.190> that<00:03:24.310> pops<00:03:24.489> up<00:03:24.640> says<00:03:25.090> template<00:03:25.480> saved

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
window that pops up says template saved

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.110 
window that pops up says template saved
lets<00:03:26.140> us<00:03:26.260> know<00:03:26.380> is<00:03:26.620> done<00:03:26.800> successfully<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:28.000> it

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
lets us know is done successfully and it

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.650 
lets us know is done successfully and it
gives<00:03:28.270> us<00:03:28.390> a<00:03:28.630> file<00:03:29.590> path<00:03:30.100> that's<00:03:30.940> where<00:03:31.390> this

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
gives us a file path that's where this

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.900 
gives us a file path that's where this
template<00:03:32.020> file<00:03:32.200> was<00:03:32.410> saved<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:33.459> also<00:03:33.580> gives<00:03:33.820> us

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
template file was saved it also gives us

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.580 
template file was saved it also gives us
a<00:03:33.970> little<00:03:34.180> warning<00:03:34.450> you<00:03:34.989> know<00:03:35.110> you<00:03:35.170> may<00:03:35.470> need

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
a little warning you know you may need

to see the results of the new template
we<00:03:38.950> don't<00:03:39.160> because<00:03:39.459> we<00:03:39.610> haven't<00:03:39.760> actually

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
we don't because we haven't actually

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.990 
have actually had a template and you're
just<00:03:44.020> kind<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.320> writing<00:03:45.040> over<00:03:45.670> an<00:03:45.760> existing

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
just kind of writing over an existing

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.720 
just kind of writing over an existing
one<00:03:46.320> you<00:03:47.320> may<00:03:47.560> need<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:48.130> run<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.790> custom<00:03:49.150> layer

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
one you may need to run the custom layer

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.699 
one you may need to run the custom layer
right<00:03:50.209> from<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.450> script<00:03:50.660> editor<00:03:50.780> or<00:03:51.470> script

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
right from the script editor or script

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
window but just go okay it gives us this

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.339 
window but just go okay it gives us this
path<00:03:55.310> right<00:03:55.550> here<00:03:55.610> again<00:03:56.390> where<00:03:56.840> we<00:03:56.959> can<00:03:57.140> save

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
path right here again where we can save

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.070 
path right here again where we can save
it<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:57.680> it<00:03:57.830> lets<00:03:58.040> us<00:03:58.190> know<00:03:58.220> where<00:03:58.900> are<00:03:59.900> the

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
it and it lets us know where are the

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.509 
it and it lets us know where are the
steps<00:04:00.319> I<00:04:00.440> went<00:04:00.590> through<00:04:00.769> that's<00:04:01.069> if<00:04:01.280> it<00:04:01.400> should

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
steps I went through that's if it should

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.509 
steps I went through that's if it should
happen<00:04:01.670> to<00:04:01.819> fail<00:04:02.120> and<00:04:02.739> bomb<00:04:03.739> out<00:04:03.980> of<00:04:04.160> it<00:04:04.280> for

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
happen to fail and bomb out of it for

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.070 
happen to fail and bomb out of it for
whatever<00:04:04.700> reason<00:04:04.849> we'll<00:04:05.330> see<00:04:05.480> exactly<00:04:05.780> where

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
whatever reason we'll see exactly where

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.500 
whatever reason we'll see exactly where
it<00:04:06.170> is<00:04:06.290> I<00:04:06.650> haven't<00:04:06.860> had<00:04:07.069> it<00:04:07.220> ever<00:04:07.880> do<00:04:08.090> that<00:04:08.239> but

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
it is I haven't had it ever do that but

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.240 
it is I haven't had it ever do that but
you<00:04:08.599> never<00:04:08.720> know<00:04:08.930> so<00:04:09.170> now<00:04:09.830> we'll<00:04:09.980> see<00:04:10.099> what<00:04:10.190> a

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
you never know so now we'll see what a

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.770 
you never know so now we'll see what a
template<00:04:10.580> file<00:04:10.730> looks<00:04:10.970> like<00:04:12.040> and<00:04:13.569> you've<00:04:14.569> got

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
template file looks like and you've got

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.259 
template file looks like and you've got
that<00:04:14.930> one<00:04:15.170> thing<00:04:15.200> we've<00:04:15.590> just<00:04:15.799> cut<00:04:16.040> paste<00:04:16.310> you

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
that one thing we've just cut paste you

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.879 
that one thing we've just cut paste you
know<00:04:17.359> fortunately<00:04:17.959> it's<00:04:18.200> not<00:04:18.410> done<00:04:18.650> in

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
know fortunately it's not done in

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.330 
know fortunately it's not done in
Windows<00:04:19.280> format<00:04:19.720> so<00:04:20.979> I'll<00:04:21.979> just<00:04:22.130> quickly

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
Windows format so I'll just quickly

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.950 
Windows format so I'll just quickly
change<00:04:22.790> these<00:04:23.000> over<00:04:25.270> ubiquitously<00:04:26.270> only

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
change these over ubiquitously only

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.250 
change these over ubiquitously only
because<00:04:27.260> my<00:04:27.290> favorite<00:04:27.860> text<00:04:28.130> editor<00:04:29.260> doesn't

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
because my favorite text editor doesn't

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.200 
because my favorite text editor doesn't
handle<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.590> automatically<00:04:31.220> but<00:04:31.940> here<00:04:32.090> we<00:04:32.180> go

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
handle it automatically but here we go

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.390 
handle it automatically but here we go
this<00:04:32.600> is<00:04:32.660> what<00:04:32.960> a<00:04:32.990> view<00:04:33.740> template<00:04:34.100> looks<00:04:34.190> like

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
this is what a view template looks like

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.580 
this is what a view template looks like
it's<00:04:35.360> primarily<00:04:35.810> broken<00:04:36.169> up<00:04:36.260> in<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.440> two

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
it's primarily broken up in the two

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.040 
it's primarily broken up in the two
sections<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:37.220> first<00:04:37.580> first<00:04:38.540> part<00:04:38.750> is<00:04:38.870> where

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
sections the first first part is where

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.230 
sections the first first part is where
it<00:04:39.229> actually<00:04:39.560> all<00:04:40.190> of<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.580> attributes<00:04:40.729> get

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
it actually all of the attributes get

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.740 
it actually all of the attributes get
declared<00:04:42.520> now<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:44.180> can<00:04:44.360> declare<00:04:44.510> an

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
declared now you can declare an

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.230 
declared now you can declare an
attribute<00:04:45.110> that's<00:04:45.320> not<00:04:45.470> used<00:04:45.740> in<00:04:45.919> a<00:04:46.010> view<00:04:46.240> but

otherwise<00:04:53.690> it<00:04:53.960> you<00:04:54.200> can't<00:04:54.470> declare<00:04:54.740> it<00:04:54.889> that

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
otherwise it you can't declare it that
