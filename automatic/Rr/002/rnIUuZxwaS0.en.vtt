00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.230 
face cheekbones cheeks around the face
so<00:06:05.460> it's<00:06:05.610> kind<00:06:05.789> of<00:06:05.819> more<00:06:06.000> like<00:06:06.060> a

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
so it's kind of more like a

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.619 
so it's kind of more like a
multi-purpose<00:06:06.870> like<00:06:07.379> I<00:06:07.649> guess<00:06:08.189> um

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:08.629 
multi-purpose like I guess um

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:12.499 
multi-purpose like I guess um
multi-coloured<00:06:09.629> bronzer<00:06:10.289> and<00:06:11.389> packaging<00:06:12.389> is

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:12.509 
multi-coloured bronzer and packaging is

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:14.809 
multi-coloured bronzer and packaging is
very<00:06:12.569> nice<00:06:12.960> and<00:06:13.199> sleek<00:06:13.469> very<00:06:14.069> similar<00:06:14.430> to<00:06:14.460> NARS

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:14.819 
very nice and sleek very similar to NARS

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:17.899 
very nice and sleek very similar to NARS
but<00:06:15.659> the<00:06:15.870> colors<00:06:16.169> are<00:06:16.349> so<00:06:16.710> pretty<00:06:16.740> and<00:06:17.550> sorry<00:06:17.849> I

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:17.909 
but the colors are so pretty and sorry I

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:19.309 
but the colors are so pretty and sorry I
don't<00:06:18.089> mean<00:06:18.210> to<00:06:18.270> blind<00:06:18.569> you<00:06:18.750> but<00:06:19.169> they're

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 
don't mean to blind you but they're

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:21.200 
don't mean to blind you but they're
really<00:06:19.589> really<00:06:19.710> pretty<00:06:20.009> and<00:06:20.279> I<00:06:20.849> think<00:06:21.089> this

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
really really pretty and I think this

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.790 
really really pretty and I think this
would<00:06:21.389> work<00:06:21.539> on<00:06:21.779> many<00:06:22.110> different<00:06:22.229> skin<00:06:22.620> tones

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
would work on many different skin tones

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.619 
would work on many different skin tones
and<00:06:23.099> you<00:06:23.189> could<00:06:23.310> also<00:06:23.460> use<00:06:23.610> this<00:06:23.939> as<00:06:24.120> I<00:06:24.330> shadow

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:24.629 
and you could also use this as I shadow

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:26.059 
and you could also use this as I shadow
because<00:06:25.110> the<00:06:25.259> colors<00:06:25.560> are<00:06:25.680> kind<00:06:25.889> of<00:06:25.919> a<00:06:26.039> little

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:26.069 
because the colors are kind of a little

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:28.070 
because the colors are kind of a little
bit<00:06:26.339> shimmery<00:06:26.669> and<00:06:26.819> really<00:06:27.419> pretty<00:06:27.599> and<00:06:27.899> just

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080
