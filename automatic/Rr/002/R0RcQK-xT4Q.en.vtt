led us to the Wii Remote was the thought

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.319 
led us to the Wii Remote was the thought
process<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.810> how<00:01:52.320> do<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.619> get<00:01:52.799> consumers<00:01:53.579> more

now<00:02:06.030> what's<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> content<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.680> very

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
now what's the content so it's a very

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.460 
now what's the content so it's a very
different<00:02:08.310> approach<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:09.229> looking<00:02:10.229> at<00:02:10.349> our

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470

very<00:02:12.750> important

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
very important

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.460 
very important
to<00:02:13.650> separate<00:02:14.129> out<00:02:14.340> our<00:02:14.849> day-to-day<00:02:15.660> operating

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
to separate out our day-to-day operating
