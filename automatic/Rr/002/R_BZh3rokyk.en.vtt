baby<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.760> don't<00:00:54.000> think<00:00:54.090> there's<00:00:54.270> any<00:00:54.420> way

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
baby but I don't think there's any way

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.360 
baby but I don't think there's any way
to<00:00:54.570> make<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.870> better<00:00:54.960> without<00:00:55.170> pistons<00:00:55.829> that

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
to make it better without pistons that

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.569 
to make it better without pistons that
push<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.940> blocks<00:00:57.180> before<00:00:57.770> so<00:00:58.770> right<00:00:59.250> I

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.939 
push out the blocks before so right I
think<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.570> think<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.170> would<00:01:01.289> only<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
think I think it would only have the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.789 
think I think it would only have the
cobblestone<00:01:02.550> right<00:01:03.030> now<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:04.229> finish<00:01:04.619> this

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
trees we're gonna run the trees from

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.770 
trees we're gonna run the trees from
this<00:03:52.530> way<00:03:52.800> to<00:03:53.070> this<00:03:53.610> way<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:54.150> this<00:03:54.480> is<00:03:54.630> gonna

have to extend pretty far this way so we

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.310 
have to extend pretty far this way so we
need<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.030> have<00:03:57.150> enough<00:03:57.510> that's<00:03:57.930> already

need to have enough that's already

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.340 
need to have enough that's already
extended<00:03:58.800> this<00:03:59.040> one<00:03:59.190> out<00:03:59.370> one<00:03:59.550> so<00:04:00.170> I'm<00:04:01.170> just

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
extended this one out one so I'm just

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.680 
extended this one out one so I'm just
gonna<00:04:01.500> okay<00:04:02.040> oh<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:02.940> want<00:04:03.120> it<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.270> extend<00:04:03.540> on

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
gonna okay oh you want it to extend on

extend<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.460> one<00:04:05.640> one<00:04:06.000> side

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
extend it one one side

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.480 
extend it one one side
I<00:04:06.690> always<00:04:07.500> think<00:04:07.680> we<00:04:07.860> should<00:04:08.010> just<00:04:08.160> say<00:04:08.280> close

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
I always think we should just say close

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.480 
I always think we should just say close
actually<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.120> figured<00:04:09.240> that<00:04:09.750> way<00:04:10.190> will<00:04:11.190> I<00:04:11.250> go<00:04:11.430> to

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
actually I figured that way will I go to

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.920 
actually I figured that way will I go to
room<00:04:11.730> or<00:04:11.910> something<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.450> thought<00:04:12.630> we<00:04:12.750> were<00:04:12.870> just

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
room or something I thought we were just

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.480 
room or something I thought we were just
gonna<00:04:13.140> go<00:04:13.350> straight<00:04:13.770> with<00:04:13.980> it<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.250> then<00:04:14.340> put

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
gonna go straight with it and then put

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.360 
gonna go straight with it and then put
the<00:04:14.610> tree<00:04:14.850> it's<00:04:15.300> like<00:04:15.480> right<00:04:15.750> there<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.370> kind

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
the tree it's like right there and kind

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.550 
the tree it's like right there and kind
of<00:04:17.430> go<00:04:17.549> every<00:04:18.090> soul<00:04:18.330> mini<00:04:18.810> blocks<00:04:19.049> over<00:04:19.410> and

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
of go every soul mini blocks over and

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.140 
of go every soul mini blocks over and
then<00:04:19.680> we<00:04:19.739> could<00:04:19.890> put<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.100> trees<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:20.489> there's

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
then we could put the trees and there's

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.910 
then we could put the trees and there's
no<00:04:21.330> one<00:04:21.480> else<00:04:21.600> like<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:21.959> just<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.650> keep<00:04:22.680> it

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
no one else like that just to keep it

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.750 
no one else like that just to keep it
isn't<00:04:23.220> thinking<00:04:23.340> 1<00:04:23.640> 2<00:04:23.820> 3<00:04:24.680> here<00:04:25.680> this<00:04:26.370> is<00:04:26.580> where

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
isn't thinking 1 2 3 here this is where

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.490 
isn't thinking 1 2 3 here this is where
we'll<00:04:26.910> put<00:04:27.120> oh<00:04:27.360> I<00:04:27.690> don't<00:04:27.840> really<00:04:28.050> need<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.380> dig

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
we'll put oh I don't really need to dig

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.800 
we'll put oh I don't really need to dig
that<00:04:28.650> out<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:28.950> have<00:04:28.980> an<00:04:29.130> e-commerce<00:04:29.220> tree

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
that out you have an e-commerce tree

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.480 
that out you have an e-commerce tree
like<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:30.840> few<00:04:31.080> pieces<00:04:31.200> like<00:04:31.560> maybe<00:04:32.040> five<00:04:32.970> or<00:04:33.240> so

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
like a few pieces like maybe five or so

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.120 
like a few pieces like maybe five or so
there<00:04:35.490> alright<00:04:36.300> so<00:04:36.570> here's<00:04:37.410> where<00:04:37.620> we<00:04:37.980> would

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
there alright so here's where we would

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.000 
there alright so here's where we would
put<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.460> first<00:04:38.700> tree<00:04:39.000> so<00:04:39.800> here's<00:04:40.800> where<00:04:40.890> we

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
put the first tree so here's where we

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.250 
put the first tree so here's where we
got<00:04:41.130> a<00:04:41.280> 3-1<00:04:41.640> and<00:04:42.030> then<00:04:42.210> how<00:04:42.360> many<00:04:42.419> over<00:04:42.990> do<00:04:43.140> you

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
got a 3-1 and then how many over do you

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.220 
got a 3-1 and then how many over do you
want<00:04:43.440> it<00:04:43.560> like<00:04:43.860> do<00:04:44.070> you<00:04:44.280> think<00:04:44.340> we<00:04:44.580> should<00:04:44.790> go

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
want it like do you think we should go

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.830 
want it like do you think we should go
like<00:04:46.230> boom<00:04:47.130> boom<00:04:47.310> I<00:04:47.700> don't<00:04:48.150> know<00:04:48.210> like<00:04:48.390> put<00:04:48.810> a

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
like boom boom I don't know like put a

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.020 
like boom boom I don't know like put a
space<00:04:49.169> of<00:04:49.380> like<00:04:49.530> seven<00:04:50.040> between<00:04:50.580> that<00:04:50.790> way<00:04:50.910> we

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
space of like seven between that way we

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.210 
space of like seven between that way we
have<00:04:51.180> plenty<00:04:51.540> of<00:04:51.660> space<00:04:52.020> so<00:04:52.260> that<00:04:52.410> the<00:04:52.530> bushes

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
have plenty of space so that the bushes

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.530 
have plenty of space so that the bushes
on<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.370> top<00:04:53.580> of<00:04:53.669> the<00:04:53.730> trees<00:04:53.940> don't<00:04:54.120> bump<00:04:54.390> into

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
on the top of the trees don't bump into

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.780 
on the top of the trees don't bump into
each<00:04:54.720> other<00:04:54.840> or<00:04:55.140> whatever<00:04:55.260> but<00:04:56.250> I<00:04:56.310> think<00:04:56.520> that

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
each other or whatever but I think that

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.700 
each other or whatever but I think that
should<00:04:57.120> definitely<00:04:57.750> work<00:04:58.200> for<00:04:58.470> what<00:04:58.590> we're

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
should definitely work for what we're

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.440 
should definitely work for what we're
doing<00:04:58.740> this<00:04:59.250> watermelons<00:04:59.790> are<00:04:59.910> literally<00:05:00.150> on

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
doing this watermelons are literally on

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.030 
doing this watermelons are literally on
any<00:05:00.780> second<00:05:01.410> now<00:05:01.440> they're<00:05:01.650> gonna<00:05:01.770> grow<00:05:02.010> I

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
any second now they're gonna grow I

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.530 
any second now they're gonna grow I
can't<00:05:02.340> wait<00:05:02.460> for<00:05:02.610> that<00:05:02.729> okay<00:05:03.240> I'm<00:05:03.300> gonna<00:05:03.419> go

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
can't wait for that okay I'm gonna go

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.030 
can't wait for that okay I'm gonna go
ahead<00:05:03.570> and<00:05:03.720> grab<00:05:03.930> it<00:05:04.229> seems<00:05:04.560> like<00:05:04.680> it's<00:05:04.830> took

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
ahead and grab it seems like it's took

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.980 
ahead and grab it seems like it's took
them<00:05:05.190> forever<00:05:05.400> like<00:05:06.390> it's<00:05:06.570> just<00:05:06.750> getting

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
them forever like it's just getting

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.409 
them forever like it's just getting
absurd<00:05:07.440> maybe<00:05:07.919> I<00:05:08.070> actually<00:05:08.430> get<00:05:08.790> more<00:05:09.090> seeds

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
absurd maybe I actually get more seeds

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.750 
absurd maybe I actually get more seeds
