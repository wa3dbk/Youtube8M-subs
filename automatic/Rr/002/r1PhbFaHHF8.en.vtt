 let's start cooking for 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.760
 You need to start on the blender manually 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.120
 I do not like to chop cabbage 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.270

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.480
 do by hand the following wonderful 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:01.920
 We cut off thin such 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:06.960
 stripes and began as much as possible 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.299

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:34.440

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:41.700
 From heat now take mince 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:50.030

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.150
 we add the whole thing and we start 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:09.210
 good 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:11.580
 knead our stuffing as much 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.590
 need we add more rice not 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.590
 We could not hurt us a little more and 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:29.190
 we break our two rails continue like this 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:33.120
 Well, well, we mix our farm 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:37.920
 Now let's give him a little insistence 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:44.910
 time is still insisting our stuffing with 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:49.610

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.959
 coarse grater here such our skin and 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.620
 we clean this side soon 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.620
 we won't need it 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.230
 we pour on what on a plate it is possible 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.320
 place here take the breadcrumbs 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.400
 but I prefer grandchildren and do 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:15.200
 follows we will move in the direction of our 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:21.980
 mince take a small amount of mince 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.980
 make such patties from it 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.190
 Form each will have its own as you 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.130
 like and flour in flour 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.910
 that's the way we do with everything 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.370
 our stuffing so many votes 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.600
 we have turned a kilo of minced meat you 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.570
 can get flesh expensive 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.210
 the amount of starting to roast our 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.330
 cabbage set set pan on 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:51.500
 plate light the fire on it, and pour 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.790
 butter wait until our butter gets warm and 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.990
 starting to spread 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.210
 stuffed cabbage rolls are fried until ruddy 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:03.820
 crust then turn on another 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.820
 side and fry until golden brown 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.740
 fry now and the other side in 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:21.520
 in the end we have such here 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.520
 fry her pills our gold 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.780
 then the next batch and so 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:32.420
 principle rebuild further we 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.540
 proceed as follows put cauldron 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:41.410
 at we burn under him fire at him and with him 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:46.340
 take oil like it and deep capacity 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.970
 We put our sour cream there 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.600
 warm up just spread the oil 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.700
 carrot with onions and begin to pass 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:02.110
 meanwhile our sultan we add 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.110
 tomato juice and start it all 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:11.690
 while our vegetables are being passaged we are so 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:16.310
 the way we prepare the sauce which we will 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:20.390
 destroy our cabbage rolls can be 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:22.100
 cook in the oven further everything in 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.170
 kazane stew as we i chose the option 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.700
 Kazan 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.130
 so in my opinion cabbage should 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.020
 get married they baked baked 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.940
 stuffed cabbage and it looks more like some two 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:38.540
 cutlets 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:42.980
 add some salt 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:50.590
 ajita seasoning needs a little bit 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:54.800
 add on dairy hangar principle 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:58.880
 found this idea how normal it is 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:05.110
 roasted we spread one our hacksaw 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.110
 and lay our cabbage rolls on it and 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.800
 we just need them 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:15.710
 the sauce 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:18.560
 Now let's wait for it all to boil 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:23.560
 starts to boil I hope you can see and we 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:28.330
 do the following operation so to speak 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:34.789
 we will take and cover it all with ours 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:38.539
 cabbage leaves remaining now we 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:39.139
 reduce the fire and leave it all 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:42.400
 dry 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:46.479
 thirty to forty minutes cabbage leaf 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:49.639
 stacked on top will create effect 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:51.639
 some pony though we will of course 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:56.240
 covered we don't care 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:07:01.580
 those cabbage rolls that are on top of him 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:03.379
 fell sauce they are much better about stewing 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:09.740
 thanks to the top of the slice tanks 

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:13.159
 well now we cover with a cover we reduce and 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.469
 the path at the very minimum and leave for 

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:22.000
 30 40 minutes well that's all 

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:24.969
 turn off the fire cover and remove 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.419
 cabbage leaves we don't need 

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:31.029
 add land to our lazy cabbage rolls 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:33.110
