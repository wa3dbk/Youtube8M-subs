okay<00:00:01.770> this<00:00:01.979> is<00:00:02.129> my<00:00:02.280> new<00:00:02.310> blade<00:00:02.730> 200<00:00:03.419> SRX

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
okay this is my new blade 200 SRX

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.490 
okay this is my new blade 200 SRX
totally<00:00:04.980> cool<00:00:05.220> helicopter<00:00:06.020> but<00:00:07.020> it<00:00:07.319> is

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
totally cool helicopter but it is

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.759 
totally cool helicopter but it is
incredibly<00:00:08.250> gutless<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.360> lot<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.440> guys<00:00:10.590> are

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
incredibly gutless a lot of guys are

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.560 
incredibly gutless a lot of guys are
having<00:00:11.040> trouble<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.790> know<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.240> fast

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
having trouble you know in a fast

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.450 
having trouble you know in a fast
descent<00:00:13.139> they're<00:00:13.349> not<00:00:13.469> able<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.860> pull<00:00:14.070> out<00:00:14.280> and

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
descent they're not able to pull out and

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.880 
descent they're not able to pull out and
save<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.719> they're<00:00:15.929> just<00:00:16.080> crashing<00:00:16.680> into

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
save it so they're just crashing into

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.170 
save it so they're just crashing into
the<00:00:17.010> ground<00:00:18.199> just<00:00:19.199> for<00:00:19.500> lack<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.710> power<00:00:20.180> I've

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
the ground just for lack of power I've

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.570 
the ground just for lack of power I've
been<00:00:21.359> experimenting<00:00:21.930> with<00:00:22.109> blades<00:00:22.920> different

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
been experimenting with blades different

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.179 
been experimenting with blades different
blades<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.359> solve<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.840> problem<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.949> motor

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
blades to solve this problem the motor

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.839 
blades to solve this problem the motor
actually<00:00:26.640> has<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> lot<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.359> power<00:00:27.769> but<00:00:28.849> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
actually has a lot of power but the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.569 
actually has a lot of power but the
blades<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.390> come<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.990> are<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.800> wimpy<00:00:32.130> that

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
blades that come on it are so wimpy that

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.790 
blades that come on it are so wimpy that
you<00:00:33.360> know<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.540> can't<00:00:33.870> get<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.170> power<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
you know you can't get the power to the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.200 
you know you can't get the power to the
wind<00:00:35.510> I'm<00:00:36.510> experimenting<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.820> v200<00:00:38.820> do<00:00:39.059> 2

while<00:00:39.960> Kara<00:00:40.260> blades<00:00:42.290> where<00:00:43.290> I'm<00:00:43.440> at<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.800> that

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
while Kara blades where I'm at in that

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.010 
while Kara blades where I'm at in that
process<00:00:44.280> right<00:00:44.610> now<00:00:44.760> as<00:00:45.180> I'm<00:00:45.360> cutting<00:00:45.629> three

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
process right now as I'm cutting three

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.340 
process right now as I'm cutting three
quarters<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.410> an<00:00:46.590> inch<00:00:46.710> off<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.190> those<00:00:47.280> blades

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
quarters of an inch off of those blades

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.540 
quarters of an inch off of those blades
because<00:00:49.350> there's<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.620> little<00:00:49.860> too<00:00:50.039> much<00:00:50.219> blade

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
because there's a little too much blade

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.520 
because there's a little too much blade
to<00:00:50.730> begin<00:00:51.030> with

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.010 

it's<00:00:55.530> much<00:00:56.070> better<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.520> think<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:57.030> increase<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
it's much better I think to increase the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.400 
it's much better I think to increase the
blade<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.949> increase<00:00:59.780> head<00:01:00.780> speed<00:01:01.170> which

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
blade that to increase head speed which

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.869 
blade that to increase head speed which
I<00:01:01.559> hear<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> lot<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.160> guys<00:01:02.309> talking<00:01:02.820> about

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
I hear a lot of guys talking about

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.890 
I hear a lot of guys talking about
putting<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.480> 13-2<00:01:04.580> thought<00:01:05.580> which<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.720> head

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
putting a 13-2 thought which is the head

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.990 
putting a 13-2 thought which is the head
speeds<00:01:07.229> already<00:01:07.650> really<00:01:08.040> high<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.520> high<00:01:08.760> head

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
speeds already really high and high head

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.200 
speeds already really high and high head
speed<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:10.350> means<00:01:10.619> massive<00:01:11.189> damage<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.090> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
speed just means massive damage in a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.170 
speed just means massive damage in a
screen<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.869> crash<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.619> I'm<00:01:14.369> not<00:01:14.580> excited<00:01:14.970> about

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
screen it crash so I'm not excited about

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.899 
screen it crash so I'm not excited about
doing<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> t-rex<00:01:16.979> 250

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
doing that I have a t-rex 250

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.270 
doing that I have a t-rex 250
that's<00:01:18.570> really<00:01:19.080> high<00:01:19.380> head<00:01:19.650> speed<00:01:20.009> when<00:01:20.250> it

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
that's really high head speed when it

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.929 
that's really high head speed when it
crashes<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.299> explodes<00:01:21.930> anyway<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.220> I'm

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
crashes it just explodes anyway so I'm

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.880 
crashes it just explodes anyway so I'm
trying<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.630> solve<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> problem<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.799> it

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
trying to solve the problem here and it

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.880 
trying to solve the problem here and it
look<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.189> looking<00:01:26.549> really<00:01:26.820> good<00:01:27.890> using

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
look it's looking really good using

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.940 
look it's looking really good using
these<00:01:29.009> d200<00:01:29.850> blades<00:01:30.229> or<00:01:31.229> v200<00:01:32.070> blades<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.950> in

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
these d200 blades or v200 blades and in

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.109 
these d200 blades or v200 blades and in
this<00:01:35.189> test<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:36.000> am<00:01:36.450> going<00:01:37.200> full<00:01:37.560> throttle<00:01:38.119> as

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
this test I am going full throttle as

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.560 
this test I am going full throttle as
fast<00:01:39.659> as<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.290> get<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.829> off<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.570> it's

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
fast as I can get on and off of it it's

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.080 
fast as I can get on and off of it it's
just<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.200> for<00:01:43.680> an<00:01:43.829> instant<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.549> looks<00:01:44.790> like

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
just on for an instant it looks like

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.780 
just on for an instant it looks like
it's<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.530> quite<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> while<00:01:47.189> or<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.640> I'm

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
it's it's on quite a while or that I'm

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.969 
it's it's on quite a while or that I'm
that<00:01:48.240> I'm<00:01:48.390> kind<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.020> feathering<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:49.860> I'm

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
that I'm kind of feathering it but I'm

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.310 
that I'm kind of feathering it but I'm
not<00:01:50.220> I'm<00:01:50.820> slamming<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.780> full<00:01:52.020> throttle

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
not I'm slamming it to full throttle

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.440 
not I'm slamming it to full throttle
pulling<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.369> back<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:53.820> fast<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.420> possibly

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
pulling it back as fast as I possibly

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.630 
pulling it back as fast as I possibly
can<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:55.560> all<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.310> these<00:01:56.460> tests<00:01:58.250> okay<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.490> is

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
can in all of these tests okay this is

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.190 
can in all of these tests okay this is
going<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> be<00:02:00.030> an<00:02:00.149> attempt<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.600> show<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:00.960> the

going to be an attempt to show you the

do this these blades have three quarters
of<00:04:03.879> an<00:04:04.000> inch<00:04:04.120> exactly<00:04:04.840> cut<00:04:05.080> off<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:06.430> also

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
of an inch exactly cut off you also

of an inch exactly cut off you also
they're<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.420> little<00:04:07.629> thinner<00:04:08.019> so<00:04:08.379> you<00:04:08.440> have<00:04:08.709> to

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
they're a little thinner so you have to

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.650 
they're a little thinner so you have to
have<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.040> 25<00:04:09.640> thousandths

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
have a 25 thousandths

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
that's 0.025 inch spacer underneath them

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.849 
that's 0.025 inch spacer underneath them
that<00:04:15.819> can<00:04:16.060> be<00:04:16.209> a<00:04:16.239> little<00:04:16.510> piece<00:04:16.660> of<00:04:16.720> plastic<00:04:17.049> or

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
that can be a little piece of plastic or

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.960 
that can be a little piece of plastic or
even<00:04:18.790> cardboard<00:04:19.120> anything<00:04:19.900> will<00:04:20.019> work

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
even cardboard anything will work

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.560

I almost get the feeling that time but
I'll<00:05:13.310> get<00:05:13.580> it<00:05:13.699> once<00:05:13.940> more

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600

you can see that it's not blowing the
tail<00:05:19.970> out<00:05:20.270> though<00:05:20.540> that's<00:05:20.840> that's<00:05:21.440> good<00:05:21.710> news
