hoping<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.860> read<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.159> where<00:01:47.430> he<00:01:47.549> sing<00:01:47.759> I

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
hoping to read this where he sing I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.399 
hoping to read this where he sing I
literally<00:01:48.630> have<00:01:48.960> lived<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.380> first<00:01:49.590> page<00:01:49.829> and

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
literally have lived the first page and

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.260 
literally have lived the first page and
for<00:01:52.409> 600<00:01:53.040> billion<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.790> think<00:01:53.909> it's<00:01:54.119> just

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
for 600 billion so I think it's just

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.179 
for 600 billion so I think it's just
going<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.420> be<00:01:54.509> really<00:01:54.750> fun<00:01:54.960> read<00:01:55.140> say<00:01:56.009> it's

afterlife of the first world war the

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.210 
afterlife of the first world war the
club<00:04:16.930> trees<00:04:17.079> in<00:04:17.199> depression<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:19.979> and<00:04:20.979> it's

all<00:04:21.340> about<00:04:21.549> student<00:04:22.360> she<00:04:22.479> has<00:04:22.720> and<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.470> believe

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
all about student she has and I believe

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.439 
all about student she has and I believe
like<00:04:23.979> a<00:04:24.010> romance<00:04:24.490> starts<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.000> it's<00:04:25.090> also<00:04:25.210> not

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
like a romance starts and it's also not

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.270 
like a romance starts and it's also not
on<00:04:25.600> politics<00:04:25.990> and<00:04:26.229> I<00:04:26.650> thought<00:04:27.010> you<00:04:27.100> might<00:04:27.220> be

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
on politics and I thought you might be

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.430 
on politics and I thought you might be
sort<00:04:27.490> of<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:27.940> I'm<00:04:28.720> expected<00:04:29.139> there<00:04:29.229> to<00:04:29.260> be<00:04:29.350> a

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
sort of and I'm expected there to be a

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.700 
sort of and I'm expected there to be a
very<00:04:29.590> slow<00:04:30.100> plodding<00:04:30.610> read<00:04:31.030> and<00:04:31.470> they<00:04:32.470> got

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
very slow plodding read and they got

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.430 
very slow plodding read and they got
really<00:04:33.100> good<00:04:33.220> reviews<00:04:33.990> and<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.080> just<00:04:35.229> think<00:04:35.350> it

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
really good reviews and I just think it

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.390 
really good reviews and I just think it
sounds<00:04:35.770> like<00:04:35.889> a<00:04:36.100> nice<00:04:36.430> a<00:04:36.930> nice<00:04:38.130> small<00:04:39.130> town

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
sounds like a nice a nice small town

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.920 
sounds like a nice a nice small town
drama<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:40.620> somehow<00:04:41.620> like<00:04:42.330> slowly<00:04:43.330> so<00:04:43.750> like

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
drama and somehow like slowly so like

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.240 
drama and somehow like slowly so like
character<00:04:44.350> studies<00:04:44.650> and<00:04:44.889> I<00:04:44.919> think<00:04:45.100> this<00:04:45.190> is

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
character studies and I think this is

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.820 
character studies and I think this is
going<00:04:45.460> to<00:04:45.520> be<00:04:45.669> one<00:04:46.479> of<00:04:46.510> those<00:04:46.750> so<00:04:47.289> I'm<00:04:47.590> really

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
going to be one of those so I'm really

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.960 
going to be one of those so I'm really
excited<00:04:47.919> about<00:04:48.250> that<00:04:48.340> I<00:04:48.490> don't<00:04:48.699> know<00:04:48.820> look

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
excited about that I don't know look

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.730 
excited about that I don't know look
