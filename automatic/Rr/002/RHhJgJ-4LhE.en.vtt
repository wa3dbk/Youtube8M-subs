00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
probably won't even get it in this video

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.200 
probably won't even get it in this video
it's<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.189> it's<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:47.280> I'll<00:01:47.549> post<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.030> video

all like it's like I'll do this video
regularly<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.290> then<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.040> takes<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.579> 30

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
regularly and then if it takes like a 30

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.819 
regularly and then if it takes like a 30
more<00:01:54.329> takes<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.229> then<00:01:55.439> I'll<00:01:55.619> just

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
more takes to do this then I'll just

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.410 
more takes to do this then I'll just
upload<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> half<00:01:57.000> part<00:01:57.299> I'll

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
upload this is like a half part I'll

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.889 
upload this is like a half part I'll
upload<00:01:57.659> both<00:01:57.960> videos<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.469> one<00:01:58.619> day<00:01:58.850> anyway

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
prefer to do the way that it was

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.610 
prefer to do the way that it was
originally<00:03:01.489> intended<00:03:01.819> to<00:03:02.120> do<00:03:02.269> so<00:03:03.080> anyway<00:03:03.290> kill

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
originally intended to do so anyway kill

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.900 
originally intended to do so anyway kill
about<00:03:03.890> 20<00:03:04.310> rates<00:03:05.290> no<00:03:06.290> killers<00:03:07.040> rates<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.610> then

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
about 20 rates no killers rates and then

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.400 
about 20 rates no killers rates and then
the<00:03:08.720> like<00:03:10.000> this<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.239> this<00:03:11.630> is<00:03:11.690> all<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.170> first

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
the like this is this is all the first

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.060 
the like this is this is all the first
phase<00:03:12.709> but<00:03:13.519> now<00:03:14.030> this<00:03:14.390> new<00:03:15.049> thing<00:03:15.650> will<00:03:15.860> begin

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
phase but now this new thing will begin

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.470 
phase but now this new thing will begin
where<00:03:16.250> he's<00:03:16.400> gonna<00:03:16.489> be<00:03:16.610> throwing<00:03:16.910> fireballs

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
where he's gonna be throwing fireballs

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.000 
where he's gonna be throwing fireballs
at<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.750> know<00:03:17.959> there's<00:03:18.140> gonna<00:03:18.260> be<00:03:18.410> a<00:03:18.440> target<00:03:18.890> on

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
at you know there's gonna be a target on

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.770 
at you know there's gonna be a target on
the<00:03:19.100> ground<00:03:19.310> showing<00:03:19.579> where<00:03:20.239> he's<00:03:20.450> gonna<00:03:20.540> be

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
the ground showing where he's gonna be

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.229 
the ground showing where he's gonna be
throwing<00:03:21.079> it<00:03:21.350> but<00:03:22.040> sometimes<00:03:22.790> they'll<00:03:22.940> appear

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
throwing it but sometimes they'll appear

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.050 
throwing it but sometimes they'll appear
in<00:03:23.269> front<00:03:23.600> of<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.739> just<00:03:25.340> watch<00:03:25.549> out<00:03:25.730> the

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
in front of you so just watch out the

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.580 
in front of you so just watch out the
best<00:03:26.209> way<00:03:26.390> to<00:03:26.420> dodge<00:03:26.690> them<00:03:27.019> is<00:03:27.170> with<00:03:27.380> long

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
best way to dodge them is with long

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.120 
best way to dodge them is with long
jumps<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:29.150> he<00:03:29.930> will<00:03:30.079> always<00:03:30.620> throw<00:03:30.799> fireballs

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
jumps and he will always throw fireballs

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.850 
jumps and he will always throw fireballs
and<00:03:31.519> patterns<00:03:31.910> of<00:03:32.060> four<00:03:32.360> so<00:03:33.140> that's<00:03:33.470> something

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
and patterns of four so that's something

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.289 
and patterns of four so that's something
to<00:03:33.950> remember<00:03:34.070> and<00:03:34.579> now<00:03:34.760> he's<00:03:35.000> going<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.239> be

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
to remember and now he's going to be

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.900 
to remember and now he's going to be
doing<00:03:35.600> rates<00:03:36.100> again<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.430> but<00:03:37.549> he's<00:03:37.670> gonna<00:03:37.820> be

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
doing rates again and but he's gonna be

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.600 
doing rates again and but he's gonna be
doing<00:03:38.060> rapes<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:39.280> fireballs<00:03:40.280> I'm<00:03:40.459> actually

this is so hard it's like there's this

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.690 
this is so hard it's like there's this
phase<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:07.380> then<00:05:07.500> there's<00:05:07.680> two<00:05:07.979> more<00:05:08.280> phases

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
phase and then there's two more phases

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.419 
phase and then there's two more phases
after<00:05:09.240> this
