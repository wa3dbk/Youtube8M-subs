00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
need the data but at this point you're

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.570 
need the data but at this point you're
better<00:02:36.990> off<00:02:37.050> trying<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.650> join<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:37.890> family<00:02:38.160> plan

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580
