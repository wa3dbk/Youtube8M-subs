00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
when we first introduced the riser for

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.370 
when we first introduced the riser for
from<00:00:13.350> element<00:00:13.950> technica<00:00:14.340> for<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.820> f3<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.570> got<00:00:16.350> a

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:16.380 
from element technica for the f3 I got a

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.720 
from element technica for the f3 I got a
lot<00:00:16.530> of<00:00:16.560> questions<00:00:16.950> about<00:00:17.040> it<00:00:17.310> thought<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> gay

people have a description but people had
a<00:00:19.350> few<00:00:19.560> questions<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.100> first<00:00:20.310> one<00:00:20.490> was<00:00:20.640> why

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
a few questions the first one was why

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.400 
a few questions the first one was why
you<00:00:20.910> callin<00:00:21.360> a<00:00:21.390> riser<00:00:21.689> what<00:00:22.050> are<00:00:22.110> you<00:00:22.170> rising

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
you callin a riser what are you rising

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.490 
you callin a riser what are you rising
and<00:00:22.860> what<00:00:23.700> are<00:00:23.760> your<00:00:23.820> rising<00:00:24.000> two<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.810> well

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
and what are your rising two and well

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.409 
and what are your rising two and well
and<00:00:26.250> then<00:00:26.400> also<00:00:26.550> what's<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> bottom<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.360> this

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
and then also what's the bottom of this

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:28.999 
and then also what's the bottom of this
thing<00:00:27.630> look<00:00:27.779> like<00:00:27.810> how<00:00:28.140> does<00:00:28.200> it<00:00:28.439> balance<00:00:28.890> how

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
thing look like how does it balance how

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.490 
thing look like how does it balance how
do<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.160> use<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.430> well<00:00:30.000> first<00:00:30.540> off<00:00:30.660> what<00:00:31.380> your

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
do you use it well first off what your

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.900 
do you use it well first off what your
rising<00:00:31.680> is<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> camera<00:00:32.340> you're<00:00:32.490> lifting<00:00:32.640> it

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
rising is the camera you're lifting it

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.979

studio bridge plate system studio bridge

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.500 
studio bridge plate system studio bridge
plate<00:00:52.620> system<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.280> one<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.940> these<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.390> an

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
plate system is one of these this is an

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.529 
plate system is one of these this is an
airy<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:57.660> idea<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:59.539> can

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
airy and the idea is that you can

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.990 
airy and the idea is that you can
balance<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.710> camera<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.309> here<00:01:02.730> when<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.910> have

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
balance the camera on here when you have

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.790 
balance the camera on here when you have
a<00:01:03.059> really<00:01:03.359> big<00:01:03.629> heavy<00:01:03.899> lens<00:01:04.230> or<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.710> have

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
a really big heavy lens or you have

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.920 
a really big heavy lens or you have
other<00:01:04.920> things<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> back<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
other things on the back you have to

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.180 
other things on the back you have to
balance<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.260> out<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.430> big<00:01:08.670> old<00:01:08.880> plate

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
balance it out so this big old plate

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.330 
balance it out so this big old plate
mounts<00:01:11.190> onto<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.670> tripod<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.450> then<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:14.100> have

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
mounts onto the tripod and then you have

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.520 
mounts onto the tripod and then you have
the<00:01:14.729> bridge<00:01:15.030> that's<00:01:15.630> called<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> dovetail

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
the bridge that's called the dovetail

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.530 
the bridge that's called the dovetail
because<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:16.950> sort<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.189> shaped<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.210> doves

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
because it's sort of shaped like a doves

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.069 
because it's sort of shaped like a doves
tail<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.740> see<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> little<00:01:20.549> wings<00:01:21.150> and

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
tail you can see the little wings and

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.109 
tail you can see the little wings and
then<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.829> the<00:01:22.860> bridge<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.700> bridge

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
then this is the bridge and this bridge

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.410 
then this is the bridge and this bridge
plate<00:01:25.130> mounts<00:01:26.130> onto<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.579> bottom<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.030> camera

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
plate mounts onto the bottom of a camera

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.569 
plate mounts onto the bottom of a camera
and<00:01:27.600> then<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.049> have<00:01:28.229> rods<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.040> go<00:01:29.100> into<00:01:29.340> its

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
and then you have rods that go into its

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.249 
and then you have rods that go into its
studio<00:01:29.880> rods<00:01:30.149> which<00:01:30.360> are<00:01:30.479> heavier<00:01:30.750> duty<00:01:31.110> than

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
studio rods which are heavier duty than

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.859 
studio rods which are heavier duty than
light<00:01:31.530> weight<00:01:31.710> rods<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.390> particular<00:01:33.540> one

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
light weight rods in this particular one

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.420 
light weight rods in this particular one
is<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> 15<00:01:34.500> millimeter<00:01:34.770> they<00:01:35.040> also<00:01:35.189> make

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
is for a 15 millimeter they also make

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.039 
is for a 15 millimeter they also make
them<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.700> nineteen<00:01:36.090> millimeter<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> newer

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
them in nineteen millimeter to the newer

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.649 
them in nineteen millimeter to the newer
standard<00:01:37.590> newer<00:01:38.520> tune<00:01:38.880> around<00:01:39.119> for<00:01:39.240> 20<00:01:39.479> years

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
standard newer tune around for 20 years

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.319 
standard newer tune around for 20 years
and<00:01:40.700> this<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.759> what<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> bottom<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
and this is what the bottom of the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.160 
and this is what the bottom of the
camera<00:01:42.509> looks<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:43.189> now<00:01:44.189> these<00:01:44.899> silver<00:01:45.899> spots

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
camera looks like now these silver spots

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.530 
camera looks like now these silver spots
right<00:01:46.350> here<00:01:46.560> that's<00:01:47.009> magnets<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.360> is

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
right here that's magnets and this is

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.389 
right here that's magnets and this is
for<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.899> shoulder<00:01:49.380> pad<00:01:49.590> system<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.219> you<00:01:50.369> can

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
for the shoulder pad system that you can

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.730 
for the shoulder pad system that you can
adjust<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:51.180> took<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.659> off<00:01:51.750> for<00:01:51.990> analysis<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.619> you

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
adjust I took it off for analysis so you

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.200 
adjust I took it off for analysis so you
can<00:01:52.890> see<00:01:53.100> clearly<00:01:53.130> what's<00:01:53.670> going<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.030> down

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
can see clearly what's going on down

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.380 
can see clearly what's going on down
here<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:54.840> pops<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.500> off<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.390> right

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
here it just pops on and off and right

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.899 
here it just pops on and off and right
here<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.899> where<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.530> actually<00:01:58.890> mount<00:01:59.640> a

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
here is where you actually mount a

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.420 
here is where you actually mount a
bridge<00:02:00.539> or<00:02:00.750> however<00:02:01.530> you're<00:02:01.799> going<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.009> mount

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
bridge or however you're going to mount

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.209 
bridge or however you're going to mount
to<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.820> base<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:03.990> two<00:02:04.380> sets<00:02:04.859> of<00:02:04.979> holes

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
to a base so you have two sets of holes

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.310 
to a base so you have two sets of holes
you<00:02:05.579> have<00:02:05.700> two<00:02:06.240> different<00:02:06.570> sets<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.930> holes<00:02:07.109> and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
you have two different sets of holes and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.700 
you have two different sets of holes and
that's<00:02:07.500> because<00:02:07.710> there<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.940> some<00:02:09.869> history<00:02:10.289> to

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
that's because there is some history to

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.670 
that's because there is some history to
traditions<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.940> over<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.780> many<00:02:12.960> decades<00:02:13.440> of

for a studio bridge plate system and

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.009 
for a studio bridge plate system and
that<00:02:44.459> way<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.640> can<00:02:44.819> use<00:02:44.940> big<00:02:45.209> heavy<00:02:45.540> lenses

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
that way you can use big heavy lenses

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.140 
that way you can use big heavy lenses
that<00:02:46.140> need<00:02:46.290> support<00:02:46.739> or<00:02:46.890> large<00:02:47.220> map<00:02:47.610> boxes

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
this little plate comes off and then you

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.280 
this little plate comes off and then you
still<00:03:21.060> have<00:03:21.090> these<00:03:21.360> holes<00:03:21.630> underneath<00:03:21.989> and

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
that height standard so you can look one

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.970 
that height standard so you can look one
here<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.180> can<00:03:33.329> see<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:34.019> different<00:03:34.530> sets<00:03:34.859> of

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
here you can see the different sets of

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.160 
here you can see the different sets of
holes<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.579> they<00:03:35.880> actually<00:03:36.180> put<00:03:36.359> extra<00:03:36.810> sets

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
holes and they actually put extra sets

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.960 
holes and they actually put extra sets
of<00:03:37.290> holes<00:03:37.470> in<00:03:37.680> there<00:03:37.829> just<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.760> have

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
of holes in there just so you have

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.020 
of holes in there just so you have
options<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.600> that<00:03:40.139> mounts<00:03:41.040> right<00:03:41.220> on<00:03:41.700> here

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
options and that mounts right on here

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.599 
options and that mounts right on here
again<00:03:42.299> you<00:03:42.480> go<00:03:42.630> into<00:03:42.959> those<00:03:43.109> holes<00:03:43.829> it<00:03:44.250> mounts

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
again you go into those holes it mounts

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.390 
again you go into those holes it mounts
up<00:03:44.989> tie<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.139> all<00:03:46.319> in<00:03:46.440> place<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.889> now<00:03:47.190> you're

up tie that all in place and now you're

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.360 
up tie that all in place and now you're

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
kind of do it it upside down but it goes

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.830 
kind of do it it upside down but it goes
right<00:04:23.070> in<00:04:23.190> there<00:04:23.280> you<00:04:23.400> tighten<00:04:23.820> those<00:04:23.880> up<00:04:23.940> no

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
right in there you tighten those up no

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.060 
right in there you tighten those up no
problem<00:04:25.289> if<00:04:25.410> you<00:04:25.830> have<00:04:26.099> a<00:04:26.340> small<00:04:27.120> tripod<00:04:28.070> it

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
problem if you have a small tripod it

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.620 
problem if you have a small tripod it
would<00:04:29.370> have<00:04:29.580> a<00:04:29.610> plate<00:04:29.909> probably<00:04:30.300> around<00:04:30.450> this

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
would have a plate probably around this

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.439 
would have a plate probably around this
size<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.500> you

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
size and you

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.629 
size and you
can<00:04:32.539> take<00:04:32.719> those<00:04:33.050> and<00:04:33.529> you<00:04:34.099> can<00:04:34.249> get<00:04:34.400> them<00:04:34.550> in

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
can take those and you can get them in

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.640 
can take those and you can get them in
there<00:04:34.789> now<00:04:34.969> if<00:04:35.330> you<00:04:35.479> have<00:04:35.689> a<00:04:35.719> plate<00:04:36.050> like<00:04:36.620> this

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
there now if you have a plate like this

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.149 
there now if you have a plate like this
one<00:04:37.219> this<00:04:38.090> particular<00:04:38.360> one<00:04:38.749> uses<00:04:39.349> three

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:40.159 
one this particular one uses three

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.360 
one this particular one uses three
eighths<00:04:40.340> and<00:04:40.520> quarter<00:04:40.969> twenty<00:04:41.330> now<00:04:41.449> the

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
eighths and quarter twenty now the

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.920 
eighths and quarter twenty now the
studio<00:04:43.370> configurations<00:04:44.270> of<00:04:44.389> the<00:04:44.509> world<00:04:44.689> all

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
studio configurations of the world all

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.629 
studio configurations of the world all
use<00:04:45.499> three<00:04:45.860> eighths<00:04:46.009> and<00:04:46.189> so<00:04:46.339> these<00:04:46.490> are

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
use three eighths and so these are

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.459 
use three eighths and so these are
larger<00:04:46.999> holes<00:04:47.210> but<00:04:47.779> you<00:04:47.870> can<00:04:48.020> get<00:04:48.169> a<00:04:48.229> little

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:48.469 
larger holes but you can get a little

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:51.790 
larger holes but you can get a little
bushing<00:04:49.159> like<00:04:49.699> this<00:04:50.029> a<00:04:50.059> little<00:04:50.479> insert<00:04:51.289> that

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
bushing like this a little insert that

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.019 
bushing like this a little insert that
is<00:04:52.039> three-eighths<00:04:52.430> on<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.669> outside<00:04:52.939> and

is three-eighths on the outside and

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:54.339 
is three-eighths on the outside and
quarter<00:04:53.240> 20<00:04:53.479> on<00:04:53.569> the<00:04:53.599> inside<00:04:53.689> and<00:04:54.169> you<00:04:54.229> can

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
quarter 20 on the inside and you can

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.260 
quarter 20 on the inside and you can
just<00:04:54.469> screw<00:04:54.740> that<00:04:54.860> in<00:04:55.039> there<00:04:55.219> and<00:04:56.120> then<00:04:56.210> you

a little screw right down and now you

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.420 
a little screw right down and now you
have<00:05:02.689> a<00:05:02.900> plate<00:05:03.199> that<00:05:03.229> can<00:05:03.529> go<00:05:03.650> directly<00:05:04.009> on

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
have a plate that can go directly on

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.670 
have a plate that can go directly on
your<00:05:04.550> tripod<00:05:04.939> even<00:05:05.689> all<00:05:05.900> the<00:05:05.960> little<00:05:06.229> tripod

heads have some adjustment just like

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.920 
heads have some adjustment just like
this<00:05:09.499> Bell<00:05:10.400> kale<00:05:10.699> type<00:05:10.939> system<00:05:11.330> you<00:05:11.509> can<00:05:11.659> slide

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
this Bell kale type system you can slide

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.659 
this Bell kale type system you can slide
stuff<00:05:12.289> back<00:05:12.469> and<00:05:12.499> forth<00:05:12.860> on<00:05:13.009> it<00:05:13.069> the<00:05:13.339> balance

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
stuff back and forth on it the balance

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.300 
stuff back and forth on it the balance
you<00:05:13.969> have<00:05:13.999> some<00:05:14.509> range<00:05:15.169> of<00:05:15.349> adjustment<00:05:15.740> so<00:05:16.249> you

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
you have some range of adjustment so you

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.890 
you have some range of adjustment so you
can<00:05:16.520> get<00:05:16.699> this<00:05:16.969> to<00:05:17.270> your<00:05:17.389> center<00:05:17.779> of<00:05:17.810> gravity

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
can get this to your center of gravity

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.089 
can get this to your center of gravity
and<00:05:18.439> then<00:05:19.129> you<00:05:19.370> are<00:05:19.610> balanced<00:05:20.300> on<00:05:20.479> your<00:05:20.629> tripod
