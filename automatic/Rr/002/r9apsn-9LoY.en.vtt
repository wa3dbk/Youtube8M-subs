00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.880
I put these 3 blocks together and it becomes a bread~

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.678
we say 「pan」in japanese,which means bread~

00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:45.775

I made a house

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.580
we say 「ouchi」in japanese ,which means「house」

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.440
a lovely dog~

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.100
we say 「inu」in japanese,which means 「dog」

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.280

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.660
what's this?

00:01:17.397 --> 00:01:21.097
it has tyres and it can run~

00:01:24.154 --> 00:01:27.734
this is a car~we say 「kuruma」in japanese,which means「car」

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.240
「car~this is a car」

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.220

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.480
Here we have 4 different kinds of shapes

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
how should we say in English?

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.280
this is star,in japanese we say「hoshi」

00:01:55.036 --> 00:01:57.036

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.940
star

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.740
how about this?

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.340
this is a circle

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.060

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.240

00:02:16.468 --> 00:02:18.468
it's triangle

00:02:19.313 --> 00:02:21.313
we say 「sannkaku」in japanese though~

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.020

00:02:30.194 --> 00:02:32.194

we can see 「to」and「from」written here

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.963

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.320
「to」means towards sth

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.300
for example,「to Anpanman」

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.160
「from」 means where sth/sb starts

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.220
so,if Baikinman send a mail to Anpanman

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.140
we say,「to Anpanman,from Bikinman」

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.300

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.500
