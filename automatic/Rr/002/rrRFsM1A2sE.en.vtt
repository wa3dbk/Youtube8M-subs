00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
is changing and there we go and number

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.480 
is changing and there we go and number
three

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.719 

numero<00:02:05.490> dos<00:02:07.040> I'm<00:02:08.040> not<00:02:08.220> too<00:02:08.340> sure<00:02:08.520> if<00:02:08.550> this

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
numero dos I'm not too sure if this

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.580 
numero dos I'm not too sure if this
one's<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> benefit<00:02:09.420> for<00:02:09.600> image<00:02:09.900> but<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.140> mean<00:02:10.440> it

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
one's a benefit for image but I mean it

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.800 
one's a benefit for image but I mean it
could<00:02:10.710> definitely<00:02:11.100> pass<00:02:11.670> for<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.780> i

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
could definitely pass for it so i

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.800 
could definitely pass for it so i
thought<00:02:13.050> i'd<00:02:13.260> throw<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:13.710> there<00:02:13.860> anyway<00:02:14.190> and

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
thought i'd throw it in there anyway and

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.720 
thought i'd throw it in there anyway and
a<00:02:15.810> numero<00:02:16.290> uno<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.980> like<00:02:20.130> i<00:02:20.250> said<00:02:20.280> i'll<00:02:20.610> be

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
a numero uno so like i said i'll be

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.400 
a numero uno so like i said i'll be
adding<00:02:20.850> more<00:02:21.030> backgrounds<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:21.960> as<00:02:22.140> time

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
adding more backgrounds in as time

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.150 
adding more backgrounds in as time
passes<00:02:22.680> through<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.670> through<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:25.920> give<00:02:26.070> you

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
passes through and through to give you

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.530 
passes through and through to give you
guys<00:02:26.310> more<00:02:26.520> options<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.090> everything<00:02:27.420> like

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
guys more options and everything like

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.250 
guys more options and everything like
that<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.780> i<00:02:27.930> also<00:02:28.490> included<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.670> logo<00:02:30.540> which

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
that and i also included a logo which

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.440 
that and i also included a logo which
pretty<00:02:31.530> much<00:02:31.620> says<00:02:31.980> battle<00:02:32.280> fit<00:02:32.430> for<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.300> if<00:02:33.390> we

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
pretty much says battle fit for so if we

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.280 
pretty much says battle fit for so if we
go<00:02:33.570> ahead<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.810> look<00:02:33.870> at<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.050> large

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
go ahead and look at the large

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.750 
go ahead and look at the large
selections<00:02:34.950> you'll<00:02:35.130> have<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.310> better<00:02:35.460> fit<00:02:35.730> for

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
selections you'll have a better fit for

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.270 
selections you'll have a better fit for
logo<00:02:36.180> original<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:37.440> will<00:02:37.590> be<00:02:38.360> style<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.630> all

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
logo original that will be style and all

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.950 
logo original that will be style and all
so<00:02:41.280> that's<00:02:41.880> what<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.120> would<00:02:42.420> look<00:02:42.450> like<00:02:42.600> and

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
so that's what that would look like and

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.930 
so that's what that would look like and
then<00:02:42.990> you<00:02:43.110> also<00:02:43.260> have<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.560> white<00:02:43.860> version<00:02:44.100> it'll

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
then you also have a white version it'll

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.260 
then you also have a white version it'll
be<00:02:45.030> no<00:02:45.240> style<00:02:45.630> just<00:02:46.500> plain<00:02:46.770> white<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.730> we<00:02:48.240> also

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
be no style just plain white and we also

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.530 
be no style just plain white and we also
have<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:48.870> with<00:02:49.140> black<00:02:49.740> so<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.610> have<00:02:51.240> three

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
have that with black so you have three

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.690 
have that with black so you have three
options<00:02:51.570> within<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.290> logo<00:02:52.710> and<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.460> have

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
not to do left because you know not a

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.760 
not to do left because you know not a

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
lot of stuff lines with the left and if

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.340 
lot of stuff lines with the left and if
you<00:03:28.890> do<00:03:29.010> bottom<00:03:29.400> left<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:29.850> just<00:03:30.030> kind<00:03:30.270> of<00:03:30.350> it's

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
you do bottom left it just kind of it's

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.020 
you do bottom left it just kind of it's
hitting<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.770> little<00:03:31.920> bit<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.580> thought<00:03:32.790> I'd

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
hitting a little bit so I thought I'd

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.570 
hitting a little bit so I thought I'd
just<00:03:33.060> stick<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.810> right<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.739> if<00:03:35.400> we<00:03:35.489> go

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
just stick it to the right and if we go

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.530 
just stick it to the right and if we go
ahead<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.760> take<00:03:35.880> a<00:03:35.940> look<00:03:36.090> at<00:03:36.239> one<00:03:36.360> of<00:03:36.390> these

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
ahead and take a look at one of these

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.710 
ahead and take a look at one of these
options<00:03:37.020> you'll<00:03:37.200> have<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.709> large<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.610> a<00:03:38.670> medium

within<00:03:39.720> each<00:03:39.959> one<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.290> these<00:03:40.500> text<00:03:40.980> options<00:03:41.370> so

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
within each one of these text options so

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:42.770 
within each one of these text options so
let's<00:03:42.030> go<00:03:42.090> ahead<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.239> take<00:03:42.330> a<00:03:42.420> look<00:03:42.600> at<00:03:42.690> the

let's go ahead and take a look at the
size<00:03:42.989> differences<00:03:43.620> here<00:03:43.830> so<00:03:44.660> under<00:03:45.660> top<00:03:46.080> there

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
size differences here so under top there
