enough for me to counter spell and if i
get<00:01:24.330> 2<00:01:24.450> 3<00:01:24.659> i'll<00:01:24.810> be<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> pretty<00:01:25.110> good

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
get 2 3 i'll be in a pretty good

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.899 
get 2 3 i'll be in a pretty good
position<00:01:25.680> because<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.280> i<00:01:26.340> could<00:01:26.369> dream<00:01:26.670> that

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
position because then i could dream that

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.880 
position because then i could dream that
extra<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.960> thing<00:01:28.140> most<00:01:28.259> people<00:01:28.380> might<00:01:28.740> do

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
extra one thing most people might do

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.560 
extra one thing most people might do
right<00:01:29.070> away<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:29.759> chump<00:01:30.180> block<00:01:30.390> this

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
right away it's just chump block this

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.999 
right away it's just chump block this
thing<00:01:30.720> when<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.930> taxes<00:01:31.259> can<00:01:31.350> attack<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:31.770> four

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
thing when it taxes can attack for four

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.950 
thing when it taxes can attack for four
there's<00:01:32.460> no<00:01:32.729> reason<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.119> chump<00:01:33.390> block<00:01:33.630> early

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
there's no reason to chump block early

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.569 
there's no reason to chump block early
in<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> game<00:01:34.259> for<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.470> couple<00:01:34.710> reasons<00:01:34.740> one<00:01:35.280> is

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.249 
in the game for a couple reasons one is
because<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.509> never<00:01:36.630> know<00:01:36.780> what<00:01:37.020> he's<00:01:37.200> gonna

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
because you never know what he's gonna

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.840 
because you never know what he's gonna
play<00:01:37.560> next<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:38.040> for<00:01:38.220> all<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.340> know<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
play next like for all I know the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.249 
play next like for all I know the
creatures<00:01:39.240> didn't<00:01:39.450> play<00:01:39.540> next<00:01:39.780> turn<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.079> way

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
creatures didn't play next turn is way

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.170 
creatures didn't play next turn is way
scarier<00:01:40.320> than<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.860> 1i<00:01:41.280> lights<00:01:41.490> chump<00:01:42.000> block

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
scarier than this 1i lights chump block

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.510 
scarier than this 1i lights chump block
them<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:43.079> jump<00:01:43.259> like<00:01:43.409> now<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.590> prevent<00:01:44.189> only

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
them but jump like now I prevent only

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.280 
them but jump like now I prevent only
for<00:01:44.790> damage<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.270> rest<00:01:45.479> its<00:01:45.659> game<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.079> take

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
for damage to the rest its game I take

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.200 
for damage to the rest its game I take
extra<00:01:46.590> damage<00:01:46.799> but<00:01:47.430> if<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.520> chump<00:01:47.790> block<00:01:47.970> later

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
extra damage but if I chump block later

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.910 
extra damage but if I chump block later
maybe<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.840> thing's<00:01:48.990> at<00:01:49.110> 88<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> could

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
maybe this thing's at 88 and I could

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.880 
maybe this thing's at 88 and I could
prevent<00:01:50.189> 8

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
prevent 8

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.130

end of the game I'm just gonna play this
guy<00:05:00.639> to<00:05:00.699> let<00:05:00.850> though<00:05:01.000> I<00:05:01.030> had<00:05:01.270> it<00:05:01.419> GG<00:05:02.100> and<00:05:03.100> that's

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
guy to let though I had it GG and that's

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.400 
guy to let though I had it GG and that's
pretty<00:05:03.490> much<00:05:03.639> it<00:05:03.760> games<00:05:04.540> over<00:05:04.750> so<00:05:05.110> I<00:05:05.139> think

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
pretty much it games over so I think

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.710 
pretty much it games over so I think
this<00:05:05.500> is<00:05:05.560> well<00:05:05.770> played<00:05:06.070> I<00:05:06.310> think<00:05:06.970> again<00:05:07.389> art

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
this is well played I think again art

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.689 
this is well played I think again art
weeks<00:05:08.020> I<00:05:08.139> need<00:05:08.290> to<00:05:08.410> do<00:05:08.560> here<00:05:08.919> and<00:05:09.130> I<00:05:09.310> maybe<00:05:09.520> I

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
weeks I need to do here and I maybe I

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.219 
weeks I need to do here and I maybe I
should<00:05:09.940> move<00:05:10.180> this<00:05:10.419> over<00:05:10.630> to<00:05:10.780> be<00:05:10.930> more<00:05:11.110> of<00:05:11.169> a

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
should move this over to be more of a

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.140 
should move this over to be more of a
turbo<00:05:11.650> deck<00:05:11.889> instead<00:05:12.190> of<00:05:12.310> stall<00:05:12.550> deck<00:05:12.820> because

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
turbo deck instead of stall deck because

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.520 
turbo deck instead of stall deck because
I<00:05:13.360> don't<00:05:13.720> really<00:05:13.810> think<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:14.080> stall<00:05:14.290> really

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
I don't really think the stall really

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.659 
I don't really think the stall really
works<00:05:14.800> I<00:05:14.979> think<00:05:15.130> it's<00:05:15.220> probably<00:05:15.310> better<00:05:15.550> to

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
works I think it's probably better to

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.219 
works I think it's probably better to
chime<00:05:16.120> mill<00:05:16.389> as<00:05:16.570> fast<00:05:16.810> as<00:05:17.020> possible<00:05:17.310> but<00:05:18.310> um<00:05:18.520> I

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
chime mill as fast as possible but um I

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.719 
chime mill as fast as possible but um I
