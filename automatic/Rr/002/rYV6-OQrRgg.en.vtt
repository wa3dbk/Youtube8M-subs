always<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.580> get<00:00:56.760> easy<00:00:57.170> it's<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.380> to<00:00:58.440> take<00:00:58.620> a

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
always you get easy it's going to take a

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.600 
always you get easy it's going to take a
while<00:00:58.980> probably<00:00:59.790> 5<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.980> 10<00:01:01.980> minutes<00:01:02.310> about

while probably 5 to 10 minutes about
that<00:01:02.820> time<00:01:04.729> but<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.939> would<00:01:06.149> only<00:01:06.329> work<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:07.079> a

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:07.109 
that time but this would only work for a

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:19.489 
that time but this would only work for a
pearl<00:01:07.439> or<00:01:07.829> diamond<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.549> platinum<00:01:18.109> so<00:01:19.109> you're

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:19.499 
pearl or diamond and platinum so you're

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:27.210 
pearl or diamond and platinum so you're
just<00:01:19.679> gonna<00:01:20.689> go

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.840 

so<00:01:28.220> there's<00:01:29.150> easy<00:01:29.740> I'm<00:01:30.740> not<00:01:31.220> gonna<00:01:31.370> catch<00:01:31.640> I

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
so there's easy I'm not gonna catch I

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.580 
so there's easy I'm not gonna catch I
already<00:01:32.180> have<00:01:32.330> a<00:01:32.360> lot<00:01:32.570> of<00:01:32.600> V's<00:01:33.080> from<00:01:33.380> this

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
already have a lot of V's from this

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.420 
already have a lot of V's from this
strategy<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:34.990> I<00:01:35.990> always<00:01:36.410> go<00:01:36.740> with<00:01:36.860> my<00:01:36.920> gabite

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
strategy and I always go with my gabite

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.520 
strategy and I always go with my gabite
and<00:01:38.710> I<00:01:39.710> have<00:01:40.160> my<00:01:40.310> whole<00:01:40.610> team<00:01:40.880> it's<00:01:41.440> so<00:01:42.440> I'm

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
and I have my whole team it's so I'm

00:01:42.530 --> 00:02:01.070 
and I have my whole team it's so I'm
just<00:01:42.710> gonna<00:01:42.830> kill<00:01:43.070> it

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.410 

so<00:02:02.080> I<00:02:02.110> think<00:02:02.410> the<00:02:02.830> way<00:02:02.980> they<00:02:03.160> put<00:02:03.550> it<00:02:03.700> on<00:02:03.880> sets

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
so I think the way they put it on sets

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.130 
so I think the way they put it on sets
no<00:02:04.720> point<00:02:05.020> um<00:02:05.830> city<00:02:06.400> because<00:02:06.850> Evie<00:02:07.780> is<00:02:07.900> like<00:02:08.110> a

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
no point um city because Evie is like a

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.770 
no point um city because Evie is like a
dog<00:02:08.530> or<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:08.979> cat<00:02:09.190> or<00:02:09.550> something<00:02:09.580> like<00:02:10.240> an<00:02:10.390> animal

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
dog or a cat or something like an animal

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.880 
dog or a cat or something like an animal
and<00:02:10.930> it's<00:02:11.080> free<00:02:11.350> so<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:12.760> could<00:02:12.940> live<00:02:13.120> there<00:02:13.890> so

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
and it's free so it could live there so

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.170 
and it's free so it could live there so
that's<00:02:15.790> how<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.000> get<00:02:16.210> Evie<00:02:16.660> by
