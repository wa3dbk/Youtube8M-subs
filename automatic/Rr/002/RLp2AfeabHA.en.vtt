00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.370
 other lighthouses of the boy who sews sephora 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.280
 thing and we end up 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.440
 in voiceover right away 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.359
 so here we are again in voiceover 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.660
 so as you can see I'm doing 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:01.070
 my eyebrows always with the same 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.530
 pencil from dior that I have you 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.960
 presented in my routine a after 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.630
 I chained with the eyelids I use 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.820
 my nars base which is quite known 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.530
 here and then I leave so between 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.830
 quotation marks I end up talent on the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:21.050
 eyelid with the finger where I come 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.940
 take my duo fiber from mac 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.890
 brush fades hours as you can 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.110
 see it and I take the color 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.690
 tie naked three stories of 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.640
 chestnuts not been pretty beautiful I 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.350
 find and I just put it on top 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.780
 of my eyelid hollow actually for 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.430
 bring it back after just a little bit 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.380
 in the stone warehouse and go down 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.880
 down in the outer corner of the eye 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.160
 to make a vision of a cat's eye 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.620
 and I really think that sam has grown up 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.970
 the eye and after I go dimmed with a 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.970
 paintbrush from sephora 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.820
 so after I resume my duo son of 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.560
 at mac and I take the color factory 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.390
 which is right next to that of linking 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.310
 in the naked 3 a kind of chestnuts 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.929
 darker actually and you see I the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.670
 put in the outer corner and I come 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.799
 after blurring that with my brush 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.190
 fades hours from sephora as 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.989
 previously with the color bind well 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.650
 sure i'm doing exactly the same thing on 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.180
 the winch 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.530
 frankly the keys to this makeup 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.709
 that's of course good and this pump and 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.870
 like all makeup but especially the 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.880
 to put the color bind a little to 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.590
 above the eyelid hollow I do not know 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.060
 I think it's something 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.280
 tell me in the comments if you 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:35.299
 find also or not at all I find 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:36.799
 that sam grew up the eye after having 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.690
 worked my kopierre crew well 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.660
 dimmed and so on I just apply the 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.640
 strange color is a kind of white 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.459
 matte as you can see I 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.049
 applied on the entire eyelid 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.450
 and I just apply that same color 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:55.970
 under the eyebrows and in the inner corner of 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.620
 the eye to illuminate and I come 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.359
 take my god over at home max 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.069
 matter of super happy and I come 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:05.389
 just fruity the edges for that to make 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.069
 a kind of degrade after I return 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.720
 but if not, I'm doing it 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.859
 really not everyday and I you 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.040
 advises against doing it all 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:14.569
 Sabine enormously days lashes here

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.069
 short curse of course if it were necessary that 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.900

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.150

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.390
 after I resume the color factory that 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.920
 I applied in the outer corner of the eye 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.170
 and I come to apply it if I 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.440

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.470
 slightly mascara on the eyelashes of the 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.330
 low 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.220
 so of course before starting this 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.350
 video I had done my time I had 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.060

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.110
