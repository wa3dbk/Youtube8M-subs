00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
to make the new item as well as what it

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.110 

people<00:00:50.800> say<00:00:50.980> that<00:00:51.250> there's<00:00:51.580> not<00:00:51.700> enough<00:00:51.970> to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
people say that there's not enough to

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.060 
people say that there's not enough to
feed<00:00:52.330> the<00:00:52.480> world<00:00:52.660> that<00:00:53.200> there's<00:00:53.410> a<00:00:53.500> scarcity

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
feed the world that there's a scarcity

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.770 
feed the world that there's a scarcity
of<00:00:54.310> resources<00:00:54.940> and<00:00:55.000> that's<00:00:55.150> why<00:00:55.330> we<00:00:55.480> have<00:00:55.630> the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
of resources and that's why we have the

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.780 
of resources and that's why we have the
economy<00:00:56.230> but<00:00:56.440> really<00:00:56.860> there's<00:00:57.220> more<00:00:57.460> than<00:00:57.610> our

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
economy but really there's more than our

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.600 
economy but really there's more than our
food<00:00:58.090> to<00:00:58.390> feed<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:59.170> world<00:00:59.200> over<00:01:00.070> as<00:01:00.250> you<00:01:00.460> can

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
food to feed the world over as you can

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.310 
food to feed the world over as you can
see<00:01:00.790> by<00:01:00.970> just<00:01:01.000> one<00:01:01.390> or<00:01:01.480> two<00:01:01.510> bins<00:01:01.870> it's<00:01:02.140> just

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
see by just one or two bins it's just

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.079 
see by just one or two bins it's just
overloaded<00:01:02.800> with<00:01:03.040> food<00:01:03.280> that's<00:01:03.580> being<00:01:03.850> wasted

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
overloaded with food that's being wasted

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.410 
overloaded with food that's being wasted
the<00:01:04.540> fruit<00:01:04.989> veg<00:01:05.290> would<00:01:05.680> have<00:01:05.800> come<00:01:06.010> from

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the fruit veg would have come from

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.850 
the fruit veg would have come from
developing<00:01:07.420> countries<00:01:07.840> and<00:01:08.110> being<00:01:08.380> shipped

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
developing countries and being shipped

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:25.819 
developing countries and being shipped
here<00:01:09.160> and<00:01:09.310> then<00:01:09.430> just<00:01:09.700> thrown<00:01:10.060> out<00:01:10.300> it's<00:01:10.810> crazy

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.889 

so<00:01:26.829> it<00:01:26.920> does<00:01:27.070> take<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.310> bit<00:01:27.520> more<00:01:27.640> effort<00:01:27.789> to<00:01:28.210> get

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
so it does take a bit more effort to get

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.209 
so it does take a bit more effort to get
something<00:01:29.200> out<00:01:29.289> of<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.469> bin<00:01:29.649> and<00:01:29.770> clean<00:01:30.070> it

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
something out of the bin and clean it

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.039 
something out of the bin and clean it
and<00:01:30.399> prepare<00:01:31.000> it<00:01:31.030> so<00:01:31.630> it's<00:01:31.780> much<00:01:31.899> more

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
and prepare it so it's much more

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.240 
and prepare it so it's much more
convenient<00:01:32.409> to<00:01:32.619> just<00:01:32.799> go<00:01:32.920> down<00:01:33.069> to<00:01:33.189> your

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
convenient to just go down to your

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.130 
convenient to just go down to your
supermarket<00:01:33.549> and<00:01:33.969> buy<00:01:34.179> what<00:01:34.359> you<00:01:34.450> want<00:01:34.479> take

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
supermarket and buy what you want take

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.649 
supermarket and buy what you want take
it<00:01:35.259> home<00:01:35.439> all<00:01:35.649> clean<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:35.950> packed<00:01:36.429> but<00:01:37.270> that's

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
it home all clean and packed but that's

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.180 
it home all clean and packed but that's
the<00:01:37.869> problem

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.360 

I<00:01:44.500> haven't<00:01:45.500> been<00:01:45.650> a<00:01:45.680> freegan<00:01:45.890> all<00:01:46.070> my<00:01:46.190> life

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
I haven't been a freegan all my life

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.010 
I haven't been a freegan all my life
it's<00:01:46.610> something<00:01:46.790> that's<00:01:47.090> evolved<00:01:47.600> in<00:01:47.690> my<00:01:47.810> life

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
it's something that's evolved in my life

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.080 
it's something that's evolved in my life
I<00:01:48.200> think<00:01:48.260> I<00:01:48.650> think<00:01:49.310> it's<00:01:49.430> interesting<00:01:49.670> in<00:01:49.970> our

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
I think I think it's interesting in our

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.630 
I think I think it's interesting in our
community<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.750> one<00:01:50.930> thing<00:01:51.200> that<00:01:51.350> unites<00:01:51.680> most

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
community the one thing that unites most

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.330 
community the one thing that unites most
of<00:01:52.820> us<00:01:52.940> in<00:01:53.120> terms<00:01:53.450> of<00:01:53.690> our<00:01:54.110> backgrounds<00:01:54.740> is

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
of us in terms of our backgrounds is

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.480 
of us in terms of our backgrounds is
that<00:01:55.580> our<00:01:55.700> parents<00:01:56.180> all<00:01:56.630> taught<00:01:57.020> us<00:01:57.200> not<00:01:58.190> to<00:01:58.250> be

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
that our parents all taught us not to be

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.050 
that our parents all taught us not to be
wasteful<00:01:58.940> to<00:01:59.810> be<00:01:59.930> resourceful<00:02:00.730> it's<00:02:01.730> nothing

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
wasteful to be resourceful it's nothing

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.230 
wasteful to be resourceful it's nothing
that's<00:02:02.180> significant<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:04.790> reason<00:02:05.150> that

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
that's significant the reason that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.720 
that's significant the reason that
there's<00:02:05.480> so<00:02:05.630> much<00:02:05.750> waste<00:02:06.110> is<00:02:06.830> because<00:02:07.250> we're

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
there's so much waste is because we're

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.850 
there's so much waste is because we're
just<00:02:07.760> incredibly<00:02:08.479> rich<00:02:08.720> we've<00:02:09.229> forgotten<00:02:09.680> the

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
just incredibly rich we've forgotten the

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:21.119 
just incredibly rich we've forgotten the
value<00:02:10.220> of<00:02:10.460> everything

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.709 

wasting<00:02:22.129> food<00:02:22.370> is<00:02:22.519> like<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.760> crime<00:02:23.120> crime

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:23.719 
wasting food is like a crime crime

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:28.000 
wasting food is like a crime crime
against<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.500> planet<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:25.040> humanity<00:02:25.370> really
