random I or mods is basically a block

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.590 
random I or mods is basically a block
they<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.160> find<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> sides<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.359> mountains

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
you would find you know any of this

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.320 
you would find you know any of this
stuff<00:01:10.310> like<00:01:11.310> if<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.549> find<00:01:11.760> call<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> south

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
side of mountains then you probably got

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.999 
side of mountains then you probably got
to<00:01:14.400> find<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.670> random<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.150> tall<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.920> when<00:01:16.920> you
