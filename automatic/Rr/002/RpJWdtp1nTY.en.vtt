00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.889
 hi guys i'm silvia and you can 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.679
 deduce that I am here to talk about 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.210
 jurisprudence and then what to say first 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.900
 I would like to dispel some myths of everything 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.460
 on the jurisprudence on this faculty 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.289
 then understanding is not a faculty that 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.359
 only prepares for the profession 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.650
 lawyer so I would like to dispel this 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.960
 myth and I would advise you to do 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.540
 this faculty if you are passionate not 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.930
 only to the right in itself but also 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.540
 to current politics and why not 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.200
 also to the most humanistic sciences at the 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.030
 philosophy the story because I think the 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.660
 his faculty is beautiful 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:55.070
 be non-sectoral what maybe 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:58.390
 may not seem at first glance me 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.180
 at the beginning I was perhaps afraid 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.280
 excessively specific that it went 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.450
 face each other only on the right but 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:14.870
 according to me this is not because from da 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:18.680
 possibility of being able to face the 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:22.700
 world second point that I would like to put 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:28.160
 in light is the fact that it is not a faculty 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:31.570
 purely it is only Italian with quo 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.310
 it may seem like it can be passed is 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.590
 essential as for now for all 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.050
 faculty to have knowledge of languages 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.800
 and essentially English 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.340
 basic also because the cuts in Italy 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.770
 being part of the European union 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.670
 being neither part it suffers the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.950
 consequences 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.990
 this means the right 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:59.810
 national is slowly falling apart and 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.900
 in place of law and in place we say 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.210
 of national law is taking the 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.620
 upper hand supranational right il 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.500
 European Union law 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.780
 that's why a knowledge not only 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.310
 of Italy a knowledge not 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.250
 only cultural of Italy 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.990
 technical knowledge of Italy but also 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.550
 therefore, a wider waste spectrum 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.100
 expect European is also true that 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.560
 will draw that job prospects 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.980
 may be limited limited 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.720
 at least to the ordinances visible in 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.970
 a common law as can be 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.610
 america or how can it be the great one 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.670
 Brittany is true but up to a certain point 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.600
 because slowly these two orders 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.290
 they are getting closer and 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:52.160
 formal differences can be up to 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.920
 at a certain point valid what you will learn 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.270
 in the study of jurisprudence will be 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:03.170
 the substance therefore equality 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:06.980
 substantial what is going to protect or 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.800
 less and this can be done either with 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.570
 through these typical tones of the 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.970
 sort the hiss both through 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.970
 hundreds and hundreds of sentences like 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.250
 example in the orders however here 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.640
 now I'm here even for a flaw 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:29.390
 of jurisprudence in Italy and is the 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.180
 made sense of being impractical us 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.860
 we study many, many manuals 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:39.770
 many 1,000,000 and 3,000 page pages 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:44.810
 however in matters such as can be 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:46.610
 procedural law or criminal law 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.870
 we will also need feedback 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:55.370
 practical then must do the traineeships ad 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:58.730
 example in court or going into one 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.100
 study as a lawyer and see it in practice 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.950
 as gentlemen say the deeds for example 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.890
 this is something that unfortunately that 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.260
 unfortunately it is also missing that 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.760
 university doesn't just mean going 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.099
 to 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.189
 to elections with the council that 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.290
 I can give you is that of in the city that 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:19.660
 you will choose to do university and 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.669
 doing French then I do not care one 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.160
 legal profession to do a few rounds 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.860
 for the court also because two biente 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.169
 they are public and to hear something though 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.289
 you have friends lawyers to show them in 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:36.820
 concretely what a balance sheet is everything 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:38.650
 a summons and after this brief 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.330
 summarized what is for me the 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.330
 I wish you luck in jurisprudence
