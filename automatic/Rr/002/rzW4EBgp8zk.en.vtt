00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.580
 pretty advanced about three days and 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.109
 good to tell you about this game as 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.990
 you will all know since the 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:31.570
 playstation3 is the first new slide 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.160
 that take out without the ht technology 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.010
 which are remastered games of 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.910
 playstation 2 and how many of this 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.230
 game 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.899
 I really have many expectations 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.670
 put on it I have spent the fast 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.850

 I am loving the 3 I have also 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.039
 many expectations placed on him and this 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.629
 on the 4th the last one you are also going to have the 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.250
 walk truje in the channel but as I say 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.140
 until the 28th that is not the exit 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.699
 I'm not going to upload it, it's not going to be 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.649
 that afterwards we have to regret some 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.219
 strike or something so good until the day 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.930
 28 I'm not going to upload it and well you know 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.759
 what I always say if a game does not 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.220
 like then you take and see it I do not want 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.080
 that you give me neither visit and I play 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.380
 I just upload it because I like it 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.479
 have it in the channel 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.299
 and here I like to see it, look at me 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.299
 it seems very good and good the new game 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.070
 it costs 39 with 90 euros a price 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.799
 quite reduced the truth that I like 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.899
 much this that the playstation what 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.780
 that are the titles of playstation 2 we 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.939
 lower and cost less than 40 euros is 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.439
 quite pretty well priced so 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.799
 well I'm not going to roll up much more 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.470
 let's do something that is unboxing 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:41.899
 I'm going to put the camera here to see that no 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.380
 I dropped it because this camera is a 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.209
 fucking shit talking in capital letters good 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.130
 here you have the game the cover the 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:50.479
 I really love bringing the show 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.920
 is the cross bay that is that if 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.020
 purchases on playstation3 also what 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.280
 you have to playstation vita but good 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.950
 I do not have playstation vita or the 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.409
 I want so well here you see the game 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.719
 behind 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.170
 and well let's open it the little eyelash 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.060
 famous is from playstation that sometimes 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.700
 It is very easy and sometimes it is very difficult 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.830
 I think now I've had the difficult 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.510
 know if I am to hook the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.130
 the best thing is that I have to use the 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.580
 mouth that is the fucking tab and I do not 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.560
 it's ok, it's already broken 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.770
 plastic although good the eyelash has not 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.950
 worked very well that is said 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.750
 to see if it's perfect, we remove the 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.040
 plastic here you see the game without the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:37.150
 plastic and open here you have it the 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.480
 disc bluray disc bluray normalito or 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.620
 be like everyone and the instructions but 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.740
 I walk carefully I will not make 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.210
 come some code or something good said 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.160
 that is not a special edition or anything 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.690
 but hey better to prevent here you have 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.930
 what are the instructions booklet 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.370
 advertising from behind 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.569
 well, an instruction book 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.799
 normalito of the movements how to play 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.930
 and it's typical of a book of 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.489
 instructions of a game platforms and 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.739
 good in advertising what is the 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.620
 system cross by this and here you see what 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.389
 it's the game on the inside so nothing 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.549
 this is all a quick boxing because 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:14.010
 this game has no special edition nor 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.980
 It has nothing 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.599
 and as I say on day 28 if I can upload 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.280
 she the first episode 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.620
 I'm going to be giving him a shot to record something 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.900
 shuruq from now on to have the 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.160
 maximum possible number of episodes as well 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.110
 than nothing 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.160
 I hope you liked the unboxing 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.660
 that there has not been much pain and nothing 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.350
 see you in the wolves the kids 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.350
 until next time 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.240
