00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:16.750
 in this course we are going to see the interface of 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.200
 xajay box this first issue because it is the 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.960
 introduction let's see in this little 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.529
 diagram what we intend to attack the 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:30.140
 make the interface between that box like 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.390
 first point we have our matrix 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.250
 where we receive all 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.700
 our goods this same matrix 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.379
 well let's go to the winery here they go to 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.440
 centralize all the operations of 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.530
 trading 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.780
 powerful 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.199
 in this company or in this example 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.579
 We have two other branches or stores 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:56.150
 which can be connected 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.730
 via remote or Friday 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.860
 and these will also carry their sales but 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.500
 these companies or these branches more 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.510
 they will have their sales through the 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.200
 Aspel system box being the system 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.170
 that manages all stores on 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.020
 system until the sae which will be in 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.300
 interface with box implementing certain 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.140
 technologies we can also have 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:24.290
 access to these systems from our 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.660
 house and even mobile in case of 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.330
 that we have a smartphone and 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:33.500
 we can agree to review the inventory 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.300
 that from our cell phone to 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.760
 matrix 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.320
 good the agenda as we already talked about 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.150
 it the first point is this 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.820
 introduction 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.220
 point number 2 we will see multi warehouse 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.200
 and its characteristics so that this 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.080
 manage the inventory of each of the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.310
 stores as well as the matrix and how 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:03.630
 point 2.1 we have the inventory we will see 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.530
 the characteristics of it 2.2 high 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.810
 of products 2.3 price modification 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.880
 with these three issues practically 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.010
 we would be covering all 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.520
 characteristics of the inventory and how 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.520
 handle it 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.110
 as point three we will have suppliers 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.890
 here we will see its high modification or low 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.680
 of the suppliers four purchases 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.080
 paid here we mean purchases 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.030
 that we make and pay in cash to 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.860
 our suppliers 4.1 purchases and 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.160
 Debts to pay 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.070
 in this topic we will see the purchases that 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.160
 we make credit to our 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.960
 providers and like that credit what 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.410
 we can manage from the system is 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.080
 think to have our our 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.640
 accounts payable updated as 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.410
 point number five movements 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.420
 food here what is intended is 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.050
 have access to modify our 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.770
 inventory in cases of shrinkage and errors 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.620
 of capture or in number of cases in the 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.250
 which we may need to move the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.350
 inventory such as making a 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.250
 transfer of goods between 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.610
 branch offices 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:29.200
 as point number 7 we will treat clients 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:33.819
 its high modification and low 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.260
 as point number 8 sales or invoices or 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.769
 paid billing 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.840
 This type of sales or billing is the 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.150
 that we do when our 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.550
 customers pay us in cash whatever 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.810
 be the form of payment 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:52.600
 cash transfer check etc. 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.510
 8.1 sales or billing and accounts by 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.800
 charge here we will see the sales that 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.360
 We will do 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.430
 to our customers 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.290
 being these customers clients 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.630
 important to which we 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.750
 we have given credit for which it is given 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:13.040
 high an account receivable and we 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:17.560
 we can take control of them 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.019
 Import of inventories and customers 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.900
 this is a process that we will take in 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:26.800
 aspe the box and that will only take 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:30.639
 under certain cases point number 10 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.980
 it would be synchronization in the box as 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.500
 point number 11 update of 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.560
 stock and movements to inventory 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.940
 in aspe caja 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.580
 and as last point the 12 sales in the 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.900
 ppl box with these last points what 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.669
 We intend to show the operation that 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.010
 let's perform in the aspel system 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.720
 box so that all sales and 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.780
 food movements that occur in 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.669
 the system will be reflected in aspen 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.130
 sae and all the information is 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.790
 centralized in the system in such a way 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:10.530
 that we do not have to resort to 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:13.310
 review both systems to know what 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.990
 is happening in our company and 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.889
 know how are the stocks of each 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.830
 one of the stores with this operation 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:25.169
 we just have to come in to think and 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.860
 with it we will see all the information 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.860
 updated
