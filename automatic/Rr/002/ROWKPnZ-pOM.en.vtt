 many times from my channel these days I 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.760
 I'm having problem is that at home it's 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.260
 The problem is, the staff is one thing it's a 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.019
 conditions related to work and 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.090
 the fact that I'm not working 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.590
 not that I 'm making any money 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.409
 I'm working right 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.900
 11 so and I played the player the day 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:19.710
 integer that is acceptable is not acceptable 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:24.000
 and I already solved the problem, I'm going 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.340
 can record your evening and / or afternoon 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.159

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.200
 service I can not write in fact I 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.900
 I'm recording a video now, the microphone. 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:42.770
 I'm recording with an x at the beginning of 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:46.560
 video I do not know how it is, and I'm 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:50.009
 the table has a mandate even 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:56.640
 and that's it's personal, I just wanted to test the 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:59.640
 the camera and the microphone and the blog and I 'm 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.220
