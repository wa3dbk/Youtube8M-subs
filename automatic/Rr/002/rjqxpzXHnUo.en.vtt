bow making group and it is sorry I'm
just<00:00:11.759> trying<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.000> clean<00:00:12.210> up<00:00:12.240> my<00:00:12.480> little<00:00:12.630> mess

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
just trying to clean up my little mess

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.000 
just trying to clean up my little mess
here<00:00:13.160> it's<00:00:14.160> how<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.400> make<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.730> little<00:00:15.000> bow<00:00:16.010> using

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
here it's how to make a little bow using

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.689 
here it's how to make a little bow using
a<00:00:17.250> fork<00:00:17.600> this<00:00:18.600> bow<00:00:18.900> actually<00:00:19.439> was<00:00:19.590> made<00:00:19.830> with

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
a fork this bow actually was made with

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.900 
a fork this bow actually was made with
larger<00:00:21.449> dinner<00:00:21.720> fork<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.100> there's<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.490> lot<00:00:23.730> of

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
larger dinner fork so there's a lot of

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.070 
larger dinner fork so there's a lot of
loops<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.310> I'm<00:00:26.310> going<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.550> try<00:00:26.820> to

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
loops on this and I'm going to try to

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.320 
loops on this and I'm going to try to
show<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.140> guys<00:00:28.410> how<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.650> make<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.849> bow<00:00:30.029> maybe

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
show you guys how to make the bow maybe

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.150 
show you guys how to make the bow maybe
a<00:00:30.420> little<00:00:30.660> bit<00:00:30.779> smaller<00:00:31.109> with<00:00:31.349> less<00:00:31.380> loops<00:00:31.920> on

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
a little bit smaller with less loops on

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.410 
a little bit smaller with less loops on
using<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> salad<00:00:33.360> fork<00:00:33.770> so<00:00:34.790> this<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.000> what

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
using like a salad fork so this is what

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.209 
using like a salad fork so this is what
you're<00:00:36.570> eventually<00:00:36.870> going<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> wind<00:00:37.710> up<00:00:37.920> with

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
you're eventually going to wind up with

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.490 
you're eventually going to wind up with
after<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.300> weave<00:00:39.570> your<00:00:39.750> ribbon<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.410> I'll

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
after you weave your ribbon and I'll

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.130 
after you weave your ribbon and I'll
show<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.829> actually<00:00:41.399> how<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.610> weave<00:00:42.140> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
show you actually how to weave the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.680 
show you actually how to weave the
ribbon<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.770> again<00:00:44.160> I'm<00:00:44.340> using<00:00:44.520> really<00:00:45.180> really

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
ribbon and again I'm using really really

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.250 
ribbon and again I'm using really really
thin<00:00:46.280> narrow<00:00:47.280> ribbon<00:00:47.850> for<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:49.050> might

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
thin narrow ribbon for this this might

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.350 
thin narrow ribbon for this this might
be<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.649> an<00:00:49.829> eighth<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.190> an<00:00:50.340> inch<00:00:50.460> maybe<00:00:51.059> even

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
be like an eighth of an inch maybe even

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.650 
be like an eighth of an inch maybe even
smaller<00:00:51.660> than<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.110> I'm<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.289> sure<00:00:53.660> but

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
smaller than that I'm not sure but

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.150 
smaller than that I'm not sure but
anyway<00:00:55.079> you're<00:00:55.320> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.530> start<00:00:55.800> off<00:00:55.949> with

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
anyway you're going to start off with

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.630 
anyway you're going to start off with
your<00:00:56.309> fork<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:58.010> you're<00:00:59.010> going<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.219> do<00:00:59.460> your

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
your fork and you're going to do your

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.470 
your fork and you're going to do your
first<00:00:59.670> weave<00:01:01.789> which<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.969> hope<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.300> guys<00:01:03.420> can

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
first weave which I hope you guys can

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.090 
first weave which I hope you guys can
see<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:09.140> I'm<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.560> push<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.040> down

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
see and I'm just going to push this down

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.660 
see and I'm just going to push this down
and<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.510> your<00:01:12.659> tail<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.860> not<00:01:14.490> going

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
and this is your tail this is not going

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.219 
and this is your tail this is not going
to<00:01:14.790> be<00:01:14.880> weaved<00:01:15.119> at<00:01:15.330> all<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.900> sort<00:01:16.110> of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
to be weaved at all this just sort of

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.990 
to be weaved at all this just sort of
hangs<00:01:16.500> off<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> side<00:01:17.220> you're<00:01:17.850> always

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
hangs off to the side you're always

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.580 
hangs off to the side you're always
going<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.600> use<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:21.119> side<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.530> is

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
going to just use the side and this is

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.490 
going to just use the side and this is
the<00:01:22.979> only<00:01:23.540> tail<00:01:24.540> part<00:01:24.840> that's<00:01:25.110> going<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.350> be

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the only tail part that's going to be

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.819 
the only tail part that's going to be
the<00:01:25.680> actual<00:01:27.259> part<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.350> ribbon<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.770> is

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
the actual part of the ribbon that is

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.270 
the actual part of the ribbon that is
weaved<00:01:29.220> back<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.150> forth<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.920> I'm<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.100> going

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
weaved back and forth so I'm just going

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.100 
weaved back and forth so I'm just going
to<00:01:32.369> go<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:33.509> front<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.650> behind<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.159> times<00:01:36.110> push

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
to go in front and behind the times push

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.929 
to go in front and behind the times push
it<00:01:37.290> down<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.799> again<00:01:38.070> you're<00:01:38.280> not<00:01:38.310> using<00:01:38.640> this

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
it down and again you're not using this

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.760 
it down and again you're not using this
one<00:01:39.180> you're<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.079> grab<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.320> one<00:01:40.619> that

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
one you're going to grab the one that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.730 
one you're going to grab the one that
you<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:40.920> weaved<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:42.390> weave<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.899> back

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you just weaved and now weave it back

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.920 
you just weaved and now weave it back
over<00:01:44.040> your<00:01:44.280> fork<00:01:44.640> tines<00:01:45.920> just<00:01:47.479> under<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.630> over

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
over your fork tines just under and over

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.740 
over your fork tines just under and over
and<00:01:49.670> then<00:01:50.670> you're<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.970> keep<00:01:51.180> going<00:01:51.390> back

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
and then you're going to keep going back

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.090 
and then you're going to keep going back
until<00:01:52.820> you<00:01:53.820> fill<00:01:54.090> up<00:01:54.210> your<00:01:54.240> fork<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.100> again

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
until you fill up your fork and again

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.280 
until you fill up your fork and again
depending<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.610> how<00:01:56.790> many<00:01:56.969> loops<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.450> want<00:01:57.689> you

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
depending on how many loops you want you

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.499 
depending on how many loops you want you
can<00:01:58.500> go<00:01:58.710> all<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.340> way<00:01:59.369> up<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.759> fork<00:02:00.060> or<00:02:00.329> you

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
can go all the way up the fork or you

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.319 
can go all the way up the fork or you
can<00:02:00.689> just<00:02:00.869> maybe<00:02:01.110> do<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> couple<00:02:02.119> couple<00:02:03.119> weaves

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
can just maybe do a couple couple weaves

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.959 
can just maybe do a couple couple weaves
back<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.869> forth<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:05.399> only<00:02:05.579> thing<00:02:05.820> is

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
back and forth and the only thing is

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.070 
back and forth and the only thing is
that<00:02:06.000> these<00:02:06.840> bows<00:02:07.170> come<00:02:07.619> out<00:02:07.799> really<00:02:08.250> tiny<00:02:09.080> so

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
that these bows come out really tiny so

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.020 
that these bows come out really tiny so
I<00:02:10.500> would<00:02:11.129> think<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.430> they're<00:02:11.670> not<00:02:11.790> going<00:02:11.970> to

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
I would think that they're not going to

and you can actually even maybe use a

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.050 
and you can actually even maybe use a

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299

and glue it on as an embellishment to
maybe<00:04:00.670> something<00:04:01.000> a<00:04:01.359> little<00:04:01.510> bit<00:04:01.870> bigger

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349
