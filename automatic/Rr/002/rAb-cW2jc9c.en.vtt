about<00:00:10.840> adjusting<00:00:11.710> the<00:00:11.980> smoke<00:00:12.280> in<00:00:12.520> Phoenix

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
about adjusting the smoke in Phoenix

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.240 
about adjusting the smoke in Phoenix
we're<00:00:13.660> going<00:00:13.780> to<00:00:13.840> continue<00:00:14.230> on<00:00:14.410> with<00:00:14.559> our<00:00:14.830> log

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
we're going to continue on with our log

2010<00:00:26.070> we'll<00:00:27.070> just<00:00:27.250> go<00:00:27.369> to<00:00:27.400> about<00:00:28.180> frame<00:00:28.449> 25<00:00:29.410> and

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
2010 we'll just go to about frame 25 and

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.800 
2010 we'll just go to about frame 25 and
render<00:00:30.340> out<00:00:30.490> and<00:00:30.730> we<00:00:31.029> can<00:00:31.150> see<00:00:31.300> that<00:00:31.480> we<00:00:31.570> have

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
render out and we can see that we have

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.430 
render out and we can see that we have
our<00:00:32.169> smoke<00:00:32.619> here<00:00:33.330> now<00:00:34.330> let's<00:00:34.720> select<00:00:35.290> the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
our smoke here now let's select the

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.310 
our smoke here now let's select the
simulator<00:00:36.340> and<00:00:36.690> under<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:37.809> rendering

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
simulator and under the rendering

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.010 
simulator and under the rendering
rollout<00:00:39.250> down<00:00:40.059> at<00:00:40.149> the<00:00:40.270> bottom<00:00:40.420> we<00:00:40.989> have

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
rollout down at the bottom we have

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.930 
rollout down at the bottom we have
colors<00:00:41.530> and<00:00:41.559> transparency<00:00:42.280> so<00:00:42.610> we'll<00:00:42.790> bring

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
colors and transparency so we'll bring

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.260 
colors and transparency so we'll bring
this<00:00:43.120> up<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.590> we're<00:00:44.800> going<00:00:44.920> to<00:00:44.980> go<00:00:45.100> into<00:00:45.309> the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
this up and we're going to go into the

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.080 
this up and we're going to go into the
diffuse<00:00:47.050> color<00:00:47.260> now<00:00:48.070> Phoenix<00:00:48.550> is<00:00:48.700> a<00:00:48.730> little

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
diffuse color now Phoenix is a little

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.580 
diffuse color now Phoenix is a little
bit<00:00:49.210> different<00:00:49.539> than<00:00:49.750> some<00:00:50.050> of<00:00:50.289> the<00:00:50.350> other

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
bit different than some of the other

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.590 
bit different than some of the other
interfaces<00:00:51.430> that<00:00:51.730> you<00:00:51.820> may<00:00:52.000> have<00:00:52.090> worked<00:00:52.390> on

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
interfaces that you may have worked on

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.500 
interfaces that you may have worked on
because<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:54.160> really<00:00:54.219> deals<00:00:54.730> with<00:00:54.940> kind<00:00:55.450> of

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
because it really deals with kind of

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.720 
because it really deals with kind of
true<00:00:55.870> light<00:00:56.230> emission<00:00:56.710> and<00:00:56.920> how<00:00:57.129> those<00:00:57.340> colors

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
true light emission and how those colors

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.119 
true light emission and how those colors
happen<00:00:58.510> and<00:00:58.780> get<00:00:58.930> brought<00:00:59.199> to<00:00:59.230> your<00:00:59.620> eye<00:00:59.649> in

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
happen and get brought to your eye in

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.610 
happen and get brought to your eye in
this<00:01:00.610> case<00:01:00.879> what<00:01:01.239> we<00:01:01.360> have<00:01:01.390> is<00:01:01.930> an<00:01:02.199> emission

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
this case what we have is an emission

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.079 
this case what we have is an emission
color<00:01:02.800> which<00:01:03.160> means<00:01:03.430> anything<00:01:03.789> that's

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
color which means anything that's

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.180 
color which means anything that's
emitting<00:01:04.509> light<00:01:04.750> is<00:01:05.050> going<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.710> be<00:01:05.830> using

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
emitting light is going to be using

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.149 
emitting light is going to be using
these<00:01:06.759> colors<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.450> a<00:01:07.960> diffuse<00:01:08.320> color<00:01:08.560> which

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
these colors and a diffuse color which

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.340 
these colors and a diffuse color which
means<00:01:09.460> once<00:01:09.850> that<00:01:10.060> process<00:01:10.630> stops<00:01:10.960> and<00:01:11.290> it

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
means once that process stops and it

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.929 
means once that process stops and it
becomes<00:01:11.710> diffuse<00:01:12.159> it's<00:01:12.460> going<00:01:12.610> to<00:01:12.670> start

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
becomes diffuse it's going to start

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.510 
becomes diffuse it's going to start
using<00:01:13.119> the<00:01:13.630> diffuse<00:01:13.960> color<00:01:14.110> and<00:01:14.409> that<00:01:14.950> equally

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
using the diffuse color and that equally

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.260 
using the diffuse color and that equally
correlates<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.270> a<00:01:16.450> flame<00:01:17.140> or<00:01:17.439> smoke<00:01:18.040> so<00:01:18.909> our

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
correlates to a flame or smoke so our

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.910 
correlates to a flame or smoke so our
smoke<00:01:19.570> pieces<00:01:19.990> are<00:01:20.200> going<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.409> use<00:01:20.619> our

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
smoke pieces are going to use our

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.340 
smoke pieces are going to use our
diffuse<00:01:21.310> color<00:01:21.549> so<00:01:22.180> I<00:01:22.210> can<00:01:22.540> go<00:01:22.689> in<00:01:22.869> to<00:01:23.080> this

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
diffuse color so I can go in to this

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.800 
diffuse color so I can go in to this
simple<00:01:23.830> color<00:01:24.040> swatch<00:01:24.369> and<00:01:24.700> I<00:01:25.240> can<00:01:25.390> change<00:01:25.600> it

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
simple color swatch and I can change it

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.570 
simple color swatch and I can change it
to<00:01:25.990> anything<00:01:26.470> that<00:01:26.619> I<00:01:26.740> might<00:01:26.920> like<00:01:27.130> so<00:01:27.400> we'll

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
to anything that I might like so we'll

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.340 
to anything that I might like so we'll
just<00:01:27.790> change<00:01:27.939> it<00:01:28.150> to<00:01:28.240> blue<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.600> render<00:01:29.140> it<00:01:29.259> out

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
just change it to blue and render it out

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.960 
just change it to blue and render it out
and<00:01:29.590> you<00:01:29.680> see<00:01:29.860> that<00:01:30.009> we<00:01:30.130> can<00:01:30.159> easily<00:01:30.850> adjust

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
and you see that we can easily adjust

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.780 
and you see that we can easily adjust
our<00:01:31.450> smoke<00:01:32.049> to<00:01:32.259> be<00:01:32.409> you<00:01:32.890> know<00:01:32.979> darker<00:01:33.520> or

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
our smoke to be you know darker or

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.600 
our smoke to be you know darker or
lighter<00:01:33.850> or<00:01:34.540> any<00:01:34.990> color<00:01:35.290> that<00:01:35.560> we<00:01:36.009> wish<00:01:36.220> so

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
lighter or any color that we wish so

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.410 
lighter or any color that we wish so
here's<00:01:36.939> a<00:01:37.000> nice<00:01:37.540> dark<00:01:37.900> blue<00:01:38.200> and<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:40.090> can<00:01:40.240> also

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
here's a nice dark blue and we can also

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.630 
here's a nice dark blue and we can also
make<00:01:40.930> it<00:01:40.990> just<00:01:41.290> a<00:01:41.409> really<00:01:41.680> bright<00:01:42.040> white<00:01:42.340> for

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
make it just a really bright white for

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.289 
make it just a really bright white for
that<00:01:42.759> real<00:01:43.060> wispy<00:01:43.750> white<00:01:44.049> type<00:01:44.470> of<00:01:44.650> smoke<00:01:45.299> okay

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
that real wispy white type of smoke okay

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.120 
that real wispy white type of smoke okay
and<00:01:46.570> there<00:01:47.049> are<00:01:47.140> also<00:01:47.290> ways<00:01:47.500> that<00:01:47.649> we<00:01:47.979> can

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
and there are also ways that we can

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.600 
and there are also ways that we can
adjust<00:01:48.250> this<00:01:48.670> through<00:01:49.479> our<00:01:50.170> source<00:01:50.619> so<00:01:51.040> using

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
adjust this through our source so using

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.580 
adjust this through our source so using
the<00:01:51.700> simple<00:01:52.030> color<00:01:52.240> is<00:01:52.509> a<00:01:52.540> nice<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.110> fast<00:01:53.320> way

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
the simple color is a nice and fast way

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.380 
the simple color is a nice and fast way
to<00:01:53.619> adjust<00:01:53.979> your<00:01:54.399> smoke<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:54.970> you<00:01:55.090> can<00:01:55.240> also

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
to adjust your smoke and you can also

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.810 
to adjust your smoke and you can also
use<00:01:55.840> different<00:01:56.140> source<00:01:56.619> channels<00:01:57.100> so<00:01:57.700> by

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
use different source channels so by

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.999 
use different source channels so by
default<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.509> temperature<00:01:59.079> channel<00:01:59.439> is<00:01:59.619> the

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
default the temperature channel is the

a<00:02:02.950> source<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:04.030> we<00:02:04.240> can<00:02:04.390> use<00:02:04.540> this<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.930> control

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
a source and we can use this to control

our smoke with a gradient and we can

our smoke with a gradient and we can

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
also use the smoke channel we'll try

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.940 
also use the smoke channel we'll try
both<00:02:10.329> of<00:02:10.360> these<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:10.959> we'll<00:02:11.410> start<00:02:11.650> off<00:02:11.769> I

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
both of these and we'll start off I

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
guess with the temperature Channel

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.720 
guess with the temperature Channel
you'll<00:02:14.530> see<00:02:14.709> that<00:02:14.860> when<00:02:15.099> we<00:02:15.190> pick<00:02:15.400> anything

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
you'll see that when we pick anything

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.089 
you'll see that when we pick anything
else<00:02:16.060> besides<00:02:16.360> simple<00:02:17.020> color<00:02:17.230> we<00:02:17.560> get<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.739> nice

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
else besides simple color we get a nice

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:18.390 
else besides simple color we get a nice
gray

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
gray

to<00:02:18.730> work<00:02:18.909> with<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.450> gradient<00:02:19.659> has<00:02:20.019> a

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
to work with and the gradient has a

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.320 
to work with and the gradient has a
couple<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.680> values<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:21.069> we<00:02:21.430> can<00:02:21.730> deal<00:02:22.299> with

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
couple of values that we can deal with

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.449 
couple of values that we can deal with
you<00:02:22.959> can<00:02:23.140> see<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.379> goes<00:02:23.560> from<00:02:23.769> zero<00:02:24.159> to<00:02:24.250> four

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
you can see it goes from zero to four

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.820 
you can see it goes from zero to four
thousand<00:02:25.299> and<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:26.019> temperature<00:02:26.409> is<00:02:26.620> going<00:02:26.739> to

thousand and the temperature is going to

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.190 
thousand and the temperature is going to
be<00:02:26.950> mapped<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:28.030> way<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.299> we<00:02:28.450> set<00:02:28.659> it<00:02:28.840> between

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
be mapped the way that we set it between

be mapped the way that we set it between
about<00:02:30.099> zero<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:31.110> 1800<00:02:32.110> so<00:02:32.379> we<00:02:32.709> can<00:02:32.860> adjust<00:02:32.980> and

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
about zero and 1800 so we can adjust and

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.460 
about zero and 1800 so we can adjust and
move<00:02:33.610> any<00:02:34.090> one<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.420> these<00:02:34.629> pieces<00:02:35.019> these

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
move any one of these pieces these

right-click<00:02:42.010> on<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.670> go<00:02:42.879> to<00:02:43.030> edit<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.510> you

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
right-click on it and go to edit and you

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.199 
right-click on it and go to edit and you
can<00:02:44.440> see<00:02:44.680> its<00:02:44.829> value<00:02:45.220> here<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:45.670> we<00:02:45.909> can<00:02:46.060> also

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
can see its value here and we can also

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.050 
can see its value here and we can also
set<00:02:46.659> it<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:47.379> for<00:02:47.860> smoke<00:02:48.129> the<00:02:48.670> smoke<00:02:48.909> is

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
set it so for smoke the smoke is

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.809 
set it so for smoke the smoke is
probably<00:02:49.360> going<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.599> be<00:02:49.659> anywhere<00:02:50.290> between

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
probably going to be anywhere between

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.240 
probably going to be anywhere between
completely<00:02:51.819> cool<00:02:52.030> which<00:02:52.359> is<00:02:52.510> zero<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.250> around

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
completely cool which is zero and around

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.250 
completely cool which is zero and around
1000<00:02:55.060> which<00:02:55.209> is<00:02:55.239> kind<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:55.750> just<00:02:55.810> before

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
1000 which is kind of just before

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.770 
1000 which is kind of just before
something<00:02:56.709> starting<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.310> ignite<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:58.180> we<00:02:58.629> can

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
something starting to ignite so we can

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.819 
something starting to ignite so we can
set<00:02:58.989> this<00:02:59.410> side<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.920> be<00:02:59.950> maybe<00:03:00.459> about<00:03:00.760> 1000<00:03:01.450> and

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
set this side to be maybe about 1000 and

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.039 
set this side to be maybe about 1000 and
we<00:03:02.829> can<00:03:02.980> set<00:03:03.159> this<00:03:03.340> side<00:03:03.579> to<00:03:04.269> be<00:03:04.299> zero<00:03:04.690> which<00:03:04.900> it

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
we can set this side to be zero which it

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.289 
we can set this side to be zero which it
already<00:03:05.200> is<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.859> now<00:03:06.579> if<00:03:06.700> we<00:03:06.790> start<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.180> adjust

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
already is and now if we start to adjust

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.020 
already is and now if we start to adjust
these<00:03:07.599> colors<00:03:08.489> we're<00:03:09.489> going<00:03:09.609> to<00:03:09.670> have<00:03:09.819> that

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
these colors we're going to have that

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.229 
these colors we're going to have that
map<00:03:10.269> out<00:03:10.450> so<00:03:10.810> we'll<00:03:11.200> set<00:03:11.379> this<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.950> blue<00:03:12.670> so

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
map out so we'll set this to blue so

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.690 
map out so we'll set this to blue so
basically<00:03:13.690> this<00:03:14.019> is<00:03:14.079> going<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.620> be<00:03:15.129> blue<00:03:15.489> in

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
basically this is going to be blue in

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.699 
basically this is going to be blue in
the<00:03:15.790> center<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.390> then<00:03:16.510> start<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.930> fade<00:03:17.140> off<00:03:17.379> to

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
the center and then start to fade off to

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.309 
the center and then start to fade off to
white<00:03:18.340> at<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:18.849> edges<00:03:19.239> so<00:03:19.599> we<00:03:19.720> can<00:03:19.750> see<00:03:20.019> we<00:03:20.170> have

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
white at the edges so we can see we have

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.020 
white at the edges so we can see we have
this<00:03:20.470> nice<00:03:20.680> blue<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.280> it's<00:03:21.549> going<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.760> fade

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
this nice blue and it's going to fade

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.059 
this nice blue and it's going to fade
off<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.450> white<00:03:22.630> if<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.380> want<00:03:23.560> to<00:03:23.650> zoom<00:03:23.859> in<00:03:24.040> or

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
off to white if you want to zoom in or

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.879 
off to white if you want to zoom in or
out<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.639> can<00:03:24.819> use<00:03:24.849> alt<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.930> right<00:03:25.959> click<00:03:26.650> or

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
out you can use alt and right click or

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.159 
out you can use alt and right click or
left<00:03:27.310> click<00:03:27.519> on<00:03:27.880> this<00:03:28.419> gradient<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.019> that's

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
left click on this gradient and that's

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.110 
left click on this gradient and that's
going<00:03:29.349> to<00:03:29.410> zoom<00:03:29.769> you<00:03:29.799> and<00:03:30.190> you<00:03:30.280> can<00:03:30.430> also<00:03:30.609> pan

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
going to zoom you and you can also pan

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.759 
going to zoom you and you can also pan
back<00:03:31.569> and<00:03:31.810> forth<00:03:32.019> with<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.380> middle<00:03:32.620> mouse

button so that you can have a little
more<00:03:34.750> control<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:35.680> we<00:03:35.799> can<00:03:35.950> set<00:03:36.160> this<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.450> you

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
more control so we can set this to you

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.009 
more control so we can set this to you
know<00:03:37.540> something<00:03:38.049> a<00:03:38.440> little<00:03:39.310> bit<00:03:39.430> darker

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
know something a little bit darker

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.659 
know something a little bit darker
that's<00:03:41.019> going<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.560> fade<00:03:42.010> off<00:03:43.919> to<00:03:44.919> a<00:03:44.950> gray<00:03:45.370> and

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
that's going to fade off to a gray and

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.539 
that's going to fade off to a gray and
that<00:03:45.810> way<00:03:46.810> we<00:03:46.989> can<00:03:47.139> get<00:03:47.379> some<00:03:47.980> more<00:03:48.099> control

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
that way we can get some more control

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.289 
that way we can get some more control
over<00:03:48.819> our<00:03:49.560> smoke<00:03:50.560> now<00:03:51.010> in<00:03:51.250> this<00:03:51.459> case<00:03:51.730> like<00:03:52.180> I

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
over our smoke now in this case like I

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.970 
over our smoke now in this case like I
said<00:03:52.359> we're<00:03:52.660> using<00:03:52.690> our<00:03:53.079> temperature<00:03:53.620> Channel

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
said we're using our temperature Channel

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.920 
said we're using our temperature Channel
and<00:03:54.250> its<00:03:54.459> values<00:03:54.849> you<00:03:55.030> can<00:03:55.209> use<00:03:55.329> any<00:03:55.629> of<00:03:55.720> the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
and its values you can use any of the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.449 
and its values you can use any of the
channels<00:03:56.139> here<00:03:56.530> but<00:03:56.739> you<00:03:56.829> do<00:03:57.010> need<00:03:57.190> to<00:03:57.250> make

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
channels here but you do need to make

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.000 
channels here but you do need to make
sure<00:03:57.669> that<00:03:58.090> you<00:03:58.269> export<00:03:58.720> them<00:03:58.989> so<00:03:59.290> for

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
sure that you export them so for

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.159 
sure that you export them so for
instance<00:04:00.340> if<00:04:00.489> we<00:04:00.609> click<00:04:00.819> on<00:04:00.970> smoke<00:04:01.389> and<00:04:01.690> we

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
instance if we click on smoke and we

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:05.009 
instance if we click on smoke and we
render<00:04:02.440> this<00:04:02.590> out<00:04:03.269> you<00:04:04.269> can<00:04:04.389> see<00:04:04.540> smoke<00:04:04.840> will

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
render this out you can see smoke will

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.839 
render this out you can see smoke will
go<00:04:05.139> between<00:04:05.349> zero<00:04:05.980> one<00:04:06.310> because<00:04:06.730> that's

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
go between zero one because that's

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.759 
go between zero one because that's
usually<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.299> good<00:04:07.540> default<00:04:07.810> for<00:04:08.109> smoke<00:04:08.349> but

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
usually a good default for smoke but

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.759 
usually a good default for smoke but
I'll<00:04:09.160> just<00:04:09.250> bring<00:04:09.579> this<00:04:09.639> up<00:04:09.910> to<00:04:10.650> purple<00:04:11.650> and

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
I'll just bring this up to purple and

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.159 
I'll just bring this up to purple and
we'll<00:04:12.579> render<00:04:12.790> it<00:04:13.030> out<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:13.750> what<00:04:13.900> you<00:04:13.989> can<00:04:14.139> see

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
we'll render it out and what you can see

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:16.409 
we'll render it out and what you can see
is<00:04:14.620> while<00:04:15.010> we<00:04:15.160> have<00:04:15.280> a<00:04:15.310> gradient<00:04:15.609> set<00:04:15.970> up<00:04:16.090> here

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
is while we have a gradient set up here

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.930 
is while we have a gradient set up here
the<00:04:16.660> purple<00:04:17.500> is<00:04:17.680> not<00:04:17.889> really<00:04:18.160> present<00:04:18.639> in<00:04:18.729> the

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
the purple is not really present in the

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.550 
the purple is not really present in the
center<00:04:19.269> and<00:04:19.419> fading<00:04:19.810> off<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.139> white<00:04:20.320> and

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
center and fading off to white and

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.620 
center and fading off to white and
that's<00:04:20.889> because<00:04:21.280> this<00:04:21.489> smoke<00:04:21.760> channel<00:04:22.150> isn't

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
that's because this smoke channel isn't

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.480 
that's because this smoke channel isn't
available<00:04:22.720> so<00:04:23.410> we<00:04:23.560> need<00:04:23.740> to<00:04:23.860> export<00:04:24.280> that

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
available so we need to export that

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.399 
available so we need to export that
smoke<00:04:24.789> channel<00:04:25.150> some<00:04:25.360> way<00:04:25.479> let's<00:04:26.229> just

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:26.409 
smoke channel some way let's just

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.700 
smoke channel some way let's just
minimize<00:04:27.190> this<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:28.630> go<00:04:28.690> to<00:04:28.960> our<00:04:29.169> simulator

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
minimize this and go to our simulator

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.250 
minimize this and go to our simulator
and<00:04:30.190> let's<00:04:30.789> go<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.240> output<00:04:31.419> rollout

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
and let's go to the output rollout

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.430 
and let's go to the output rollout
and<00:04:33.270> from<00:04:34.270> here<00:04:34.540> you<00:04:34.660> can<00:04:34.780> see<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.290> default

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
and from here you can see the default

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.320 
and from here you can see the default
output<00:04:36.040> channels<00:04:36.430> when<00:04:36.610> you're<00:04:36.760> simulating

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
output channels when you're simulating

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.440 
output channels when you're simulating
are<00:04:37.720> just<00:04:38.140> the<00:04:38.260> temperature<00:04:38.650> so<00:04:39.340> if<00:04:40.270> you

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
are just the temperature so if you

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.720 
are just the temperature so if you
wanted<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:40.780> output<00:04:41.170> smoke<00:04:41.560> or<00:04:41.860> you<00:04:42.130> v's<00:04:42.370> or

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
wanted to output smoke or you v's or

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.460 
wanted to output smoke or you v's or
anything<00:04:43.090> else<00:04:43.420> then<00:04:43.840> you<00:04:44.080> want<00:04:44.230> to<00:04:44.290> make<00:04:44.440> sure

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
anything else then you want to make sure

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.830 
anything else then you want to make sure
that<00:04:44.770> that<00:04:44.920> is<00:04:45.160> checked<00:04:45.670> so<00:04:46.270> we're<00:04:46.660> going<00:04:46.780> to

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
that that is checked so we're going to

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.620 
that that is checked so we're going to
go<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:47.320> we're<00:04:47.560> going<00:04:47.650> to<00:04:47.740> check<00:04:47.920> smoke<00:04:48.250> here

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
go and we're going to check smoke here

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.540 
go and we're going to check smoke here
and<00:04:49.630> we'll<00:04:49.750> also<00:04:49.930> go<00:04:50.200> into<00:04:50.410> our<00:04:50.890> source<00:04:51.220> and

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
and we'll also go into our source and

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.330 
and we'll also go into our source and
we're<00:04:52.240> going<00:04:52.360> to<00:04:52.390> enable<00:04:52.900> some<00:04:53.860> smoke<00:04:54.130> so

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
we're going to enable some smoke so

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.600 
we're going to enable some smoke so
we'll<00:04:54.490> just<00:04:54.960> enable<00:04:55.960> maybe<00:04:56.170> one<00:04:56.740> in<00:04:57.100> the<00:04:57.340> smoke

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
we'll just enable maybe one in the smoke

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.660 
we'll just enable maybe one in the smoke
and<00:04:58.440> then<00:04:59.440> we'll<00:04:59.590> go<00:04:59.710> back<00:04:59.920> to<00:05:00.100> our<00:05:00.130> simulator

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
and then we'll go back to our simulator

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.930 
and then we'll go back to our simulator
and<00:05:01.140> we<00:05:02.140> will<00:05:02.640> restart<00:05:03.640> the<00:05:03.730> simulation

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
and we will restart the simulation

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.520 
and we will restart the simulation
because<00:05:04.480> now<00:05:04.660> it<00:05:04.810> needs<00:05:04.990> to<00:05:05.110> go<00:05:05.230> through<00:05:05.380> the

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
because now it needs to go through the

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.400 
because now it needs to go through the
process<00:05:05.920> to<00:05:06.130> output<00:05:06.910> that<00:05:07.060> channel<00:05:07.480> so<00:05:08.110> we'll

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
process to output that channel so we'll

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.070 
process to output that channel so we'll
click<00:05:08.770> on<00:05:08.890> simulate<00:05:09.400> and<00:05:09.720> now<00:05:10.720> you<00:05:10.780> should

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
click on simulate and now you should

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.440 
click on simulate and now you should
actually<00:05:11.230> see<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:12.100> smoke<00:05:12.400> and<00:05:12.670> how<00:05:13.090> that<00:05:13.300> is

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
actually see the smoke and how that is

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.300 
actually see the smoke and how that is
working<00:05:13.480> right<00:05:14.020> in<00:05:14.140> the<00:05:14.230> viewport<00:05:14.680> as<00:05:14.920> far<00:05:15.160> as

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
working right in the viewport as far as

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.000 
working right in the viewport as far as
the<00:05:15.490> preview<00:05:16.090> is<00:05:16.240> set<00:05:16.390> up<00:05:16.540> and<00:05:16.870> when<00:05:17.650> we<00:05:17.770> render

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
the preview is set up and when we render

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.200 
the preview is set up and when we render
this<00:05:18.220> out<00:05:19.920> because<00:05:20.920> we<00:05:21.130> actually<00:05:21.490> have<00:05:22.000> that

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
this out because we actually have that

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.870 
this out because we actually have that
set<00:05:22.510> up<00:05:22.660> to<00:05:22.900> go<00:05:23.110> from<00:05:23.470> purple<00:05:24.010> to<00:05:24.130> white<00:05:24.160> you're

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
set up to go from purple to white you're

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.610 
set up to go from purple to white you're
going<00:05:25.030> to<00:05:25.090> see<00:05:25.270> that<00:05:25.450> gradiation<00:05:25.990> now<00:05:26.350> we'll

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
going to see that gradiation now we'll

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.270 
going to see that gradiation now we'll
see<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:26.860> purple<00:05:27.280> start<00:05:27.580> to<00:05:27.820> happen<00:05:28.540> in<00:05:28.840> here

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
see the purple start to happen in here

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.620 
see the purple start to happen in here
so<00:05:30.280> we'll<00:05:30.430> let<00:05:30.550> this<00:05:30.610> simulate<00:05:31.120> through<00:05:31.390> for<00:05:31.600> a

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
so we'll let this simulate through for a

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.100 
so we'll let this simulate through for a
couple<00:05:31.690> frames<00:05:33.360> and<00:05:34.360> I'm<00:05:34.480> just<00:05:34.630> going<00:05:34.780> to<00:05:34.810> stop

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
couple frames and I'm just going to stop

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.230 
couple frames and I'm just going to stop
it<00:05:35.320> at<00:05:35.560> around<00:05:35.680> frame<00:05:36.130> 20<00:05:38.790> we'll<00:05:39.790> render<00:05:40.060> this

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
it at around frame 20 we'll render this

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.540 
it at around frame 20 we'll render this
out<00:05:40.480> and<00:05:40.720> let's<00:05:41.110> go<00:05:41.260> back<00:05:41.500> into<00:05:41.770> our<00:05:42.310> render

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
out and let's go back into our render

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.360 
out and let's go back into our render
properties<00:05:43.500> so<00:05:44.500> here<00:05:44.770> in<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:44.920> diffuse<00:05:45.190> color

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
properties so here in the diffuse color

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.120 
properties so here in the diffuse color
you<00:05:45.670> can<00:05:45.790> see<00:05:45.970> that<00:05:46.380> we're<00:05:47.380> mapping<00:05:47.830> to<00:05:48.010> the

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
you can see that we're mapping to the

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.700 
you can see that we're mapping to the
smoke<00:05:48.370> channel<00:05:48.760> which<00:05:49.360> is<00:05:49.390> between<00:05:49.870> zero<00:05:50.320> one

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
smoke channel which is between zero one

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.730 
smoke channel which is between zero one
because<00:05:51.070> we<00:05:51.220> set<00:05:51.430> the<00:05:51.460> smoke<00:05:51.790> to<00:05:51.970> one<00:05:52.150> and<00:05:52.740> we

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
because we set the smoke to one and we

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.920 
because we set the smoke to one and we
can<00:05:53.890> set<00:05:54.130> these<00:05:54.280> values<00:05:54.400> to<00:05:55.060> anything<00:05:55.600> we<00:05:55.750> like

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
can set these values to anything we like

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.680 
can set these values to anything we like
so<00:05:56.170> we<00:05:56.290> can<00:05:56.320> set<00:05:56.620> that<00:05:56.770> to<00:05:56.980> red<00:05:57.250> and<00:05:57.670> maybe<00:05:58.420> to

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
so we can set that to red and maybe to

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.030 
so we can set that to red and maybe to
fade<00:05:59.050> off<00:05:59.320> to<00:05:59.680> something<00:06:00.610> like<00:06:00.880> green<00:06:01.860> and<00:06:02.860> we

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
fade off to something like green and we

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.890 
fade off to something like green and we
can<00:06:03.190> get<00:06:03.310> some<00:06:03.520> interesting<00:06:03.820> not<00:06:04.720> so

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
can get some interesting not so

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.840 
can get some interesting not so
realistic<00:06:05.500> I<00:06:05.860> guess<00:06:06.040> depending<00:06:06.190> on<00:06:06.580> what<00:06:06.730> your

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
realistic I guess depending on what your

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.390 
realistic I guess depending on what your
burning<00:06:07.240> effects<00:06:07.960> in<00:06:08.170> the<00:06:08.290> smoke<00:06:08.590> and<00:06:08.800> you<00:06:09.250> can

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
burning effects in the smoke and you can

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.250 
burning effects in the smoke and you can
also<00:06:09.580> get<00:06:09.910> more<00:06:10.180> realism<00:06:10.840> and

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
also get more realism and

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.920 
also get more realism and
customizability<00:06:12.160> through<00:06:12.640> this<00:06:12.850> so<00:06:13.150> we'll

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
customizability through this so we'll

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.490 
customizability through this so we'll
bring<00:06:14.200> this<00:06:14.380> maybe<00:06:14.650> down<00:06:15.150> more<00:06:16.150> to<00:06:16.360> a<00:06:16.390> grey<00:06:16.930> on

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
bring this maybe down more to a grey on

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.490 
bring this maybe down more to a grey on
the<00:06:18.040> outside<00:06:20.070> and<00:06:21.070> a<00:06:21.760> lighter

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
the outside and a lighter

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.030 
the outside and a lighter
gray<00:06:24.160> here<00:06:24.610> on<00:06:24.790> the<00:06:25.480> inside<00:06:25.840> and<00:06:26.110> that's<00:06:26.890> going

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
gray here on the inside and that's going

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.040 
gray here on the inside and that's going
to<00:06:27.100> give<00:06:27.250> us<00:06:27.400> some<00:06:27.610> kind<00:06:27.790> of<00:06:27.940> control<00:06:28.510> over<00:06:28.840> how

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
to give us some kind of control over how

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.130 
to give us some kind of control over how
we<00:06:29.200> want<00:06:29.590> our<00:06:29.800> smoke<00:06:30.190> to<00:06:30.370> look<00:06:30.780> so<00:06:31.780> that's<00:06:32.020> how

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
we want our smoke to look so that's how

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.170 
we want our smoke to look so that's how
you<00:06:32.230> can<00:06:32.590> adjust<00:06:32.950> the<00:06:33.280> color<00:06:33.490> with<00:06:33.760> your<00:06:33.910> smoke

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
you can adjust the color with your smoke

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.350 
you can adjust the color with your smoke
using<00:06:34.660> just<00:06:34.960> simple<00:06:35.410> controls<00:06:36.210> mapping<00:06:37.210> it<00:06:37.330> to

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
using just simple controls mapping it to

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.510 
using just simple controls mapping it to
the<00:06:37.870> temperature<00:06:38.500> Channel<00:06:38.980> as<00:06:39.100> well<00:06:39.400> as

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
the temperature Channel as well as

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.160 
the temperature Channel as well as
mapping<00:06:39.970> it<00:06:40.090> to<00:06:40.240> the<00:06:40.360> smoke<00:06:40.570> channel<00:06:40.960> and

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.170 
mapping it to the smoke channel and

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.290 
mapping it to the smoke channel and
setting<00:06:41.560> up<00:06:41.710> your<00:06:41.890> simulator<00:06:42.670> in<00:06:42.940> order<00:06:43.180> to

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
setting up your simulator in order to

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.210 
setting up your simulator in order to
export<00:06:43.720> the<00:06:43.900> smoke<00:06:44.110> channel<00:06:44.500> so<00:06:44.890> you<00:06:44.950> have<00:06:45.190> a

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
export the smoke channel so you have a

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.610 
export the smoke channel so you have a
valid<00:06:45.550> channel<00:06:46.060> in<00:06:46.270> order<00:06:46.390> to<00:06:46.600> map<00:06:47.200> the<00:06:47.410> color

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
valid channel in order to map the color

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.870 
valid channel in order to map the color
of<00:06:47.950> the<00:06:48.190> smoke<00:06:48.310> -<00:06:48.730> thank<00:06:49.420> you<00:06:49.510> very<00:06:49.660> much
