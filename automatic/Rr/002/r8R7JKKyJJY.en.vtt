environmental<00:02:28.090> matters<00:02:28.240> I<00:02:28.480> guess<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.070> the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
environmental matters I guess and the

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.490 
environmental matters I guess and the

of<00:02:32.620> life<00:02:32.680> style<00:02:33.070> versus<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.910> more<00:02:34.660> urban

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
of life style versus a more urban

of life style versus a more urban
environment<00:02:35.950> also<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.880> more<00:02:37.090> pressing<00:02:37.300> issue

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
environment also a more pressing issue
