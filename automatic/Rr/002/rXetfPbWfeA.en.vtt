00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.930
 in principle should 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.650
 certain structures warm up afterwards 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.650
 they may fell out 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.960
 must include articular 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.990
 gymnastics small warming run and 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.990
 running exercises 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.820
 while improving the composition 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.559
 he stabilize these all processes but 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.630
 only there should be an amendment that 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.739
 running should take place at the lowest in the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:44.000
 zone this is about this then 20 140 strokes 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.000
 for the average person 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.109
 principle on 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.750
 man can walk then he can run 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:57.690
 the question is how he trains some 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.940
 the technique he runs and wait there and long 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.969
 if you have a lot of excess weight and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.680
 it's hard for you not to choose right away 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.350
 imagine a distance of five or 10 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.960
 kilometers so that it does not reach 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.549
 to end 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:18.780
 you can alternatively start alternating 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:21.929
 website, or up the lion lords 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.420
 air and any mode convenient for you 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:27.420
 the main thing is to keep technology because 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.649
 that as the technique falls apart so immediately 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.649
 interfere with the negative promise 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.040
 this and 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.390
 the body responds to what you have not 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.710
 the right technique 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.810
 because every injury entails 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.460
 more precisely not so everyone already in the technique and 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.460
 entails a certain morning 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.679
 train
