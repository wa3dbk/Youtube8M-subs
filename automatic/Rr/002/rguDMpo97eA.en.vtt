basic basically what you do is you take
out<00:00:20.330> your<00:00:20.570> spline<00:00:28.960> generally<00:00:29.960> is<00:00:30.080> in<00:00:30.110> the

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
out your spline generally is in the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.010 
out your spline generally is in the
corner<00:00:30.860> somewhere<00:00:32.199> and<00:00:34.480> dig<00:00:35.480> it<00:00:35.629> out<00:00:35.780> with<00:00:35.989> a

right out just like that okay so we got

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.880 
right out just like that okay so we got
our<00:01:14.420> spline<00:01:14.869> here<00:01:15.200> we're<00:01:15.350> just<00:01:15.500> going<00:01:15.619> to<00:01:15.650> set

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
our spline here we're just going to set

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.399 
our spline here we're just going to set
this<00:01:16.010> aside<00:01:16.299> and<00:01:17.299> our<00:01:17.900> screen<00:01:18.170> is<00:01:18.260> going<00:01:18.350> to

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
this aside and our screen is going to

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.210 
this aside and our screen is going to
come<00:01:18.619> right<00:01:18.830> out<00:01:20.770> now<00:01:21.770> what<00:01:21.950> we're<00:01:22.070> going<00:01:22.190> to

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
do is we're going to take the screen and

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.000 
do is we're going to take the screen and
we're<00:01:23.810> going<00:01:23.930> to<00:01:23.990> roll<00:01:24.200> it<00:01:24.350> over<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.680> top<00:01:24.890> and

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
we're going to roll it over the top and

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
here is just a roll is bug screen and

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.500 
here is just a roll is bug screen and
we're<00:01:34.010> going<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:34.159> roll<00:01:34.340> this<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:35.390> top

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
put this bug screen in it's nice and

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.670 
put this bug screen in it's nice and
tight<00:01:44.690> that's<00:01:45.690> what<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.960> want<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.380> want<00:01:46.500> the

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.980 
actually and all you do is you work here
or<00:02:10.530> spline<00:02:10.920> which<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.970> here<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.570> your

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
or spline which is this here in your

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.410 
or spline which is this here in your
groove<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:14.130> as<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.400> go<00:02:14.580> along<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:15.060> pull<00:02:15.300> the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
groove and as you go along you pull the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.240 
groove and as you go along you pull the
screen<00:02:15.750> tight<00:02:16.110> I've<00:02:16.410> gotten<00:02:16.770> this<00:02:16.980> pretty

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
screen tight I've gotten this pretty

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.010 
screen tight I've gotten this pretty
much<00:02:17.490> all<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.850> way<00:02:17.970> done<00:02:18.210> I<00:02:18.240> just<00:02:18.450> wanted<00:02:18.840> to

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
much all the way done I just wanted to

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.260 
much all the way done I just wanted to
speed<00:02:19.950> things<00:02:20.160> up<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.520> little<00:02:20.640> bit<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.090> show

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
speed things up a little bit and show

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.750 
speed things up a little bit and show
you<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.450> little<00:02:21.630> bit<00:02:21.810> how<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.380> do<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.860> if<00:02:23.490> you

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
you a little bit how to do it if you

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.110 
you a little bit how to do it if you
could<00:02:23.970> look<00:02:24.540> down<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:25.050> there<00:02:25.290> into<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.830> groove

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
could look down in there into the groove

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.640 
could look down in there into the groove
I'm<00:02:27.120> actually<00:02:27.390> holding<00:02:27.840> onto<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.500> screen

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
I'm actually holding onto the screen

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.910 
I'm actually holding onto the screen
holding<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.770> tight<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.990> I'm<00:02:34.230> working<00:02:34.500> it

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
holding it tight and I'm working it

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.970 
holding it tight and I'm working it
with<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.460> spline<00:02:36.850> tool<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:38.500> can<00:02:38.650> get<00:02:38.800> this

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
with the spline tool you can get this

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.480 
with the spline tool you can get this
spline<00:02:39.310> tool<00:02:39.580> at<00:02:39.700> any<00:02:39.940> hardware<00:02:40.300> store
