00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.200 

I've<00:00:07.710> got<00:00:07.919> some<00:00:08.189> other<00:00:08.309> pens<00:00:08.670> which<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.059> would

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
I've got some other pens which I would

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.060 
I've got some other pens which I would
kind<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.450> consider<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:10.019> be<00:00:10.080> kind<00:00:10.889> of

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
kind of consider to be kind of

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.220 
kind of consider to be kind of
comparable<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.210> size<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.780> weight<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.049> stuff

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
comparable in size and weight and stuff

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.480 
comparable in size and weight and stuff
like<00:00:13.349> that<00:00:13.530> I've<00:00:13.769> got<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> new<00:00:14.070> lers<00:00:14.219> nib

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
like that I've got a new lers nib

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.070 
like that I've got a new lers nib
creeper<00:00:14.880> which<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.240> really<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> pretty<00:00:15.570> small

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
creeper which is really a pretty small

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.189 
creeper which is really a pretty small
pen<00:00:16.550> it's<00:00:17.550> it's<00:00:17.970> thicker<00:00:18.300> than<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.750> creeper

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
pen it's it's thicker than the creeper

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.220 
pen it's it's thicker than the creeper
but<00:00:20.189> it's<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.670> little<00:00:21.000> bit<00:00:21.180> longer<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:21.840> if<00:00:22.109> you

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
but it's a little bit longer so if you

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.810 
but it's a little bit longer so if you
if<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.590> pen<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> little<00:00:23.130> too<00:00:23.220> thin<00:00:23.430> for<00:00:23.460> you

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
if this pen is a little too thin for you

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.370 
if this pen is a little too thin for you
the<00:00:24.090> cool<00:00:24.300> would<00:00:24.510> probably<00:00:24.960> be<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the cool would probably be it and the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.870 
the cool would probably be it and the
reason<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.680> compare<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.369> because<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.640> find

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
reason I compare this is because I find

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.540 
reason I compare this is because I find
both<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.150> these<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.539> have<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> flexible<00:00:28.050> nib

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
both of these to have a flexible nib

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.160 
both of these to have a flexible nib
I've<00:00:29.550> got<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> Monteverde<00:00:30.150> artistic<00:00:30.779> crystal

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
I've got the Monteverde artistic crystal

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.830 
I've got the Monteverde artistic crystal
this<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.769> another<00:00:31.980> clear<00:00:32.219> pen<00:00:32.520> that's<00:00:32.840> right

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
this is another clear pen that's right

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.510 
this is another clear pen that's right
in<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.079> price<00:00:34.320> range<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.980> little<00:00:35.219> bit<00:00:35.309> less

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
in the price range a little bit less

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.670 
in the price range a little bit less
than<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> cool<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> little<00:00:37.230> bit<00:00:37.320> shorter

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
than the cool it's a little bit shorter

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.410 
than the cool it's a little bit shorter
but<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:37.920> about<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> same<00:00:38.460> diameter<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.329> if

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
but it's about the same diameter so if

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.750 
but it's about the same diameter so if
you're<00:00:39.570> used<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.399> it's<00:00:41.399> not<00:00:41.550> gonna<00:00:41.670> be

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
you're used to that it's not gonna be

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.430 
you're used to that it's not gonna be
too<00:00:41.910> big<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.210> stretch<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.260> course

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
too big of a stretch and then of course

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.869 
too big of a stretch and then of course
I've<00:00:43.559> got<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.739> Lummi<00:00:43.920> Vista<00:00:44.430> here<00:00:44.610> which<00:00:44.760> is

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
I've got the Lummi Vista here which is

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.790 
I've got the Lummi Vista here which is
kind<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.180> classic<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:46.200> about<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.649> right

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
kind of a classic it's about the right

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.029 
kind of a classic it's about the right
size<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.399> Vista<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.360> only<00:00:48.570> difference<00:00:48.930> here

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
size of a Vista the only difference here

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.410 
size of a Vista the only difference here
would<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.520> know<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> grip<00:00:50.910> section<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
would be you know the grip section the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.150 
would be you know the grip section the
Vista<00:00:51.660> you've<00:00:51.780> got<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.050> triangular<00:00:52.710> grip

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
Vista you've got that triangular grip

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.920 
Vista you've got that triangular grip
which<00:00:53.460> actually<00:00:53.879> makes<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.270> feel<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.809> little

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
which actually makes it feel a little

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.200 
which actually makes it feel a little
smaller<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.680> grip<00:00:55.890> than<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> platinum<00:00:56.940> cool

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
smaller of a grip than the platinum cool

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.260 
smaller of a grip than the platinum cool
but<00:00:57.750> even<00:00:57.930> still<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.350> not<00:00:58.500> going<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.710> be<00:00:58.890> an

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
but even still it's not going to be an

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.490 
but even still it's not going to be an
incredible<00:01:00.270> stretch<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.899> then<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> last

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
incredible stretch and then the last

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.630 
incredible stretch and then the last
thing<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.770> wanted<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.010> show<00:01:02.250> which<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.609> really

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
thing I wanted to show which is really

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.270 
thing I wanted to show which is really
not<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> price<00:01:03.390> range<00:01:03.629> at<00:01:03.780> all<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.199> this

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
not in the price range at all is this

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.830 
not in the price range at all is this
Kanazawa<00:01:06.270> leaf<00:01:06.780> machi<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.560> from<00:01:08.010> platinum<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
Kanazawa leaf machi a from platinum and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.179 
Kanazawa leaf machi a from platinum and
the<00:01:09.840> reason<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.170> wanted<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.470> show<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.950> one

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
the reason I wanted to show this one

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.000 
the reason I wanted to show this one
especially<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:12.420> because<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.990> has<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.439> nearly

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
especially is because it has a nearly

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.120 
especially is because it has a nearly
identical<00:01:14.340> nib<00:01:15.030> design<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.320> two<00:01:16.470> pens<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
identical nib design on the two pens and

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.380 
identical nib design on the two pens and
this<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.580> actually<00:01:17.939> one<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> most

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
this is actually one of the most

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.649 
this is actually one of the most
appealing<00:01:18.659> things<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.500> found<00:01:19.860> about

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
appealing things that I found about

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.130 
appealing things that I found about
platen<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.930> platinum<00:01:22.530> cool<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.950> begin<00:01:23.040> with

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
platen this platinum cool to begin with

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.300 
platen this platinum cool to begin with
so<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.229> see<00:01:25.470> here<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:25.799> got<00:01:25.860> kind<00:01:26.220> of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
so you can see here it's got kind of

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.780 
so you can see here it's got kind of
this<00:01:26.430> neat<00:01:26.960> design<00:01:28.040> it's<00:01:29.040> not<00:01:29.250> your<00:01:29.520> your

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
this neat design it's not your your

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.179 
this neat design it's not your your
typical<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.750> know<00:01:30.780> Wings<00:01:31.110> flared<00:01:31.710> out<00:01:31.860> kind

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
typical you know Wings flared out kind

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.620 
typical you know Wings flared out kind
of<00:01:32.280> nib<00:01:32.430> design<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:33.210> really<00:01:33.420> kind<00:01:33.570> of

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
of nib design it's really kind of

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.480 
of nib design it's really kind of
straight<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.290> then<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.470> tapers<00:01:34.619> down<00:01:34.890> and

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
straight and then it tapers down and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.910 
straight and then it tapers down and
it's<00:01:36.119> got<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.420> little<00:01:36.630> kind<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:37.110> swoop<00:01:37.740> II

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
it's got this little kind of swoop II

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.030 
it's got this little kind of swoop II
feed<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.270> here<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.900> they<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.530> both<00:01:40.650> actually

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
feed on here and they they both actually

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.530 
feed on here and they they both actually
have<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.189> translucent<00:01:41.850> feed<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.240> one<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
