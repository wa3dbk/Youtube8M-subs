00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Yes 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.729
 hello and welcome to his activity and his allies we are currently 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:17.090
 so always so alert 2013 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.910
 with the stand she will then tell us why it does not come simply 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.230
 because the guys were a lot like the builder who made another 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.830
 which made a little sensation at the opening of the cei remains that the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.850
 conference has proved to us that via believe at the local club dimming and with that 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.820
 so a parent he introduced us to the famous glow the architectured a 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.210
 old town that will allow the powers to market players to 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.410
 propose chaos mines then for those who still have doubts 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.280
 vis-à-vis the gaming club aabar a laon at a demo I think the respect is 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.559
 far says this tasty duel nixon but I know more too% in all 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.820
 case see that it's just a simple android smartphone with a client and 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.060
 liga individual customers that will allow launched hard that will launch this 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.620
 moment to a game from rome any pc platform and so his thirst 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.100
 zaza on the hug you also probably later from your pc since 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.050
 the French that the and that didier has productive and combative and that for the 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.250
 stim at the clear point of the meeting m pardon for a club and 2000 in the calm so 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.149
 we could see or see here again it's a skate style demo to believe it 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.300
 and want that too little actually controlled pretty quickly and that's 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.080
 quite fluid years 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.320
 but that gold to the protocol on remote servers 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.170
 and that's it's still very fluid 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.810
 and especially more respectful 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.940
 we can see it here sex and connected to a gamepad 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.640
 all that has more and more we can play with this controller wait I 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.900
 will show you 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.960
 so for this ride here it is simple ahronoth finds the same 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.670
 orders 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.580
 we move forward we move we turn we can aim ap 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.560
 and it's past impressive donkalor which ones performing it's not as 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.680
 fluid 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.210
 cure if we had real pests loved suddenly it's still enough 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.310
 nice to say that 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.600
 the police reason I want to play in game while the Columbia who beat in 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.100
 finale by philippe starck 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.590
 here we can do it and with graphics staying at that's why it 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.269
 must say that 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:09.129
 we can see it here 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.559
 so why am I dead another has a little dropped 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:16.889
 e in all cases it is not necessarily effectively michène do it is not 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.739
 necessarily the rat how to say 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.870
 to the type of game I would have thought of first mym keyboards but I 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.940
 think especially for example instead of playing or simple chance or simple portage 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:30.049
 800 spider-man boasts of android and or on aion f there I can play at 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.189
 volley mixing drinks split head on pc on steam so where dodge comes out 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.599
 also as murderers thinks he's assassin's creed 3 for example at all 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.430
 these games can rejoice quietly there is indeed the bottom csu it's when 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.300
 even pretty cool and polo arches 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.159
 in terms of graphics it's still pretty enough 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.060
 especially on a small screen hd like that in ka band 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.160
 by living the tablets in the image of social themes a second tablet 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.370
 but it can do it totally 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.150
 here I think we never ready after Montreal what we could do 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.250
 with the case decreases what will happen in the future I know that some are 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.940
 still resistant to emilie club but for that I think it's okay 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.410
 arrive sooner or later ope at us there is in our habits as if 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.010
 savings issues and see you soon on the geek newspaper
