it now this is that's a coroner as you
can<00:00:28.769> see<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.189> like<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.939> DVD<00:00:30.510> shelf<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.840> on

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
can see so like that the DVD shelf is on

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.530 
can see so like that the DVD shelf is on
this<00:00:31.080> wall<00:00:31.289> I'm<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.040> blurry<00:00:32.880> shelf<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.420> that

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
this wall I'm a blurry shelf is that

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.930 
this wall I'm a blurry shelf is that
some<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> opposite<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.290> window<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:35.340> yeah

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
some the opposite the window so yeah

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.700 
some the opposite the window so yeah
it's<00:00:36.210> like<00:00:36.300> an<00:00:36.450> Ace<00:00:36.570> or<00:00:36.690> coroner<00:00:37.140> for<00:00:37.320> movies

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
it's like an Ace or coroner for movies

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.010 
it's like an Ace or coroner for movies
such<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.280> think<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.760> cool<00:00:39.059> because<00:00:39.809> it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
such as I I think so cool because it

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.170 
such as I I think so cool because it
meets<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.440> movies<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.040> closer<00:00:41.460> together<00:00:41.700> but

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
meets the movies I closer together but

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.450 
meets the movies I closer together but
not<00:00:42.300> cramped<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.350> really<00:00:43.649> do<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.219> but

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
not cramped so I really do like that but

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.790 
not cramped so I really do like that but
I<00:00:44.489> will<00:00:44.640> give<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> little<00:00:45.170> tour<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.649> not
