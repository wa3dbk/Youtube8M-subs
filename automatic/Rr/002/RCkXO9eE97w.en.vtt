00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Look, I was a beauty who said goodbye and 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.379
 Today's video is about pdcs goal and came out on 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.750
 May 28th 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.090
 then this psychic who changed 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.179
 main change was to sic k 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.190
 during matches before when you 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.600
 go out with your whole team, that's all. 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.430
 starting desconectassem 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.840
 You do not have to leave the game and 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.300
 you would not take a seat 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.099
 then all his team for example if 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.140
 faced hackers was face believer 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.359
 going out running and a winery if everyone 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.520
 if you could go out with the whole team in 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.739
 starting and shortly after starting the new 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.809
 without worrying about the bank 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.090
 now I will not tell you more 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.570
 Connect everyone is still going to continue 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.340
 running to you is being banned for time 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.420
 so it was a very big change that 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.059
 last update 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.070
 Furthermore interesting is also that 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.899
 inventories the new exchanges when you 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.079
 have more than ten items you can click 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.719
 on the gun and click on how to use the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.390
 exchange contract before and has had to 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.150
 I came here in the inventory to look for the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.140
 exchange contract then look for 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.939
 they made it easy enough that 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.689
 all the work he had to find 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.979
 room is good traditional also here one 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.189
 new set 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.650
 trittin then when you come here in 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.479
 khemisset options also here one 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.259
 tweet setup 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:32.070
 to leave your profile private the staff 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.500
 depending on how the note is your 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.420
 profile even then dedicated to the front 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.610
 you can always see the profile as public 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.390
 can see with the number of wins and 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.899
 stuff like that 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.549
 there by the passage now talking about the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.079
 changes do not see feet for who do not 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.850
 knows how to see a play when she 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.290
 it's time to meet because the map 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.220
 which involves spending more of the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.960
 time 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.000
 modifying leaving one more 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.549
 increasingly competitive with each update 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.399
 in the morning that modifies a little map 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.740
 and now the main change was the track 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.520
 they closed the way that came by 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.369
 here is a way here 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.750
 the cds went by the same website to get here and 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:14.660
 had a direct side door in the middle 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.000
 closed door and that the new door 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.890
 here is our way and you will arrive 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.290
 through a website b 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.989
 this will ease the roles in the 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.150
 map that was balanced a bit more 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:31.010
 sure now has a little more 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.470
 balanced with up since just 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.260
 change more other things pretty thing 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.170
 was identified in bed because the map 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.920
 1.6 was well modified and 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.170
 golf 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.920
 good before and able to plant teaching 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.579
 this house 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.579
 the cs go considerably a bug was 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:51.980
 removed from this plant position and 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:55.069
 position that most moved here more 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.970
 they moved here in 2002 and did 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:02.239
 higher this year and jump the zip had 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.170
 good bongue also this status is more 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.790
 high that she can work from within 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.340
 to modify the people that these paths 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.769
 made 11 afi more closed around here 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.269
 increased is also so expensive 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:19.010
 can not stay inside the goal by 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:21.889
 out of you and in law is just the 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.780
 head or there should be nothing 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.750
 inside and also had a good indication 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.450
 in this passage above that before 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.139
 had in the body of the small extend 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.000
 enough here and left 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:41.150
 even though these barrels will be over 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.970
 here is yet another significant change in 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.639
 in the game was that they got quite 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.930
 fog that had this map that is a 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:52.669
 thing that hinders rather inclusive 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.599
 fps your machine was slightly impaired 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.700
 by the mist 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:59.750
 now it's a bit cleaner a little 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.919
 more beautiful but we want to watch these 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.919
 were the main changes in the 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:06.740
 society to whom it accesses all this 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:10.660
 President I put the link for you 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.660
 This video is now the next
