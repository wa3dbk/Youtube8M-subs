voice I mean these headphones burn her

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.340 
voice I mean these headphones burn her
voice<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.880> was<00:02:25.000> like<00:02:25.180> they<00:02:25.209> cheated<00:02:25.930> back<00:02:26.110> from

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
voice it was like they cheated back from

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.430
