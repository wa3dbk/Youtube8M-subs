the cuttings that we did the other
things<00:00:09.030> like<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.240> couple<00:00:09.510> weeks<00:00:09.690> ago<00:00:09.840> around

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
things like a couple weeks ago around

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.120 
things like a couple weeks ago around
there<00:00:11.750> they've<00:00:12.750> started<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.440> develop<00:00:13.650> chutes

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
there they've started to develop chutes

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
there they've started to develop chutes
and<00:00:14.460> as<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.269> can<00:00:15.389> see<00:00:15.599> from<00:00:15.990> right<00:00:16.350> here

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
and as you can see from right here

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.240 
and as you can see from right here
those<00:00:18.150> little<00:00:18.449> shoots<00:00:18.840> coming<00:00:19.140> off<00:00:19.350> there's

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
those little shoots coming off there's

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.320 
those little shoots coming off there's
going<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.460> be<00:00:20.520> another<00:00:20.699> one<00:00:20.880> right<00:00:21.029> there<00:00:21.060> as

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
going to be another one right there as

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.710 
going to be another one right there as
well

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
well

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.990 
well
and<00:00:22.109> this<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.160> basically<00:00:23.430> what<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.640> wanted<00:00:23.910> to

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
and this is basically what I wanted to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.429 
and this is basically what I wanted to
talk<00:00:24.180> about<00:00:24.210> today<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.080> when<00:00:25.289> you

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
talk about today is that when you

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.070 
talk about today is that when you
propagate<00:00:25.800> your<00:00:26.039> lucky<00:00:26.310> bamboo<00:00:26.900> shoots<00:00:27.900> will

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
propagate your lucky bamboo shoots will

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.730 
propagate your lucky bamboo shoots will
develop<00:00:28.529> off<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> plants<00:00:29.490> at<00:00:30.179> different

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
develop off of the plants at different

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.160 
develop off of the plants at different
parts<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.009> plant<00:00:32.250> but<00:00:33.059> mainly<00:00:33.630> they<00:00:33.960> will

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
parts of the plant but mainly they will

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.549 
parts of the plant but mainly they will
develop<00:00:35.010> around<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.640> rings<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.180> plant

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
develop around the rings of the plant

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.260 
develop around the rings of the plant
and<00:00:37.559> what<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.739> mean<00:00:37.950> by<00:00:38.160> rings<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.850> mean<00:00:39.059> these

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and what I mean by rings is I mean these

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.389 
and what I mean by rings is I mean these
little<00:00:39.420> rings<00:00:39.719> right<00:00:39.899> here<00:00:40.170> these<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
little rings right here these are the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.180 
little rings right here these are the
growth<00:00:41.879> newts<00:00:42.570> or<00:00:42.989> something<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.739> some

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
growth newts or something like that some

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.430 
growth newts or something like that some
doesn't<00:00:45.090> people<00:00:45.180> call<00:00:45.510> them<00:00:45.660> as<00:00:45.989> far<00:00:46.200> as<00:00:46.320> I've

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
doesn't people call them as far as I've

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.549 
doesn't people call them as far as I've
been<00:00:46.469> reading<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> internet<00:00:48.260> but<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.469> me

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
been reading on the internet but for me

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.439 
been reading on the internet but for me
they're<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:49.890> called<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.879> rings<00:00:51.090> around

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
they're just called the the rings around

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.150 
they're just called the the rings around
the<00:00:51.690> bamboo<00:00:52.079> stalk<00:00:54.500> but<00:00:55.500> basically<00:00:56.010> what

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
the bamboo stalk but basically what

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.930 
the bamboo stalk but basically what
happens<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:57.109> this<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.170> where<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.160> bamboo<00:00:59.760> has

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
happens is this is where the bamboo has

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.240 
happens is this is where the bamboo has
grown<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.140> how<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.350> bamboo

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
grown and this is how the bamboo

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.070 
grown and this is how the bamboo
develops<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.120> gotten<00:01:03.480> bigger<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.809> bigger

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
develops it's gotten bigger and bigger

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.590 
develops it's gotten bigger and bigger
and<00:01:04.409> these<00:01:05.129> rings<00:01:05.460> are<00:01:05.790> where<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.060> leaves<00:01:06.270> were

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
and these rings are where it leaves were

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.750 
and these rings are where it leaves were
growing<00:01:06.869> out<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.500> that's<00:01:08.159> mainly<00:01:08.520> why

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
growing out of so that's mainly why

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.590 
growing out of so that's mainly why
they're<00:01:08.970> there<00:01:09.350> but<00:01:10.580> these<00:01:11.580> shoots<00:01:12.060> develop

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
they're there but these shoots develop

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.960 
they're there but these shoots develop
out<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:13.020> these<00:01:13.650> rings<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.220> either<00:01:14.430> side<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
out of these rings on either side of the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.450 
out of these rings on either side of the
plant<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:16.229> funny<00:01:16.439> thing<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.920> I've<00:01:17.040> noticed

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
plant the funny thing is is I've noticed

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.090 
plant the funny thing is is I've noticed
is<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.820> whenever<00:01:18.060> i<00:01:18.570> propagate<00:01:18.990> bamboo<00:01:19.830> I

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
is that whenever i propagate bamboo I

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.520 
is that whenever i propagate bamboo I
always<00:01:20.970> get<00:01:21.210> two<00:01:21.540> shoots<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.170> come<00:01:22.229> off<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
always get two shoots that come off the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.200 
always get two shoots that come off the
plan<00:01:22.830> no<00:01:22.979> matter<00:01:23.040> what<00:01:23.960> I<00:01:25.009> could<00:01:26.009> cut<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.060> way

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
plan no matter what I could cut it way

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.780 
plan no matter what I could cut it way
down<00:01:27.390> here<00:01:27.689> say<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.380> I'll<00:01:29.100> still<00:01:29.369> get<00:01:29.520> two

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
down here say and I'll still get two

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.310 
down here say and I'll still get two
shoots<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.390> come<00:01:30.509> off<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.780> plant<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.290> I

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
shoots that come off the plant so I

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.170 
shoots that come off the plant so I
don't<00:01:31.680> know<00:01:31.770> what<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.700> that's<00:01:32.939> just

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
don't know what it is but that's just

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.800 
don't know what it is but that's just
how<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.420> happens<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:35.210> that's<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.630> is

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
how it happens so that's this is

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.450 
how it happens so that's this is
basically<00:01:37.140> how<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.409> looks<00:01:37.740> for<00:01:37.920> people<00:01:38.070> that

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
basically how it looks for people that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.330 
basically how it looks for people that
want<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.420> know<00:01:39.600> how<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.710> shoots<00:01:40.979> will<00:01:41.159> look

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
want to know how the shoots will look

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.590 
want to know how the shoots will look
once<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.700> certain<00:01:41.880> once<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.270> start<00:01:42.509> to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
once a certain once they start to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.999 
once a certain once they start to
develop<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.140> case<00:01:43.320> you're<00:01:43.470> wondering<00:01:43.680> how<00:01:43.860> to

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
develop in case you're wondering how to

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.359 
develop in case you're wondering how to
propagate<00:01:44.369> bamboo<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.100> how<00:01:47.220> they

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
propagate bamboo so this is how they

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.920 
propagate bamboo so this is how they
look<00:01:47.520> they<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:48.000> come<00:01:48.270> off<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.540> plant<00:01:48.780> like

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
look they just come off the plant like

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.690 
look they just come off the plant like
this<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.409> they<00:01:49.500> get<00:01:49.649> bigger<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.070> bigger<00:01:50.220> by

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
this and they get bigger and bigger by

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.660 
this and they get bigger and bigger by
the<00:01:50.729> time<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.119> know<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.509> got<00:01:51.829> a<00:01:52.829> big<00:01:53.399> shoot

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
the time you know it you got a big shoot

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.719 
the time you know it you got a big shoot
like<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:53.909> coming<00:01:54.390> off<00:01:55.040> now<00:01:56.040> one<00:01:56.460> thing<00:01:56.640> you

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
like this coming off now one thing you

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.920 
like this coming off now one thing you
got<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.850> be<00:01:57.000> careful<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.659> they're

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
got to be careful of is that they're

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.990 
got to be careful of is that they're
very<00:01:58.170> delicate<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.040> if<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.250> drop<00:01:59.520> your<00:01:59.759> stock

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
very delicate so if you drop your stock

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.760 
very delicate so if you drop your stock
or<00:02:00.409> you<00:02:01.409> bump<00:02:01.619> into<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.159> because<00:02:02.820> much

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
or you bump into it because much

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.919 
or you bump into it because much
or<00:02:04.369> break<00:02:04.759> them<00:02:04.969> off<00:02:05.149> and<00:02:05.420> then<00:02:05.539> you<00:02:05.810> know

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
or break them off and then you know

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.109 
or break them off and then you know
there<00:02:06.079> you<00:02:06.200> go<00:02:06.350> they're<00:02:06.560> gone<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.909> really

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
there you go they're gone so you really

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.520 
there you go they're gone so you really
want<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.390> be<00:02:08.479> careful<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:08.989> really<00:02:09.259> want<00:02:09.440> to

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
want to be careful you really want to

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.920 
want to be careful you really want to
make<00:02:09.679> sure<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:10.879> you<00:02:11.209> don't<00:02:11.390> knock<00:02:11.720> these

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
make sure that you don't knock these

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.559 
make sure that you don't knock these
around<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.379> you<00:02:12.470> keep<00:02:12.620> them<00:02:12.739> in<00:02:12.800> a<00:02:12.890> safe<00:02:13.069> place

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
around and you keep them in a safe place

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.619 
around and you keep them in a safe place
and<00:02:14.569> another<00:02:15.110> thing<00:02:15.379> is<00:02:15.910> our<00:02:16.910> cuttings<00:02:17.360> that

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
and another thing is our cuttings that

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.199 
and another thing is our cuttings that
we<00:02:17.959> did<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.500> other<00:02:18.650> couple<00:02:19.280> weeks<00:02:19.430> ago<00:02:19.610> have

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
we did the other couple weeks ago have

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.839 
we did the other couple weeks ago have
started<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.840> develop<00:02:21.080> roots<00:02:21.410> as<00:02:21.590> well<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.730> you

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
started to develop roots as well and you

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.780 
started to develop roots as well and you
can<00:02:23.030> see<00:02:23.239> that<00:02:23.450> right<00:02:23.959> here<00:02:24.280> see<00:02:25.280> that<00:02:25.310> tiny

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
can see that right here see that tiny

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.559 
can see that right here see that tiny
tiny<00:02:26.030> little<00:02:26.330> rope<00:02:26.690> coming<00:02:26.900> off<00:02:27.110> right<00:02:27.769> there

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
tiny little rope coming off right there

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.940 
tiny little rope coming off right there
the<00:02:29.569> roots<00:02:29.780> will<00:02:29.930> develop<00:02:30.379> around<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.739> edge

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
the roots will develop around the edge

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.710 
the roots will develop around the edge
of<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.459> cutting<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.030> then<00:02:32.269> start<00:02:32.599> developing

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
of the cutting and then start developing

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.069 
of the cutting and then start developing
in<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.379> center<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.790> cutting<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:35.540> like<00:02:35.959> I

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
in the center of the cutting and like I

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.110 
in the center of the cutting and like I
said<00:02:36.260> make<00:02:36.440> sure<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.650> don't<00:02:36.829> do<00:02:37.040> too<00:02:37.730> much<00:02:37.880> leg

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
said make sure you don't do too much leg

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.729 
said make sure you don't do too much leg
stripping<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:38.720> want<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:38.930> keep<00:02:39.079> as<00:02:39.290> much<00:02:39.440> later

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
stripping you want to keep as much later

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.370 
stripping you want to keep as much later
on<00:02:39.829> there<00:02:40.010> as<00:02:40.130> possible<00:02:40.670> but<00:02:40.849> still<00:02:41.380> exposing

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
on there as possible but still exposing

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.160 
on there as possible but still exposing
the<00:02:42.560> bottom<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.489> stock<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:45.049> also

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
the bottom of the stock and you also

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.110 
the bottom of the stock and you also
want<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.470> be<00:02:45.560> careful<00:02:45.920> with<00:02:46.069> the<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.700> cuttings

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
want to be careful with the the cuttings

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.509 
want to be careful with the the cuttings
too<00:02:47.329> because<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.170> cuttings<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:49.160> roots<00:02:49.370> on

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
too because the cuttings the roots on

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.759 
too because the cuttings the roots on
the<00:02:49.610> cuttings<00:02:49.880> are<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:51.019> know<00:02:51.140> once<00:02:51.560> again

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
the cuttings are you know once again

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.339 
the cuttings are you know once again
very<00:02:51.980> delicate<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:53.750> can't<00:02:53.930> be<00:02:54.079> moving

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
very delicate and you can't be moving

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:55.960 
very delicate and you can't be moving
these<00:02:54.440> around<00:02:54.799> from<00:02:55.130> you<00:02:55.280> know<00:02:55.370> container<00:02:55.790> to

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
these around from you know container to

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.610 
these around from you know container to
container<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:57.079> know<00:02:57.170> just<00:02:57.440> try<00:02:57.560> to

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
container and you know just try to

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.930 
container and you know just try to
recover<00:02:57.890> with<00:02:58.099> and<00:02:58.280> where<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.579> could<00:02:58.760> ruin

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
recover with and where you could ruin

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.370 
recover with and where you could ruin
them<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.360> then<00:02:59.510> you're<00:03:00.140> gonna<00:03:00.260> be

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
them and then you're gonna be

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.750 
them and then you're gonna be
disappointed<00:03:01.010> because<00:03:01.069> your<00:03:01.310> plant<00:03:01.549> is<00:03:01.640> going

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
disappointed because your plant is going

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.440 
disappointed because your plant is going
to<00:03:01.849> be<00:03:01.970> dead

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
to be dead

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.220 
to be dead
so<00:03:03.250> another<00:03:04.250> thing<00:03:04.540> people<00:03:05.540> keep<00:03:05.690> on<00:03:05.780> asking

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
so another thing people keep on asking

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.440 
so another thing people keep on asking
me<00:03:06.290> which<00:03:07.099> I<00:03:07.220> haven't<00:03:07.400> addressed<00:03:07.730> yet<00:03:08.000> fully

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
me which I haven't addressed yet fully

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.379 
me which I haven't addressed yet fully
so<00:03:08.840> I'm<00:03:08.930> going<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.200> do<00:03:09.350> that<00:03:09.470> now<00:03:09.650> is<00:03:10.329> if<00:03:11.329> you

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
so I'm going to do that now is if you

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.199 
so I'm going to do that now is if you
could<00:03:11.750> cut<00:03:12.049> your<00:03:12.590> bamboo<00:03:12.859> in<00:03:13.160> half<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.670> then

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
could cut your bamboo in half and then

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.300 
could cut your bamboo in half and then
put<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.600> bottom<00:03:14.930> half<00:03:15.139> or<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.829> top<00:03:16.010> cut<00:03:16.220> off

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
put the bottom half or the top cut off

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.360 
put the bottom half or the top cut off
rather<00:03:16.670> whichever<00:03:17.359> end<00:03:17.590> put<00:03:18.590> that<00:03:18.799> into<00:03:19.130> a

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
rather whichever end put that into a

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.789 
rather whichever end put that into a
glass<00:03:19.700> of<00:03:19.880> water<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.480> will<00:03:21.109> that<00:03:21.290> develop

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
glass of water and will that develop

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.410 
glass of water and will that develop
roots<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.609> cooking<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:22.940> answer<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.299> that

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
roots and the cooking the answer to that

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.509 
roots and the cooking the answer to that
question<00:03:23.840> is<00:03:23.989> no<00:03:24.230> they<00:03:24.440> won't<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:24.889> tried<00:03:25.250> many

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
question is no they won't I tried many

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.330 
question is no they won't I tried many
times<00:03:25.819> and<00:03:26.150> it's<00:03:27.139> never<00:03:27.440> worked<00:03:27.769> for<00:03:27.950> me<00:03:28.010> and

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
times and it's never worked for me and

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.030 
times and it's never worked for me and
the<00:03:28.730> thing<00:03:28.970> is<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.389> can't<00:03:29.660> tell<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:30.019> why<00:03:30.260> they

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
the thing is I can't tell you why they

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.500 
the thing is I can't tell you why they
won't<00:03:31.250> develop<00:03:31.370> roots<00:03:31.760> it's<00:03:31.970> just<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:32.239> don't

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
won't develop roots it's just I don't

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.129 
won't develop roots it's just I don't
know<00:03:33.250> that<00:03:34.250> I've<00:03:34.370> tried<00:03:34.670> many<00:03:35.569> times<00:03:35.840> I've

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
know that I've tried many times I've

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.050 
know that I've tried many times I've
done<00:03:36.290> research<00:03:36.680> on<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.040> Internet<00:03:37.430> I've

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
done research on the Internet I've

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.420 
done research on the Internet I've
looked<00:03:38.329> in<00:03:38.510> as<00:03:38.660> many<00:03:38.840> books<00:03:39.109> as<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.470> can<00:03:39.739> and<00:03:40.069> for

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
looked in as many books as I can and for

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.190 
looked in as many books as I can and for
some<00:03:40.609> reason<00:03:41.000> if<00:03:41.150> you<00:03:41.299> do<00:03:41.480> cut<00:03:41.750> this<00:03:41.959> off

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
some reason if you do cut this off

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.870 
some reason if you do cut this off
they're<00:03:42.650> just<00:03:42.859> it's<00:03:43.069> not<00:03:43.370> going<00:03:43.579> to<00:03:43.670> develop

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
they're just it's not going to develop

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.720 
they're just it's not going to develop
roots<00:03:44.180> it's<00:03:44.420> impossible<00:03:45.049> so<00:03:45.889> for<00:03:46.579> those<00:03:46.669> of

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
roots it's impossible so for those of

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.309 
roots it's impossible so for those of
you<00:03:46.910> that<00:03:47.209> want<00:03:47.359> to<00:03:47.450> try<00:03:47.630> that<00:03:47.840> don't<00:03:48.109> because

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
you that want to try that don't because

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.190 
you that want to try that don't because
you're<00:03:48.380> just<00:03:48.560> kind<00:03:48.799> of<00:03:48.859> ruin<00:03:49.069> your<00:03:49.220> plant<00:03:49.459> so

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
you're just kind of ruin your plant so

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.199 
you're just kind of ruin your plant so
just<00:03:51.200> stick<00:03:51.950> with<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.310> main<00:03:52.549> means<00:03:52.970> of

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
just stick with the main means of

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.690 
just stick with the main means of
propagation<00:03:53.870> which<00:03:54.079> is<00:03:54.230> basically<00:03:54.700> cutting

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
propagation which is basically cutting

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.659 
propagation which is basically cutting
the<00:03:56.030> growths<00:03:56.720> off<00:03:56.989> and<00:03:57.319> then<00:03:57.980> cutting<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.489> top

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
the growths off and then cutting the top

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.940 
the growths off and then cutting the top
of<00:03:58.819> the<00:03:58.910> plant<00:03:59.150> off<00:03:59.359> to<00:03:59.660> promote<00:04:00.500> new<00:04:00.709> growth

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
of the plant off to promote new growth

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.580 
of the plant off to promote new growth
throughout<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.430> plant<00:04:02.019> and<00:04:03.019> what<00:04:03.470> we're

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
throughout the plant and what we're

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.110 
throughout the plant and what we're
thinking<00:04:03.739> I<00:04:03.950> want<00:04:04.130> to<00:04:04.220> tell<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:04.519> guys<00:04:04.669> is<00:04:04.819> that
