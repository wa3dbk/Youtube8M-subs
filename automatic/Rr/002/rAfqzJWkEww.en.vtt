 Belgium against the Netherlands in appearance 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.970
 is the third match in the elite round 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.230

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.269
 stekelenburg 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.349
 a win a draw and this one 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.059
 contest 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.740
 supplies with a win for orange 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.840
 so the first place but the Belgians 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.880
 have their previous two games 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.619
 won in this elite round 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.660
 and two matches were with a 4 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.250
 0 result for Belgium 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.130
 the opening phase and the goalkeeper is an ax 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.869
 who gets injured and so the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.769
 keeper nijenhuis the keeper of fc 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.890
 utrecht 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.960
 start warming up belgium in the first ten 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.600
 minute strong will netherlands and this is 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.430
 a very nice action from Dennis van 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.110
 vaerenberg the player of club brugge he 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.450
 scored three goals in the previous two 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.710
 matches of belgium 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.050
 This ends well for the Netherlands 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.149
 not for goalkeeper justin bijlo 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.820
 he is injured in such a way that he already 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.620
 in the opening stages of the match though 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.090
 needs to be replaced after ten minutes 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.460
 to become 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.780
 and so goalie is thyme home of FC 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.860
 utrecht came within the lines 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.909
 shot is of office chair from here 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.189
 manchester city 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.659
 but it does not benefit the Netherlands 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.810
 The Netherlands does get a little more control 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.330
 the game with cave that first 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.340
 the base stands for the Netherlands 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.409
 last Saturday he was still on the raid 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.650
 and animals it is the Belgians and this is 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.840
 or a very nice promotion for Belgium 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.220
 Of camp jorn player 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.770
 Anderlecht 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.310
 hit the bar and therefore a huge opportunity 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.460
 Netherlands to Belgium to participate with red 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.020
 soon 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.020
 and that goes down and the 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.600
 referee from portugal very simo 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.240
 decides to whistle it again and there 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.090
 the free kick is the free kick from 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.340
 share rose then but again it delivers 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.290
 the Netherlands nothing 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.479
 this looks like a good attack with van 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.710
 whirring from whirring is over from 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.710
 karel 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.050
 but again orange becomes the team of 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.840
 maarten stekelenburg not dangerous 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.200
 the second half starts with a whole 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.200
 nice head butt from reda boultam 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.970
 one of the players of ajax de belg 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.280
 enough to tie 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.420
 first to be in this pool 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.640
 Belgians who are also already in the 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.830
 qualifying round the previous round three 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.180
 matches in a row managed to win 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.959
 they do not yet have this against the Netherlands 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.630
 won 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.700
 although this is again a very nice one 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.700
 chance is again it's van vaerenberg 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:36.130
 belgium with mangala substitute at the 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.320
 Belgians who comes the long ball and it 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.329
 there will be no shot of verburg 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.070
 again it becomes dangerous and there 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.739
 the ball hits the post and here 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.470
 the Netherlands is well away from Vaerenbergh 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.920
 involved again in this attack 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.360
 it remains only 0 0 and here is cave that 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.620
 creates space and there it comes 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.570
 shot 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.410
 night you're roberta with the chance the 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.900
 Belgian goalie cake is in good shape 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.459
 and still 0 0 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.829
 we are going halfway to the final phase 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.870
 of this competition 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.280
 the Belgians continue with the draw 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.290
 are then assured of the first place 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:17.980
 while the Netherlands still has something 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:20.560
 creates cave of nec fc oss with the chance 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.340
 again belgium again it's the substitute 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.440
 mancala and again the bar 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.890
 orange escapes again 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.890
 backlog 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.440
 now in the absolute final phase the Netherlands can 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.780
 create something else the ball does not get there 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.819
 right at the foot of the bijleveld but 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.280
 then there is a substitute 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.470
 for sale meijers from az just inside the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.390
 lines and then it's done 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.340
 Belgium is the number one Netherlands 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.000
 ends in second place 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.580
 but seven out of eight numbers 2 in this one 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.140
 qualification still go to it 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.420
 European championship 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.410
 so the joy for the Belgians is only 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.510
 The Netherlands of course has a whole 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.959
 great opportunity to qualify for it 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.959
 punctures
