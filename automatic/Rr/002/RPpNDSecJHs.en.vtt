this<00:00:26.449> fours<00:00:26.779> I<00:00:27.470> have<00:00:27.710> a<00:00:27.770> lot<00:00:27.919> of<00:00:27.950> AI<00:00:28.579> and<00:00:28.939> the<00:00:29.059> is

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:29.329 
this fours I have a lot of AI and the is

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.280 
this fours I have a lot of AI and the is
lenses<00:00:29.840> it<00:00:29.989> the<00:00:31.000> younger<00:00:32.000> models<00:00:32.419> don't<00:00:32.989> seem

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
lenses it the younger models don't seem

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.860 
lenses it the younger models don't seem
to<00:00:33.530> do<00:00:34.280> any<00:00:34.430> light<00:00:34.640> metering<00:00:35.000> with<00:00:35.239> those<00:00:35.390> so

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
to do any light metering with those so

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.180 
to do any light metering with those so
this<00:00:36.379> is<00:00:36.559> the<00:00:36.789> last<00:00:37.789> model<00:00:38.629> fully<00:00:39.410> before<00:00:39.980> you

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
this is the last model fully before you

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.779 
this is the last model fully before you
get<00:00:40.340> into<00:00:41.860> the<00:00:42.860> full<00:00:43.460> frame<00:00:43.820> also<00:00:45.699> pretty<00:00:46.699> sure

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
get into the full frame also pretty sure

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:54.639 
get into the full frame also pretty sure
that<00:00:47.059> this<00:00:47.210> does

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:01.080 

or<00:00:55.640> she<00:00:55.879> could

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.670 

after<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.630> instruction<00:01:02.140> books<00:01:02.350> that<00:01:02.530> nobody

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
after the instruction books that nobody

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:19.380 
after the instruction books that nobody
ever<00:01:02.980> reads

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.950 

like<00:01:20.390> describe<00:01:22.150> it<00:01:23.150> thought<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.510> same<00:01:23.750> one

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
like describe it thought the same one

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:33.910 
like describe it thought the same one
that<00:01:23.990> actually<00:01:24.320> came<00:01:24.710> up<00:01:25.240> 5300<00:01:28.150> Shia<00:01:32.650> this<00:01:33.650> is

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
that actually came up 5300 Shia this is

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.430 
that actually came up 5300 Shia this is
definitely<00:01:34.370> different<00:01:34.670> from<00:01:35.000> my<00:01:35.210> @d<00:01:35.480> 5300<00:01:36.350> so

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
definitely different from my @d 5300 so

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
definitely different from my @d 5300 so
that's<00:01:39.440> probably<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:39.770> same<00:01:40.010> one<00:01:40.190> that<00:01:40.220> comes

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
that's probably the same one that comes

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.800 
that's probably the same one that comes
with<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.790> P<00:01:40.910> 7100<00:01:41.780> series<00:01:41.860> plus<00:01:42.860> every<00:01:43.130> 100

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
with the P 7100 series plus every 100

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:53.520 
with the P 7100 series plus every 100
are<00:01:44.810> you<00:01:44.960> saying<00:01:45.230> very<00:01:45.560> cool

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.970 

second<00:01:54.530> USB<00:01:54.950> cord

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.990 

remember<00:02:01.980> eyepiece<00:02:02.460> looks<00:02:03.210> like<00:02:03.590> some<00:02:04.590> sort

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
remember eyepiece looks like some sort

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:20.930 
remember eyepiece looks like some sort
of<00:02:06.000> rabies<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.870> last<00:02:19.350> but<00:02:19.530> not<00:02:19.680> least<00:02:19.980> it's

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
of rabies and last but not least it's

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.890 
of rabies and last but not least it's
full<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.300> audio

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900 

or<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.380> already<00:02:28.530> tell<00:02:28.770> it's<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.160> EPA<00:02:29.730> than

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
or I can already tell it's the EPA than

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:44.340 
or I can already tell it's the EPA than
my<00:02:30.320> 5300

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.000 

I<00:02:44.410> am<00:02:45.070> challenge<00:02:45.670> ready<00:02:46.920> all<00:02:47.920> right

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
I am challenge ready all right

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:59.010 
I am challenge ready all right
that's<00:02:51.010> beautiful

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.520 

it<00:02:59.530> looks<00:02:59.830> probably<00:03:00.550> exactly<00:03:00.910> like<00:03:01.330> the

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
it looks probably exactly like the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.910 
it looks probably exactly like the
70-200<00:03:02.560> moves<00:03:03.400> at<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.670> stand<00:03:03.970> my<00:03:04.720> 7100<00:03:05.500> was<00:03:05.770> in

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
70-200 moves at the stand my 7100 was in

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.160 
70-200 moves at the stand my 7100 was in
the<00:03:05.980> same<00:03:06.250> same<00:03:07.090> body<00:03:07.390> it's<00:03:07.630> part<00:03:07.780> of<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.930> same

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
the same same body it's part of the same

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.000 
the same same body it's part of the same
exact<00:03:08.910> chassis<00:03:10.650> entirely<00:03:11.650> sure<00:03:11.980> if<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:12.370> guess<00:03:12.610> I

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
exact chassis entirely sure if I guess I

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.510 
exact chassis entirely sure if I guess I
love<00:03:15.010> this<00:03:15.130> little<00:03:15.370> d-pad<00:03:15.880> in<00:03:16.210> there<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:18.370> one

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
love this little d-pad in there the one

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.840 
love this little d-pad in there the one

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
tactile e to clicky for me it always

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:36.170 
tactile e to clicky for me it always
doesn't<00:03:26.740> seem<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.810> work<00:03:28.810> well<00:03:28.840> for<00:03:29.110> me

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.660 

I'm<00:03:36.599> gonna<00:03:36.810> papa

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.130 

nice<00:04:05.410> of<00:04:06.410> that<00:04:06.709> battery

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
nice of that battery

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.760 
nice of that battery
hopefully<00:04:09.140> it<00:04:09.200> is<00:04:09.290> somewhat<00:04:09.560> of<00:04:09.680> a<00:04:09.739> challenge

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
hopefully it is somewhat of a challenge

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:18.979 
hopefully it is somewhat of a challenge
on

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:33.770 

and

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:46.149 

never<00:04:34.780> look<00:04:34.930> like<00:04:34.960> that<00:04:35.139> again

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:46.159 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:49.519 

and<00:04:47.159> I<00:04:47.699> am<00:04:47.939> probably<00:04:48.599> almost<00:04:48.900> certain<00:04:49.499> that

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:49.529 
and I am probably almost certain that

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:52.549 
and I am probably almost certain that
this<00:04:49.740> is<00:04:49.800> if<00:04:50.699> not<00:04:50.909> close<00:04:51.509> to<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:51.930> exact<00:04:52.349> is

00:04:52.549 --> 00:04:52.559 
this is if not close to the exact is

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:58.040 
this is if not close to the exact is
probably<00:04:53.039> of<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:54.360> firmware<00:04:54.689> about<00:04:55.169> 70<00:04:57.050> 205

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
probably of the firmware about 70 205

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:12.909 
probably of the firmware about 70 205
not<00:04:58.289> really<00:04:58.889> really<00:04:59.189> close

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919

I<00:05:15.210> don't<00:05:15.630> think<00:05:15.660> it'll<00:05:15.900> let<00:05:16.050> you<00:05:16.080> do<00:05:16.320> that

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:44.410 

weights<00:05:36.290> up

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.570 

very<00:05:45.020> cool

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.120 

I<00:05:47.990> like<00:05:48.990> it<00:05:49.200> it's<00:05:49.770> very<00:05:50.130> nice

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
I like it it's very nice

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.530 
I like it it's very nice
