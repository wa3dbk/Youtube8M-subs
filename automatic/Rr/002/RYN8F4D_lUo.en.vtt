00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.870 
the highest I want to run is 120 but 135
little<00:00:31.080> bit<00:00:31.199> higher<00:00:31.320> than<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.650> but<00:00:32.009> really

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
little bit higher than that but really

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.130 
little bit higher than that but really
is<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.120> going<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> hurt<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.630> horns<00:00:33.960> because

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
is it going to hurt the horns because

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.720 
is it going to hurt the horns because
they're<00:00:34.320> rated<00:00:34.620> for<00:00:34.800> 140<00:00:36.680> okay<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.520> have

angle but there's a quarter inch port on
the<00:01:10.229> bottom<00:01:10.560> which<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.830> installed<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.280> drain

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the bottom which I installed the drain

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
ports up top here now on one of these

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.870 
ports up top here now on one of these
ports<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.450> installed<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.259> half<00:01:19.439> inch<00:01:19.680> t<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
ports I installed a half inch t the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.550 
ports I installed a half inch t the
bottom<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.330> which<00:01:21.479> goes<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> safety<00:01:22.409> valve

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
bottom of which goes to a safety valve

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.969 
bottom of which goes to a safety valve
that<00:01:22.860> pops<00:01:23.130> at<00:01:23.280> 150<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.960> top<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.439> which<00:01:25.650> goes

to a quarter inch Quick Connect which

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.749 
to a quarter inch Quick Connect which
eventually<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.759> plan<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.299> hooking<00:01:30.990> up<00:01:31.140> an<00:01:32.070> air

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
eventually I plan on hooking up an air

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.359 
eventually I plan on hooking up an air
gauge<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.780> possibly<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.829> bill<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.070> don't

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
gauge to and possibly a bill I don't

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.149 
gauge to and possibly a bill I don't
know<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.610> haven't<00:01:35.970> gotten<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.920> bell<00:01:37.920> mount

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
know I haven't gotten that a bell mount

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.760 
know I haven't gotten that a bell mount
from<00:01:38.340> my<00:01:38.430> car<00:01:38.640> yet<00:01:38.820> now<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> other<00:01:40.350> three

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.090 
from my car yet now in the other three
ports<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.780> have<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:43.939> half<00:01:44.939> inch<00:01:45.180> elbow<00:01:45.960> going<00:01:46.829> to

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
ports I have a half inch elbow going to

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.190 
ports I have a half inch elbow going to
a<00:01:47.509> chrome-plated<00:01:48.509> ball<00:01:49.229> valve<00:01:49.530> ah<00:01:51.020> yeah<00:01:52.020> it's

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
a chrome-plated ball valve ah yeah it's

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.719 
a chrome-plated ball valve ah yeah it's
shiny<00:01:52.700> going<00:01:53.700> up<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.170> 1/2<00:01:55.170> inch<00:01:55.320> airlines<00:01:55.770> now

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
shiny going up to 1/2 inch airlines now

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.270 
shiny going up to 1/2 inch airlines now
the<00:01:57.390> reason<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.810> three<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.200> them<00:01:58.350> well

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
the reason I have three of them well

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.270 
the reason I have three of them well
this<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.610> here<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.590> inlet<00:02:01.590> furred<00:02:01.829> from

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
this one here is the inlet furred from

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.830 
this one here is the inlet furred from
the<00:02:02.399> compressor<00:02:02.930> this<00:02:03.930> one<00:02:04.170> here<00:02:05.119> is<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
the compressor this one here is the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.529 
the compressor this one here is the
outlet<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.860> horn<00:02:08.129> valve<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.700> then<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
outlet to the horn valve and then the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.320 
outlet to the horn valve and then the
third<00:02:09.750> one<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.140> figure<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.950> hook<00:02:11.849> up<00:02:12.060> to

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
third one I figure I can hook up to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.880 
third one I figure I can hook up to
possibly<00:02:13.319> another

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
possibly another

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.280 
possibly another
there<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.790> enough<00:02:15.030> space<00:02:15.150> in<00:02:15.510> my<00:02:15.720> trunk<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.080> fit

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
there is enough space in my trunk to fit

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.880 
there is enough space in my trunk to fit
two<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.620> these<00:02:16.710> 20<00:02:17.040> gallon<00:02:17.310> tanks<00:02:18.890> another

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
two of these 20 gallon tanks another

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.050 
two of these 20 gallon tanks another
horn<00:02:20.220> perhaps<00:02:22.070> maybe<00:02:23.070> an<00:02:23.280> air<00:02:23.430> tool<00:02:23.670> something

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
horn perhaps maybe an air tool something

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.550 
horn perhaps maybe an air tool something
else<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.510> don't<00:02:24.570> know<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.750> haven't<00:02:24.960> decided<00:02:25.110> but

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
else I don't know I haven't decided but

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.710 
else I don't know I haven't decided but
I<00:02:25.800> figure<00:02:26.640> it's<00:02:26.790> good<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.030> have<00:02:27.120> three<00:02:27.360> usable

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
I figure it's good to have three usable

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.450 
I figure it's good to have three usable
ports<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:32.730> goes<00:02:33.120> runs<00:02:33.630> upfront<00:02:33.990> here

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
ports and that goes runs upfront here

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.340 
ports and that goes runs upfront here
comes<00:02:35.460> up<00:02:35.640> through<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.510> backseat<00:02:36.900> here's<00:02:37.230> the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
comes up through the backseat here's the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.070 
comes up through the backseat here's the

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
compressor hose here this hose runs up

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.260 
compressor hose here this hose runs up
down<00:02:43.500> under<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:43.980> compressor<00:02:44.490> between<00:02:45.180> the
