00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.570
 or the one we have from youtube like this one 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.880
 that place is missing 90 with a new video and 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.500
 I asked back this time decides 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.880
 that the truth is very interesting as 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.259
 you can know what is help from 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.670
 some music equalizers 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:24.320
 predetermined that really are not very 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.760
 good these we accede entering what 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.840
 it fits we go to what music is and 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.220
 As you can see, there are 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.129
 equalizations which like them 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.230
 I comment because they are not very good now 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.210
 good with this tweet what it does is in 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.559
 our native music player does not 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.600
 an equalizer is added the truth very 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.640
 very professional as you can see there 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.320
 what is my player and a 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.200
 arrow that under cante goes which 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.760
 we are going to press 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.800
 and at that time it was a small 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.940
 equalizer this good this how 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.230
 I'm going to explain to you great 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.910
 features how this hoist works 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.100
 we have three sequences what are the 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.440
 low mid and highs that are these three 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.030
 how can they check and well here they have 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.489
 which hoist each one for example you 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.020
 they want to equalize what the basses are 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.460
 they choose the frequency is a little 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.010
 complicated but do not get scared or not 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.450
 it's nothing special they choose the 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.170
 frequency in which you want and 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.700
 amplify that those low and good 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.530
 only what he recommended is to put 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.229
 some music for example reproduce 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.509
 some music and then get into what 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.240
 what is the equalizer to you put it 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.770
 you will filter this this filter only 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.310
 in music you must go to play 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.290
 this frequency only so you 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.450
 can look up the frequency of want 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.680
 equalize and increase the gain of this 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.880
 often when they go to increase a lot 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.740
 because this can damage your 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.240
 speaker and good to be on this occasion 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.970
 because they can choose this 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.920
 often you want low 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.990
 this and good can increase the download 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.630
 that frequency and so on it 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.760
 can go to the treble afterwards 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.760
 a frequency that they want to increase 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.610
 they can do what is the ipad 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.900
 so that he can only listen 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.180
 the frequency that you are updating 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.950
 only to hear that they will then 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.100
 they go to what the means are and obviously 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.570
 they also arrive in any of them and 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.860
 automatically when they remove it already 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.750
 will listen to all the music already 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.520
 equalize this also includes what 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.870
 which is a booster glass as they can 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.900
 check here can this put the 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.570
 intensity the frequency that I give them 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.460
 I recommend that they do it for their low 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.680
 approximately 80 depending on 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.550
 funds what frequency reproduce up 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.960
 the 120 by y of 100 110 would be fine 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.880
 obviously of gain because they are about 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.740
 try to upload a lot and good here what 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.060
 can enable or reserve booster the 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.980
 truth is a tweet that is very well 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.540
 it's done very well thought the 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.520
 Equalizer is very very professional me 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.140
 he liked quite goals to install it 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.030
 very simple as we always have to 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.770
 enter this way to wait for it to end 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.000
 load or galicia that ends creation 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.110
 and show demo to find out what is 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.130
 in the lower right we're going to 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.840
 search for 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.300
 by iphone as it appears in the 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.490
 top this has a cost of 2 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.590
 dollars in the big boss network of syria 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.910
 but good as always friends check in 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.210

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.130
 pole 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.300
 it's very important that they do it and here I 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.530

 ensure proper operation is worth 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.710
