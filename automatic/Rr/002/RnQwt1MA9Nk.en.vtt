was nice if I do the keyboard just to go
along<00:00:16.230> with<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.740> but<00:00:17.430> anyway<00:00:17.699> we're<00:00:17.850> gonna

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
2.0 which you can configure a lot of

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.979 
2.0 which you can configure a lot of
things<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.860> we'd<00:00:44.640> go<00:00:44.820> into<00:00:45.270> detail<00:00:45.690> about<00:00:45.719> that

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989

anti-ghosting and also you can change

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.130 
anti-ghosting and also you can change
all<00:00:50.430> your<00:00:50.550> macro<00:00:51.120> keys<00:00:51.420> things<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:51.989> that

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
keyboard not really that important

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.930 
keyboard not really that important
because<00:00:59.789> some<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.329> these<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.780> don't<00:01:01.020> really<00:01:01.320> use

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
because some of these I don't really use

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.579 
because some of these I don't really use
but<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.300> don't<00:01:03.480> read<00:01:03.690> notice<00:01:04.080> them<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:04.470> if

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
but you don't read notice them but if
