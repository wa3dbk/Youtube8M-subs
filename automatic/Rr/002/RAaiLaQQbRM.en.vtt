still kind of see through it
well<00:02:41.709> they'll<00:02:41.859> start<00:02:42.099> turning<00:02:42.489> this<00:02:42.639> I<00:02:43.049> like<00:02:44.049> a

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
well they'll start turning this I like a

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
golden whitish color they'll get me less

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.699 
golden whitish color they'll get me less
see-through<00:02:47.469> and<00:02:47.680> more<00:02:47.889> cooked<00:02:49.560> once<00:02:50.560> we

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
see-through and more cooked once we

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.300 
see-through and more cooked once we
start<00:02:50.980> getting<00:02:51.099> the<00:02:51.280> mostly<00:02:51.669> cooked<00:02:53.310> and

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
start getting the mostly cooked and

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.720 
start getting the mostly cooked and
again<00:02:54.699> these<00:02:54.849> don't<00:02:55.000> take<00:02:55.299> very<00:02:55.629> long<00:02:56.579> once<00:02:57.579> we

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
again these don't take very long once we

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
again these don't take very long once we
get<00:02:57.819> mostly<00:02:58.090> cooked<00:02:58.299> we're<00:02:58.480> going<00:02:58.599> to<00:02:58.659> go

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
get mostly cooked we're going to go

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.959 
get mostly cooked we're going to go
ahead<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.109> throw<00:02:59.260> on<00:02:59.349> the<00:02:59.469> butter<00:02:59.650> here<00:02:59.980> and

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:02.969 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.069 

I'm<00:03:03.969> just<00:03:04.030> going<00:03:04.299> to<00:03:04.329> kind<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.599> surround<00:03:04.930> the

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
I'm just going to kind of surround the

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.990 
I'm just going to kind of surround the
butter<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:05.590> as<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.829> melts<00:03:06.099> sound<00:03:06.340> it's<00:03:06.790> going

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
butter so as it melts sound it's going

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.520 
butter so as it melts sound it's going
to<00:03:07.090> start<00:03:07.329> soaking<00:03:07.659> into<00:03:07.930> all<00:03:08.079> of<00:03:08.109> them<00:03:08.349> nice

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
to start soaking into all of them nice

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.449 
to start soaking into all of them nice
and<00:03:10.859> basically<00:03:11.859> we're<00:03:12.010> just<00:03:12.040> going<00:03:12.189> to<00:03:12.340> keep

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
and basically we're just going to keep

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.679 
and basically we're just going to keep
cooking<00:03:12.669> these<00:03:12.939> now<00:03:13.150> I'm<00:03:13.329> going<00:03:13.449> to<00:03:13.540> keep

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
cooking these now I'm going to keep

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:14.969 
cooking these now I'm going to keep
moving<00:03:13.810> around<00:03:14.019> and<00:03:14.470> let<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.680> butter<00:03:14.859> melt

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:14.979 
moving around and let the butter melt

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:16.710 
moving around and let the butter melt
and<00:03:15.699> we're<00:03:15.819> basically<00:03:16.120> just<00:03:16.239> going<00:03:16.479> to<00:03:16.569> keep

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
and we're basically just going to keep

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.569 
and we're basically just going to keep
cooking<00:03:16.870> these<00:03:17.109> for<00:03:17.319> another<00:03:17.409> couple<00:03:18.129> minutes

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
cooking these for another couple minutes

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.629 
cooking these for another couple minutes
until<00:03:19.239> they're<00:03:19.329> done<00:03:20.159> they'll<00:03:21.159> be<00:03:21.250> done<00:03:21.459> when

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
until they're done they'll be done when

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.640 
until they're done they'll be done when
they're<00:03:21.790> hard<00:03:22.090> but<00:03:22.329> not<00:03:22.479> rubbery<00:03:22.930> you're

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
they're hard but not rubbery you're

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.140 
they're hard but not rubbery you're
gonna<00:03:23.769> have<00:03:23.889> to<00:03:24.009> play<00:03:24.370> around<00:03:24.639> a<00:03:24.819> little<00:03:24.939> bit

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
gonna have to play around a little bit

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.999 
gonna have to play around a little bit
but<00:03:25.720> again<00:03:25.750> they<00:03:26.079> don't<00:03:26.199> take<00:03:26.500> very<00:03:26.709> long<00:03:26.949> to

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:27.009 
but again they don't take very long to

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.330 
but again they don't take very long to
cook

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
cook

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.819 
cook
basically<00:03:27.909> when<00:03:28.750> they're<00:03:28.900> not<00:03:29.199> Caesar<00:03:29.560> when

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
basically when they're not Caesar when

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.020 
basically when they're not Caesar when
it's<00:03:29.979> starting<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.310> get<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.459> nice<00:03:30.609> color<00:03:30.939> on

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
it's starting to get a nice color on

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.729 
it's starting to get a nice color on
them<00:03:31.299> they're<00:03:31.750> pretty<00:03:31.930> much<00:03:32.199> done<00:03:32.439> at<00:03:32.560> that

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
them they're pretty much done at that

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.949 
them they're pretty much done at that
point<00:03:33.099> so<00:03:33.639> we're<00:03:33.759> actually<00:03:33.879> very<00:03:34.060> close<00:03:34.659> here

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
point so we're actually very close here

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.319 
point so we're actually very close here
they<00:03:35.199> barely<00:03:35.470> require<00:03:35.889> any<00:03:36.099> more<00:03:36.220> cooking<00:03:36.609> so

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
they barely require any more cooking so

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.369 
they barely require any more cooking so
I'm<00:03:37.419> just<00:03:37.599> gonna<00:03:37.720> let<00:03:37.870> him<00:03:37.930> sitting<00:03:38.229> here

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
I'm just gonna let him sitting here

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.080 
I'm just gonna let him sitting here
about<00:03:38.530> another<00:03:38.709> 30<00:03:39.040> seconds<00:03:39.549> as<00:03:39.699> this<00:03:39.849> butter

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
about another 30 seconds as this butter

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.330 
about another 30 seconds as this butter
melts<00:03:40.449> all<00:03:40.599> around<00:03:40.930> them<00:03:41.109> and<00:03:41.470> then<00:03:42.220> we're

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
melts all around them and then we're

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.530 
melts all around them and then we're
going<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.489> go<00:03:42.579> ahead<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:42.909> take<00:03:43.060> them<00:03:43.150> out<00:03:43.269> put
