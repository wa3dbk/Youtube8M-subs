we're going to go ahead and put our

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.499 
we're going to go ahead and put our
protein<00:01:22.350> protein<00:01:23.069> that<00:01:23.369> I'm<00:01:23.490> using<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:24.060> ice

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
protein protein that I'm using is ice

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.599 
protein protein that I'm using is ice
appear<00:01:24.960> ok<00:01:25.319> this<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.590> made<00:01:25.740> by<00:01:25.920> nature's<00:01:26.369> back

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:26.609 
appear ok this is made by nature's back

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:29.450 
appear ok this is made by nature's back
its<00:01:26.789> best<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> dutch<00:01:28.319> chocolate<00:01:28.740> okay

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
its best this is a dutch chocolate okay

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.379 
its best this is a dutch chocolate okay
um<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.929> nice<00:01:31.109> smooth<00:01:31.490> chocolate<00:01:32.490> whey

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:33.389 
um the nice smooth chocolate whey

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:35.419 
um the nice smooth chocolate whey
protein<00:01:34.020> ice<00:01:34.139> and<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.530> reason<00:01:34.770> why<00:01:34.889> i<00:01:34.920> used<00:01:35.189> is

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
protein ice and the reason why i used is

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.069 
protein ice and the reason why i used is
some<00:01:35.639> people<00:01:35.880> maybe<00:01:36.030> even<00:01:36.359> be<00:01:36.630> shit<00:01:36.810> about<00:01:37.020> us

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
some people maybe even be shit about us

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.690 
some people maybe even be shit about us
and<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.469> it's<00:01:37.590> too<00:01:37.710> expensive<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and that it's too expensive but the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.370 
and that it's too expensive but the
reason<00:01:38.850> why<00:01:39.060> i<00:01:39.090> buy<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.359> is<00:01:39.600> because<00:01:39.630> you

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
reason why i buy this is because you

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.289 
reason why i buy this is because you
know<00:01:40.530> saying<00:01:40.770> I'm<00:01:41.189> lactose<00:01:41.549> intolerant<00:01:41.850> and

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
know saying I'm lactose intolerant and

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.099 
know saying I'm lactose intolerant and
this<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> very<00:01:43.229> nice<00:01:43.619> filter<00:01:44.280> pure<00:01:45.109> 100%

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
this is a very nice filter pure 100%

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.230 
this is a very nice filter pure 100%
whey<00:01:46.259> isolate<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.219> gives<00:01:47.579> me<00:01:47.789> no<00:01:47.819> type<00:01:48.209> of

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
whey isolate so it gives me no type of

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.899 
whey isolate so it gives me no type of
digestive<00:01:48.959> problems<00:01:49.319> at<00:01:49.409> all<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.189> actually

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
digestive problems at all so actually

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.669 
digestive problems at all so actually
it's<00:01:51.509> cheaper<00:01:51.810> than<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.959> protein<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.590> I

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
it's cheaper than the protein that I

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.649 
it's cheaper than the protein that I
used<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.189> so

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
used to you so

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.669
