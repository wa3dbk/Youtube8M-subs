seuss however comes in at under $800 and

seuss however comes in at under $800 and
you<00:00:58.170> know<00:00:58.379> what<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.590> has<00:00:58.710> pretty<00:00:58.980> much<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
you know what it has pretty much the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.010 
you know what it has pretty much the
same<00:00:59.579> part<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.180> you're<00:01:00.300> gonna<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.600> fairly

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
same part so you're gonna get fairly

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.869 
same part so you're gonna get fairly
comparable<00:01:01.440> performance<00:01:01.710> even<00:01:02.460> though<00:01:02.640> maybe

comparable performance even though maybe

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.850 
comparable performance even though maybe
it's<00:01:03.149> not<00:01:03.300> quite<00:01:03.359> as<00:01:03.809> fancy<00:01:04.110> looking<00:01:04.530> although

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
it's not quite as fancy looking although

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.560 
it's not quite as fancy looking although
it<00:01:05.040> certainly<00:01:05.309> has<00:01:05.489> some<00:01:05.700> metal<00:01:06.180> parts<00:01:06.450> right

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
it certainly has some metal parts right

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.179 
it certainly has some metal parts right
here<00:01:06.630> brushed<00:01:07.080> metal<00:01:07.229> looks<00:01:07.530> pretty<00:01:07.710> nice<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
here brushed metal looks pretty nice and

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.020 
here brushed metal looks pretty nice and
kind<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.490> dark<00:01:09.390> bronzy<00:01:10.200> brown<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:11.640> back<00:01:11.850> of

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
sometimes they're even just like a

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.940 
sometimes they're even just like a

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
little rocker bar and we certainly don't

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.100 
little rocker bar and we certainly don't
like<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.460> at<00:01:38.670> all<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.180> think<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> only

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
like that at all I think one of the only

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.960 
like that at all I think one of the only
things<00:01:40.439> we're<00:01:40.560> really<00:01:40.590> missing<00:01:40.920> out<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.579> on

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
things we're really missing out on on

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.420 
things we're really missing out on on
the<00:01:42.540> k-50<00:01:43.110> 3e<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.740> some<00:01:43.860> sort<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.070> high-speed

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
the k-50 3e is some sort of high-speed

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.819 
the k-50 3e is some sort of high-speed
data<00:01:44.850> connection<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.810> an<00:01:45.960> eSATA<00:01:46.560> connection

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
data connection like an eSATA connection

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.420 
data connection like an eSATA connection
or<00:01:47.310> USB<00:01:47.880> 3.0<00:01:48.689> most<00:01:49.140> laptops<00:01:49.380> especially<00:01:49.799> mid

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.310

that<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.280> missing<00:01:53.729> here<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.720> other<00:01:54.990> hand

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320

the<00:01:55.860> battery<00:01:56.189> life<00:01:56.340> gets<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.270> almost<00:01:57.630> five

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the battery life gets to almost five

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.120 
the battery life gets to almost five
hours<00:01:57.840> think<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:58.380> have<00:01:58.500> about<00:01:58.590> four<00:01:58.799> hours<00:01:58.890> and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
hours think we have about four hours and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.770 
hours think we have about four hours and
40<00:01:59.399> minutes<00:01:59.729> out<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.509> well
