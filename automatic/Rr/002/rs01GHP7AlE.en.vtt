00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.360
 the same 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160

 My Jesus 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.979
 Hello, my name is Jorge, and I'm here. 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.710
 to give you some tips on how to 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.770
 sing a lot of people think this is 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.049
 impossible but anyone can 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.869
 develop the art of singing because 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.270
 because when we sing we get 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.820
 some rules that often 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.770
 we now know a person who does not have 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.440
 ability to sing if she meets 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.299
 these rules and if it meets these 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.610
 rules will definitely go 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:38.069
 develop the art of singing well 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:42.390
 you must first understand that 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:48.090
 vocal chords they are not one is the only one 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.009
 instrument that the singer has and that 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.610
 vocal chords they should vibrate from a 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.170
 natural way and the vocal chords vibrate 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.740
 in a natural way 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.670
 means that the production of the sound that you 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.310
 will be a clean production and 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:11.100
 We call this the primary sound 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.670
 vocal chords they vibrate through the 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.540
 friction she has with the air column 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.620
 which is generated through what through 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.650
 lungs 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.870
 having as its base its origin 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.170
 the pressure of fragments on the lungs 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.519
 good 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.769
 the first thing we can address 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:37.290
 here is where we should sing without forcing 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.320
 the vocal chords like we got 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.530
 this in a very simple way as well 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:48.540
 succinct, may I give some indications 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:55.829
 you here the first is imagine that you 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:59.720
 Are you going to have a strong goal for you? 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:03.480
 Since you do you have an opening 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.790
 which is a very ideal aperture when 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.120
 You're going to sing so it's not just for 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.000
 You already in something else you realize but 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.570
 that your abdominal part 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.860
 there she contracts what does that mean 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.530
 when your abdominal part is 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.540
 Find out when and how much you 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.460
 It's pulling the belly when you're 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:29.450
 do it again you'll notice it there 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.450
 Let's do it again here. 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.640
 that by placing your hand on your 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.880
 belly here your abdominal part 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.560
 you will feel a contraction to the 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.600
 contracting is indicating that your 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:49.140
 diaphragm is creating pressure on the 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:53.100
 the lungs and lungs thus releases 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.920
 through the respiratory tract and 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.190
 these airways produce 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.450
 it is with this concentration of air that comes out 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.610
 of the lungs 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.920
 a column of air every time we 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.880
 We talk every time we sing 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:12.209
 we produce to the air column 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.680
 now we'll do it again and 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.709
 let's fix it well 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.280
 is the sound we produce 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.280
 come on 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.760
 we then observe that I am with him 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.090
 leaving in a very comfortable way in 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.180
 quiet and felt not hurt their 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.060
 vocal chords to your throat when you 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.150
 that's right 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:45.090
 you noticed that when you produce the 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:47.520
 air column is thus creating this yawn 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.540
 You do not feel the er's ropes. 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.169
 vocals 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.990
 You do not feel pain in your throat and that's 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.390
 indispensable for the singer 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.650
 the singer he can never force 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:05.100
 ever your vocal chords 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.530
 because it will generate nodules that will 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:12.110
 generate hoarseness in the voice and this hoarseness 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:14.280
 that it will intensify and 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.370
 unfortunately many people end up 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:23.080
 losing is the ability to produce a 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:28.659
 nice sound because a lot of force is like this 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:31.449
 the maxillary vocals came down 1 from Adam here 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:34.449
 Look there was a movement if you put 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:38.400
 hand on throat here 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:43.509
 this one is the Adam's apple come 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:48.169
 open your mouth like it's already you 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:52.009
 I 'll give you the a-ha 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:56.240
 how she had yawned 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:06:00.050
 even come back to 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:04.720
 there is very well with that we will produce 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.720
 this vowel to with a chord here 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.640
 ah 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:19.120
 ah good to produce a sound without forcing 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.830
 the vocal chords 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.680
 if you did like you were yawning 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:28.060
 You no longer forced the vocal cords. 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:31.830
 now you can produce all the vowels 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.830
 this same format let's go 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:49.419
 and without any other concern 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:53.699
 repeat this exercise several times and 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:53.699
 notice well how your body behaves
