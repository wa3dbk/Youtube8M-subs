 earth with the blade of a knife 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.080
 no resistance is good it's 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.970
 they are cooked 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.120
 drain and book until 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.040
 cooling 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.280
 I roughly cut your salmon 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.280
 smoke 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.370

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.370
 washers 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.130
 I try your half lemon 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.110
 in a salad bowl preparing our strength 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.110
 let's put our smoked salmon 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.800

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.150
 and our potatoes cooled 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.050
 we mix our stuffing for the first time 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.180
 a little trick I take 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.890
 porsche is actually that I 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.480
 and fears 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.480
 more effective than a single fork 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.560
 we do not forget to give taste to 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.560
 our farce 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.420
 adding chives 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.420
 salting course 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.350
 and why 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.790
 we are the angel one last time for 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.790
 to homogenize the flavors 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.750
 we go to editing 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.889
 you take your rhythm sheets and 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.120
 it was good 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.139
 he was still the others 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.590
 so that it is 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.590
 really 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.230
 and acts initially in 2 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.910
 given a pair of scissors and 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.910
 you will get in 2007 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.370
 come a teaspoon from your side 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.680
 that you will come 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.680
 you are on your tennis yesterday 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.490
 we follow your half circle on his 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.490
 length 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.569
 had to have two parallel sides 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.890
 then as in the picture came beat the 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.890
 the closest point on your part 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.280
 this prime customers dock 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.280
 then folded back on itself 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.100
 a foreground 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.050
 you continue so 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.009
 ah bend him even survival 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:59.139
 musca this step 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:02.409
 published last tip 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.939
 introduce in your trio I prefer 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:07.590
 as you look at the pictures because 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:07.590
 to explain really not obvious 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.370
 reproduce this step until 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.940
 you are seniors 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.940
 gold since he 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.729
 in a little oil and have all 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.249
 your bricks and came 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:27.930
 the two topics do not bother to do the 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:31.520
 underneath because the plate 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.520
 and as I wanted said already seen 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.770
 it's good our bricks are ready for them 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:59.229
 brown in the oven 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:01.569
 bake the 220 degrees and leave 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:02.770
 cook on each side between 5 and 10 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:04.150
 minutes 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.340
 this is the result they must be 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.340
 slightly golden but not too 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.510
 here is the result your plate 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.750
 you can accompany them like me 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.699
 of a small salad you can 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.250
 also eat them as his nature 

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.050
 all alone and with the soups too 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.520
 Besides, it's not bad I know he 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.350
 are a lot of brick recipes 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.940
 good there this time I showed you 

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.080
 bricks with smoked salmon but 

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.330
 feel free to comment 

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.169
 is preferable to minced meat 

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.419
 hens etc 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:46.660
