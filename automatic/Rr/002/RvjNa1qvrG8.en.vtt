00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
before you muscle test somebody the most

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.010 
before you muscle test somebody the most
important<00:00:03.030> thing<00:00:03.179> you<00:00:03.300> should<00:00:03.510> check<00:00:03.540> first

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
important thing you should check first

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.470 
important thing you should check first
is<00:00:04.319> their<00:00:04.560> polarity<00:00:04.920> their<00:00:05.520> polarity<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.210> the

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
is their polarity their polarity is the

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.930 
is their polarity their polarity is the
electrical<00:00:07.020> system<00:00:07.500> positive<00:00:08.069> negative<00:00:08.309> on

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
electrical system positive negative on

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.209 
electrical system positive negative on
the<00:00:09.090> tops<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.599> all<00:00:09.780> your<00:00:09.960> body<00:00:10.110> parts<00:00:10.320> should

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
the tops of all your body parts should

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.669 
the tops of all your body parts should
be<00:00:11.429> negative<00:00:11.639> positive<00:00:12.269> excuse<00:00:12.929> me<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.290> the

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
be negative positive excuse me and the

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.740 
be negative positive excuse me and the
bottom<00:00:14.009> should<00:00:14.219> all<00:00:14.370> be<00:00:14.519> negative<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.540> top

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
bottom should all be negative so the top

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.810 
bottom should all be negative so the top
of<00:00:15.960> your<00:00:16.080> head<00:00:16.320> being<00:00:16.590> positive<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.400> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
of your head being positive and the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.700 
of your head being positive and the
bottom<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.270> your<00:00:18.300> hand<00:00:18.660> being<00:00:18.900> negative

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
bottom of your hand being negative

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.859 
bottom of your hand being negative
let's<00:00:19.949> use<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.340> one<00:00:20.400> when<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.510> put<00:00:21.750> your

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
let's use this one when you put your

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.599 
let's use this one when you put your
hand<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.289> your<00:00:22.350> head<00:00:22.769> which<00:00:23.130> looks<00:00:23.369> kind<00:00:23.519> of

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
hand on your head which looks kind of

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.670 
hand on your head which looks kind of
funny<00:00:23.820> positive<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.960> negative<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.439> should

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
funny positive to negative that should

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.660 
funny positive to negative that should
be<00:00:25.769> strong<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.310> as<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.359> can<00:00:27.539> see<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:28.710> was<00:00:28.920> okay

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
be strong and as you can see it was okay

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.060 
be strong and as you can see it was okay
then<00:00:30.300> when<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.539> turn<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.929> over<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.800> put

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
then when you turn it over you put

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.770 
then when you turn it over you put
positive<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.790> positive<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.510> should

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
positive to positive and that should

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.880 
positive to positive and that should
sort<00:00:34.020> circuit<00:00:34.469> him<00:00:34.620> which<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:36.450> did<00:00:36.890> that's

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
sort circuit him which it did that's

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.880 
sort circuit him which it did that's
what<00:00:38.430> should<00:00:38.730> happen<00:00:39.000> now<00:00:39.719> with<00:00:40.230> some<00:00:40.500> people

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
what should happen now with some people

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.440 
what should happen now with some people
you'll<00:00:41.219> get<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.700> opposite<00:00:42.180> when<00:00:42.329> they

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
you'll get it the opposite when they

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.270 
you'll get it the opposite when they
when<00:00:42.809> they<00:00:42.930> test<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.500> way<00:00:43.739> well<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.010> can't

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
when they test it this way well I can't

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.650 
when they test it this way well I can't
do<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.520> because<00:00:44.789> you're<00:00:44.969> you're<00:00:45.270> good<00:00:45.450> but

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
do it because you're you're good but

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.510 
do it because you're you're good but
when<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.200> test<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.710> way<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.100> would<00:00:47.460> be

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
when you test it this way it would be

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.520 
when you test it this way it would be
weak<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.120> turned<00:00:48.390> over<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.870> would<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.170> strong

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
weak and turned over it would be strong

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.110 
weak and turned over it would be strong
that's<00:00:49.860> backwards<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.550> means<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.940> their

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
that's backwards that means that their

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.689 
that's backwards that means that their

all<00:01:09.720> around<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.560> will<00:01:10.740> reverse<00:01:11.100> your

walk<00:01:13.680> around<00:01:14.010> all<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> time<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.850> they<00:01:15.240> don't

walk around all the time like they don't

belong in this planet you know they

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.950 
belong in this planet you know they
always<00:01:17.310> feel<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.549> everything<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.479> little

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
always feel like everything is a little

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.200 
always feel like everything is a little
off<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.710> them<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:19.920> that's<00:01:20.759> how<00:01:21.000> they're

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
off for them and that's how they're

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.179 
off for them and that's how they're
gonna<00:01:21.270> test<00:01:21.630> upside<00:01:22.140> down<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.560> cannot<00:01:22.860> test

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
gonna test upside down you cannot test

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:23.899 
gonna test upside down you cannot test
them<00:01:23.430> further

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
them further

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.999 
them further
because<00:01:24.720> everything<00:01:25.140> will<00:01:25.259> be<00:01:25.320> backwards<00:01:25.830> if

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
because everything will be backwards if

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.679 
because everything will be backwards if
it's<00:01:26.189> good<00:01:26.430> if<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.700> says<00:01:26.880> good<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.270> bad<00:01:27.420> if

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
it's good if it says good it's bad if

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.090 
it's good if it says good it's bad if
it's<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:27.960> bad<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.320> good<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.710> know<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:28.920> it's

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
it's as bad it's good you know and it's

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.100 
it's as bad it's good you know and it's
just<00:01:29.159> it'll<00:01:29.549> all<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.759> wrong<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.600> what<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.990> need

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
just it'll all be wrong so what you need

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.260 
just it'll all be wrong so what you need
to<00:01:31.350> do<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.890> do<00:01:32.009> then<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.670> give<00:01:32.880> them<00:01:33.090> bee

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
to do to do then is you give them bee

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.319 
to do to do then is you give them bee
pollen<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:35.009> find<00:01:35.280> bee<00:01:35.939> pollen

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
pollen if you can find bee pollen

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.870 
pollen if you can find bee pollen
locally-grown<00:01:36.810> that's<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.560> best<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:38.100> not<00:01:38.310> you

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
locally-grown that's the best if not you

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.969 
locally-grown that's the best if not you
can<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.090> buy<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.869> pollen<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.320> capsules<00:01:40.799> and

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
can just buy be pollen in capsules and

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.160 
can just buy be pollen in capsules and
it<00:01:41.430> will<00:01:41.610> reverse<00:01:42.060> your<00:01:42.210> polarity<00:01:42.600> back<00:01:42.840> again

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
it will reverse your polarity back again

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.710 
it will reverse your polarity back again
to<00:01:43.860> proper<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.460> then<00:01:44.579> again<00:01:45.149> give<00:01:45.360> them<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.540> few

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
to proper and then again give them a few

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.380 
to proper and then again give them a few
days<00:01:45.869> try<00:01:46.500> again<00:01:46.860> another<00:01:47.579> way<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.119> test

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
days try again another way you can test

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.819 
days try again another way you can test
that<00:01:48.540> what<00:01:48.689> if<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.840> person<00:01:49.020> has<00:01:49.290> arthritis

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
that what if the person has arthritis

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.410 
that what if the person has arthritis
they<00:01:49.950> can't<00:01:50.130> put<00:01:50.310> their<00:01:50.430> arm<00:01:50.640> up<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:51.180> that

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
they can't put their arm up like that

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.450 
they can't put their arm up like that
this<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.079> what<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.409> can<00:01:52.590> do<00:01:54.470> your<00:01:55.470> main<00:01:55.770> energy

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
this is what you can do your main energy

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.940 
this is what you can do your main energy
in<00:01:56.759> your<00:01:57.149> body<00:01:57.390> or<00:01:57.600> main<00:01:57.780> Meridian<00:01:58.259> flows<00:01:58.649> up

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
in your body or main Meridian flows up

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.889 
in your body or main Meridian flows up
the<00:01:59.399> center<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.909> your<00:02:00.090> body<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.750> your

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
the center of your body and this is your

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.539 
the center of your body and this is your
energy<00:02:01.290> flow<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.770> your<00:02:02.040> blood<00:02:02.250> flows

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
energy flow just like your blood flows

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.639 
energy flow just like your blood flows
through<00:02:02.579> your<00:02:02.939> body<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.450> does<00:02:03.659> energy<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.259> it

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
through your body so does energy and it

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.740 
through your body so does energy and it
flows<00:02:04.920> up<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.329> then<00:02:06.600> you're

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
flows up like this and that then you're

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.109 
flows up like this and that then you're
strong<00:02:07.049> if<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.740> run<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.160> energy<00:02:08.610> backwards

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
strong if I run that energy backwards

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.229 
strong if I run that energy backwards
he's<00:02:09.989> going<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.259> be<00:02:10.410> weak<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.790> then<00:02:11.790> if<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.030> run

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
he's going to be weak and then if I run

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.370 
he's going to be weak and then if I run
it<00:02:12.360> back

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
it back

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.200 
it back
strong<00:02:13.650> again<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.160> that's<00:02:14.700> what<00:02:14.940> should

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
strong again and that's what should

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.900 
strong again and that's what should
happen<00:02:15.450> if<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:16.290> goes<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.710> other<00:02:16.740> way<00:02:17.220> then<00:02:17.700> you

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
happen if it goes the other way then you

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.780 
happen if it goes the other way then you
know<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.330> they're<00:02:18.570> reversed<00:02:19.370> bee<00:02:20.370> pollen

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
know that they're reversed bee pollen

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.820 
know that they're reversed bee pollen
for<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> few<00:02:21.300> days<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:22.050> try<00:02:22.290> again<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.650> few

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
for a few days and then try again a few

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.700 
for a few days and then try again a few
days<00:02:22.890> later<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.600> of<00:02:24.600> course<00:02:24.870> if<00:02:25.050> they<00:02:25.260> work

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
days later and of course if they work

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.100 
days later and of course if they work
with<00:02:26.040> with<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.580> lot<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.940> computers<00:02:27.360> like<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.750> said

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
with with a lot of computers like I said

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.290 
with with a lot of computers like I said
or<00:02:28.350> if<00:02:28.620> they're<00:02:28.980> living<00:02:29.340> under<00:02:29.640> high<00:02:29.790> wires<00:02:30.030> it

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
or if they're living under high wires it

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.600 
or if they're living under high wires it
might<00:02:30.510> be<00:02:30.690> hard<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.990> ever<00:02:31.170> take<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.070> back<00:02:32.250> again

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
might be hard to ever take it back again

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.980 
might be hard to ever take it back again
but<00:02:32.990> using<00:02:33.990> bee<00:02:34.290> pollen<00:02:34.620> will<00:02:34.800> help
