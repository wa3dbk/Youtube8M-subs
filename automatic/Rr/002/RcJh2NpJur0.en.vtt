00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
hi guys welcome back to my test world

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.240 
hi guys welcome back to my test world
here<00:00:09.910> do<00:00:10.910> little<00:00:11.180> short<00:00:11.660> video<00:00:11.960> on<00:00:12.290> door

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
here do little short video on door

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.410 
here do little short video on door
boosters<00:00:14.290> this<00:00:15.290> is<00:00:15.530> your<00:00:15.740> standard<00:00:16.730> door

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
boosters this is your standard door

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.870 
boosters this is your standard door
booster<00:00:18.940> Dylan<00:00:19.940> difference<00:00:21.580> that<00:00:22.580> I<00:00:22.730> in<00:00:22.850> no

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
booster Dylan difference that I in no

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.700 
booster Dylan difference that I in no
from<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:23.630> original<00:00:24.080> is<00:00:24.200> I<00:00:24.440> think<00:00:24.530> the

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
from the original is I think the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.250 
from the original is I think the
original<00:00:25.100> showed<00:00:25.369> a<00:00:25.400> little<00:00:25.869> incline<00:00:26.869> piece

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
original showed a little incline piece

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.910 
original showed a little incline piece
here<00:00:27.670> but<00:00:28.670> I've<00:00:29.480> always<00:00:29.660> just<00:00:29.990> had<00:00:30.470> a<00:00:30.500> flat

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
here but I've always just had a flat

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.000 
here but I've always just had a flat
that's<00:00:31.130> always<00:00:31.490> worked<00:00:31.670> fine<00:00:31.970> for<00:00:32.000> me<00:00:32.710> so<00:00:33.710> I'm

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
that's always worked fine for me so I'm

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.599 
that's always worked fine for me so I'm
not<00:00:34.129> sure<00:00:34.399> that's<00:00:34.909> critical<00:00:35.420> or<00:00:35.480> not<00:00:35.719> but<00:00:36.609> this

00:00:37.599 --> 00:00:37.609 
not sure that's critical or not but this

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:44.290 
not sure that's critical or not but this
seems<00:00:37.879> to<00:00:37.999> work<00:00:38.149> pretty<00:00:38.300> good<00:00:41.979> so<00:00:43.059> that's<00:00:44.059> your

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
seems to work pretty good so that's your

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.619 
seems to work pretty good so that's your
standard<00:00:44.600> door<00:00:45.319> booster<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.789> what<00:00:47.269> I<00:00:47.359> want<00:00:47.569> to

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
standard door booster and what I want to

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.979 
standard door booster and what I want to
show<00:00:47.839> you<00:00:47.899> is<00:00:48.109> I<00:00:49.039> guess<00:00:50.030> I'll<00:00:50.179> call<00:00:50.359> the

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
show you is I guess I'll call the

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.919 
show you is I guess I'll call the
compact<00:00:51.649> door<00:00:52.309> booster<00:00:54.879> and<00:00:55.879> it<00:00:56.179> works<00:00:56.479> just

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:56.929 
compact door booster and it works just

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.489 
compact door booster and it works just
as<00:00:57.379> well<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:59.120> it's<00:00:59.539> quite<00:01:00.170> a<00:01:00.199> bit<00:01:00.379> smaller

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:00.499 
as well and it's quite a bit smaller

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:05.340 
as well and it's quite a bit smaller
though<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:02.649> what<00:01:03.649> I'm<00:01:03.769> using<00:01:04.040> here<00:01:04.250> is

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
though and what I'm using here is

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.929 
though and what I'm using here is
there's<00:01:06.350> that<00:01:06.560> piece<00:01:06.890> of<00:01:06.920> curb<00:01:07.369> to<00:01:07.610> track

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
there's that piece of curb to track

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.219 
there's that piece of curb to track
right<00:01:08.240> there<00:01:08.329> and<00:01:10.149> the<00:01:11.149> momentum<00:01:11.360> of<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:11.899> cart

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
right there and the momentum of the cart

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.350 
right there and the momentum of the cart
when<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:12.649> comes<00:01:12.860> around<00:01:13.009> this<00:01:13.189> corner<00:01:13.490> it

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
when it comes around this corner it

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.520 
when it comes around this corner it
carries<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.140> just<00:01:15.380> a<00:01:15.530> little<00:01:15.560> bit<00:01:16.060> to<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.210> left

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
carries it just a little bit to the left

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.840 
carries it just a little bit to the left
far<00:01:18.530> enough<00:01:18.740> where<00:01:18.950> it<00:01:19.009> hangs<00:01:19.219> up<00:01:19.490> on<00:01:19.579> the<00:01:19.700> door

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
far enough where it hangs up on the door

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.679 
far enough where it hangs up on the door
and<00:01:20.920> I<00:01:21.920> don't<00:01:22.280> think<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.609> latter<00:01:23.119> really<00:01:23.479> does

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
and I don't think the latter really does

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.889 
and I don't think the latter really does
anything<00:01:23.899> is<00:01:24.680> if<00:01:24.829> you<00:01:24.950> look<00:01:25.159> at<00:01:25.340> sea<00:01:25.719> it's<00:01:26.719> not

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
anything is if you look at sea it's not

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.910 
anything is if you look at sea it's not
even<00:01:27.070> touching<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.250> ladder<00:01:28.549> up<00:01:28.969> to<00:01:29.770> I'll<00:01:30.770> just

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
even touching the ladder up to I'll just

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.219 
even touching the ladder up to I'll just
have<00:01:31.100> that<00:01:31.280> there<00:01:31.549> for<00:01:31.820> whatever<00:01:32.359> reason<00:01:32.659> but

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
have that there for whatever reason but

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.749 
have that there for whatever reason but
anyway<00:01:33.469> that<00:01:33.530> i<00:01:33.649> can<00:01:33.679> turn<00:01:34.009> on<00:01:34.130> this<00:01:34.189> corner<00:01:34.549> it

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
anyway that i can turn on this corner it

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.029 
anyway that i can turn on this corner it
the<00:01:35.119> momentum<00:01:35.689> kicks<00:01:36.259> it<00:01:36.439> off<00:01:36.500> a<00:01:36.560> little<00:01:36.829> bit

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
the momentum kicks it off a little bit

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.789 
the momentum kicks it off a little bit
if<00:01:37.250> you<00:01:37.460> came<00:01:37.729> straight<00:01:38.210> in<00:01:38.409> from<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.560> side

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
if you came straight in from the side

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.090 
if you came straight in from the side
you<00:01:40.700> would<00:01:40.789> just<00:01:40.939> fall<00:01:41.210> straight<00:01:41.240> down<00:01:41.770> but<00:01:42.770> by

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
you would just fall straight down but by

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.279 
you would just fall straight down but by
that<00:01:43.579> little<00:01:43.729> corner<00:01:44.149> there<00:01:44.420> kicking<00:01:45.109> it<00:01:45.200> off

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
that little corner there kicking it off

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.109 
that little corner there kicking it off
to<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:45.499> side<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:45.950> lands<00:01:46.280> on<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.490> door<00:01:46.670> or<00:01:46.999> in

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
to the side it lands on the door or in

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.310 
to the side it lands on the door or in
the<00:01:47.270> corner<00:01:47.539> there<00:01:47.719> and<00:01:49.659> when<00:01:50.659> you<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.170> door

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
the corner there and when you the door

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.029 
the corner there and when you the door
it'll<00:01:52.009> fall<00:01:52.219> down<00:01:52.719> now<00:01:53.719> if<00:01:54.049> you<00:01:54.229> have<00:01:54.439> too<00:01:54.859> much

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
it'll fall down now if you have too much

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.469 
it'll fall down now if you have too much
boost<00:01:55.579> if<00:01:55.999> you<00:01:56.450> have<00:01:56.780> this<00:01:57.670> contact<00:01:58.670> zone<00:01:59.060> too

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
boost if you have this contact zone too

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.800 
boost if you have this contact zone too
long<00:01:59.780> or<00:02:02.409> perhaps<00:02:03.409> if<00:02:03.859> the<00:02:04.390> if<00:02:05.390> you<00:02:05.509> don't<00:02:05.659> have

if it's got too much momentum it will

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.140 
if it's got too much momentum it will
swing<00:02:15.150> out<00:02:15.959> further<00:02:16.439> on<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.859> door<00:02:17.069> and<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:18.000> it

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
falls down it'll fall down kind of

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.800 
falls down it'll fall down kind of
behind<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:25.069> track<00:02:26.069> there<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:26.969> if<00:02:27.299> it'll<00:02:27.659> get

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
behind the track there so if it'll get

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.300 
behind the track there so if it'll get
all<00:02:28.609> get<00:02:29.609> all<00:02:29.730> wonky<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:31.409> want<00:02:31.590> worked<00:02:31.799> so

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
all get all wonky and I want worked so

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.679 
all get all wonky and I want worked so
you<00:02:32.400> have<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.760> kind<00:02:32.879> of<00:02:33.000> fine<00:02:33.209> tune<00:02:33.239> in<00:02:33.629> a

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
you have to kind of fine tune in a

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:34.880 
you have to kind of fine tune in a
little<00:02:33.900> bit<00:02:33.989> make<00:02:34.260> sure<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.560> have<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.859> right

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
little bit make sure you have the right

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.039 
little bit make sure you have the right
amount<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.310> momentum<00:02:35.599> so<00:02:36.599> that<00:02:36.750> when<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:36.959> comes

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
amount of momentum so that when it comes

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.520 
amount of momentum so that when it comes
around<00:02:37.200> at<00:02:37.470> lands<00:02:37.799> just<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:38.700> door<00:02:39.530> I've

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
around at lands just on the door I've

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.349 
around at lands just on the door I've
probably<00:02:40.859> got<00:02:41.129> just<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:41.639> little<00:02:41.670> bit<00:02:41.969> too<00:02:42.209> much

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
probably got just a little bit too much

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.429 
probably got just a little bit too much
momentum<00:02:44.000> but<00:02:45.000> it's<00:02:45.870> probably<00:02:46.139> just<00:02:46.290> about

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
momentum but it's probably just about

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.720 
momentum but it's probably just about
right<00:02:47.599> anymore<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.560> think<00:02:49.769> it<00:02:49.889> might<00:02:50.040> start

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
right anymore and I think it might start

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.149 
right anymore and I think it might start
to<00:02:51.500> cause<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> problem<00:02:54.379> but<00:02:55.379> there<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.129> go

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
to cause a problem but there you go

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:03.530 
to cause a problem but there you go
compact<00:02:56.909> or<00:02:57.599> booster<00:03:00.349> thanks<00:03:01.349> Roger
