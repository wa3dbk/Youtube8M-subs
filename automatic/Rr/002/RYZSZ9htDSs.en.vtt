00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.939 
I'll show you quick the hole at least
right<00:06:51.400> there<00:06:51.789> so<00:06:52.330> it's<00:06:52.539> it's<00:06:53.020> pretty<00:06:53.319> bad<00:06:53.620> it's

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:53.949 
right there so it's it's pretty bad it's

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:56.450 
right there so it's it's pretty bad it's
getting<00:06:54.280> there<00:06:54.310> that<00:06:55.210> crack<00:06:55.509> is<00:06:55.780> up<00:06:55.960> in<00:06:56.139> there

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 
getting there that crack is up in there

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.149 
getting there that crack is up in there
yeah<00:06:57.460> this<00:06:57.639> frame<00:06:57.909> is<00:06:57.939> junk<00:06:58.509> so<00:06:59.229> that<00:06:59.949> one's

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:00.159 
yeah this frame is junk so that one's

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:02.490 
yeah this frame is junk so that one's
almost<00:07:00.550> perfect<00:07:01.360> just<00:07:01.629> needs<00:07:02.020> to<00:07:02.110> be<00:07:02.169> cleaned

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
almost perfect just needs to be cleaned

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.770 
almost perfect just needs to be cleaned
up<00:07:02.620> and<00:07:02.800> painted<00:07:03.150> so<00:07:04.150> that's<00:07:04.360> where<00:07:04.629> we're

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
up and painted so that's where we're

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.659 
up and painted so that's where we're
going<00:07:05.050> with<00:07:05.139> the<00:07:05.319> truck<00:07:05.620> that's<00:07:06.250> we're<00:07:06.490> going

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:06.669 
going with the truck that's we're going

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:10.140 
going with the truck that's we're going
with<00:07:06.849> the<00:07:06.969> Firebird<00:07:07.449> and<00:07:07.889> the<00:07:08.889> bikes<00:07:09.129> so<00:07:09.729> it

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.150 
with the Firebird and the bikes so it

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.110 
with the Firebird and the bikes so it
should<00:07:10.389> be<00:07:10.419> really<00:07:10.840> fun<00:07:11.189> year<00:07:12.189> riding<00:07:12.879> and

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 
should be really fun year riding and

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.040 
should be really fun year riding and
modding<00:07:14.050> can<00:07:14.680> get<00:07:14.860> some<00:07:14.979> videos<00:07:15.250> of<00:07:15.280> that<00:07:15.550> so

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.050 
modding can get some videos of that so

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.089 
modding can get some videos of that so
that's<00:07:17.050> pretty<00:07:17.379> much<00:07:17.469> it<00:07:17.620> thanks<00:07:18.039> for
