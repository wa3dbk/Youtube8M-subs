00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
trackpad and the cloth let me show you

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.700 
trackpad and the cloth let me show you
ever<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.130> applied<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.579> my<00:02:05.759> macbook<00:02:06.710> so

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
ever you applied it to my macbook so

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.499 
ever you applied it to my macbook so
this<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:07.860> basically<00:02:07.979> looks<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:09.270> there's

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
this is basically looks like so there's

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.869 
this is basically looks like so there's
two<00:02:09.629> foam<00:02:09.840> pads<00:02:10.050> here<00:02:10.229> real<00:02:10.530> soft<00:02:10.860> soft<00:02:11.730> type

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
two foam pads here real soft soft type

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.900 
two foam pads here real soft soft type
material<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.450> like<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.200> said<00:02:13.379> I<00:02:13.440> custom

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
material I like I said I custom

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.250 
material I like I said I custom
is<00:02:14.000> my<00:02:14.180> track<00:02:14.420> right<00:02:14.570> so<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.750> have<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.960> cut<00:02:15.140> the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
is my track right so I have to cut the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.420 
is my track right so I have to cut the
bottom<00:02:15.530> edge<00:02:15.620> off<00:02:15.800> so<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:15.980> way<00:02:16.190> because<00:02:16.310> it

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
bottom edge off so that way because it

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.130 
bottom edge off so that way because it
was<00:02:16.520> overlapping<00:02:16.880> over<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.210> whole<00:02:17.330> thing<00:02:17.540> but

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
was overlapping over the whole thing but

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.900 
was overlapping over the whole thing but
so<00:02:18.350> this<00:02:18.530> basically<00:02:18.650> protects<00:02:19.220> your<00:02:19.490> track<00:02:19.760> by

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
so this basically protects your track by

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.280 
so this basically protects your track by
from<00:02:20.120> being<00:02:20.270> scratched<00:02:20.510> up<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.870> mess<00:02:21.020> up<00:02:21.170> and

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
from being scratched up a mess up and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.690 
from being scratched up a mess up and
actually<00:02:21.380> it's<00:02:21.620> really<00:02:21.890> smooth<00:02:22.160> it's<00:02:22.640> a

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
actually it's really smooth it's a

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.100 
actually it's really smooth it's a
little<00:02:22.880> bit<00:02:22.970> smoother<00:02:23.240> than<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.540> trackpad

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
little bit smoother than the trackpad

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.990 
little bit smoother than the trackpad
was<00:02:24.740> before<00:02:25.070> I<00:02:25.220> know<00:02:25.370> I<00:02:25.460> can't<00:02:25.670> like<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.910> though

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
was before I know I can't like it though

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.660 
was before I know I can't like it though
it's<00:02:26.090> really<00:02:26.390> nice<00:02:26.510> glassy<00:02:27.080> feeling<00:02:27.670> about

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
it's really nice glassy feeling about

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.770 
it's really nice glassy feeling about
the<00:02:28.790> stupid<00:02:29.120> just<00:02:29.330> so<00:02:29.390> whatever<00:02:29.570> you<00:02:29.660> are
