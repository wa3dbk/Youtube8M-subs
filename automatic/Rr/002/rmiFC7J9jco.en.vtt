00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
upward motion of the rod tip so if you

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.609 
upward motion of the rod tip so if you

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
see my rod tip there you want the line

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.010 
see my rod tip there you want the line
to<00:01:15.800> pull<00:01:16.040> out<00:01:16.250> as<00:01:16.610> you<00:01:17.090> lift<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.720> rod

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
to pull out as you lift the rod

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.710 
to pull out as you lift the rod
vertically<00:01:18.680> up<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:18.950> what<00:01:19.850> we're<00:01:20.000> doing<00:01:20.030> is

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
vertically up and what we're doing is

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.859 
vertically up and what we're doing is
we're<00:01:21.050> using<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.500> vacuum<00:01:21.800> tension<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:23.600> water

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
we're using the vacuum tension the water

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.440 
we're using the vacuum tension the water

tension between the fly line and the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.560 
tension between the fly line and the
water<00:01:26.750> to<00:01:27.500> actually<00:01:27.710> pull<00:01:28.250> slack<00:01:28.670> line<00:01:29.030> out<00:01:29.300> my

water to actually pull slack line out my
rod<00:01:29.810> tip<00:01:29.950> you<00:01:30.950> need<00:01:31.160> to<00:01:31.280> move<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.550> rod<00:01:31.729> very

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.300 
rod tip you need to move the rod very
vertically<00:01:32.869> that's<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.649> mistake<00:01:33.890> a<00:01:33.950> lot<00:01:34.220> of

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
vertically that's the mistake a lot of

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.740 
vertically that's the mistake a lot of
people<00:01:34.580> make<00:01:34.759> is<00:01:34.910> they'll<00:01:35.090> try<00:01:35.330> to<00:01:35.390> move<00:01:35.600> the

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
people make is they'll try to move the

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.200 
people make is they'll try to move the
rod<00:01:35.930> to<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.289> side<00:01:36.590> well<00:01:37.399> that<00:01:37.580> takes<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:38.030> lot

rod to the side well that takes a lot
more<00:01:38.509> force<00:01:38.869> to<00:01:39.110> pull<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.500> line<00:01:39.740> out<00:01:40.009> and<00:01:40.310> it's

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
more force to pull the line out and it's

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.090 
more force to pull the line out and it's
going<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:41.000> put<00:01:41.180> a<00:01:41.210> drag<00:01:41.479> on<00:01:41.690> your<00:01:41.720> indicator<00:01:42.350> so

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
going to put a drag on your indicator so

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.650 
going to put a drag on your indicator so
you<00:01:43.160> take<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.729> line<00:01:43.910> just<00:01:44.119> in<00:01:44.240> your<00:01:44.390> left<00:01:44.539> hand

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
you take the line just in your left hand

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.840 
you take the line just in your left hand
you'll<00:01:45.140> feed<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.500> easily<00:01:45.800> through<00:01:46.100> there<00:01:46.280> and

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
you'll feed it easily through there and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.660 
you'll feed it easily through there and
release<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.600> line<00:01:47.840> on<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.440> upward<00:01:48.710> motion<00:01:49.220> of

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
release the line on the upward motion of

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.330 
release the line on the upward motion of
the<00:01:50.240> rod<00:01:50.420> tip<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:50.929> you<00:01:51.050> lift<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.619> rod<00:01:51.860> tip<00:01:52.160> up

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
the rod tip so you lift that rod tip up

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.490 
the rod tip so you lift that rod tip up
using<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.270> vacuum<00:01:53.479> tension<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.289> water

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
using the vacuum tension the water

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.679 
using the vacuum tension the water
against<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:54.890> line<00:01:55.190> to<00:01:55.909> pull<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.299> line<00:01:56.450> out<00:01:56.659> of

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
against the line to pull the line out of

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:57.370 
against the line to pull the line out of
your<00:01:56.869> hand

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
your hand

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.050 
your hand
and<00:01:57.860> what<00:01:58.040> that's<00:01:58.250> going<00:01:58.430> to<00:01:58.490> do<00:01:58.700> that's<00:01:58.850> going

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
and what that's going to do that's going

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.850 
and what that's going to do that's going
to<00:01:59.150> allow<00:01:59.390> your<00:01:59.600> fly<00:01:59.869> to<00:01:59.930> continue<00:02:00.470> drifting

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
to allow your fly to continue drifting

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.340 
to allow your fly to continue drifting
downstream<00:02:01.070> it's<00:02:02.000> absolutely<00:02:02.990> imperative

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
downstream it's absolutely imperative

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.800 
downstream it's absolutely imperative
that<00:02:03.680> you<00:02:04.040> don't<00:02:04.220> put<00:02:04.430> any<00:02:04.610> back<00:02:05.119> tension<00:02:05.689> on

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
that you don't put any back tension on

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.899 
that you don't put any back tension on
that<00:02:05.840> indicator<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:06.890> that<00:02:07.189> indicator<00:02:07.670> does

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
that indicator and that indicator does

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.280 
that indicator and that indicator does
not<00:02:08.090> move<00:02:08.299> at<00:02:08.450> all<00:02:08.540> when<00:02:08.600> you're<00:02:08.869> feeding<00:02:09.049> line

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
not move at all when you're feeding line

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.380 
not move at all when you're feeding line
otherwise<00:02:10.040> your<00:02:10.399> nymphs<00:02:10.549> will<00:02:10.820> lift<00:02:11.000> right<00:02:11.239> to

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
otherwise your nymphs will lift right to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.090 
otherwise your nymphs will lift right to
the<00:02:11.480> surface<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.320> become<00:02:12.650> far<00:02:12.890> less

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
the surface and become far less

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.650 
the surface and become far less
effective<00:02:13.400> than<00:02:13.760> if<00:02:13.880> that

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
effective than if that

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.840 
effective than if that
okay<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:17.050> in<00:02:17.620> theory<00:02:17.980> that's<00:02:18.460> going<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.730> work

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
okay so in theory that's going to work

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.290 
okay so in theory that's going to work
for<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.270> 70%<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.620> time<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:21.700> obstacle<00:02:22.240> is

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
for you 70% of the time the obstacle is

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.880 
for you 70% of the time the obstacle is
going<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.480> be<00:02:22.600> when<00:02:22.810> there's<00:02:22.990> slow<00:02:23.320> water<00:02:23.620> in

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
going to be when there's slow water in

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.710 
going to be when there's slow water in
front<00:02:24.160> of<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.640> your<00:02:24.850> indicator<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.570> out

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
front of you and your indicator is out

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.930 
front of you and your indicator is out
there<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.110> faster<00:02:26.530> water<00:02:26.770> it's<00:02:27.340> pretty<00:02:27.670> tough

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
there and faster water it's pretty tough

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.030 
there and faster water it's pretty tough
because<00:02:28.300> giving<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.230> all<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.500> slack<00:02:29.770> in<00:02:29.980> the

slack out to your rock that's what we're

slack out to your rock that's what we're

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
going to we're going to teach you how to

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.290 
going to we're going to teach you how to
throw<00:02:37.600> some<00:02:37.900> downstream<00:02:38.800> slack<00:02:39.400> out<00:02:39.700> the

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
throw some downstream slack out the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.120 
throw some downstream slack out the
indicator<00:02:40.810> so<00:02:41.110> I'm<00:02:41.560> going<00:02:41.710> to<00:02:41.770> run<00:02:41.920> through<00:02:42.100> a

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
indicator so I'm going to run through a

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.550 
indicator so I'm going to run through a
scenario<00:02:42.550> here<00:02:42.640> we'll<00:02:43.630> throw<00:02:43.870> my<00:02:44.050> drift<00:02:44.350> out

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
scenario here we'll throw my drift out

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.550 
scenario here we'll throw my drift out
in<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:44.920> river

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
in the river

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.960 
in the river
drips<00:02:47.560> going<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.860> come<00:02:48.010> behind<00:02:48.160> me<00:02:48.490> I'm<00:02:48.790> going

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
drips going to come behind me I'm going

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.940 
drips going to come behind me I'm going
to<00:02:49.030> do<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.180> big<00:02:49.450> upstream<00:02:49.900> end<00:02:50.140> I'm<00:02:50.680> going<00:02:50.860> to

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
to do a big upstream end I'm going to

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.800 
to do a big upstream end I'm going to
start<00:02:51.190> feeding<00:02:51.460> line<00:02:51.820> that<00:02:52.510> I<00:02:52.600> can

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
start feeding line that I can

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.990 
start feeding line that I can
immediately<00:02:53.080> see<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:54.070> no<00:02:54.400> matter<00:02:54.550> how<00:02:54.730> fast

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
immediately see that no matter how fast

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.510 
immediately see that no matter how fast
I<00:02:55.300> feed<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:56.200> slack<00:02:56.350> only<00:02:56.830> gets<00:02:57.040> right<00:02:57.220> off<00:02:57.340> my

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
I feed the slack only gets right off my

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.920 
I feed the slack only gets right off my
raw<00:02:57.700> tip<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.180> doesn't<00:02:58.420> quite<00:02:58.540> make<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.780> out

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
raw tip and it doesn't quite make it out

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.080 
raw tip and it doesn't quite make it out
to<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.230> indicator<00:02:59.620> on<00:02:59.830> this<00:02:59.980> drift<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:00.910> what

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
to the indicator on this drift so what

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.400 
to the indicator on this drift so what
I'm<00:03:01.209> going<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.390> do<00:03:01.540> is<00:03:01.690> I'm<00:03:01.840> actually<00:03:01.870> going<00:03:02.290> to

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.110 
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to
take<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:02.830> I'm<00:03:02.890> going<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.040> propel<00:03:03.459> some<00:03:03.760> slaps

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
take and I'm going to propel some slaps

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.480 
take and I'm going to propel some slaps
on<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.660> start<00:03:04.959> of<00:03:05.020> this<00:03:05.140> drift<00:03:05.410> over<00:03:05.680> again

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
on the start of this drift over again

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.810 
on the start of this drift over again
I<00:03:07.630> get<00:03:08.630> my<00:03:08.780> grips<00:03:09.050> all<00:03:09.230> set<00:03:09.530> up<00:03:09.740> I<00:03:10.010> give<00:03:10.640> it<00:03:10.760> a

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
I get my grips all set up I give it a

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.820 
I get my grips all set up I give it a
man<00:03:11.060> I'm<00:03:11.450> starting<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:11.870> feel<00:03:12.080> I'm<00:03:12.320> that<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.650> can

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
man I'm starting to feel I'm that I can

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.230 
man I'm starting to feel I'm that I can
tell<00:03:13.040> already<00:03:13.250> it's<00:03:13.610> not<00:03:13.670> quite<00:03:14.000> going<00:03:14.180> to

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
tell already it's not quite going to

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.150 
tell already it's not quite going to
work<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:15.020> I'm<00:03:15.140> actually<00:03:15.380> going<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.740> take<00:03:15.890> and

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
work so I'm actually going to take and

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.400 
work so I'm actually going to take and
I'm<00:03:16.220> going<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.400> roll<00:03:16.700> past<00:03:17.170> some<00:03:18.170> line

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
I'm going to roll past some line

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.430 
I'm going to roll past some line
straight<00:03:19.310> downstream<00:03:20.000> of<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.240> indicator<00:03:20.750> so

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
straight downstream of the indicator so

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.010 
straight downstream of the indicator so
that<00:03:21.470> I<00:03:21.710> can<00:03:21.920> get<00:03:22.070> my<00:03:22.250> line<00:03:22.550> out<00:03:22.910> closer<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.870> the

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
that I can get my line out closer to the

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.260 
that I can get my line out closer to the
indicator<00:03:24.560> therefore<00:03:25.460> make<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.700> indicator

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
indicator therefore make the indicator

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.390 
indicator therefore make the indicator
float<00:03:27.050> more<00:03:27.260> naturally<00:03:27.860> so<00:03:28.040> I'm<00:03:28.100> going<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.280> go

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
float more naturally so I'm going to go

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.490 
float more naturally so I'm going to go
through<00:03:28.640> that<00:03:28.730> motion<00:03:29.180> again<00:03:29.450> it's<00:03:30.080> just<00:03:30.260> a

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
through that motion again it's just a

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.710 
through that motion again it's just a
quick<00:03:30.830> snap<00:03:31.640> of<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:31.970> rod<00:03:32.150> tip<00:03:32.450> you're

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
quick snap of the rod tip you're

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.950 
quick snap of the rod tip you're
actually<00:03:33.200> going<00:03:33.320> to<00:03:33.440> throw<00:03:33.620> their<00:03:34.550> small<00:03:35.180> like

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
actually going to throw their small like

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.160 
actually going to throw their small like
a<00:03:35.990> miniature<00:03:36.560> roll<00:03:36.950> passed<00:03:37.450> down<00:03:38.450> towards<00:03:39.050> the

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
a miniature roll passed down towards the

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.380 
a miniature roll passed down towards the
indicator<00:03:39.650> like<00:03:39.980> that<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.820> that's<00:03:41.150> going<00:03:41.330> to

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
indicator like that and that's going to

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.170 
indicator like that and that's going to
propel<00:03:41.840> some<00:03:42.050> slack<00:03:42.410> out<00:03:42.740> there<00:03:43.070> closer<00:03:43.940> to

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
propel some slack out there closer to

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.510 
propel some slack out there closer to
the<00:03:44.360> indicator<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.890> that's<00:03:46.070> going<00:03:46.250> to<00:03:46.310> allow

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
the indicator and that's going to allow

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.250 
the indicator and that's going to allow
your<00:03:46.760> indicator<00:03:47.210> and<00:03:47.450> your<00:03:47.570> flies<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:48.050> fish

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
your indicator and your flies to fish

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.060 
your indicator and your flies to fish
more<00:03:48.470> drag-free

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
more drag-free

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.510 
more drag-free
therefore<00:03:49.760> catch<00:03:50.000> more<00:03:50.240> fish
