00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.610 
honey will recognize that they're
bringing<00:05:10.620> back<00:05:10.650> pure<00:05:11.130> honey<00:05:11.630> so<00:05:12.630> they<00:05:13.470> will

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
bringing back pure honey so they will

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.650 
bringing back pure honey so they will
put<00:05:13.800> them<00:05:13.979> on<00:05:14.160> the<00:05:14.280> defensive<00:05:14.810> because

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
put them on the defensive because

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.060 
put them on the defensive because
they'll<00:05:18.660> have<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.110> idea<00:05:19.530> that<00:05:19.620> they've

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
they'll have the idea that they've

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.710 
they'll have the idea that they've
robbed<00:05:20.430> this<00:05:20.990> this<00:05:21.990> honey<00:05:22.229> from<00:05:22.590> another<00:05:22.860> hive

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
robbed this this honey from another hive

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.670 
robbed this this honey from another hive
and

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
and

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.770 
and
and<00:05:28.259> so<00:05:29.259> that'll<00:05:29.560> think<00:05:29.800> if<00:05:30.610> these<00:05:30.970> bees<00:05:31.330> are

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
and so that'll think if these bees are

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.999 
and so that'll think if these bees are
getting<00:05:32.110> hunting<00:05:32.380> from<00:05:32.530> another<00:05:32.740> high

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
getting hunting from another high

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.670 
getting hunting from another high
there's<00:05:34.000> a<00:05:34.090> good<00:05:34.330> chance<00:05:34.630> that<00:05:34.990> Robert<00:05:35.500> these

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
there's a good chance that Robert these

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.969 
there's a good chance that Robert these
might<00:05:35.979> come<00:05:36.250> along<00:05:36.400> to<00:05:37.300> steal<00:05:37.570> their<00:05:37.840> honey<00:05:38.139> so

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
might come along to steal their honey so

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.600 
might come along to steal their honey so
then<00:05:39.160> they<00:05:39.310> get<00:05:39.490> more<00:05:39.729> on<00:05:39.940> a<00:05:39.970> defensive<00:05:41.610> yeah

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
then they get more on a defensive yeah

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.830 
then they get more on a defensive yeah
for<00:05:43.229> intruders<00:05:44.520> so<00:05:45.520> all<00:05:46.000> of<00:05:46.060> these<00:05:46.360> from<00:05:46.660> other

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
for intruders so all of these from other

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.320 
for intruders so all of these from other
horrors

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.120 

I'm<00:05:53.330> not<00:05:53.510> sure<00:05:53.750> if<00:05:53.990> the<00:05:54.170> numbers<00:05:54.560> of<00:05:54.590> build<00:05:54.980> up

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
I'm not sure if the numbers of build up

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.740 
I'm not sure if the numbers of build up
since<00:05:55.400> I've<00:05:55.580> been<00:05:55.760> talking<00:05:56.240> since<00:05:56.390> I've<00:05:56.600> been

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
since I've been talking since I've been

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.650 
since I've been talking since I've been
video<00:05:57.080> in<00:05:57.320> but

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.900 

weather<00:06:03.230> might<00:06:03.470> do<00:06:03.710> is<00:06:03.920> come<00:06:04.250> back<00:06:04.430> later<00:06:04.670> when

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
weather might do is come back later when

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.950

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
it's all cleaned up as you can see now

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.500 
it's all cleaned up as you can see now
the<00:06:08.990> numbers<00:06:09.470> are<00:06:09.590> dropping<00:06:09.740> so<00:06:10.510> they've

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
the numbers are dropping so they've

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.530 
the numbers are dropping so they've
cleaned<00:06:11.810> it<00:06:11.960> all<00:06:12.050> up<00:06:13.120> won't<00:06:14.120> be<00:06:14.210> long<00:06:14.240> that

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
cleaned it all up won't be long that

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.790 
cleaned it all up won't be long that
I'll<00:06:14.630> be<00:06:14.750> able<00:06:14.780> to<00:06:14.930> put<00:06:15.110> this<00:06:15.260> bucket<00:06:15.650> in<00:06:15.740> the

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
I'll be able to put this bucket in the

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.450 
I'll be able to put this bucket in the
rubbish<00:06:16.130> bin<00:06:16.160> I<00:06:16.990> can't<00:06:17.990> even<00:06:18.140> use<00:06:18.440> it<00:06:18.500> to<00:06:18.800> plant

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
rubbish bin I can't even use it to plant

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.630 
rubbish bin I can't even use it to plant
I<00:06:19.670> could<00:06:19.970> probably<00:06:20.240> use<00:06:20.450> it<00:06:20.600> to<00:06:20.690> put<00:06:20.900> plants<00:06:21.200> in

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
I could probably use it to put plants in

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.160 
I could probably use it to put plants in
