what<00:00:00.719> fascinates<00:00:01.319> me<00:00:01.410> on<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:01.709> planet<00:00:02.159> is<00:00:02.280> the

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
what fascinates me on this planet is the

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.079 
what fascinates me on this planet is the
diverse<00:00:03.060> many<00:00:04.020> different<00:00:04.920> races<00:00:05.190> we<00:00:05.819> have

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
diverse many different races we have

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.810 
diverse many different races we have
here<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.870> it<00:00:07.259> because<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.710> environment<00:00:08.670> and

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
here is it because of environment and

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.650 
here is it because of environment and
locale<00:00:09.540> or<00:00:10.309> are<00:00:11.309> these<00:00:11.639> all<00:00:11.969> have<00:00:12.389> always

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
locale or are these all have always

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.749 
locale or are these all have always
thought<00:00:12.929> about<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:14.130> more<00:00:14.309> we<00:00:14.429> look<00:00:14.610> at

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
thought about this the more we look at

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.849 
thought about this the more we look at
the<00:00:15.389> different<00:00:15.750> race<00:00:15.929> groups<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:16.500> planet

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
the different race groups on planet

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.439 
the different race groups on planet
earth<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.520> know<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:17.760> call<00:00:17.940> ourselves<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
earth you know we call ourselves the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.000 
earth you know we call ourselves the
human<00:00:18.720> race<00:00:18.900> but<00:00:19.109> we're<00:00:19.260> not<00:00:19.380> one<00:00:19.560> race<00:00:19.740> we

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
human race but we're not one race we

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.179 
human race but we're not one race we
distinctly<00:00:20.430> several<00:00:21.240> different<00:00:21.660> race<00:00:21.810> groups

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
distinctly several different race groups

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.500 
distinctly several different race groups
and<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.369> becomes<00:00:23.760> very<00:00:23.820> interesting<00:00:24.000> and

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
and that becomes very interesting and

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.779 
and that becomes very interesting and
often<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.289> very<00:00:25.320> sensitive<00:00:25.920> subject<00:00:26.490> but

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
often a very sensitive subject but

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.099 
often a very sensitive subject but
something<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.330> needs<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.630> be<00:00:27.750> discussed

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
something it needs to be discussed

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.240 
something it needs to be discussed
openly<00:00:28.769> without<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.880> know<00:00:30.769> racial<00:00:31.769> prejudice

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
openly without you know racial prejudice

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.840 
openly without you know racial prejudice
and<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.110> forth<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:35.100> becomes<00:00:35.489> more<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
and and so forth so it becomes more and

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.299 
and and so forth so it becomes more and
more<00:00:35.910> compelling<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:37.350> evidences<00:00:37.890> becomes

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
more compelling the evidences becomes

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.369 
more compelling the evidences becomes
overwhelming<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.090> are<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:40.020> did<00:00:40.200> not

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
overwhelming that we are we did not

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.180 
overwhelming that we are we did not
really<00:00:40.620> evolve<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.579> point<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.239> time<00:00:43.190> we

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
really evolve to this point in time we

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.090 
really evolve to this point in time we
somehow<00:00:44.640> were<00:00:45.360> manipulated<00:00:46.140> into<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.500> into

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
somehow were manipulated into this into

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.529 
somehow were manipulated into this into
this<00:00:47.129> point<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.700> time<00:00:47.879> there<00:00:48.180> was<00:00:48.300> therefore

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
this point in time there was therefore

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.049 
this point in time there was therefore
for<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.020> specific<00:00:49.230> reason<00:00:49.739> no<00:00:50.100> doubt<00:00:50.309> yeah

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
for a specific reason no doubt yeah

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.240 
for a specific reason no doubt yeah
exactly<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:52.260> know<00:00:52.350> some<00:00:52.590> evolutionists

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
exactly you know some evolutionists

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.830 
exactly you know some evolutionists
Michael<00:00:53.789> would<00:00:53.910> say<00:00:54.090> George<00:00:54.390> I'll<00:00:54.570> use<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
Michael would say George I'll use the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.849 
Michael would say George I'll use the
word<00:00:54.930> popped<00:00:55.289> up<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.800> we<00:00:56.250> evolved<00:00:56.879> yet<00:00:57.859> it's

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
word popped up we we evolved yet it's

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.150 
word popped up we we evolved yet it's
pretty<00:00:59.579> convincing<00:01:00.379> that<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.590> kind<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.010> just

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
pretty convincing that we kind of just

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.090 
pretty convincing that we kind of just
showed<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.730> all<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.120> sudden<00:01:03.510> isn't<00:01:03.690> it

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
showed up all of a sudden isn't it

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.130 
showed up all of a sudden isn't it
Cradle<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.129> Humankind<00:01:05.210> that<00:01:06.210> we<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.840> is

Cradle of Humankind that we that that is

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.730 
Cradle of Humankind that we that that is
being<00:01:07.290> sold<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.030> world<00:01:09.380> doesn't<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.500> any

110 caves just northwest of Johannesburg
over<00:01:29.220> 500<00:01:29.670> fossils<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.450> um<00:01:30.600> got<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.869> right

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
over 500 fossils this is um got it right

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.160 
over 500 fossils this is um got it right
but<00:01:31.860> they<00:01:32.040> all<00:01:32.250> hominis<00:01:32.820> no<00:01:33.090> human<00:01:33.540> skeletons

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
but they all hominis no human skeletons

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.289 
but they all hominis no human skeletons
there<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.799> these<00:01:34.950> are<00:01:35.189> all<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:36.470> supposedly

pre pre human evolutionary states they

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.289 
pre pre human evolutionary states they
are<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> human<00:01:43.250> this<00:01:44.250> has<00:01:44.700> become<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.270> very

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
planet a long time ago have you ever

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.640 
planet a long time ago have you ever
thought<00:02:33.319> of<00:02:33.470> that

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
thought of that

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.220 
thought of that
yeah<00:02:34.370> absolutely<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.420> once<00:02:35.690> again<00:02:35.840> you

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
yeah absolutely and and once again you

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.650 
yeah absolutely and and once again you
you<00:02:36.530> obviously<00:02:36.910> give<00:02:37.910> this<00:02:38.060> stuff<00:02:38.270> a<00:02:38.450> great

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
you obviously give this stuff a great

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.000 
you obviously give this stuff a great
deal<00:02:38.810> of<00:02:38.959> thought<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.170> i<00:02:39.410> think<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:39.770> put<00:02:39.980> your

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
deal of thought and i think you put your

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.710 
deal of thought and i think you put your
finger<00:02:40.400> right<00:02:40.430> on<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.730> button<00:02:40.970> one<00:02:41.270> one<00:02:41.569> more

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
finger right on the button one one more

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.710 
finger right on the button one one more
time

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
time

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.009 
time
once<00:02:44.720> again<00:02:44.900> i<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.260> look<00:02:45.800> at<00:02:45.920> this

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
once again i I look at this

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.350 
once again i I look at this
scientifically<00:02:48.019> genetically<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.400> and

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
scientifically genetically and and and

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.259 
scientifically genetically and and and
ecologically<00:02:51.350> you<00:02:51.950> know<00:02:52.130> if<00:02:52.370> we<00:02:52.910> only

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
ecologically you know if we only

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.110 
ecologically you know if we only
appeared<00:02:53.630> as<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.900> species<00:02:54.730> 250,000<00:02:55.730> years<00:02:55.820> ago

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
appeared as a species 250,000 years ago

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.009

and<00:02:56.800> not<00:02:57.800> enough<00:02:58.040> time<00:02:58.280> has<00:02:58.459> passed<00:02:58.760> for<00:02:59.150> these

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
and not enough time has passed for these

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.690 
and not enough time has passed for these
different<00:03:00.440> race<00:03:00.590> groups<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:01.130> have<00:03:01.250> evolved

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
different race groups to have evolved

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.240 
different race groups to have evolved
and<00:03:01.880> I<00:03:02.660> don't<00:03:02.840> care<00:03:03.080> what<00:03:03.260> anybody<00:03:03.650> throws<00:03:04.069> the

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
and I don't care what anybody throws the

juice it's just not going to happen

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.190

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
when i run into the Sun you know yeah it

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.920 
when i run into the Sun you know yeah it
doesn't<00:03:43.640> make<00:03:43.820> any<00:03:44.000> sense<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.540> there's<00:03:44.780> not

doesn't make any sense and there's not

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.780 
doesn't make any sense and there's not

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
thirst for us to have evolved so

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.750 
thirst for us to have evolved so
dramatically<00:03:50.299> into<00:03:50.780> these<00:03:51.709> three<00:03:52.280> or<00:03:52.459> four

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
dramatically into these three or four

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.970 
dramatically into these three or four
different<00:03:53.230> distinctly<00:03:54.230> different<00:03:54.470> race

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
different distinctly different race

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.099 
different distinctly different race
groups<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.910> it's<00:03:56.030> alright<00:03:56.450> when<00:03:56.720> i<00:03:56.750> said

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
groups and it's alright when i said

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.710 
groups and it's alright when i said
earlier<00:03:57.560> we<00:03:57.799> call<00:03:58.250> ourselves<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.760> human<00:03:59.150> race

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
earlier we call ourselves the human race

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.390 
earlier we call ourselves the human race
well<00:04:00.079> we<00:04:00.200> not<00:04:00.380> really<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.859> human<00:04:01.040> race

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
well we not really the human race

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.120 
well we not really the human race
because<00:04:02.299> we<00:04:02.480> are<00:04:02.600> not<00:04:02.750> one<00:04:03.079> race<00:04:03.410> group<00:04:03.739> we<00:04:03.950> are

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
because we are not one race group we are

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.699 
because we are not one race group we are
three<00:04:04.579> or<00:04:04.760> four<00:04:05.000> possibly<00:04:05.720> more<00:04:06.019> distinctly

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
three or four possibly more distinctly

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.319 
three or four possibly more distinctly
different<00:04:07.040> race<00:04:07.519> groups<00:04:07.880> but<00:04:08.120> there's

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
different race groups but there's

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.599 
different race groups but there's
obvious<00:04:09.200> ones<00:04:09.440> are<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.769> Caucasians<00:04:10.370> the

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
obvious ones are the Caucasians the

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.449 
obvious ones are the Caucasians the
Asians<00:04:11.420> but<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.170> Chinese<00:04:12.650> are<00:04:12.680> suppose<00:04:13.280> when

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
Asians but the Chinese are suppose when

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.030 
Asians but the Chinese are suppose when
I<00:04:13.489> say<00:04:13.670> Asian<00:04:14.060> I<00:04:14.150> mean<00:04:14.329> the<00:04:14.510> Chinese<00:04:15.440> type<00:04:16.870> look

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
I say Asian I mean the Chinese type look

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.730 
I say Asian I mean the Chinese type look
and<00:04:18.130> then<00:04:18.670> the<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.210> black<00:04:19.990> African<00:04:20.530> and

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:20.740 
and then the the the black African and

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.090 
and then the the the black African and
and<00:04:21.460> that<00:04:21.910> is<00:04:22.110> fascinating<00:04:23.110> stuff<00:04:23.410> because<00:04:23.800> it

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
and that is fascinating stuff because it

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.360 
and that is fascinating stuff because it
is<00:04:24.370> really<00:04:24.970> it<00:04:25.540> becomes<00:04:25.960> a<00:04:26.140> melting<00:04:26.590> pot<00:04:26.800> of<00:04:27.070> of

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
is really it becomes a melting pot of of

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.680 
is really it becomes a melting pot of of
debate<00:04:28.030> that<00:04:28.410> what<00:04:29.580> what<00:04:30.580> an<00:04:30.700> interesting<00:04:31.030> is

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690

earlier<00:04:32.260> this<00:04:32.470> year<00:04:32.530> I<00:04:32.770> think<00:04:32.950> it<00:04:33.070> was<00:04:33.160> in
