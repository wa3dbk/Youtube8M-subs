00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
now diving back into the high temp

now diving back into the high temp
itself<00:01:50.610> some<00:01:51.329> three<00:01:51.479> hundred<00:01:51.540> dollars<00:01:51.960> you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
itself some three hundred dollars you

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.660 
itself some three hundred dollars you
can't<00:01:52.259> beat<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.470> 5<00:01:52.799> colors<00:01:53.159> available<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.610> is

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
can't beat it 5 colors available this is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.069 
can't beat it 5 colors available this is
the<00:01:53.790> black<00:01:54.000> there's<00:01:54.210> also<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.450> silver<00:01:54.689> gunmetal

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
the black there's also a silver gunmetal

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.170 
the black there's also a silver gunmetal
I<00:01:55.259> think<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.500> blue<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.310> high<00:01:56.490> vis<00:01:56.790> which<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.149> a

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
I think a blue and a high vis which is a

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.999 
I think a blue and a high vis which is a
really<00:01:57.450> nice<00:01:57.659> option<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> great

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
really nice option you have a great

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.620 
really nice option you have a great
amount<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.430> functionality<00:01:59.969> here<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.509> also

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
amount of functionality here you also

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.030 
amount of functionality here you also
have<00:02:00.750> reflectivity<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.619> you're<00:02:01.740> gonna<00:02:01.860> even

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
have reflectivity and you're gonna even

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.620 
have reflectivity and you're gonna even
notice<00:02:02.219> here<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.610> arm<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:03.000> Chrissy<00:02:03.329> you're

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
notice here in the arm on Chrissy you're

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.999 
notice here in the arm on Chrissy you're
gonna<00:02:03.750> see<00:02:03.960> these<00:02:04.079> snaps<00:02:04.380> for<00:02:04.560> adjustability

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
gonna see these snaps for adjustability

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.609 
gonna see these snaps for adjustability
and<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.280> biceps<00:02:05.700> as<00:02:05.820> well<00:02:06.450> as<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.229> forearm

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
and the biceps as well as in the forearm

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.440 
and the biceps as well as in the forearm
and<00:02:07.770> again<00:02:08.220> very<00:02:08.489> basic<00:02:08.700> here<00:02:09.060> at<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.239> cuff

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
and again very basic here at the cuff

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.969 
and again very basic here at the cuff
now<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:09.929> we<00:02:10.020> think<00:02:10.200> about<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.470> liner<00:02:10.679> system

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
now if we think about the liner system

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.500 
now if we think about the liner system
the<00:02:11.489> liners<00:02:11.849> are<00:02:11.910> interesting<00:02:12.450> because

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
the liners are interesting because

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.890 
the liners are interesting because
they're<00:02:12.720> circumferential<00:02:13.530> zippers

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
they're circumferential zippers

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.110 
they're circumferential zippers
down<00:02:14.019> here<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.590> this<00:02:14.799> would<00:02:14.980> be<00:02:15.189> your<00:02:15.819> rain

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
down here so this would be your rain

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.729 
down here so this would be your rain
liner<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.569> actually<00:02:17.079> zips<00:02:17.290> around<00:02:17.409> like

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
liner that actually zips around like

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.559 
liner that actually zips around like
that<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.250> will<00:02:18.670> say<00:02:18.849> it's<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.030> low<00:02:19.150> profile

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
that I will say it's a low profile

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:20.910 
that I will say it's a low profile
zipper<00:02:19.930> but<00:02:20.079> some<00:02:20.260> folks<00:02:20.439> depending<00:02:20.590> on<00:02:20.860> the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
zipper but some folks depending on the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.259 
zipper but some folks depending on the
way<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.069> wear<00:02:21.250> your<00:02:21.280> gloves<00:02:21.579> that<00:02:22.000> might

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
way you wear your gloves that might

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.580 
way you wear your gloves that might
become<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.870> might<00:02:23.049> get<00:02:23.170> in<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.319> way<00:02:23.409> a<00:02:23.439> little

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
become and might get in the way a little

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.780 
become and might get in the way a little
bit<00:02:23.799> you<00:02:23.890> should<00:02:24.040> think<00:02:24.129> about<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.400> before

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
bit you should think about that before

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.100 
bit you should think about that before
you<00:02:24.819> invest<00:02:25.180> in<00:02:25.299> this<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.569> I'll<00:02:25.810> tell<00:02:25.989> you

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
you invest in this and I'll tell you

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.600 
you invest in this and I'll tell you
while<00:02:26.439> I'm<00:02:26.560> on<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.769> nitpicking<00:02:27.129> subject

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
while I'm on the nitpicking subject

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.710 
while I'm on the nitpicking subject
while<00:02:27.730> I<00:02:27.760> do<00:02:27.879> like<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.299> bang<00:02:28.450> for<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.689> buck

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
while I do like the bang for the buck

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.330 
while I do like the bang for the buck
factor<00:02:29.140> here<00:02:29.290> then<00:02:29.590> have<00:02:29.739> Chrissy<00:02:30.069> raise<00:02:30.220> her

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
factor here then have Chrissy raise her

the other big nitpick I have is right

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.890 
the other big nitpick I have is right
here<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.370> max<00:02:33.549> Tina<00:02:33.819> Pro<00:02:34.030> 500<00:02:34.299> D<00:02:34.689> and

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
it is what they call their titanium mesh

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.970 
it is what they call their titanium mesh
but<00:02:37.120> meshes<00:02:37.480> mesh<00:02:37.689> guys<00:02:37.930> there's<00:02:38.439> bomb<00:02:38.739> proof

but meshes mesh guys there's bomb proof

your basic mesh that's meant to flow air

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.259 
your basic mesh that's meant to flow air
I<00:02:42.129> would<00:02:42.310> have<00:02:42.489> loved<00:02:42.700> them<00:02:42.879> seeing<00:02:43.090> them

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
I would have loved them seeing them

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.819 
I would have loved them seeing them
encapsulate<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:43.959> seam<00:02:44.260> on<00:02:44.439> the<00:02:44.530> elbow
