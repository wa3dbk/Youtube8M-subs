00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
here things like that and then they've

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.510 
here things like that and then they've
tossed<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.899> bunch<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.530> widgets<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.399> can

see the only widgets in here you know
apps<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.160> I've<00:00:44.250> downloaded<00:00:45.680> or<00:00:46.680> just<00:00:46.950> stock

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
apps that I've downloaded or just stock

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.549 
apps that I've downloaded or just stock
Google<00:00:47.670> stuff<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.420> none<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.170> touch<00:00:49.379> was

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
Google stuff so none of that touch was

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.139 
Google stuff so none of that touch was
you<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.800> stuff<00:00:50.100> we<00:00:50.280> definitely<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.000> your

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
you have stuff we definitely have your

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.229 
you have stuff we definitely have your
five<00:00:51.390> home<00:00:51.660> screens<00:00:52.190> I<00:00:53.190> will<00:00:53.610> say<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.059> when

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
five home screens I will say that when

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.270 
five home screens I will say that when
I'm<00:00:54.329> been<00:00:54.809> flipping<00:00:55.230> through<00:00:55.469> screens<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
I'm been flipping through screens the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.340 
I'm been flipping through screens the
touch<00:00:56.460> sensitivity<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:57.000> pretty<00:00:57.539> good<00:00:57.750> it's

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
touch sensitivity is pretty good it's

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.590 
touch sensitivity is pretty good it's
not<00:00:58.500> mind<00:00:59.100> blowing<00:00:59.550> by<00:00:59.670> any<00:00:59.820> means<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.480> can

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
not mind blowing by any means you can

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.959 
not mind blowing by any means you can
see<00:01:00.750> there's<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.960> little<00:01:01.020> bit<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.410> leg<00:01:01.649> there<00:01:01.980> in

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
see there's a little bit of leg there in

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.520 
see there's a little bit of leg there in
between<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.690> would<00:01:03.899> almost<00:01:04.140> say<00:01:04.350> that

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
between that so I would almost say that

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.950 
between that so I would almost say that
the<00:01:04.619> zoom<00:01:04.890> might<00:01:05.400> possibly<00:01:05.670> beat<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.420> device

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the zoom might possibly beat this device

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.560 
the zoom might possibly beat this device
with<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.320> but<00:01:07.830> otherwise<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.549> far<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.450> know

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
with that but otherwise so far you know

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.200 
with that but otherwise so far you know
just<00:01:09.780> picking<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.260> up<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.650> holding<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.210> you

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
just picking it up and holding it you

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.550 
just picking it up and holding it you
can<00:01:12.360> see<00:01:12.510> it's<00:01:12.630> got<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.780> thicker<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.470> know

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
can see it's got a thicker you know

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.170 
can see it's got a thicker you know
bezel<00:01:14.010> going<00:01:14.220> around<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.520> edge<00:01:14.670> there<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.119> you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
bezel going around the edge there so you

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.330 
bezel going around the edge there so you
can<00:01:15.330> actually<00:01:15.420> hold<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.930> device<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.439> don't

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
can actually hold the device and don't

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.830 
can actually hold the device and don't
feel<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.670> you're<00:01:17.820> touching<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.299> screen<00:01:18.600> so

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
feel like you're touching the screen so

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.149 
feel like you're touching the screen so
it's<00:01:18.990> got<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> really<00:01:19.350> good<00:01:19.470> form<00:01:19.830> factor

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
it's got a really good form factor

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.429 
it's got a really good form factor
although<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.729> does<00:01:20.909> look<00:01:21.390> eerily<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
although it does look eerily like the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.820 
although it does look eerily like the
ipad<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.759> did<00:01:24.479> want<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.720> show<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.990> guys<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.590> my

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
zoom I just want to show you the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.260 
zoom I just want to show you the
difference<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.689> screen<00:01:28.170> colors<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:29.270> i'm

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
difference in the screen colors here i'm

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.730 
difference in the screen colors here i'm
not<00:01:30.479> sure<00:01:30.540> exactly<00:01:30.780> i<00:01:31.140> haven't<00:01:31.409> looked<00:01:31.560> at<00:01:31.650> the

differences<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> screens<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:34.950> i<00:01:34.979> have

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
differences is in the screens but i have

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.100 
differences is in the screens but i have
both<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.790> zoom<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:37.020> galaxy<00:01:37.590> tab<00:01:37.799> on

both of the zoom and the galaxy tab on

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.999 
both of the zoom and the galaxy tab on
probably<00:01:40.110> should<00:01:40.200> do<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.409> i<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.770> both<00:01:40.950> of

probably should do it i have both of

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.880 
probably should do it i have both of
them<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.460> full<00:01:42.210> brightness<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.170> i<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:43.740> want

difference in the greens how the samsung
device<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.750> definitely<00:01:49.140> brighter<00:01:49.470> more

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
device is definitely brighter more

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.039 
device is definitely brighter more
vibrant<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.820> zoom<00:01:51.030> sort<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.479> i<00:01:51.720> mean<00:01:51.899> that

vibrant and the zoom sort of i mean that

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.420 
vibrant and the zoom sort of i mean that
green<00:01:52.229> almost<00:01:52.409> looks<00:01:52.649> brown<00:01:53.009> when<00:01:53.340> you

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
green almost looks brown when you

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.399 
green almost looks brown when you
compare<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> galaxy<00:01:54.630> tab<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.290> don't

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
compare it to the galaxy tab and I don't

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.510 
compare it to the galaxy tab and I don't
know<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.590> my<00:01:55.680> cameras<00:01:56.009> aren't<00:01:56.130> great<00:01:56.369> job

the screen and again on the galaxy tab

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.580 
the screen and again on the galaxy tab
you<00:02:36.600> actually<00:02:36.720> have<00:02:36.930> plenty<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.230> room<00:02:37.410> over

there so different little bit different
form<00:02:39.660> factors<00:02:39.720> on<00:02:40.320> same<00:02:40.800> screen<00:02:41.040> size

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
form factors on same screen size

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.490 
form factors on same screen size
basically<00:02:41.730> same<00:02:41.910> specs<00:02:42.360> all<00:02:42.570> around<00:02:42.840> no<00:02:43.290> SD

card slot on the galaxy tab it is up 32
gig<00:02:47.460> internal<00:02:47.820> storage<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.210> you<00:02:48.300> should<00:02:48.420> have

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
gig internal storage so you should have

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.870 
gig internal storage so you should have
plenty<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.990> room<00:02:49.200> in<00:02:49.350> there<00:02:49.500> but<00:02:50.280> otherwise<00:02:50.490> so

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
plenty of room in there but otherwise so

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.940 
plenty of room in there but otherwise so
far<00:02:51.090> really<00:02:51.360> loving<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.720> like<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.200> size<00:02:52.500> like

far really loving it like the size like

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.430 
far really loving it like the size like
the<00:02:53.100> weight<00:02:53.340> like<00:02:54.240> how<00:02:54.420> thin<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:54.900> and

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
the weight like how thin it is and

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.270 
the weight like how thin it is and
definitely<00:02:56.430> 11<00:02:56.910> this<00:02:57.000> bright<00:02:57.330> screen<00:02:57.840> so

trying to show you guys a quick hands-on
little<00:03:02.310> walkthrough<00:03:02.520> of<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:02.970> but<00:03:03.510> basically

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
little walkthrough of it but basically

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.750 
little walkthrough of it but basically
it's<00:03:03.930> just<00:03:04.230> it's<00:03:04.950> just<00:03:05.040> stock<00:03:05.310> honeycomb

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
it's just it's just stock honeycomb

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
it's just it's just stock honeycomb
which<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:05.940> guys<00:03:06.060> have<00:03:06.180> seen<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.390> hundred<00:03:06.690> times

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
which you guys have seen a hundred times
