to<00:03:52.989> come<00:03:53.200> in<00:03:53.349> and<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:53.650> help<00:03:54.190> him<00:03:54.370> work<00:03:54.549> with

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
to come in and and help him work with

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.670 
to come in and and help him work with
them<00:03:55.000> and<00:03:55.239> in<00:03:55.510> time<00:03:55.870> test<00:03:56.139> the<00:03:56.290> boards<00:03:56.530> and

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
them and in time test the boards and

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.259 
them and in time test the boards and
makes<00:03:56.889> little<00:03:57.190> changes<00:03:57.549> to<00:03:57.579> him<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:57.880> continue

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
makes little changes to him and continue

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.089 
makes little changes to him and continue
to<00:03:58.359> make<00:03:58.510> board<00:03:58.989> after<00:03:59.290> board<00:03:59.650> after<00:03:59.859> board

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
to make board after board after board

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.370 
to make board after board after board

we're<00:04:02.560> down<00:04:02.709> to<00:04:02.950> some<00:04:03.250> more<00:04:03.430> subtle<00:04:03.700> changes

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
we're down to some more subtle changes

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
before we were that there were big

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.590 
before we were that there were big
changes<00:04:06.190> so<00:04:06.400> that<00:04:06.430> relationship<00:04:06.759> for<00:04:07.359> him<00:04:07.479> and

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
changes so that relationship for him and

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.420 
changes so that relationship for him and
I<00:04:07.660> has<00:04:07.750> been

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430

on<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.650> board<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.220> real<00:04:11.400> important<00:04:11.879> when

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
on a board is real important when

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.059 
on a board is real important when
