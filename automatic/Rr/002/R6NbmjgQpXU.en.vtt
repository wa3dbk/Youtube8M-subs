 Although the series has begun 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.960

 In a word, it is a pedestal of the collection straight 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:50.810
 It's really just a pedestal-only toy 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:56.149
 It is extremely expensive . 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:02:01.880

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.500
 right 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.190
 Like this 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:05.030
 Because it has a socket, it is in the shape of this walk 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:10.160
 This way you can attach it to this stand 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:14.060

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.540
 To say this 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.160

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:06.420

 And now I'm searching for a bit, but there is a medal holder here too and this is the upper side 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:36.030

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.090
 The result as a medal is also very good. 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.510
 Yes 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.430

 The price was a little bit 5,000 yen including shipping fee etc. 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:57.330
 And I use only double and response but I am very satisfied at all 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:02.569
 Of this target in Koromosuna cat-of-breed of pedestal 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:05.779
 You just put this mask collection on top 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:08.930
 The owner will come out, and this is also true from this itself 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:13.639
 The aura coming out isn't going to change a lot 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:18.620
 Well here I was very satisfied 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:21.949
