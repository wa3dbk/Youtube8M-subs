00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.129
 hello guys and welcome back the wardrobe 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.000
 of you style today to talk about how 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.559
 to copy 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.449
 obviously in low cost version and the 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.610
 look of a hit girl or kate 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.350
 bosworth is not so much a hit 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.720
 however, an actress is born like that 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.220
 American actress of undoubted 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.370
 beauty then this blonde hair 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.129
 crazy eyes of different color one 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.110
 green 1 brown paparazzi usually 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.120
 for her perfect outfits the 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.100
 surely remember the coach she 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.320
 festival always with hot pants 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.489
 of the booties 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.430
 let's try to copy the first one 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.860
 outfits that I would call bon ton because 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.270
 provides for the combination of a fur 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.789
 she actually as you have noticed 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.210
 from the image to be copied 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:18.520
 to this sweatshirt fur t shirt is a 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.649
 mix so it is closed without the zip in front 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.740
 I definitely propose a solution to you 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:27.490
 more available in stores like precisely 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.800
 a micro gray fur to match 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.690
 to a shirt precisely because his is 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.520
 a sweatshirt then a kind of 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.789
 sweater I instead propose you the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.119
 open version and a white blouse 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:43.170
 It is fine in a microskirts 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.330
 sequins to illuminate the whole is 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.649
 really unlikely solution perhaps for 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.630
 we who are not used to that of 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.119
 match it with a dancer or one 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.950
 lougher then a very low shoe 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.450
 under this outfit you can match us 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.509
 quietly a décolleté or a 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.630
 heel trick maybe thin for 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.340
 slender the figure then a clutch 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.130
 I chose it black but you can too 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.349
 match it with something metallic and then 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.360
 still a face like this the hill 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.400
 that I wear to illuminate everything 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.959
 maybe hair pick them up because 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.540
 already having the fur and then 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.370
 something very voluminous in the part 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.049
 high of your silhouette 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.450
 actually tends to loose hair 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.920
 It would tend to swell a little everything and 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.810
 so to emphasize too much 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.810
 let's try to see the second outfit 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.469
 this rather definitely a more 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.569
 rocket than the first provides 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:43.730
 the use of a mini dress in 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.069
 sequins have fun here too with i 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.989
 colors if you don't want to use black too 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.390
 the golden gray is fine 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.000
 squeeze your waistline with one 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.939
 leather belt that then pushes the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.060
 figure and then you preferred a couple of 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:01.790
 otherwise, thin heeled tricks 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.439
 even a décolleté is fine is one 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.109
 clutch that maybe pick up a little 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.849
 belt and shoe colors 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.590
 maybe you can also reuse the 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.879
 same you used for the look 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.419
 previous and those accessories 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.430
 actually they are versatile on ours 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:18.620
 proposed outfits and then at that point 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.900
 hair loose because you don't have much 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.519
 a coat for which to refine a 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.019
 little your outfit 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.370
 and what to say you will be perfect for yours 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.370
 evening bye girls
