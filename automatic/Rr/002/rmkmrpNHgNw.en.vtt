00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:06.580
 expanding our knowledge about classes css 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.959
 i 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:14.450
 about the use of survivors said 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.300
 between the layers 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.279
 that can be inserted center tables we will try to make a 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.659
 composition as we have it and on whose screen 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:32.119
 where are we going to see a design a few photo captions that are going to illustrate with some 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.119
 texts some images that are finding others 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.640
 one alignment left the other right 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.969
 And where are we going to achieve this text overlay on the image 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:44.960
 everything is not necessary 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.000
 do it like 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.300
 Caracas 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.620
 typing type but it can be done with layers 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.340
 normal with layers 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.490
 fixed position 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.780
 as long as we can these images in the background 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.780
 for this we are going to start from this situation where 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.430
 let's create first 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.490
 a new ccs rule but not the class amount 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.910
 and we're going to finish it 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.830
 classes start with a dot their names and they differ 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.570
 of the identity elements 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.340
 in the sense that some kind 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.430
 it can not be applied to any html element 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.960
 and not necessarily to one that has a certain name as they are 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.030
 those that start with the pad 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.300
 then we are going to do 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.490
 a class called right we are going to occupy first of all the fund 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.490
 and what we are going to do is going to be 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.320
 an image that we have previously prepared from photoshop previously 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.580
 optimized 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.330
 and we're going to tell you not to repeat that background image 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.140
 that the horizontal position is the right and that the vertical position is 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.970
 the fringe 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.380
 if we 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.070
 we apply it 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.170
 we will have here already created the rule and to apply it to these cells not 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.960
 We will have more to select your corresponding label with the button 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.759
 right we would apply 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.089
 we would have a background image 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.139
 that will admit any element 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.729
 that can come superimposed over 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.729
 for example the caption 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.340
 and what's not going to happen again, as it happens with all background images 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.769
 by default that mosaic is repeated 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:31.759
 plus 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:33.669
 we have an alignment 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:35.789
 on the right 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:39.319
 To do the caption, what we are going to do is insert an element 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:43.879
 inserted label design objects 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.879
 and we're going to call it a basilica 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.619
 in this text 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:58.219
 we will place a text through our extension of loren hinkson 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:03.159
 enter a paragraph 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.629
 let's reduce 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.629
 it's a bit excessive 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:12.129
 what we are going to do is going to be 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.069
 in this sense 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.419
 we go every tear shape with a 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.419
 different rule that is going to be 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.939
 his name is that we are going to give 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:26.879
 this 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.959
 the cell that has a name as we can see in the inspector of 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.010
 properties that is called basilica we are going to create a rule 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.909
 but it will not be 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.299
 of the kind 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.169
 let's do 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.930
 various changes like for example let's put a background color 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.369
 Dark 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:52.589
 Kyle, let's put 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:53.899
 at the source 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:55.679
 we are going to put nasralÃ¡ 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:56.809
 to ten points 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:58.689
 in white 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.689
 if we apply the changes we can see what is happening to us 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.720
 also what we are going to do is to establish the width of the painting 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.620
 we are going to put him for example 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.249
 120 pixels 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.129
 to the box 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.029
 and we can see 

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:17.759
 what our situation 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.659
 which we will realize that usually the stop is usually left in 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:22.280
 White 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.210
 for which the high is automatic in such a way that the tables 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.710
 and in the layers just as the tables are expandable that is to say as 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.419
 let's go that this grows high 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.849
 Anyway, you can also set a certain height 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:41.770
 we can put here an amount without pixels and if that text 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.319
 overwhelmed 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.529
 we could 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:47.610
 through 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.050
 d the position in the 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.749
 sheep category 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:53.539
 we could 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.789
 choose if the overflowed text that comes out 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.689
 out of the layer because it does not fit 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:00.189
 If i were 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:02.680
 visible if it would be hidden 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.499
 or do we want that 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:06.749
 Mark us 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:11.439
 foundation scroll bars the scroll bars to be able to follow the 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:12.169
 laws 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.059
 At the moment we are not going to go down as is 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:17.370
 and we will accept 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.289
 we will see also 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.879
 another situation is that in this one 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.389
 capable we have 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.729
 here on the left 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.049
 and we have established a margin value to achieve alignment 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:30.409
 where we 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.699
 percent let's establish 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.550
 if we want for example to be another layer 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.169
 go squeezing 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.550
 to the cell that has contiguous 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.550
 we could be establishing a margin on the right 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.319
 in such a way that 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:49.050
 in the category box 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.279
 we are going to put a margin on the right 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:55.599
 we are going to put it 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.599
 the box has 120 pixels and approximately 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.450
 Well, it's going to be about 240 pixels 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:07.339
 the total width of the cell 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:09.559
 we are not going to put 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:12.719
 for example in the value of the right 120 feet 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:16.939
 if we were increasing the value of 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:19.050
 margin 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.059
 we could see how 

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:24.099
 this margin 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:27.369
 is tightening the cell 

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:29.249
 alsea front 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:30.120
 and how 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.150
 we could be achieving a position mask 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.639
 different 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:38.589
 we could 

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:43.219
 to re-edit this one asks for photos and it seems too high for 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:46.559
 example we could win 

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:50.509
 in the width I started at 120 pixels which are 140 pixels 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.119
 and we could see the result 

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:57.039
 as well 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:59.629
 we can see how here in the cell 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:01.030
 As the order 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.849
 the vertical alignment are lower could be on top 

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:06.960
 could be 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.889
 in the middle but this is an attribute of the cell 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:13.059
 of the table cell that is moving away 

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:16.059
 to everything and with this we are achieving here also an overlay 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:19.009
 finally we are going to give 

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:22.009
 in the category border 

00:07:24.149 --> 00:07:25.710
 let's give for example 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:26.930
 dotted 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.930
 and in the lower one also dotted 

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:33.830
 although exempt 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.689
 compilation 

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:38.449
 and there was color 

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:41.449
 a bar declared 

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:45.249
 the edge 

00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:48.249
 for the edge of being 

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:53.179
 we would keep and our father and request for example to explore 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:58.119
 and we would have this effect 

00:07:58.119 --> 00:07:59.369
 feet of photo 

00:07:59.369 --> 00:08:04.189
 that overlap the images without using the cells 

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:05.879
 the seventeenth century 

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:06.899
 we see how 

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:09.969
 the layers we can be anita fairies inside 

00:08:09.969 --> 00:08:10.619
 in the tables
