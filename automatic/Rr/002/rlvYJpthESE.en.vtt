00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.839
 you know how I feel about it in every game 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.960
 are several games should be read on 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.389
 tactical plan played should be studied a 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.340
 moment to have also vary a 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.520
 also the theme of the speech today 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.869
 the game the match the team has 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.160
 made a great match on the plan 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.630
 dribble wasn't easy because 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.939
 we faced a very closed team 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.930
 compact 15 I wanted great speed of 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.130
 dribble of turning of 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.289
 quality verticalisations 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.960
 the kids did it all to do it 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.030
 indeed we have unfortunately had the misfortune 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.500
 to pass at a disadvantage has complicated 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.660
 but there was always a little things 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.760
 right attitude right mindset 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.670
 all the way down to wanting to take home i 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.710
 three points like ours in ours 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.149
 head both home and away during 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.250
 we also work on the week 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.230
 placed on these things here he has the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.760
 ability to be able to go even to 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.360
 improve in this respect of 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.969
 be decisive and poisonous even on 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.250
 these situations from placed andrea sa 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.060
 what I think therefore must continue to 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.990
 work with great humility trust e 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.630
 trying to improve to grow 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.220
 still room for improvement 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.170
 important we forget that at twenty 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.420
 of ton years so it is clear that we 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.000
 we are called as technical staff ad 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.820
 have on him and his other companions 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.310
 in growth he wished to hope for one 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.170
 fast and rapid growth because it can give 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.850
 a hand like he did today to the team 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.350
 jajalo whereas for four years 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.170
 who was with us made a good race 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.579
 so it inserted itself well into the mechanism 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.409
 it is clear that even more and we will work 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.630
 together he will know his companions 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.890
 will know what we have in mind of 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.299
 wanting to do at the organizational level 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.880
 of play 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.649
 as regards the ranking the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.180
 I look up to a certain point already 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.680
 I think about the next game of what 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.010
 we should do what we have to do 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.750
 let's take a step at a time 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.460
 let's get to those 40 as soon as possible 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.830
 points that are a primary goal for 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.410
 we will then try to reach them 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.410
 to go climbing again in the mountains
