00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
size of its brain so that's why we use

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.439

it is driving nuts 177 you would have

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.139 
it is driving nuts 177 you would have
landed<00:02:01.710> where<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.950> were<00:02:02.070> looking<00:02:02.189> that's<00:02:02.939> why

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
landed where you were looking that's why

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.050 
landed where you were looking that's why
I<00:02:03.180> seat<00:02:03.479> 177<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.979> hope<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.850> chalk

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
I seat 177 the hope is that the chalk

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.510 
I seat 177 the hope is that the chalk
discs<00:02:06.450> are<00:02:06.780> delicate<00:02:07.290> enough<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:08.069> not<00:02:08.340> to

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
discs are delicate enough so not to

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.300 
discs are delicate enough so not to
disturb<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.119> flight<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.660> pellet<00:02:10.099> we<00:02:11.099> get
