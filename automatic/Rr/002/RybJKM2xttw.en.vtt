00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
docking station itself and it looks a

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.639 
docking station itself and it looks a
lot<00:00:52.590> like<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.699> know<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> wireless<00:00:54.480> router<00:00:54.750> that

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
lot like you know a wireless router that

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.950 
lot like you know a wireless router that
you<00:00:55.829> might<00:00:56.010> plug<00:00:56.219> into<00:00:56.430> your<00:00:56.610> computer<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:57.840> it

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
you might plug into your computer so it

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.450 
you might plug into your computer so it
doesn't<00:00:58.230> take<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:58.440> much<00:00:58.500> space<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:59.219> pretty

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
doesn't take up much space it's pretty
