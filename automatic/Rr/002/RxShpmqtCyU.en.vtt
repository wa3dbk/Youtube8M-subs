00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
is make sure it lands right here this is

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.090 
is make sure it lands right here this is
good<00:03:53.430> we<00:03:54.430> just<00:03:54.460> need<00:03:54.700> it<00:03:54.730> to<00:03:54.820> land<00:03:55.060> right<00:03:55.240> there

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
I guess this isn't the touchback drill

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.490 
I guess this isn't the touchback drill
because<00:04:01.390> there's<00:04:01.630> one<00:04:01.810> way<00:04:02.020> you<00:04:02.080> have<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:02.380> make

because there's one way you have to make

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.560 
because there's one way you have to make
sure<00:04:02.530> it's<00:04:02.800> not<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:02.950> touch<00:04:03.220> back<00:04:03.459> this<00:04:04.209> is<00:04:04.390> kind
