00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.819
 here 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.830
 Ivan and love 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.820
 how about friends of youtube thanks for 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.650
 be here with us on the green route 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.860
 and as you usually know every day 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.290
 he uploaded his video today 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:33.030
 corresponds to the subject man and woman 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:35.730
 of the future as we know the DNA is in 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.890
 constant evolution in any kind of 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.530
 be alive and different then scientists 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.420
 have been analyzing what would be the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.920
 possible development of the human being inside 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.109
 of a thousand years 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.649
 let's start first with nothing 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:57.809
 outside it is estimated that due to 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.729
 activities that the human being has and 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.559
 because of how you think you are going to go 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.390
 developing the human being 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.649
 human would be measuring on average 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.659
 between 185 and more than 2 meters 10 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.960
 centimeters that would be the average 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.830
 imagine the tall people within a thousand 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.500
 years will probably measure 220 250 no 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.170
 giants for what is the stature of 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.600
 now and in fact we can see how it does 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.390
 thousand years the human being was then let's say 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.720
 much smaller than the human being of 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.270
 nowadays it is also believed that the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.060
 arms and fingers will be much more 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.090
 long because the activities will already be 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:43.860
 let's say more computers more 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.280
 robotic more let's say intellectuals than 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.530
 otherwise on the other hand also 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.830
 consider that the head probably 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.810
 it would be a little smaller in proportion 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.070
 to what we now know as the body 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.250
 perfect human 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.650
 this would also be because it is believed that 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.340
 because of all the development that there is of 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.410
 computers a lot of memory that 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.039
 uses the brain at present not 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.709
 will use chips that we will have inside 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.420
 the head which we will no longer need 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.610
 use both the brain without understanding to 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.459
 the chips that will do that job for 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.250
 we in fact humans as 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.200
 such would be finished they would no longer be beings 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.810
 humans in their totality would be 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.080
 sidewalks we would be let's say a 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.989
 combination between human being and robot and 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.070
 we would have say in the possibility of 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.440
 jump much higher to achieve good 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.480
 eradicate all diseases due 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.570
 to all this kind of technology that 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.269
 supposes according to this newspaper of asÃ³n that 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.760
 is the one that makes a note and has interviewed 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.110
 different scientists who are in the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.660
 search of where 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:01.460
 and the DNA of the human being if we are going to be 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.060
 developed in this way or not not what 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.840
 we will know up to many hundreds 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.930
 of years more say that for now they are 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.060
 speculations but surely this 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.910
 video and all the information that we have 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.390
 now and that is hovering over the internet 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:24.130
 let's say it will be a large file which 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.580
 men and women of the future will 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:31.390
 count to be able to know the story and 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.450
 to be able to say let's see how we were 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.670
 before so greet the future and 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.620
 well we are talking on twitter in 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.770
 the green route we see also the 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.220
 next hangout remember are Tuesdays 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.400
 Friday and Saturday at 9 the night until 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.400
 then
