a<00:02:14.900> hard<00:02:15.140> lead<00:02:15.380> pencil<00:02:15.920> it's<00:02:16.430> not<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.760> one<00:02:16.910> that

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
a hard lead pencil it's not the one that

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.850 
a hard lead pencil it's not the one that
I<00:02:17.150> use<00:02:17.180> for<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.720> majority<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.560> drawing

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
I use for the majority of the drawing

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.680 
I use for the majority of the drawing
but<00:02:19.220> have<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.490> start<00:02:19.790> there<00:02:20.060> you'll<00:02:20.240> see<00:02:20.480> when

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
but have to start there you'll see when

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.850 
but have to start there you'll see when
I'm<00:02:20.780> doing<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.140> outline<00:02:21.530> I'm<00:02:21.680> actually

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
I'm doing that outline I'm actually

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.390 
I'm doing that outline I'm actually
pressing<00:02:22.340> pretty<00:02:22.730> hard<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:24.290> find<00:02:25.130> that<00:02:25.220> it's

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
pressing pretty hard I find that it's

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.160 
pressing pretty hard I find that it's
better<00:02:25.610> it<00:02:25.880> doesn't<00:02:26.060> smudge<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.660> go<00:02:26.840> away<00:02:26.959> so

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
better it doesn't smudge and go away so

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.440 
better it doesn't smudge and go away so
I<00:02:27.380> don't<00:02:27.650> lose<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:27.950> that<00:02:28.580> main<00:02:28.880> outline

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
I don't lose that that main outline

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.940 
I don't lose that that main outline
where<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:29.780> can<00:02:30.050> use<00:02:30.260> as<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.500> measurement

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
where I can use as a measurement

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.250 
where I can use as a measurement
sometimes<00:02:31.940> if<00:02:32.150> you're<00:02:32.240> quick<00:02:32.450> enough<00:02:32.480> you'll
