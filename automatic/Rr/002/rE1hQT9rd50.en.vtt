latest foray into accessories and the

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.309 
latest foray into accessories and the
first<00:02:30.340> thing<00:02:30.489> you'll<00:02:30.609> notice<00:02:30.819> is<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.239> it<00:02:31.930> has

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
first thing you'll notice is that it has

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.929 
first thing you'll notice is that it has
these<00:02:32.530> nice<00:02:32.890> rubber<00:02:33.549> buds<00:02:34.409> and<00:02:35.409> I<00:02:35.859> can<00:02:36.099> happily

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
these nice rubber buds and I can happily

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.899 
these nice rubber buds and I can happily
report<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.629> they<00:02:37.840> fit<00:02:38.769> snugly<00:02:39.159> in<00:02:39.430> your<00:02:39.609> ear

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
it's very important that these buds

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.500 
it's very important that these buds
successfully<00:02:44.019> create<00:02:44.829> a<00:02:44.890> seal<00:02:45.400> in<00:02:45.700> your<00:02:46.329> ear

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
successfully create a seal in your ear

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.559 
successfully create a seal in your ear
because<00:02:46.690> that's<00:02:46.959> what<00:02:47.319> allows<00:02:47.790> these<00:02:48.790> style

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
because that's what allows these style

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.369 
because that's what allows these style
of<00:02:49.930> headphones<00:02:50.409> the<00:02:50.709> style<00:02:51.010> of<00:02:51.129> headphone<00:02:51.489> to

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
of headphones the style of headphone to

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.270 
of headphones the style of headphone to
to<00:02:53.379> reproduce<00:02:53.980> those<00:02:54.310> lows<00:02:55.769> in<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:57.069> sound

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
to reproduce those lows in the sound

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.759 
to reproduce those lows in the sound
spectrum<00:02:57.549> and<00:02:58.150> they<00:02:58.780> do<00:02:58.840> stay<00:02:59.260> in<00:02:59.439> the<00:02:59.560> air

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
spectrum and they do stay in the air

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.710 
spectrum and they do stay in the air
which<00:03:00.700> was<00:03:00.849> a<00:03:00.879> big<00:03:01.120> problem<00:03:01.239> with<00:03:01.629> the

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
which was a big problem with the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.690 
which was a big problem with the
original<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:02.379> your<00:03:02.560> headphones<00:03:02.739> they<00:03:03.220> always

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
original in your headphones they always

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.780 
original in your headphones they always
fell<00:03:03.939> out<00:03:04.139> so<00:03:05.139> that's<00:03:05.950> been<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.340> successful

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
fell out so that's been a successful

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.599 
fell out so that's been a successful
redesign<00:03:07.599> from<00:03:07.780> that<00:03:08.019> perspective<00:03:08.609> moving

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
redesign from that perspective moving

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:14.580 
redesign from that perspective moving
along<00:03:10.230> we<00:03:11.230> see<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:12.780> mic<00:03:13.780> clicker<00:03:14.290> has

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
along we see that the mic clicker has

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.770 
along we see that the mic clicker has
evolved<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.129> little<00:03:15.340> bit<00:03:15.519> if<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.329> look<00:03:16.480> at<00:03:16.629> the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
evolved a little bit if you look at the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.849 
evolved a little bit if you look at the
original<00:03:17.019> mic<00:03:17.680> clicker<00:03:18.989> it's<00:03:19.989> somewhat

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
original mic clicker it's somewhat

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.099 
original mic clicker it's somewhat
smaller<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.669> the<00:03:21.849> opening<00:03:22.599> for<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.810> mic<00:03:22.959> is

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
smaller and the opening for the mic is

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.619 
smaller and the opening for the mic is
also<00:03:23.440> smaller<00:03:23.799> if<00:03:24.639> you<00:03:24.699> flip<00:03:25.030> over<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.359> new

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
also smaller if you flip over the new

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.839 
also smaller if you flip over the new
one<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:25.989> see<00:03:26.260> that<00:03:26.440> we<00:03:26.530> have<00:03:26.709> these<00:03:26.919> added

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
one you see that we have these added

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.089 
one you see that we have these added

controls we have plus and minus and

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.629 
controls we have plus and minus and
these<00:03:30.250> are<00:03:30.400> actually<00:03:30.909> volume<00:03:31.239> controls<00:03:31.690> now

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
these are actually volume controls now

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.610 
these are actually volume controls now
unfortunately<00:03:33.639> the<00:03:34.090> volume<00:03:34.480> controls<00:03:34.989> don't

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
unfortunately the volume controls don't

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.759 
unfortunately the volume controls don't
work<00:03:35.769> currently<00:03:36.669> with<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.540> iPhone<00:03:38.440> they<00:03:38.590> only
