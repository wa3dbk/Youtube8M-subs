and<00:01:42.480> offline<00:01:43.050> a<00:01:43.110> few<00:01:43.320> years<00:01:43.650> has<00:01:43.860> give<00:01:44.160> me<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
and offline a few years has give me a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.380 
and offline a few years has give me a
great<00:01:44.460> deal<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.640> pleasure<00:01:44.940> it's<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> great

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
great deal of pleasure it's a great

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.880 
great deal of pleasure it's a great
entry-level<00:01:45.720> machine<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.620> actually

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
entry-level machine but this actually

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.920 
entry-level machine but this actually
worked<00:01:47.160> out<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.400> be<00:01:47.430> cheaper<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.630> slightly

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
worked out to be cheaper it's slightly

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.590 
worked out to be cheaper it's slightly
bigger<00:01:49.230> and<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:50.430> certainly<00:01:50.910> looks<00:01:51.150> a<00:01:51.330> whole

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
bigger and it certainly looks a whole

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.930 
bigger and it certainly looks a whole
lot<00:01:51.630> better<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.560> what<00:01:53.370> did<00:01:53.550> I<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:53.760> for<00:01:53.880> my

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
lot better so what did I get for my

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.700 
lot better so what did I get for my
money<00:01:54.240> well<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.480> got<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> couple<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.110> wagons<00:01:55.410> as

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
money well I got a couple of wagons as

it could even be some flutter issues
there<00:02:38.510> who<00:02:38.870> knows<00:02:39.079> when<00:02:39.349> you<00:02:39.440> get<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.590> bit<00:02:39.709> of

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
there who knows when you get a bit of

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.699 
there who knows when you get a bit of
speed<00:02:39.980> on<00:02:40.099> and<00:02:41.019> other<00:02:42.019> thing<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.379> can<00:02:42.500> send

wing now as I say $100 dlg you don't

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.160 
wing now as I say $100 dlg you don't
expect<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.879> youth<00:02:47.000> but<00:02:47.209> you<00:02:47.299> do<00:02:47.510> expect<00:02:47.989> a

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
expect the youth but you do expect a

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.869 
expect the youth but you do expect a
little<00:02:48.379> bit<00:02:48.500> of<00:02:48.650> quality<00:02:49.069> control<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:49.790> I'm

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
little bit of quality control and I'm

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.640 
little bit of quality control and I'm
afraid<00:02:50.090> I've<00:02:50.840> got<00:02:51.019> to<00:02:51.079> give<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.230> big<00:02:51.379> thumbs

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
afraid I've got to give a big thumbs

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.170 
afraid I've got to give a big thumbs
down<00:02:52.129> for<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.400> quality<00:02:52.700> control<00:02:52.909> on<00:02:53.090> this

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
down for the quality control on this

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.550 
down for the quality control on this
model<00:02:53.359> it's<00:02:53.599> not<00:02:53.659> our<00:02:53.870> two<00:02:53.989> hobbies<00:02:54.230> problem

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
model it's not our two hobbies problem

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.199 
model it's not our two hobbies problem
well<00:02:55.099> it<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.430> problem<00:02:55.730> but<00:02:55.819> it's<00:02:55.940> not<00:02:56.060> your

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
well it is a problem but it's not your

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.300 
well it is a problem but it's not your

look at this I'll show you here we go
here<00:03:03.260> is<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.819> Euler<00:03:04.819> and<00:03:04.970> on<00:03:05.060> this<00:03:05.329> wing<00:03:05.540> you

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
here is the Euler and on this wing you

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.180 
here is the Euler and on this wing you
can<00:03:05.989> see<00:03:06.109> it<00:03:06.230> goes<00:03:06.349> up<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.650> down<00:03:06.709> goes<00:03:06.950> up<00:03:07.069> and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
can see it goes up and down goes up and

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.819 
can see it goes up and down goes up and
there's<00:03:07.310> lovely<00:03:07.639> up<00:03:07.940> yeah<00:03:08.420> yeah<00:03:09.049> fine<00:03:09.470> no

there's lovely up yeah yeah fine no
problems<00:03:10.250> here<00:03:10.879> is<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.150> Euler<00:03:12.139> and<00:03:12.260> on<00:03:12.319> the

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
problems here is the Euler and on the

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:13.960 
problems here is the Euler and on the
other<00:03:12.500> wing<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.769> goes<00:03:12.889> up<00:03:13.129> but<00:03:13.459> it<00:03:13.579> doesn't<00:03:13.730> go

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
other wing it goes up but it doesn't go

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.210 
other wing it goes up but it doesn't go
down<00:03:14.000> look<00:03:14.599> that's<00:03:15.139> it<00:03:15.319> it<00:03:15.440> goes<00:03:15.590> just<00:03:16.010> below

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
down look that's it it goes just below

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.860 
down look that's it it goes just below
level<00:03:16.700> there's<00:03:16.879> the<00:03:17.000> Snowdown<00:03:17.450> movement

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
level there's the Snowdown movement

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.280 
level there's the Snowdown movement
because<00:03:18.790> this<00:03:19.790> bolster<00:03:20.209> here<00:03:20.420> is<00:03:20.510> walked<00:03:20.780> so

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
because this bolster here is walked so

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.319 
because this bolster here is walked so
it<00:03:21.500> hits<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.250> then<00:03:22.639> won't<00:03:22.849> give<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.120> any

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
it hits and then won't give you any

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.629 
it hits and then won't give you any
downward<00:03:23.900> movement<00:03:24.260> on<00:03:24.379> that<00:03:24.410> I<00:03:24.620> Lauren<00:03:24.859> what

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
downward movement on that I Lauren what

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.729 
downward movement on that I Lauren what
a<00:03:25.819> pain<00:03:26.120> in<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.299> backside<00:03:26.720> I'm<00:03:27.230> gonna<00:03:27.379> have<00:03:27.560> to

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
and then re hinge it so it's going to

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.280 
and then re hinge it so it's going to

have been a really quick simple build is
now<00:04:01.250> going<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.459> be<00:04:01.519> complicated<00:04:01.849> by<00:04:02.269> the<00:04:02.329> fact

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
now going to be complicated by the fact

now going to be complicated by the fact
I<00:04:02.659> have<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:02.900> fix<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.470> damn<00:04:03.709> islands<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.459> AH

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
I have to fix the damn islands and AH

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.210 
I have to fix the damn islands and AH
you<00:04:05.419> know<00:04:05.540> he<00:04:06.169> ruins<00:04:06.500> it<00:04:06.590> it<00:04:06.799> was<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.099> whole

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
you know he ruins it it was the whole

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.550 
you know he ruins it it was the whole
experience<00:04:07.609> so<00:04:07.760> it's<00:04:08.480> gonna<00:04:08.569> be<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:09.109> lot<00:04:09.470> of

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
experience so it's gonna be a lot of

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.619 
experience so it's gonna be a lot of
points<00:04:09.799> off<00:04:09.949> on<00:04:10.190> this<00:04:10.370> model<00:04:10.699> because<00:04:10.940> I<00:04:11.180> have

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
points off on this model because I have

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.599 
points off on this model because I have
to<00:04:11.750> rebuild<00:04:12.379> the<00:04:12.500> damn<00:04:12.709> wing<00:04:12.949> just<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.459> make

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
to rebuild the damn wing just to make

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.120 
to rebuild the damn wing just to make
the<00:04:13.730> ailerons<00:04:14.150> work<00:04:14.620> now<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:15.680> other<00:04:15.859> thing<00:04:16.010> is

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
the ailerons work now the other thing is

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.560 
the ailerons work now the other thing is
that<00:04:16.159> no<00:04:16.430> instructions<00:04:17.060> at<00:04:17.150> all<00:04:17.329> with<00:04:17.479> this

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
that no instructions at all with this

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.870 
that no instructions at all with this
model<00:04:17.870> no<00:04:18.199> instructions<00:04:18.829> whatsoever<00:04:18.889> so<00:04:19.820> you

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
model no instructions whatsoever so you

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.240 
model no instructions whatsoever so you
have<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.060> be<00:04:20.150> a<00:04:20.180> bit<00:04:20.299> of<00:04:20.329> a<00:04:20.799> it's<00:04:21.799> not<00:04:21.949> a<00:04:22.010> first

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
have to be a bit of a it's not a first

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.189 
have to be a bit of a it's not a first
model<00:04:22.729> by<00:04:22.970> any<00:04:23.210> means<00:04:23.510> because<00:04:23.870> there's<00:04:24.050> a<00:04:24.080> lot

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
model by any means because there's a lot

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.450 
model by any means because there's a lot
of<00:04:24.229> bit<00:04:24.380> see<00:04:24.500> what<00:04:24.530> what<00:04:24.860> is<00:04:24.949> this<00:04:25.039> for

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
of bit see what what is this for

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.040 
of bit see what what is this for
look<00:04:25.849> at<00:04:25.940> this<00:04:26.000> it's<00:04:26.419> actually<00:04:26.510> not<00:04:26.750> part<00:04:26.990> of

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
look at this it's actually not part of

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.209 
look at this it's actually not part of
the<00:04:27.139> aircraft<00:04:27.440> at<00:04:27.560> all<00:04:27.650> I<00:04:27.710> think<00:04:27.950> it<00:04:28.010> must<00:04:28.099> be

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:28.219 
the aircraft at all I think it must be

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:30.129 
the aircraft at all I think it must be
some<00:04:28.400> kind<00:04:28.580> of<00:04:28.700> jig<00:04:29.419> for<00:04:29.599> joining<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:29.960> wings

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
some kind of jig for joining the wings

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.659 
some kind of jig for joining the wings
or<00:04:30.380> maybe<00:04:30.830> I<00:04:30.950> don't<00:04:31.159> know

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
or maybe I don't know

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.059 
or maybe I don't know
it's<00:04:32.090> a<00:04:32.389> laser<00:04:33.139> cut<00:04:33.379> plier<00:04:33.650> you<00:04:33.800> put<00:04:33.919> together

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.069 
it's a laser cut plier you put together

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.939 
it's a laser cut plier you put together
but<00:04:34.810> weird<00:04:35.810> if<00:04:35.930> there's<00:04:36.110> ago<00:04:36.319> it<00:04:36.499> does<00:04:36.620> it

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
but weird if there's ago it does it

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.610 
but weird if there's ago it does it
doesn't<00:04:37.099> go<00:04:37.310> on<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.550> model<00:04:37.960> there's<00:04:38.960> no<00:04:39.110> hint

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
doesn't go on the model there's no hint
