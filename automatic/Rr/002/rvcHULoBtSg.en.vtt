00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
most Game Boy Advance games that you

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.419 
most Game Boy Advance games that you
know<00:00:27.060> had<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.570> tilt<00:00:27.840> sensor<00:00:28.130> most<00:00:29.130> people

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
know had the tilt sensor most people

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.740 
know had the tilt sensor most people
thought<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.820> was<00:00:29.910> lame<00:00:30.179> but<00:00:31.969> actually<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.180> love

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
thought it was lame but actually I love

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.040 
thought it was lame but actually I love
twisted<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.829> think<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.940> compares<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> scale

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
twisted I think it compares on the scale

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.200 
twisted I think it compares on the scale
with<00:00:37.350> smooth<00:00:37.649> moves<00:00:37.950> if<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.790> don't<00:00:38.969> know<00:00:39.090> what

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
with smooth moves if you don't know what

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.840 
with smooth moves if you don't know what
smooth<00:00:39.570> loses<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.320> get<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.680> over<00:00:40.860> here<00:00:40.890> it's

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
smooth loses and get it over here it's

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.420 
smooth loses and get it over here it's
the<00:00:42.090> Wii<00:00:42.300> version

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
the Wii version

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.490 
the Wii version
here's<00:00:44.430> smooth<00:00:44.940> moves<00:00:45.270> right<00:00:45.899> there<00:00:46.170> and

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
here's smooth moves right there and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.810 
here's smooth moves right there and
there's<00:00:47.070> twisted<00:00:47.640> yeah<00:00:48.649> anyway<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.890> think<00:00:50.250> this

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
there's twisted yeah anyway I think this

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.380 
there's twisted yeah anyway I think this
has<00:00:51.480> more<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.739> fun<00:00:53.039> factor<00:00:53.550> than<00:00:54.149> its

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
has more of a fun factor than its

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.290 
has more of a fun factor than its
predecessor<00:00:55.199> than<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:56.070> its<00:00:56.340> successor

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
predecessor than you know its successor

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.090 
predecessor than you know its successor
well<00:00:57.809> actually<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.199> don't<00:00:58.440> even<00:00:58.590> call<00:00:58.920> it

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
well actually I don't even call it

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.010 
well actually I don't even call it
success<00:00:59.550> or<00:00:59.760> because<00:01:00.390> they<00:01:00.480> came<00:01:00.690> out<00:01:00.719> around

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
success or because they came out around

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.889 
success or because they came out around
the<00:01:01.440> exact<00:01:01.829> team<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.219> same<00:01:02.399> time<00:01:02.670> Wario<00:01:03.539> twist

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.700 
it
so<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.100> calibrates<00:02:21.790> exactly<00:02:22.480> with<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.230> sensor

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
so it calibrates exactly with the sensor

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.940 
so it calibrates exactly with the sensor
and<00:02:23.860> stuff<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.340> know<00:02:24.490> is<00:02:24.940> this<00:02:25.360> primitive

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
and stuff you know is this primitive

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.010 
and stuff you know is this primitive
technology<00:02:26.950> sensing<00:02:27.520> technology<00:02:28.480> compared

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
technology sensing technology compared

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.520 
technology sensing technology compared
to<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.230> we<00:02:29.880> man<00:02:30.880> or<00:02:31.300> you<00:02:31.540> where<00:02:31.660> twisted<00:02:32.110> press

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
to the we man or you where twisted press

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.000 
to the we man or you where twisted press
Start<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:34.000> it's<00:02:34.630> telling<00:02:34.990> you<00:02:35.230> now<00:02:35.950> this

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
Start and it it's telling you now this

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.190 
Start and it it's telling you now this
is<00:02:36.190> weird<00:02:36.880> I<00:02:37.180> don't<00:02:37.390> even<00:02:37.570> know<00:02:37.750> who<00:02:37.960> would<00:02:38.080> do

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
is weird I don't even know who would do

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.770 
is weird I don't even know who would do
this<00:02:38.350> but<00:02:38.700> usually<00:02:39.700> thing<00:02:40.120> right<00:02:40.360> away<00:02:40.570> that

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
this but usually thing right away that

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.410 
this but usually thing right away that
says<00:02:41.050> do<00:02:41.500> not<00:02:41.530> turn<00:02:42.160> your<00:02:42.370> whole<00:02:42.580> body<00:02:42.610> just

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
first step to in to making Wario Ware

first step to in to making Wario Ware
adapt<00:03:45.070> with<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.430> new<00:03:45.910> systems<00:03:49.140> see<00:03:50.140> in<00:03:50.410> that

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
adapt with the new systems see in that

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.270 
adapt with the new systems see in that
what<00:03:51.489> I<00:03:51.520> basically<00:03:51.940> did<00:03:52.239> is<00:03:52.270> um<00:03:53.040> Gaja

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
what I basically did is um Gaja

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.890 
what I basically did is um Gaja
see<00:03:55.820> a<00:03:55.850> clinical<00:03:56.600> system<00:03:58.600> turn<00:03:59.600> the<00:03:59.720> whole

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
see a clinical system turn the whole

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.470 
see a clinical system turn the whole
system<00:04:00.380> and<00:04:00.590> completes<00:04:01.100> the<00:04:01.160> minion<00:04:01.550> now<00:04:02.420> you

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
system and completes the minion now you

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.030 
system and completes the minion now you
wondering<00:04:03.170> why<00:04:03.260> you're<00:04:03.440> saying<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.770> scene

now<00:04:40.700> my<00:04:41.330> opinion<00:04:41.630> is<00:04:42.050> that<00:04:42.590> this<00:04:43.040> is<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.460> only

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
now my opinion is that this is the only

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
now my opinion is that this is the only
warrior<00:04:44.270> where<00:04:44.840> that<00:04:45.800> has<00:04:46.280> a<00:04:46.580> lot<00:04:47.150> of<00:04:47.180> content

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
warrior where that has a lot of content

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.110 
warrior where that has a lot of content
if<00:04:48.560> you've<00:04:48.800> seen<00:04:49.040> uh<00:04:49.160> the<00:04:49.520> other<00:04:49.610> warrior

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
if you've seen uh the other warrior

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.350 
if you've seen uh the other warrior
wears<00:04:50.419> you<00:04:51.110> know<00:04:51.320> that<00:04:51.700> smooth<00:04:52.700> moves<00:04:52.970> doesn't

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
wears you know that smooth moves doesn't

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.890 
wears you know that smooth moves doesn't
have<00:04:53.480> that<00:04:53.660> much<00:04:53.840> content<00:04:54.530> but<00:04:55.419> the<00:04:56.419> Gamecube

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
have that much content but the Gamecube

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.680
