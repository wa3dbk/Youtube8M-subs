00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
three the only thing I really want to

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.469 
three the only thing I really want to
stress<00:01:43.979> now<00:01:44.250> now<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.520> we're<00:01:44.850> at<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:45.299> point

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
stress now now that we're at the point

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.660 
stress now now that we're at the point
before<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.470> were<00:01:46.590> seeing<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.460> we<00:01:47.520> could

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
before we were seeing if we could

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.820 
before we were seeing if we could
possibly<00:01:47.850> get<00:01:48.119> second<00:01:48.630> but<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.049> think<00:01:49.380> NV<00:01:49.650> had<00:01:49.799> a

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
possibly get second but I think NV had a

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.340 
possibly get second but I think NV had a
30<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.460> other<00:01:50.610> day<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.299> we<00:01:51.509> can't<00:01:51.810> get<00:01:51.930> second

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
30 the other day so we can't get second

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.710 
30 the other day so we can't get second
um<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.799> think<00:01:52.830> third<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.610> still<00:01:53.820> an<00:01:53.909> option<00:01:54.119> we

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
um I think third is still an option we

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.450 
um I think third is still an option we
can<00:01:54.840> still<00:01:54.990> get<00:01:55.049> up<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.380> third<00:01:55.650> right<00:01:56.159> now<00:01:56.280> if

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
can still get up the third right now if

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.460 
can still get up the third right now if
we<00:01:56.520> do<00:01:56.880> good<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.270> our<00:01:57.329> matches<00:01:57.780> uh<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:58.350> could

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
we do good in our matches uh we could

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.380 
we do good in our matches uh we could
