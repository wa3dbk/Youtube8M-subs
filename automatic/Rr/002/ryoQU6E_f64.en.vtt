00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.140
 ah 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.160
 hello I hope very well and good today 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.049
 this video that is the second part of the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.640
 previous than the previous one was about 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.820
 decorations but banality about 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.310
 dyes and this one on decorations 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.450
 but natural decorations with things 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.130
 natural that we find in our 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.840
 cases and even with and with it has been done 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.060
 very long and cut it to make it two 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.770
 parts and that's why they see me with different 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.010
 clothes now and not now when you see well of 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.840
 back but good in basically that what 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.670
 that I would tell him and well I hope that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.300
 really like this video and fabric 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.300
 Of something 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:52.230
 as we know there are natural ways to 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.840
 decolorize the most known hair and more 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.730
 obvious is the sun the sun colored hair 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.890
 because you have seen people who in 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.810
 Summer puts on her pretty blond hair and 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.250
 we do not understand why that 's because the 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.080
 Sun 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.600
 also which participates as of 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.370
 dyes but suddenly obviously what 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.880
 now makes the colors much more natural 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.250
 and it's very natural not to have 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.050
 dyed the hair that the sun is a 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.760
 super slow decoration does not make a 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.130
 fast decoration so it does not sting the 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.020
 handle of the sun they go to bed and the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.880
 hair will be totally blond like that 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.780
 that I do not think about that other coloring 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.450
 natural known is lemon lemon 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.590
 faster is a little bit faster in 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.110
 what you have to do is put 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.020
 No hair all over the hair but 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.000
 also logic many do not think it is 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.259
 as it did not get damaged because it's natural 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.259
 in truth it also damages the hair 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:51.869
 and the sun this same technique serves to 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.420
 the arm and body hairs 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.130
 etc 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.689
 and just a girl asked for 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.780
 I answer this place in this way 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.580
 What does this method do for chamomile? 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.860
 motions to me did not give me results 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:08.270
 but good basically it 's in the 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.510
 chamomile boil it and have it all over 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.970
 hair under the sun can go a little 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.790
 faster those are the most 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.250
 known is more the sun but good 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.810
 with the sun effects something even better 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.730
 that is not bleaching but also 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.980
 clarifies the hair and sprays that are for 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.930
 clarify the hair they have to look for what 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.209
 sumo shoelaces but they should 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.739
 sirvent is not that they do not hurt 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.840
 to the hair but good if they give some 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.580
 reflections is not totally noise give 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.920
 Blonde highlights are very natural and 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.230
 they are very beautiful capello leave some 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.610
 marks so that they see because I the truth 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.959
 I do not remember brands at that time 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.510
 the corner of wonder by facebook 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.660
 on how to declare the hairs of the body 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.670
 the arms face and so on 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.850
 I the best known way that I know is 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.060
 in putting the oxygenated water and I can 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.010
 make the sun what it has that is that you 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.840
 can irritate a lot the skin in the voice and 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.210
 that nothing so the best would be the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.230
 first that prepare is your skin let's say 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.230
 first you have to wear 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.760
 moisturizer for a whole week we put 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.829
 an instant et cetera so that your 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.810
 skin begins to strengthen a little more 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.269
 caring for the skin and after 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.140
 do this because if you put on a 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.670
 very weak skin like that of the face 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.500
 I 'm sure you're going from the skin and not 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.670
 we want that also with function 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.489
 connections of any of going out 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.750
 manchitas and we do not want that so 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.239
 well this is the best way to spare 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.609
 I would say very first try 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.879
 with the sun make it quiet in your house 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.590
 and then on if other results go 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.010
 directly to the sun that can also be 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.010
 an arrow 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.330
 that did not mean 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.980
 one thing 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.030
 well I came to enter the face that 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.030
 I have something that is not available in the country 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.370
 is already good fabric 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.850
 and they always saw photos that published 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.830
 in its walls and that said goodbye that is not 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.340
 get my damn country turned 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.160
 Wednesday chocolate and good in my 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.790
 brother-in-law had accompanied me I brought him to 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.609
 you and they brought you nothing 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.850
 Realism too I say for this 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.850
 world 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.520
 the rhythm I do not know what element but it's a 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.389
 genius 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.389
 Manchester 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.790
 the evils and the evil 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.850
 normal 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.320
 because he said that the good evil 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:53.440
 I'm saying goodbye 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.440

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.840

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.840
 the hills I saw something else 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:06.960

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.700
 little finger up so I feel 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.380
 motivated keeps uploading videos because 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.669

 a vÃ­ctor that I have more follows me 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.540

 uploading videos and doing many more and I 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.080
 excited too much then they follow 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.610
 doing it but keep that wave 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.110
 d 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.110
 constant motivation 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.960

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.970
 for our barrientos chance to 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.699
 tell them if they like this hairstyle 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.229
 that has a very fine wave 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.690
 If they liked it, it was possible to ask 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.340
 a tutorial if you want to be taught 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.349

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.659
 it 's very fast that I do not believe it and 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:57.830
