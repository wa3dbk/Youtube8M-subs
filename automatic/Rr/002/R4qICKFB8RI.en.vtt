00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.560 
the scribble was right up the center and
I<00:00:37.140> decided<00:00:37.589> to<00:00:37.830> do<00:00:37.949> my<00:00:38.129> colors<00:00:38.570> horizontally

have any little gaps or that you think

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.270 
have any little gaps or that you think
could<00:03:42.390> use<00:03:42.570> a<00:03:42.600> little<00:03:42.960> more<00:03:43.110> of<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.290> teal<00:03:43.620> or

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
could use a little more of the teal or

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.210 
could use a little more of the teal or
even<00:03:45.240> anywhere<00:03:46.020> maybe<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:46.530> add<00:03:46.710> a<00:03:46.740> little<00:03:47.070> too

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
even anywhere maybe you add a little too

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.040 
even anywhere maybe you add a little too
much<00:03:47.400> teal<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.270> think<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.600> need<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.780> go

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
much teal and you think you need to go

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.420 
much teal and you think you need to go
back<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.410> add<00:03:49.500> somewhere<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.920> base<00:03:50.100> color

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
back and add somewhere the base color

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.090 
back and add somewhere the base color
you<00:03:50.670> can<00:03:50.850> certainly<00:03:51.060> do<00:03:51.360> that<00:03:51.800> but<00:03:52.800> you<00:03:52.980> know
