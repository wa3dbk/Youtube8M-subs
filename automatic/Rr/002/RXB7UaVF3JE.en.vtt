00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
say if I had an AT&amp;T phone I unlocked it

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.849 
say if I had an AT&amp;T phone I unlocked it
so<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> could<00:00:57.000> use<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> tmobile<00:00:57.570> sim<00:00:57.930> card<00:00:58.410> or

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
so I could use a tmobile sim card or

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.119 
so I could use a tmobile sim card or
simple<00:00:59.309> mobile<00:00:59.340> sim<00:01:00.120> card<00:01:00.660> or<00:01:00.840> if<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.140> go<00:01:01.289> take

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
simple mobile sim card or if you go take

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.310 
simple mobile sim card or if you go take
a<00:01:02.160> risin<00:01:02.730> phone<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.359> then<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.600> flash<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.899> to

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
a risin phone and then you flash it to

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.490 
a risin phone and then you flash it to
you<00:01:04.589> know<00:01:04.680> metropcs<00:01:05.610> same<00:01:06.150> thing<00:01:06.500> completely

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
