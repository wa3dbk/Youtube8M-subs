00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
easier and more convenient to use us so

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.240 
easier and more convenient to use us so
that's<00:01:29.400> basically<00:01:29.549> our<00:01:30.000> key<00:01:30.600> concept<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.710> like

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
that's basically our key concept so like

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.440 
that's basically our key concept so like
this<00:01:32.970> one

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
this one

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.050 
this one
easier<00:01:35.450> right<00:01:35.810> anyway<00:01:36.290> to<00:01:36.920> change<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.790> also

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
easier right anyway to change and also

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.120 
easier right anyway to change and also
more<00:01:38.210> safe<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:39.380> then<00:01:40.100> our<00:01:40.549> R&amp;D<00:01:41.030> is<00:01:41.479> this<00:01:41.810> caddy

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
more safe so then our R&amp;D is this caddy

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.210 
more safe so then our R&amp;D is this caddy
say<00:01:43.130> for<00:01:43.460> more<00:01:43.909> for<00:01:44.150> DSA<00:01:46.119> hiya<00:01:47.119> mature<00:01:48.220> then

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
say for more for DSA hiya mature then

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.810 
say for more for DSA hiya mature then
more<00:01:49.820> bigger<00:01:50.390> picture<00:01:50.840> then<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.920> take<00:01:52.130> good

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
more bigger picture then to take good

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.359 
more bigger picture then to take good
picture<00:01:53.180> easier<00:01:53.659> that's<00:01:54.649> our<00:01:54.770> key<00:01:54.950> concept

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
picture easier that's our key concept

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.630
