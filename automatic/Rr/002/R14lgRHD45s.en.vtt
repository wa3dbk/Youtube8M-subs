because<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:33.750> Dvorak<00:01:34.110> keyboard<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.740> now<00:01:34.890> easy

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
because the Dvorak keyboard is now easy

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.660 
because the Dvorak keyboard is now easy
to<00:01:35.700> get<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:36.960> where<00:01:37.439> people<00:01:37.950> are<00:01:38.280> in

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
to get to this is where people are in

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.140 
to get to this is where people are in
adopting<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.810> Dvorak<00:01:40.400> it's<00:01:41.400> easy<00:01:41.820> because

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
adopting the Dvorak it's easy because

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.210 
adopting the Dvorak it's easy because
it's<00:01:42.329> right<00:01:42.720> available<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.470> any<00:01:43.680> computer

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
it's right available on any computer

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.660 
it's right available on any computer
that<00:01:44.250> uses<00:01:44.700> Windows<00:01:45.119> available<00:01:46.110> also<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
Macintosh and on the UNIX you can just

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.469 
Macintosh and on the UNIX you can just
do<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.540> with<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.810> click<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.320> button<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:54.270> late

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
do it with a click of a button the late

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.280 
do it with a click of a button the late
majority<00:01:54.689> are<00:01:55.290> those<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:56.719> see<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.899> value

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
majority are those that see the value

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.399 
majority are those that see the value
are<00:01:58.710> able<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.340> accomplish<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.600> or<00:02:00.840> have<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> need

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
are able to accomplish it or have a need

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.609 
are able to accomplish it or have a need
and<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.280> easy<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.390> difference<00:02:04.290> there

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
and it is easy but the difference there

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.280 
and it is easy but the difference there
for<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.159> late<00:02:05.340> majority<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:06.570> combined

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
for the late majority to can be combined

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.960 
for the late majority to can be combined
would<00:02:07.590> be<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.860> fact<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.250> they<00:02:08.489> see<00:02:08.789> that

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
would be the fact that they see that

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.960 
would be the fact that they see that
others<00:02:09.270> are<00:02:09.539> successful<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.709> doing<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.790> before

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
others are successful in doing it before

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.059 
others are successful in doing it before
them

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
them

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.670 
them
the<00:02:13.640> last<00:02:13.849> group<00:02:14.180> would<00:02:14.390> be<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.540> laggers<00:02:15.110> and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
the last group would be the laggers and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.259 
the last group would be the laggers and
those<00:02:15.980> are<00:02:16.159> people<00:02:16.459> who<00:02:16.489> would<00:02:16.670> never<00:02:16.939> change

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
those are people who would never change

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.140 
those are people who would never change
because<00:02:18.200> they<00:02:18.349> don't<00:02:18.530> see<00:02:18.799> the<00:02:18.829> value<00:02:19.010> or<00:02:19.610> the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
because they don't see the value or the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.569 
because they don't see the value or the
need<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.599> change<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.950> with<00:02:22.129> the<00:02:22.250> Dvorak

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
need to change so with the Dvorak

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.479 
need to change so with the Dvorak
keyboard<00:02:22.879> the<00:02:23.659> ligers<00:02:24.140> are<00:02:24.439> not<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.680> concern<00:02:25.159> if

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
keyboard the ligers are not a concern if

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.399 
keyboard the ligers are not a concern if
somebody<00:02:25.819> doesn't<00:02:26.090> change<00:02:26.480> over<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:27.140> doesn't

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
somebody doesn't change over it doesn't

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.289 
somebody doesn't change over it doesn't
matter<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> computer<00:02:28.519> if<00:02:28.760> you're<00:02:28.970> typing

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
in the Dvorak or QWERTY it's changed in

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.520 
in the Dvorak or QWERTY it's changed in
the<00:02:31.790> language<00:02:32.209> part<00:02:32.510> on<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.930> control<00:02:33.290> panel
