00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:13.480
 we can approve the new champion of 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.600
 I try to get a ph of 460 horses 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.150
 with complying with the regulations of stock exchange and 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.590
 an expected truck and we could 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.590
 define as completely 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.700
 ah 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.730
 good the features that more 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.949
 they highlighted this truck that they are going to do 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.839
 that we look at him are the new 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:49.809
 for the seven degrees and with a light 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:49.809
 very characteristic daytime 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.870
 and if it is the new system that uses 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.170
 this vehicle as speed control 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.750
 with added knowledge in this case 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.460
 they will not use gps information but 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.890
 who are going to use information that are going 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.850
 recording the vehicles is going through 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.250
 the roads 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.439
 and creating a database from which 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.060
 can get information each of 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.060
 those who have set up this system 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.970
 and 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.530
 this I return the th has changed 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.730
 practically in an integral 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.250
 cabin 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.590
 the steering wheel is new with said sides 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.410
 also located for automations 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.700
 on the steering wheel radio 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.280
 odometer and lap counter 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.520
 it's also different now it gives you the 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.410
 just information without saturating you for 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.390
 that during the driving you have the mere 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.340
 possible entertainment but yes that 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.400
 we can know the speed that we are 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.420
 If you are working circling yes or no 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.420
 is working that is 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.210
 the market of our route from madrid to 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.600
 guadarrama we have done it in a while 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.750
 pretty tight the vehicle has 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.750
 responded very well on the rise 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.000
 and has shown power and power with 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.360
 his 460 horses have been enough 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.940
 to solve this first part the 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.620
 second part of this journey love 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.710
 this new volvo has done it too 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.270
 without any problem without having a delay 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.480
 only uses the engine brake 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.209
 I return it responds very well and makes it 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.010
 drive the 460 safely 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.870
 horses of this truck have been 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.870
 enough to perform the test 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.540
 quite adequate and then pretty 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.540
 happy
