 and civil protection family plan which 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.120
 is the goal of the family plan of 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.920
 civil protection 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.539
 the goal of a family plan is 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.279
 know the basic actions that each 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.350
 one of us must perform for 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.880
 safeguard our life and power 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.370
 help us in case of emergency or 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.440
 disaster 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.240
 the plan is preventive and requires that 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.340
 we talked in a coordinated way and with 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.440
 sense of a family for it is 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.060
 important that all of us know 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.760
 the measures and activities that 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.620
 we will perform in case of emergency 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.300
 recommends the participation of children 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.100
 so that they too 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.410
 know what to do and can collaborate 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.850
 with older people even when their 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.220
 parents can not work in the 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.809
 moment of the disaster the elaboration of 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.670
 a plan is very simple and useful always and 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.320
 when it is in advance it includes 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.620
 five steps that we will show little to 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.680
 little in case of emergency we have a 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.300
 plan in this waterproof suitcase I have 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.489
 a few copies of the birth certificates 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.340
 from each one of us the security of 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.120
 the house the car papers a 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.330
 lamp a radio with batteries a small 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.080
 first aid kit a bottle of water 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.210
 and some food data we can not 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.250
 recharge many the suitcase simply 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.840
 be sure, we find you with 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.850
 everything necessary during the first 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.210
 hours in case of an emergency or 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.210
 skillet 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.160
 detects and reduces risks the first step 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.800
 of our plan is to review the listing 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.720
 that keeps the construction of the house on 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.880
 good condition of the facilities 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.980
 electricity, water and gas if they have 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.660
 fallen or stumbled upon some object of 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.580
 repeated way for example the 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.070
 patio stairs to put you 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.590
 protectors or rails you have to know 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.600
 where are the potential risks 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.270
 we should reduce those looking for the house 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.470
 offer the maximum security elaborates a 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.180
 simple sketch of your house and 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.620
 surroundings in it write down the 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.780
 observations are the possible risks 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.000
 as well as the recommendations for 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.650
 reduce them in the I think that is indicated with 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.479
 red color all damages and breakdowns you 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.399
 find out what brand other 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.320
 elements of danger that can damage you 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.510
 how can they be sewers or 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.670
 records without cover breaks or unevenness 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.770
 on the floor stairs cables of the 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.470
 Loose higher or more flower boxes 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.720
 loose you have to hold the objects that 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.090
 They may fall if an earthquake is , 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.770
 nor do we project during a hurricane in addition 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.060
 you have to store and label 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.010
 adequately the substance 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.560
 ships that may cause a fire or 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.770
 intoxications like spirit white spirit 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.080
 thinner and this such love 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.569
 we have to try is a high place 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.310
 risk has to give a perfect order 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.260
 if you're right I have a mess in that 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.810
 fourth but this saturday you look like 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.640
 that is fine but remains as commitment 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.200
 we also have to locate that there are 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.209
 the surroundings that can cause 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.360
 risks such as tortillerías the 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.680
 gas stations restaurants galleries 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.450
 food stalls light cables more 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.819
 near the house and transformers 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.470
 this will allow decisions to go out 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.360
 of the house or protect us here 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.840
 depending on the type of emergency 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.840
 concerned 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.840
 the second point of the plan is to design 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.090
 our evacuation routes and departures 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.980
 safer to get away from the risk 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.840
 one of the decisions that many times 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.940
 it has to be taken in a situation of 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.950
 emergency is to stay inside or 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.350
 leave the house there is no answer 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.090
 common for all situations a 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.920
 place is safer in the degree to which 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.980
 allows greater possibilities of 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.720
 survive keeps calm is the 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.450
 crucial element to survive a 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.580
 emergency situation so you should 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.300
 know how to behave and what actions 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.300
 run 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.780
 in a practice that we were invited to 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:51.430
 pemex industrial safety friends 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.629
 they told me that civil protection is 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.120
 like when we start studying 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.400
 mathematics what is not practiced is not 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.219
 learn so one of the principles 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.200
 fundamental is to periodically perform 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:05.340
 exercises or drills at home for 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.340
 always be prepared 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.409
 but Andrea, you know what a 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.780
 a clear simulacrum a simulacrum is a 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.669
 essay or practice about how it should be 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.310
 adopt in case of an emergency 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.190
 cyclone flood tropical fire 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.919
 earthquake etcetera realize it brings many 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.510
 Advantages check in advance if 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.970
 the preparation actions are 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.830
 allows efficient and suitable 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.240
 correct them or improve them to be 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.389
 trained to act correctly 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.280
 in the face of disasters fosters the culture of 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.689
 civil protection between the family and 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.830
 community 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:44.029
 to see and what happens to be that follow 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.149
 imagine some of the situations 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:50.269
 emergency here at home or in another 

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:51.739
 place assigns responsibilities according to 

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:53.599
 this idea of ​​the family plan of 

00:04:51.739 --> 00:04:56.209
 civil protection to each member of the 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:05:00.639
 family and sounds the alarm with a 

00:04:56.209 --> 00:05:00.639
 bell whistles timber mermaid or lights 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.990
 Stop doing what you are doing 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.910
 immediately and lower the switch 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.110
 general of the electric current of the 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.970
 house and leave the kitchen in an orderly manner 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.700
 travel the holiday routes and 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.330
 drive with order do not shout do not run 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.330
 but thrusts 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.170
 medium type you need to get to 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.060
 the safe sites outside the house 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.530
 starting from different places chooses 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.980
 the route that takes the shortest time to 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.710
 travel 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.960
 Do not forget to evacuate the children already 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.060
 people with different abilities 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.160
 the time involved may be greater 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.650
 therefore consider the possible help 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.600
 what these people will need some 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.690
 general measures for any kind of 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.310
 emergency are one must be put of 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.930
 agreement to have a meeting place 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.550
 in case the loss occurs when not 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.380
 let's be together can be in case of 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.810

 at home one of my friends not at home 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.980
 my aunt tere it is necessary to specify in 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.600
 where we will see each other and the route that will follow 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:06.110
 each one of us to get there 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.820
 that gives us greater tranquility 2 next to 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.160
 the exit door being applied from

 warning sign 3 the waterproof suitcase 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.640
 that prepares mom 4 to keep them 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.830
 informed and timely decide if 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.270
 we will stay at home or go to a 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.620
 shelter that we have previously 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.470
 identified 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.960
 5 go ahead to the shelter 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:33.560
 temporary and verify your location with your

 civil protection unit 6 features 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.320
 a directory with the phones and

 children work centers of the 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:52.449
 family social sports centers and 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:54.260
 cultural where they commonly go 7 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:56.570
 consider that you will not be able to communicate 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.220
 immediately with your family and friends 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.830
 due to the saturation of lines 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.570
 phone calls so do not despair what 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.310
 ideal is that all the actions that 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.889
 we have planned to be registered in a 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:10.030
 document that will be our family plan 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:10.030
 of civil protection 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:17.120
 it must be an acknowledgment to each of 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.860
 we thought that this would be the most 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.320
 difficult to meet and we all show 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.540
 the provision for self-protection is 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.560
 the fourth step and we have done very well 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.560
 congratulations family 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.669
 ah 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.500
 since you are prepared together with your 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:34.880
 family initiates the plan by organizing the 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.530
 neighbors organize the brigadistas 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.840
 civil protection organizations in your 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.610
 block neighborhood or building to maintain 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.380
 a permanent communication and help 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.849
 mutual integration to the national network of 

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.039
 community brigadistas to be able 

00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:49.210
 receive training and collaborate with 

00:07:46.039 --> 00:07:49.210
 civil protection actions
