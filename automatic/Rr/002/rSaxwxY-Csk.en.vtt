00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:05.540
 Like I'm here today to talk a little about you about philosophy. 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.050
 mainly as it was requested in the vestibular of the great vestibular of the 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:09.989
 Brazil 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:15.400
 and I want to give some indications of what I really think is going to fall 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:19.310
 the name of two philosophers or of 

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:22.779
 history of philosophy and also some basic concepts 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.960
 is that I'm sure they appeared in the tests for you then 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.880
 my concepts also know that the concepts of philosophy they have 

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:35.219
 I can not treat a philosophical concept as a 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.590
 concept any it has a strict precision 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.450
 and it is necessary that you are nice to us and of courage 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.510
 the accuracy and validity of each of these concepts within the 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.930
 philosophy of each of the pilots 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.930
 for example the word accident 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.980
 the word accident is a very precise philosophical concept 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.210
 introduced call for the whole history of philosophy by a philosopher called Rest 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.799
 cost of the world to know 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.829
 a contemporary Plato philosopher was a disciple of Plato in fact he 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:18.110
 then they broke up 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.110
 creating certain assumptions in which their philosophical systems 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.290
 but I always depended on the other dialogue between the two is very fruitful too 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.220
 important 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.189
 moreover speaking in dialogue within the ever important philosophy 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.409
 vestibular issues usually call for a comparison between two 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.640
 concepts I can if such concept of accident means that there were no people 

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.809
 that is, circumstantial means connected to the material plane 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.570
 yes metaphysical or face-to-face 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.850
 In fact, as opposed to an accident, I'll give you the word 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.740
 I know 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.550
 segall 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.040
 Look, I quoted two philosophers. 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.020
 Plato and Aristotle and two accident concepts 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.020
 essence the essential accidental 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.280
 please third party in the evidence that these concepts do not appear isolated 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.540
 they always appear 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.310
 undoubtedly these pairs usually imply oppositions not 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.870
 necessarily but they can imply in oppositions and so the thought 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.000
 of people within philosophy works cup and pipo comparison between a 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.160
 philosophical doctrine of the 16th century in full 19 these jumps actually within 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.749
 of the history of philosophy are always very important 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:36.050
 I'm going to put some names for you now 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.040
 the wages and the merger wires great names of the flow be sure you 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.189
 found in the 'vestibular' is right 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.589
 In Brazil, I want to start with you with the prices, 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:49.589
 always create these doubles, it's alright so let's go 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.659
 heracle 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.239
 paulinho says 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:09.819
 besides the heraclitus and I congratulate I can quote for you 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.109
 plato 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:18.749
 and paris touches 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:27.889
 because it is another pair of pilots that this statement and who opposes certain 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.769
 that's right 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.769
 since 2000 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.209
 emanuel 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.209
 the client 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.000
 I'm sure that of those 6 names that I will here for you. 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.229
 at least half of them you only find in the vestibular 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.699
 Once again I'm going to tell you the questions of the vestibular 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:57.659
 and philosophy always took the comparison always a very categorical word but 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.189
 usually they ask for the comparison between two names or between concepts 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.059
 of the same philosopher are attentive to this comparison game then okay 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.040
 another place another street another good tip that I can give you 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.119
 is that many want lots of college entrance exams 

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:16.609
 some texts 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.950
 not part 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.970
 the history of philosophy recently he struggled 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:26.459
 correcting a test of the vestibular the federal of uberlÃ¢ndia 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.050
 from there silver make a question about two concepts 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.440
 that the universals and nominal ones were a concept that part of the rest crowded and 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.569
 everything else 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:41.150
 is they asked for an excerpt from the book with the name of the rose of the season 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.200
 It was an excerpt from the basic guilherme ranges from making a blessing 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.860
 and this deduction part of these two concepts of the universal 'of the name in the al 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.860
 there they ask to prolong 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.160
 an issue that was not so difficult to get to see with careful reading of the 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.770
 texts 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.030
 not always the texts is enough, it's necessary that you then come back 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.370
 concepts to the main concepts of pilots and 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.020
 part of them I'm sure you will do a good test 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.219
 that's right 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.889
 thank you very much
