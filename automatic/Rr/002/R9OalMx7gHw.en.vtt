we get into all that let's talk about
the<00:00:24.359> design<00:00:24.779> here<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.769> unit<00:00:26.310> now<00:00:26.580> it's

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
the design here of the unit now it's

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.150 
the design here of the unit now it's
boxy<00:00:27.390> u<00:00:27.510> rectangular<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.470> doesn't<00:00:28.980> really

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
boxy u rectangular and doesn't really

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.980 
boxy u rectangular and doesn't really
change<00:00:29.490> up<00:00:29.699> all<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.119> much<00:00:30.359> it's<00:00:30.630> made<00:00:30.840> of

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
change up all that much it's made of

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.530 
change up all that much it's made of
plastic<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:32.040> matte<00:00:32.279> finish<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> little

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
plastic a matte finish and it's a little

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.330 
plastic a matte finish and it's a little
bit<00:00:33.630> hollow<00:00:33.930> no<00:00:34.230> fairness<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.890> design<00:00:35.160> is

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
bit hollow no fairness the design is

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.340 
bit hollow no fairness the design is
rather<00:00:35.520> boring<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.210> uninspiring<00:00:36.899> but<00:00:37.230> then

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
rather boring and uninspiring but then

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.530 
rather boring and uninspiring but then
again<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:38.040> not<00:00:38.190> really<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> focal<00:00:39.000> aspect

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
again it's not really the focal aspect

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.690 
again it's not really the focal aspect
of<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> unit<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.710> white<00:00:40.890> bezel<00:00:41.219> trim<00:00:41.520> around

year's model also packs so long and

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.700 
year's model also packs so long and
Ethernet<00:01:11.790> ports<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.750> turns<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.350> unit

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
Ethernet ports so it turns this unit

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.160 
Ethernet ports so it turns this unit
into<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> portable<00:01:14.790> router<00:01:15.119> as<00:01:15.420> well<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.990> order

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
into a portable router as well in order

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.170 
into a portable router as well in order
to<00:01:16.320> establish<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.979> connection<00:01:17.180> initially

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
to establish the connection initially

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.749 
to establish the connection initially
you<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.930> use<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> direct<00:01:19.890> Wi-Fi

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
you have to use a direct Wi-Fi

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.850 
you have to use a direct Wi-Fi
connection<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.020> unit<00:01:22.380> itself<00:01:22.619> is

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
connection so the unit itself is

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.039 
connection so the unit itself is
emitting<00:01:23.520> its<00:01:23.670> own<00:01:23.850> hotspot<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.869> just

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
emitting its own hotspot you just

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.320 
emitting its own hotspot you just
connect<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.590> directly<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.909> also<00:01:27.090> have

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
connect to it directly and you also have

what we have here is a movie stored on
an<00:02:46.500> SD<00:02:46.650> card<00:02:47.099> and<00:02:47.340> right<00:02:47.819> now<00:02:48.000> we<00:02:48.060> are

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
an SD card and right now we are

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.809 
an SD card and right now we are
streaming<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.140> with<00:02:49.440> very<00:02:49.769> minimal<00:02:49.950> lag<00:02:50.459> or

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
streaming it with very minimal lag or

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.940 
streaming it with very minimal lag or
stutter<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.629> also<00:02:51.750> works<00:02:52.019> well<00:02:52.290> when<00:02:52.769> it<00:02:52.829> comes

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
stutter it also works well when it comes

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.710 
stutter it also works well when it comes
to<00:02:53.069> streaming<00:02:53.370> music<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:54.329> rather<00:02:54.540> than

to streaming music so rather than

to streaming music so rather than
storing<00:02:55.019> all<00:02:55.319> that<00:02:55.349> on<00:02:56.040> your<00:02:56.340> phone<00:02:56.609> you<00:02:57.000> can

storing all that on your phone you can
put<00:02:57.359> them<00:02:57.569> on<00:02:57.750> an<00:02:57.959> SD<00:02:58.170> card<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.829> then<00:02:58.920> from

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
put them on an SD card and then from

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.250 
put them on an SD card and then from
there<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.819> could<00:02:59.970> stream<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.629> directly<00:03:00.780> from

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
there you could stream it directly from

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.069 
there you could stream it directly from
the<00:03:01.680> MobileLite<00:03:02.010> Wireless<00:03:02.129> g2<00:03:02.720> in<00:03:03.720> addition

to streaming content from the MobileLite
Wireless<00:03:06.209> g2<00:03:06.780> we<00:03:07.680> could<00:03:07.859> actually<00:03:08.069> copy<00:03:08.819> this

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269
