 Hello, everyone's name is Maxim.

 insert new walked exit tattooist 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.290
 We meet with Artem and go do him 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.290
 tattooed 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.210
 cima because this man is wise 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:29.840
 honestly i met two masters up 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.079
 but it will remove and perhaps not find 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.159
 common language as a person gives his 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:41.059
 the skin itself one way or another we are already working 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:42.489
 Here I am personally pleased with his works otherwise 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:50.390
 would not be here now 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:55.190
 1 from maxim was the word for some reason 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:59.809
 immediately called me a Mason after seeing the sketch I 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.239
 I can only explain why osago because 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.560
 that somehow it reflects me and 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:11.630
 which should reflect part 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:16.030
 man that is hidden the day further all 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.030
 what will happen next most likely it is not 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.610
 will be the final stage of the tattoo before 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.800

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.800
 sentries do not think we will finish 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.270
 Artem considers. 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:24.750
 how much of the point that says it is not 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:27.590
 hurts that harm well, you just cheat 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.500
 feel every point anyway 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.920
 feel the feel you feel every 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.060
 stage 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.840
 and this tattoo is really 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.840
 becomes part of you 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.110
