00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
curb and look at all four wheels

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.009 
curb and look at all four wheels
together<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.640> can<00:02:32.849> see<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.120> very<00:02:33.450> very<00:02:33.690> large

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
together you can see the very very large

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.220 
together you can see the very very large
dish<00:02:35.010> they<00:02:35.459> have<00:02:35.670> again<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.750> can<00:02:36.900> see<00:02:37.050> the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
dish they have again you can see the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.680 
dish they have again you can see the
edge<00:02:37.620> there<00:02:38.160> Philly<00:02:38.519> gnarly<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.450> wheel

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
edge there Philly gnarly of that wheel

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.170 
edge there Philly gnarly of that wheel
so<00:02:40.410> putting<00:02:40.650> their<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.340> severely<00:02:41.760> gnarly

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
so putting their so severely gnarly

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.600 
so putting their so severely gnarly
marks<00:02:42.480> around<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.930> edge<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.590> rims<00:02:43.830> but

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610

structurally again another look there

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.250 
structurally again another look there
you<00:02:51.000> can<00:02:51.209> see<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.480> little<00:02:51.720> bit<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.080> lip

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
you can see that little bit of the lip

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.070 
you can see that little bit of the lip
folded<00:02:53.160> in<00:02:53.280> there<00:02:53.459> very<00:02:53.489> very<00:02:54.030> minor<00:02:54.360> nothing
