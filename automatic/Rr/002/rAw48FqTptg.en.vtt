 good before having to make hear 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.900
 is going to be do square moron squares 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.259
 per hundred on an image 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:13.239
 for this we have any one like this can be any kind of image 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.519
 moya choose 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.519
 the front rectangle selection 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.730
 I'm going to do 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.650
 a square then for the seat ibiza this tool 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.999
 but if you want 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.569
 you can use the lithic matchmaker tool 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:31.940
 If you want to do another way 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.910
 then the aem 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.680
 istanbul 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.310
 I'm going to choose to blur the edges 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.310
 and I'm going to raise a pit the rally so yes no 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.070
 Inia put this rounded corners like I do not know 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.070
 I'm going to leave it that way for the moment 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.910
 I'm going to make the selection on the site 10 want 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.160
 if they 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.920
 what 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.089
 The distinction 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.230
 in the place where it does not hide 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.230
 well always the moon also 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.610
 another point room rounded corners if you do not like 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.190
 if you do not want detonating 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.230
 then do not check the option of rounded corners 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.590
 or to blur lombardi 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.590
 well if the round corner does not cost either you want 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.600
 trial date 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.930
 to go 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.010
 moving the rally 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.010
 good to do 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.280
 and I'm going to create a hand in the field 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.390
 valence layer 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.260
 to house the paint bucket 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.590
 and with the color that I want 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.590
 one that highlights triplet 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.870
 I'm going to paint 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.850
 the selection and how I will be separated from the image 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.869
 and perfectly páramo remove the eye of you from the previous image 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.470
 if it is seems very argued 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.749
 the picture as it is 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:10.819
 well, always country 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.519
 asier 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.689
 which work of your opponent efe 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.689
 for example I wrote to put a border 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.409
 who wants it to be black 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:22.800
 and it looks bad 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.440
 with the right mouse button 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.249
 get to avoid 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:27.779
 and back transcendence 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:29.299
 and related topics 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.899
 other areas as starting the resale of paint as the brush does 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.329
 that previously we had to go to pinter and choose the brush that 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.169
 we want to use and size 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.229
 or drawn line 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:43.829
 already in which usually appears 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.479
 i chose the color 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.479
 that this is more than it seems you wanted 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.329
 the boat was the liguilla 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.949
 when we have nothing else 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:59.229
 she accepted 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:01.719
 to give it another look for example 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.719
 we can go to filters 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.589
 and we can go looking 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:12.149
 and testing with the 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.119
 cala filters that there 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:17.309
 dv always actress the sprinter a 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.389
 she throws 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:26.999
 this is not going to move me I will try to see how 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:29.699
 as stalin 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.749
 and be affected 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:35.129
 you see that without doing and how 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.540
 to give you better see press and nothing iquique la cidh 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:42.789
 and it's like the picture we already highlighted 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:48.119
 this circulated from ciu the picture was to use for anything 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.949
 write in tibás 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.309
 and it is already 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:57.559
 basically there is the tutorial that I have been asked 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:01.469
 If I had any doubts then I would not use to spread the perez I'm 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:03.999
 and nothing until next day 13 vial
