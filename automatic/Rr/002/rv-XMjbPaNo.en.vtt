 rey william johnson announced closing 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.670
 equal to three now for sure 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.740
 over the next couple months not 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.269
 will be able to find a replacement for ray one of 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.920
 biggest videobloger whose 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.660
 many drew their inspiration 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.910
 and also hit the Guinness Book of Records 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.859
 he decided to leave bye and entered still at the peak and 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.300
 has good numbers and said he has 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.880
 meaning pay attention to your other 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.320
 projects and aspects of career Well good luck 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.090
 hi my name is elena rasokhina and i 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.650
 I want to share with you my thoughts on 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.630
 about some strange and not so 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.590
 The latest motorcyclist day events with 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.390
 severe trauma to the facial bones 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.880
 restored face with 3d printer 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.770
 and this is one of the first operations of such 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.899
 kind of a definite plus is that the details 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.030
 very accurate and there used to be inconsistencies 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.309
 man broke nose upper jaw 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.870
 both cheekbones and skull nehily like this 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.700
 Asphalt inhibited doctors used 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.379
 computed tomography of the victim and 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.629
 by not printed symmetrical models of it 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.890
 the skull is then based on the models cut out 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.660
 only those pieces that were 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.360
 needed to recover as 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.250
 templates and made them from chat to broke 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.829
 he was re- chipped and secured innovations 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.660
 so the dude would see neat okay well 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.549
 for lovers of igral new bonus on 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.320
 next week sony will introduce the helmet 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.729
 virtual reality project morpheus 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.830
 for reference year before the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.119
 presented an oculus rift helmet which 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.979
 brought a lot of hype around 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.869
 namely, to this world have not yet seen 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.570
 so realistic wanting a 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.400
 kickstarter in 2012 on about funds 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.220
 the required amount of 250 thousand dollars 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.220
 collected in four hours and 36 hours 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.900
 million in all time two and a half here 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.000
 so they craved their designer Palmer Lucky 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.740
 said that since childhood I wanted to get into 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.180
 he was always interested in technology 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.130
 and he dreamed of a virtual helmet 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.170
 reality but when tried it 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.460
 disappointed the viewing angle was only 40 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.140
 degrees that is not adequately 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.360
 conveyed the atmosphere plus they were 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.280
 dofiga bulky so Palmer to 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.579
 invented new glasses dubbed them the oculus 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.799
 rift 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.119
 whose viewing angle is 110 degrees and this 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.750
 means complete immersion in the atmosphere 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.270
 games 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.619
 who would risk playing with a layer of punch on 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.659
 first of all you should stock diapers 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.729
 my friend how can I test the oculus 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.259
 rift and it was something with something for 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.299
 dough used hank my card and 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.850
 it was quite uncomfortable when out of the corner 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.040
 heard 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.470
 what could invent a new corner 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.780
 The review will become 110 from 180 degrees and 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.520
 our eyes will become what kind of fly on or they 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.250
 will become more comfortable and will look 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.840
 just like robocop and one more step in 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.280
 side and i'm an iron man 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.540
 and tell more about the presentation 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.400
 the thing itself but if you count 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.990
 secretly you need to have such a device 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.190
 appropriate quality because a 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.780
 more likely to cause nausea and 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.550
 dizziness especially if the cop is not 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.290
 pulls and the effect can persist on 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.090
 over the course of several tens of minutes everything 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.580
 a couple more of these technologies and we 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.160
 let's forget the real communication because I drive so 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.140
 wing and maybe this particular device 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.640
 will pull out a victory for playstation in the eternal 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.160
 Inca war sex boxing 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.470
 but in the end it won't hurt a bit 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.420
 inadequate greenpeace activists snuck 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.100
 in French and from phishing and 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.709
 not the first time and hung out on the reactor 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.360
 a poster may put Europe at risk 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.830
 and draw the attention of the whole world to 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.900
 hazards from obsolete 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.390
 power plant equipment 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.830
 power plant put into operation in 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.570
 1977 President of France Francois 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.600
 Holland during the election campaign 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.400
 promised sunset phishing and 2016 two 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.870
 years could not wait on the territory 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.880
 former USSR still where many 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.739
 use sample aggregates still second 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.660
 the world what if works properly 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.250
 although in Russia it can be applied to a 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.820
 Well, probably not yet in Russia 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.470
 these greenpeaces are spread though no to me 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.549
 very interesting where all this time 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.500
 watched security 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.900
 or she still hasn't woken up 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.910
 You can not notice 60 tabs of their 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.980
 there are no people at the station but they are 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.540
 of course reacted by sending 200 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.670
 policemen and two helicopters 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.579
 that is, for every square ecologist 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.420
 there are about 333 people of order 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.850
 apparently 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.680
 033 made distemper did not know where to run and 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.560
 for got their questions and in the course 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.810
 this is the reason that the attention they 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.110
 only 34 people were detained 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.180
 where have 26 more gone? what if they are like 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.090
 mushrooms grow in the morning and in the evening 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.890
 break up or they are such they we are not here 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.640
 what have we here on a tour with those 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.799
 schoolchildren 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.079
 everything went I went they just kind of like 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.340
 harmless and only tents everywhere are fastened 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.190
 like caterpillars cocoon 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.580
 and why everyone calls environmentalists what 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.830
 they are environmentalists 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.760
 they are vandals petty hooligans why are they 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.730
 don't really do something 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.299
 helpful moreover they gathered at 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.700
 event already from 14 countries so that's why 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.680
 to climb a nuclear power plant 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.050
 unnerve people and stop them from working 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.670
 if it is covered with so I do not say 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.530
 that you need to dump chemical everywhere 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.300
 waste and spill oil toil 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.490
 shit that's sad hope 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.950
 Greenpeace hard to think about it 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.210
 all with you was elena rasokhina

 subscribe put Like if all of a sudden 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.810
 yourself stumble upon something 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.580
 Interestingly boldly throw it in 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:46.900
