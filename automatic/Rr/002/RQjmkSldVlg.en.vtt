00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
we're just beyond the Isles of Scilly

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.330 
we're just beyond the Isles of Scilly
with<00:00:44.239> bishop<00:00:44.570> block<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:45.110> what's<00:00:45.890> left<00:00:45.980> for<00:00:46.250> us

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
with bishop block and what's left for us

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.330 
with bishop block and what's left for us
now<00:00:46.580> is<00:00:46.850> basically<00:00:47.350> our<00:00:48.350> approach<00:00:48.890> into<00:00:49.250> the

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
now is basically our approach into the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.880 
now is basically our approach into the
finish<00:00:49.520> line<00:00:49.820> browning<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:51.260> lizard<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:51.800> in

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
finish line browning the lizard so in

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.500 
finish line browning the lizard so in
about<00:00:51.980> 10<00:00:52.250> minutes<00:00:52.460> 20<00:00:53.030> minutes<00:00:53.059> we're<00:00:53.420> gonna

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
about 10 minutes 20 minutes we're gonna

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.170 
about 10 minutes 20 minutes we're gonna
settle<00:00:53.750> for<00:00:53.840> a<00:00:53.960> tribe<00:00:54.200> so<00:00:55.129> bring<00:00:55.309> us<00:00:55.400> just<00:00:55.879> shy

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
settle for a tribe so bring us just shy

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.430 
settle for a tribe so bring us just shy
of<00:00:56.210> lizard<00:00:56.870> rock<00:00:57.080> and<00:00:57.739> then<00:00:59.019> we're<00:01:00.019> going<00:01:00.350> to

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
of lizard rock and then we're going to

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.070 
of lizard rock and then we're going to
expect<00:01:01.100> adverse<00:01:01.580> current<00:01:02.059> until<00:01:02.390> we<00:01:02.480> get<00:01:02.690> to

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
expect adverse current until we get to

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.560 
expect adverse current until we get to
lizard<00:01:03.470> run<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:03.949> then<00:01:04.280> prepare<00:01:04.670> we<00:01:04.909> hope<00:01:05.390> to

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
lizard run and then prepare we hope to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.300 
lizard run and then prepare we hope to
gain<00:01:05.720> some<00:01:05.780> compression<00:01:06.350> geographically

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
gain some compression geographically

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.000 
gain some compression geographically
from<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.580> breeze<00:01:08.200> what<00:01:09.200> are<00:01:09.320> two<00:01:09.470> knots<00:01:09.710> as

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
from the breeze what are two knots as

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.800 
from the breeze what are two knots as
well<00:01:10.190> as<00:01:10.370> starting<00:01:10.729> to<00:01:10.790> focus<00:01:10.940> a<00:01:11.240> favorable

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
well as starting to focus a favorable

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.719 
well as starting to focus a favorable
current<00:01:12.250> readings<00:01:13.250> going<00:01:13.400> to<00:01:13.460> start<00:01:13.670> the

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
current readings going to start the

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.160 
current readings going to start the
clock<00:01:13.970> around<00:01:14.360> to<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:14.990> west<00:01:16.000> northwest<00:01:17.170> so

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
clock around to the west northwest so

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.990 
clock around to the west northwest so
again<00:01:18.409> around<00:01:18.590> 310<00:01:19.159> is<00:01:19.400> always<00:01:19.700> was<00:01:19.880> the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
again around 310 is always was the

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.830 
again around 310 is always was the
unlight<00:01:20.330> er<00:01:20.360> so<00:01:21.290> we<00:01:21.710> started<00:01:22.240> an<00:01:23.240> hour<00:01:23.390> ago<00:01:23.570> we

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
unlight er so we started an hour ago we

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.539 
unlight er so we started an hour ago we
are<00:01:23.960> seeing<00:01:24.140> 14<00:01:24.590> knots<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:25.130> right<00:01:25.220> now<00:01:25.340> we're

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
are seeing 14 knots and right now we're

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.430 
are seeing 14 knots and right now we're
in<00:01:25.580> around<00:01:25.880> 10<00:01:28.510> so<00:01:29.510> there's<00:01:29.840> more<00:01:30.050> about<00:01:30.350> it

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
in around 10 so there's more about it

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.260 
in around 10 so there's more about it
not<00:01:30.560> more<00:01:30.710> pressure<00:01:31.010> to<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.280> north<00:01:31.400> inside<00:01:32.030> of

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
not more pressure to the north inside of

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.960 
not more pressure to the north inside of
Lands<00:01:32.780> End<00:01:33.020> but<00:01:33.980> the<00:01:34.100> current<00:01:34.310> in<00:01:34.490> there<00:01:34.640> so
