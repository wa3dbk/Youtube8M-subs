00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.630
 Hi, I'm not waiting for you to be clear in Mexico if I take it off 4 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.919
 at this point the federal judge 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.919
 with a web server www 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:14.779
 this apparatus to be exact 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.789
 a little hahaha 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.570
 but fat tovar 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.580
 palm apart the package comes all indica 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.529
 a brick to understand 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.890
 to be able to take as a flag 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.840
 efe the subsidiary of edp fast start because simple but good as seeing 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.210
 being usual calm I do not understand 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.300
 second goal in three or four 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.950
 this is the show at least 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.150
 / weight devices 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.550
 good the appliances is based on the white windows protocol 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.950
 - It's worth saying in 2008 for 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.230
 combat peripheral hunger in this case 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.270
 penumbra peripheral storage or make a portrait an external hard drive 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.320
 oj printers 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.760
 the papacy can access cancer a printer 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.620
 oo a trailer with external hard drive 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.380
 that has been connected 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.110
 for his part he can win 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.300
 naturally he showed his world famous to Víctor Valdés and that is 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.800
 compatible with windows 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.010
 windows xp 38 64-bit hidden visit also depends on 64 bits 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.650
 but we have checked to see that the juan sanchez package works 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.659
 what includes 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.110
 14 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.480
 what we discussed 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.480
 we make 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.359
 we also comment 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:37.770
 the previous one 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.980
 we are going to protect 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.190
 mark hughes advise surprising surprised when laying 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.370
 and so that children leave from noon in the northeast of service to 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.470
 client is already behind 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.500
 same way that we have 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.610
 until last august is that borja prepared to defend 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.120
 for we wanted 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.360
 how does it work 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.360
 thankfully very simple mac under windows 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.570
 we started real his grandfather 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.939
 that fast ramp 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:13.870
 iphoto inhabitants another of the sections we can comment anything 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.099
 it was pointed out why to fear is to the cobo apparatus 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.369
 diplomatically printer 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:22.859
 we apparently on screen 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.809
 let's kill another little thing like davis 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:28.079
 see blair's photos 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.559
 i will disappear too 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:33.169
 the case 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.859
 suddenly craftsmen 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.329
 Tehran for now to write down the content the mayor 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:41.759
 Venezuela 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:45.189
 Well, we only have to comment on the devices 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.059
 as you see appeared 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:50.959
 percent and herrera liconsa is to say that it tells us that we are connected to 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.589
 the net 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:56.010
 and good but we can also see with the power Italian bars 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.010
 the two swamps 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.859
 we have commented that it is not that we can access them 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:08.230
 if no problem as if we were with the 2-2 of the computer 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.039
 here we have 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:14.349
 have the gift of haiti are facts and those that we have passed indicated that he will not have 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.479
 loans or loans accessible as if they were 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:19.299
 a 2 m hard drive 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.739
 within the agreements appropriate only to do if other side 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.799
 news to see about these victory waters discs tell us in fact 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.829
 we are disconnecting from the hard drive 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.980
 and in this case, any other side of the network could connect to the 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:40.959
 its function has resembled a server b in the astelena garcía hard drive box 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.169
 in the writing a trailer to be able to take advantage of them was more radical than 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.509
 I write we can access for computers at the same time 

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:51.129
 encourage device 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.629
 anyway so the advantage of the print server is to say we can 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.129
 connect a printer that any other side can be commented appear 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.919
 three hours 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:03.159
 it's typical in it 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.449
 we are going to nothing 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:09.779
 as we do not rule out going another lie is naturally a good server 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:12.699
 to federer percent 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.889
 imbued so that we can 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:20.719
 modify the connection network data of the device we can modify by four 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.240
 then by state ports ie 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.110
 that separated him we are connected even though we do not have 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.529
 the show installed 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:32.759
 and we can both modified the gnaw configuration 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.820
 we can not change the name is positive peter cetera 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.789
 a series of changes 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:44.119
 it can be definitive this is not an economic saltillo device Thursday 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.490
 to simply share 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.099
 some devices 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:48.930
 In the net 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.550
 It sounds uncommon in the home network that they do not have many users or not 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.789
 they are small business 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.669
 in which the good one because a single person used the donors another group of 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.669
 people last month once and I have to change 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.139
 m as it will echo a hard drive from one computer to another and neither June 17 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.599
 Past was intended to serve others 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:14.879
 As it concludes a very economical impression or solves the ballot in 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:18.389
 many times where to put it between sobradiel so I promise you could not 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.020
 recover from the 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.500
 i will do this we hope you are polite trying to get some 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.890
 products
