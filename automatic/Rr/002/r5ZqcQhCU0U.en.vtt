00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
not good which is kind of an

a<00:00:30.470> really<00:00:31.470> positive<00:00:31.679> review<00:00:32.399> about<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.850> DVD

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
a really positive review about the DVD

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.569 
a really positive review about the DVD
and<00:00:33.570> how<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:34.050> encompasses<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> strength

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
and how it encompasses of the strength

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.090 
and how it encompasses of the strength
and<00:00:35.790> stretching<00:00:36.570> which<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.380> something<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.860> felt

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
and stretching which is something I felt

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.959 
and stretching which is something I felt
I<00:00:38.280> definitely<00:00:39.090> needed<00:00:39.360> both<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:40.309> so<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.340> decided

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
I definitely needed both of so I decided

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.709 
I definitely needed both of so I decided
to<00:00:42.120> go<00:00:42.239> with<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.450> DVD<00:00:43.879> very<00:00:44.879> very<00:00:45.270> happy<00:00:45.690> with

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
to go with that DVD very very happy with

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.400 
to go with that DVD very very happy with
my<00:00:46.079> decision<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.680> do<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.570> before<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.899> started

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
my decision to do so before I started

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.459 
my decision to do so before I started
rocking<00:00:49.890> legs<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.340> abs<00:00:50.520> my<00:00:51.469> flexibility

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
rocking legs and abs my flexibility

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.910 
rocking legs and abs my flexibility
would<00:00:53.270> crack<00:00:54.270> when<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:54.989> first<00:00:55.320> started<00:00:55.710> doing

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
would crack when I first started doing

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.290 
would crack when I first started doing
the<00:00:56.280> DVD<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.710> did<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.859> few<00:00:58.890> times<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.760> then<00:01:00.030> I

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
the DVD I did it a few times and then I

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.560 
the DVD I did it a few times and then I
sadly<00:01:00.780> admit<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.250> actually<00:01:02.579> stopped<00:01:03.210> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
sadly admit that I actually stopped and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.010 
sadly admit that I actually stopped and
put<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.140> side<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.909> collected<00:01:05.909> dust<00:01:06.119> so

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
put it to the side and collected dust so

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.890 
put it to the side and collected dust so
I<00:01:07.409> realized<00:01:07.890> at<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.100> point<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.450> am<00:01:09.600> the

when<00:01:58.910> I<00:01:58.940> first<00:01:59.330> started<00:01:59.840> I<00:02:00.080> had<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.380> lot<00:02:00.680> of<00:02:00.710> pain

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
when I first started I had a lot of pain

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.310 
when I first started I had a lot of pain
in<00:02:01.250> my<00:02:01.340> pair<00:02:01.580> of<00:02:01.670> harness<00:02:02.090> which<00:02:02.750> is<00:02:02.900> in<00:02:03.080> your

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
in my pair of harness which is in your

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.740 
in my pair of harness which is in your
butt<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:04.090> in<00:02:05.090> my<00:02:05.570> IT<00:02:05.780> bands<00:02:06.350> so<00:02:07.070> that<00:02:07.750> chapter

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
butt and in my IT bands so that chapter

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.280 
butt and in my IT bands so that chapter
really<00:02:09.580> strengthened<00:02:10.580> those<00:02:11.210> muscles<00:02:11.930> which

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
really strengthened those muscles which

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.230 
really strengthened those muscles which
is<00:02:12.440> what<00:02:12.710> I<00:02:12.740> really<00:02:13.100> really<00:02:13.520> needed<00:02:13.760> in<00:02:14.030> order

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
is what I really really needed in order

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.120 
is what I really really needed in order
to<00:02:14.390> be<00:02:14.660> able<00:02:15.020> to<00:02:15.170> safely<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:15.890> effectively

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
to be able to safely and effectively

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.930 
to be able to safely and effectively
stretch<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:17.810> second<00:02:18.230> chapter<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.950> I<00:02:19.160> loved

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
it's okay it's gonna pass soon enough I

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.910 
it's okay it's gonna pass soon enough I
started<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.630> see<00:02:59.840> improvement<00:03:00.709> pretty<00:03:01.870> much

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
started to see improvement pretty much

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.460 
started to see improvement pretty much
immediately<00:03:04.930> after<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.080> first<00:03:06.290> week

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
immediately after the first week

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.440 
immediately after the first week
obviously<00:03:07.100> I<00:03:07.130> was<00:03:07.340> taking<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.760> progress<00:03:08.150> pics

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
obviously I was taking the progress pics

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.509 
obviously I was taking the progress pics
so<00:03:08.780> I<00:03:08.810> was<00:03:09.019> able<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.320> compare<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.709> week<00:03:10.040> one<00:03:10.280> to

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
so I was able to compare a week one to

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.330 
so I was able to compare a week one to
week<00:03:10.550> two<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.360> I<00:03:12.110> thought<00:03:12.830> you<00:03:13.160> could

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
week two and I thought you could

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.580 
week two and I thought you could
actually<00:03:13.489> visually<00:03:14.360> visibly<00:03:14.750> see<00:03:15.050> the<00:03:15.260> change

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
actually visually visibly see the change

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.640 
actually visually visibly see the change
and<00:03:16.489> I<00:03:16.640> actually<00:03:16.850> started<00:03:17.570> to<00:03:17.810> feel<00:03:18.200> it<00:03:18.440> which

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
and I actually started to feel it which

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.930 
and I actually started to feel it which
was<00:03:18.860> more<00:03:19.850> evident<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.780> me<00:03:21.280> after<00:03:22.280> maybe<00:03:22.459> three

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
was more evident to me after maybe three

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.220 
was more evident to me after maybe three
or<00:03:23.030> four<00:03:23.180> times<00:03:23.420> doing

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
or four times doing

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.040 
or four times doing
in<00:03:24.560> a<00:03:24.590> row<00:03:25.030> there<00:03:26.030> is<00:03:26.060> an<00:03:26.300> initial<00:03:26.690> hump<00:03:26.900> that

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
in a row there is an initial hump that

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.899 
in a row there is an initial hump that
you're<00:03:27.319> getting<00:03:27.590> over<00:03:28.040> when<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.400> first<00:03:28.640> start

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
you're getting over when you first start

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.059 
you're getting over when you first start
doing<00:03:29.239> it<00:03:29.390> you're<00:03:29.690> not<00:03:29.930> as<00:03:30.200> strong<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.799> begin

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
doing it you're not as strong to begin

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.369 
doing it you're not as strong to begin
with<00:03:31.310> where<00:03:31.940> you're<00:03:32.450> just<00:03:32.599> like<00:03:32.690> oh<00:03:32.989> god<00:03:33.019> this
