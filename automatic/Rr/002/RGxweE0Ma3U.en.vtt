bolts hold the bearing carrier in place

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.840

no<00:02:08.750> that's<00:02:08.990> correct<00:02:09.170> term<00:02:09.500> for<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.860> but<00:02:10.100> it'll

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
no that's correct term for it but it'll

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.390 
no that's correct term for it but it'll
suffice<00:02:11.060> for<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.450> moment<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.560> I<00:02:13.010> didn't

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
suffice for the moment and I didn't

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.060 
suffice for the moment and I didn't
actually<00:02:13.520> think<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.120> taking<00:02:14.450> them<00:02:14.570> out<00:02:15.070> so

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
actually think of it taking them out so

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.660 
actually think of it taking them out so
that<00:02:16.100> I<00:02:16.310> could<00:02:17.650> thoroughly<00:02:18.650> clean<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.840> a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
that I could thoroughly clean and a

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
that I could thoroughly clean and a
paint<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.780> Bering<00:02:24.140> courier<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:28.090> well

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
paint the Bering courier and I well

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.910 
paint the Bering courier and I well
and<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.380> easier.we<00:02:32.250> because<00:02:33.000> as<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.140> stands<00:02:34.710> at

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
and I easier.we because as it stands at

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.410 
and I easier.we because as it stands at
the<00:02:34.950> moment<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.430> quite<00:02:35.520> tricky<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.090> get<00:02:36.270> in

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
the moment it's quite tricky to get in

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.900 
the moment it's quite tricky to get in
here<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.350> know<00:02:38.010> basically<00:02:38.670> cleaning

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
here and you know basically cleaning

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.090 
here and you know basically cleaning
they're<00:02:39.210> sort<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.570> all<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.290> dirt<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.920> grime

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
they're sort of all the dirt and grime

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.040 
they're sort of all the dirt and grime
you<00:02:41.160> know<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.640> was<00:02:41.850> just<00:02:41.970> absolutely<00:02:42.570> for<00:02:42.900> some

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
you know it was just absolutely for some

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.000 
you know it was just absolutely for some
and<00:02:45.080> took<00:02:46.080> quite<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.290> lot<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.500> time<00:02:46.680> how

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
and took quite a lot of time how

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.940 
and took quite a lot of time how
scratching<00:02:47.670> your<00:02:47.790> paint<00:02:48.120> or<00:02:48.330> our<00:02:48.770> needle<00:02:49.770> fail

I<00:03:12.780> discovered<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.830> they're<00:03:14.130> they're<00:03:14.610> really

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
I discovered that they're they're really

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.860 
I discovered that they're they're really
tight<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.870> if<00:03:16.470> they've<00:03:16.680> been<00:03:16.920> torque<00:03:17.400> then

I<00:03:19.620> believe<00:03:20.100> when<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.760> lathe<00:03:21.000> was<00:03:21.270> new<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.630> don't

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
I believe when the lathe was new I don't

I believe when the lathe was new I don't

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
if this has ever been removed so I had

if this has ever been removed so I had

because<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:31.590> know<00:03:31.710> it's<00:03:31.890> around<00:03:32.040> here

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.750 

you've<00:03:36.349> got<00:03:36.470> machined<00:03:36.860> surface<00:03:37.280> long<00:03:37.489> here

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
you've got machined surface long here

you've got machined surface long here
I'm<00:03:37.970> down<00:03:38.330> here<00:03:38.630> and<00:03:39.530> I<00:03:39.590> machined<00:03:39.950> surface<00:03:40.370> up

I'm down here and I machined surface up

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.030 
I'm down here and I machined surface up
here<00:03:40.849> and<00:03:41.060> along<00:03:41.270> there

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
here and along there

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.550 
here and along there
that's<00:03:43.040> flush<00:03:43.580> here<00:03:44.030> but<00:03:44.900> there's<00:03:45.110> a<00:03:45.200> buffer

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
that's flush here but there's a buffer

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.260 
that's flush here but there's a buffer
state<00:03:45.890> they're<00:03:46.310> a<00:03:46.340> little<00:03:46.580> faster<00:03:47.000> into<00:03:47.180> the

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
state they're a little faster into the

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.720 
state they're a little faster into the
casting<00:03:47.660> at<00:03:47.810> all<00:03:47.959> but<00:03:48.800> it's<00:03:49.310> certainly<00:03:49.670> not

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
casting at all but it's certainly not

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.309 
casting at all but it's certainly not
even<00:03:50.770> and<00:03:52.390> again<00:03:53.390> you<00:03:53.630> go<00:03:53.750> arms<00:03:54.080> in<00:03:54.290> circles

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
even and again you go arms in circles

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.890 
even and again you go arms in circles
coming<00:03:54.830> along<00:03:55.069> here<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:55.550> down<00:03:55.700> here<00:03:56.060> when<00:03:56.870> a

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
coming along here and down here when a

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.809 
coming along here and down here when a
sheen<00:03:57.170> surface<00:03:57.590> coming<00:03:57.860> up<00:03:57.980> here<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.519> I<00:03:58.670> love

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
sheen surface coming up here and I love

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.839 
sheen surface coming up here and I love
there<00:03:59.709> and<00:04:00.709> again<00:04:00.980> there's<00:04:01.190> a<00:04:01.250> stay<00:04:01.489> on<00:04:01.519> that

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
there and again there's a stay on that

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.930 
there and again there's a stay on that
side<00:04:02.090> both<00:04:02.900> up<00:04:03.260> here<00:04:03.610> and<00:04:04.610> in<00:04:05.150> there<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:07.790> it's

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
side both up here and in there and it's

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.920 
side both up here and in there and it's
not<00:04:08.000> here<00:04:10.569> excuse<00:04:11.569> me

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
not here excuse me

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.410 
not here excuse me
so<00:04:12.799> if<00:04:12.920> I<00:04:13.010> were<00:04:13.190> to<00:04:13.220> remove<00:04:13.670> those<00:04:13.819> four<00:04:14.090> bolts

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
so if I were to remove those four bolts

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:24.000 
so if I were to remove those four bolts
I<00:04:18.100> am<00:04:19.100> unsure<00:04:19.459> whether<00:04:20.120> or<00:04:20.389> not<00:04:21.160> simply

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
I am unsure whether or not simply

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.409 
I am unsure whether or not simply

four bolt holes and on these to guide

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.950 
four bolt holes and on these to guide
rails<00:04:33.380> would<00:04:33.800> be<00:04:34.010> enough<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.639> maintain<00:04:36.250> the

rails would be enough to maintain the

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.550 

there<00:04:42.180> because<00:04:43.180> a<00:04:43.330> lot<00:04:43.510> of<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.660> writers<00:04:43.960> write
