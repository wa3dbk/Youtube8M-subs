00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.140
 lee 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.290
 lee 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.400
 the 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.819
 serious all bike paths talent 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:14.279
 can he new commented video and for good reason it is the revenge of the match 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.630
 ultimate of the west against the it says 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.579
 so the first part was safe at rs 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:22.150
 it was our match 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.150
 and this one and especially favelas the shipowner 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.050
 so on rmc I was not very well at first 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.849
 in any case hatches at the end 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.030
 and it seems to me that the hd and it's kind of like the porthole boss and 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.390
 beers and then and then 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.590
 I go 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.090
 he is played by the end 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.470
 so I'm still with the rest of the 08 panda and mike mills if the defeats 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.150
 against lille 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.300
 four site staff 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.440
 and I like 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.150
 would not say their name 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.210
 it seems like someone in this shuttered house I think it's 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.440
 past 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.490
 this effort 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.750
 while out the best and the chaos 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.320
 but I tell myself that 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.750
 arsene texas really very short term 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.210
 and here I am going to do something a little 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.440
 a bit phony in quotation marks 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.280
 that is to say, I will take the jedi sith hakim go 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.680
 and I'm just going to try to 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.049
 16% 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.180
 Tuesday Frederic 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.180
 there remains only one ally with me 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.690
 maybe two or three 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.110
 it is more difficult to evolve what type of lacoste impose labeaume apart 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.940
 so I go get it 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.040
 if I could very well have stayed in the stomach and 45 what I should have 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.030
 make 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.140
 the dead beasts at lot messi 18 found on the ground 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.820
 and that's when my team faces the promoted stoke who never pulls straight 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.540
 while 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.160
 I saw for example 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.950
 but I'm also foiled niemi 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.400
 it is also supported for example longevity it's worth 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.160
 failed during his visits always pulls straight to the bet to do it 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.769
 know how to handle them 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.040
 and watch the second round to kill all the enemies effect of the 4 0 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.849
 sawyer is wrong behind because it's a piece that has become very 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:20.929
 greenhouse 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:24.679
 of technical domination of habit and you may know 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:29.499
 he still plays the nuclear bomb in the optics he is activated paris 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.039
 Nicolas Sarkozy for the nuclear 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:37.139
 meal scenes still at the stage of research and destruction the offices 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.320
 of renault have also progressed predators 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.019
 jean-louis darted 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.079
 there is always a unit that hopes to one day make 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.529
 a nuclear bomb 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:47.459
 search and destroy 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.709
 and there look over 45 as usual I'm getting used to 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.519
 who starts 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.719
 flashcodes 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.359
 he is not afraid of them 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.779
 finally he could very well come out 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:07.579
 and there he makes a small casing can find a way out with the knife nancy-metz 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.719
 look but look what way 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.099
 except that Sunday 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.169
 it's I do not know how it makes me I'm really trying to 20 pm abbey says 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:22.429
 ten kilos blow just as quickly change of style and she 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.689
 is that to make it simple and humble 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.189
 Hundreds of Victims Handled United States at the Beginning of February 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:35.459
 on the farm this one 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.529
 of their lord while they thought he plowed 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.389
 m 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.539
 poor for dominance than for research 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.139
 for this hardest match 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:51.090
 the research 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.119
 the time entrance together 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:56.279
 the csa is not very strong interest for women 

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:58.809
 while domination 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:00.439
 whatever 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.640
 he came out with the suspicion of being alone against all 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.949
 it can be it's done it's really cheap 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.839
 because the difficulty next to armandie 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:12.839
 govt 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.449
 refuse this little window 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.599
 according to france 3 goes up 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.909
 so he could very well have tried a flashcode 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.419
 definitive tunisia 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:38.370
 this is this series both under the par while he knows that the enemy 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.969
 as for the uzi submachine gun 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.719
 so classify ranger 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:46.719
 and yes these cases I will immediately go to ask belz 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.319
 I looked so apart from the crime 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.180
 and unfortunately not racist anyway 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.550
 the little 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.689
 here 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:00.559
 the welcome really needs to be taken 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:03.409
 and that's not it if you noticed but he from which 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.539
 47 he is a little off to the right 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.259
 so that's what we need 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:10.270
 with 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.740
 a little who was stalking 47 years of the arranged I had very recently and I stayed 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.419
 I'm very proud of you to play there unfortunately too much if I find myself 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.729
 all alone 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.270
 against crossroads enemies 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.999
 theater 

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:26.999
 follow one by one try 45% 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:30.849
 despey 45th it's really huge 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.139
 alizÃ©e I find this blow hard so he did not understand that there was in front a 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.339
 such a case 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:39.959
 judges are not at e3 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:46.459
 and I'm a score of 10 to 3 it does not really make sense to who it was 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.219
 break this series at home are a reality it's really a shame 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.589
 he studied 

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:54.569
 teachers a few 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:55.800
 a few seconds 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.800
 knowing that there is only one that does not belong to 33 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.289
 and there, what am I doing 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.789
 I'm right now 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:05.599
 I played really well alas 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:08.509
 I was sure that one year ago, that's why I did not look 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:09.460
 behind 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.869
 I do not know 

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:13.869
 clermont managed to score 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.810
 the rate is 47 a lot of silent discs and highly recommended especially 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.750
 for the search and destruction the images on this folder I find it 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.159
 really 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.809
 no need for TV 

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:31.360
 and a slayer by a pressing and either you can put a charger for 

00:06:31.359 --> 00:06:32.949
 kill an enemy 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:36.770
 and it does not improve a bit I do not know if you saw the militia with his 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.770
 style 18 he really managed to kill the millions 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:46.109
 indirectly they are then dried 18 nov m in monthey they are not mounted 

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:49.499
 it's pretty amazing 

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:50.569
 he is 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:53.809
 he knows how to use it well 

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:54.719
 then at afp 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:55.879
 what are we going to run 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:59.459
 it's bad about what he wanted a little hold-up in the next round 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:03.129
 it's a very pretty font 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:06.430
 so I want to clarify that 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.910
 this video is in two parts since it was exchanged for 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.029
 put the party on youtube 

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:17.610
 so the prospect I started this round 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.190
 knowing that 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.169
 soon 24 jobs 

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:24.860
 if you're interested, of course 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.860
 e swiss and video match m 

00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:31.080
 and I'm going to leave each other on me 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.479
 aiming at the enemy 

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:36.430
 and you will see 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.220
 in the second part of this video then I tell you 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:39.720
 See you soon
