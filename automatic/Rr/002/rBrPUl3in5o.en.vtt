00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:18.060
 and the eyes of the cat the eyes of the cat 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:22.619
 deep and luminous they have a power 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:26.070
 mysterious the Egyptian word used 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:30.269
 to name the cat was mou that 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.460
 It means seeing until recently was 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.120
 I thought that cats did not distinguish 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.989
 colors however recently it has 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.780
 proven by experiments that yes 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.829
 they can perceive the posts that their 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.149
 Retina contains cones and canes as 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.149
 It has been shown 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.870
 but the most important thing is that the eyes 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:00.800
 of the cat are extremely prepared in 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:04.070
 other aspects sensitivity to light 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.380
 of the eyes of cats especially in 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.190
 what refers to the lengths of 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.640
 shortwave is six times higher than the 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.420
 of man and that's why the cat is said 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.170
 can see in the dark even when not 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.800
 can see in absolute darkness possesses 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.590
 behind his retina a tissue 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.560
 reflective called tape with light and doom 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.789
 that allows you to distinguish what 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.100
 surrounds when the light is so reduced that 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:40.160
 impedes vision for man and others 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.259
 less gifted animals in this aspect 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:48.289
 that felines also thanks to their 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:51.319
 very fine ear and tactile sensitivity 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:54.579
 of your vibrissa can move with total 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:57.579
 security even in the dark 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.579
 absolute 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:16.730
 the lucid tape tour that manages to increase 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:20.569
 between 30 and 50 times any trace of 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.640
 light however small it is, what makes 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.159
 glow in the dark eyes of 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.130
 cats when struck by lightning 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:30.100
 bright 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.770
 the visual power of the cat looks 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.950
 favored also by the great 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.220
 adaptability of their pupils that are 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.710
 circular when they open to the maximum in 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.730
 the penumbra to collect the greatest 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.930
 possible amount of light and are reduced to 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:53.160
 two thin vertical wires in full light 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.160
 when the pupils contract 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:04.700
 the light too strong even for 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.600
 contracted pupils can be diminished 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.720
 When you close your eyes a little 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.620
 cats also have vision 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.320
 binocular is to say that part of the field 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.590
 vision of an eye is covered by the 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:24.400
 another also skill that is necessary 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.730
 for three-dimensional vision that 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.850
 requires all animal hunter which 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:34.310
 allows to judge the distance depth 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:37.340
 and size of its prey 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.990
 binocular vision may vary according to 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.290
 the race 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:46.460
 what determines the best disposition to 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:50.510
 hunting one race more than another 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:54.650
 for example the Siamese whose vision 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:58.630
 binocular is not so pronounced for that 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.630
 they are not so good hunters 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.440
 despite all these skills 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.920
 eye cat is born without power 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.760
 use since it only opens your eyes to 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.310
 from seven days after 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.040
 of which is when they begin to 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.190
 learn to interpret all 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.010
 stimuli that enter through the eyes and not 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.690
 they come to dominate them until they have passed 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:34.419
 about 12 weeks that is when your eyes 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.240
 they acquire their final color that can 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:40.780
 have a wide range that goes from 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.400
 yellow and orange to green or 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.400
 intense blue
