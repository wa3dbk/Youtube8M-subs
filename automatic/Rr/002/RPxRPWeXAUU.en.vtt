00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.200
For this nail we are going to do a gel ripple
design.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.800
I have already made this base out of acrylic
using

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.779
a sculptured stiletto.
So we are ready for our design.

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.779
We are going to start by working with our
white and start shaping these ripples.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.050
Wipe your brush and then using the tip of
your brush blend the gel out slightly.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.600
So just with the tip of that brush

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.200
and just on one side of your gel.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.200
That wants to go into the lamp just for 10 seconds.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.200
Take that back out.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.200
We are then going to carry on building this
ripple up.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.800
Just by adding more white gel to the
original part, not the bit that you have blended.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.100
Back under the lamp 
again for another 10-20 seconds.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.500
Again, same again.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.000
Back in.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.200
And then another once.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.800
And back in. That needs to stay under the
lamp now for 3 minutes.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.500
So what you should end up with at the minute 
is higher sections of white

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.200
and lower sections of white.
Because what we are going to do is put a

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.900
slightly transparent purple onto the whole
nail now.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.200
And you are going to use this as your clear
builder as if you would a clear builder.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.500
So a nice thin layer on the whole nail 
and then your builder layer.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.500
And that can go back under the lamp for
3 minutes.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.300
So you need to wipe that sticky residue off now

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.000
and we're going to file this nail. What you should
see happening is parts of the white really

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.200
standing out because we are filing through
the colour.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.300
Get rid of your dust.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:02.400
I am going to finish this design off with a little bit of hand-painting just to extend some of those ripples

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.600
so just white block it
so that is nice and smooth.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.600
And then give it a wipe as well so you can really see where those ripples are.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:27.900
Using a nice detailer brush, into your white.
Just at the edge of the ripples extend them

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.700
slightly with your brush. 
That way you will get a nice point on the end of them.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Wait for that to dry

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.000
and then you are ready for your gel top coat.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.500
Into your lamp for 2 minutes.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.500
So a little bit of cuticle oil will finish that
nail off.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.500
That's your gel ripples done.
