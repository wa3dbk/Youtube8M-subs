signed<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.259> I'm<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.470> wondering<00:01:28.680> why<00:01:28.950> doesn't

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
signed so I'm just wondering why doesn't

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.350

it<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.880> contract<00:01:31.310> issue<00:01:32.310> about<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.790> penalty

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
it in the contract issue about a penalty

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.969 
it in the contract issue about a penalty

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
for drug testing was never brought up

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.399 
for drug testing was never brought up
prior<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.210> first<00:01:36.390> contract<00:01:36.930> be<00:01:37.110> inside

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
prior to the first contract be inside

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.140 
prior to the first contract be inside
but<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.159> was<00:01:38.250> leaked<00:01:38.520> out<00:01:38.670> into<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.000> public

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
but it was leaked out into the public

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.580 
but it was leaked out into the public
because<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.600> actually<00:01:39.869> asked<00:01:40.170> Freddie<00:01:40.439> Roach

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
because I actually asked Freddie Roach

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.280 
because I actually asked Freddie Roach
about<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.180> but<00:01:42.180> we've<00:01:42.390> never<00:01:42.570> discussed<00:01:42.960> it

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
about it but we've never discussed it

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.240 
about it but we've never discussed it
formally<00:01:43.799> with<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> other<00:01:44.159> side<00:01:44.460> my<00:01:44.880> day<00:01:46.250> but

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
formally with the other side my day but

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
formally with the other side my day but
we<00:01:47.430> knew<00:01:47.610> there<00:01:47.790> was<00:01:47.909> going<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.149> be<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
we knew there was going to be a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.630 
we knew there was going to be a
secondary<00:01:48.780> contract<00:01:49.680> with<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> drug<00:01:50.220> testing

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
secondary contract with the drug testing

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.100 
secondary contract with the drug testing
company<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.240> they<00:01:51.270> look<00:01:51.659> good<00:01:51.780> whether<00:01:57.110> he's

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
company so they look good whether he's

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.399
