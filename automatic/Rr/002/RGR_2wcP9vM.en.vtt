00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.010
 thanks to funds from the city 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.990
 budget new serve 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.910
 cars are regularly received by rescuers 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.320
 a few years ago the first contract 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.270
 this kind was a prisoner with 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.830
 the police then the guards 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.930
 carrier in the central part 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.760
 Tallinn received from Mary several 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.590
 scooters which are much more convenient 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.450
 patrol as narrow old streets 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.640
 cities and numerous parks 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.350
 but the development of technology does not stand still 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.600
 it is used by modern 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.730
 offenders in the streets all 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.320
 more often you can meet 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.629
 four-wheeled moto monsters for 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.430
 quadrocycles or as they are called from 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.110
 in which are designed to ride 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.449
 actually cross country or 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.850
 pole can't keep up not on car not 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:53.269
 on a scooter summertime especially in 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.909
 old town and different cash parks 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:59.379
 Kalinovsky territory for example in 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:01.220
 the quadriorg is very comfortable and very 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.129
 positive result yes it is 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.190
 patrol with such devices 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:13.280
 and of course whether 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:16.430
 how powerful powerful bike gives us 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.200
 opportunity to patrol and on the island 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.030
 window current financial situation 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.130
 state does not give reason to hope 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.440
 to ensure that the cops are timely 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.600
 got much needed but not cheap 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.910
 technique that's why the initiative on 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.410
 himself again took the mayoralty of Tallinn and justice 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.450
 central part of the capital decided 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.190
 to present as a gift a police unit 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.140
 the same level to the guardians of order 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.540
 could worthily if necessary 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.980
 confront a motorized intruder 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.350
 when two years ago we bought 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.210
 police scooter saw it immediately 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.490
 benefit from this but now the city is all 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.620
 you can see such cars more often 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.870
 which by the way is recorded as 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.090
 tractor but sometimes they ride through the parks 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.250
 where they often spoil lawns breaks 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.770
 vegetation park furniture a police 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.930
 it is very difficult to catch them by car or 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.280
 motor scooter quad model which 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.840
 entered service in the capital 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.700
 the cops is one of the most 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.800
 fast and powerful in this class 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.170
 power 800 cubic engine 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.159
 reaches forty two kilowatts thanks 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.019
 what is this shell 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.909
 reaches speeds of up to 100 kilometers 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.069
 hour but the main advantage of the design 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:18.830
 unit is considered high reliability 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.629
 endurance carrying capacity coming 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.609
 ATV days will receive an additional 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.480
 police siren equipment and flashers 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.890

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.849
 same will be painted in characteristic 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.110
