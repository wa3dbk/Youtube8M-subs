00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
thought before I even switch this

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.580 
thought before I even switch this
wonderful<00:01:39.479> bit<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.689> kit<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.049> which<00:01:40.320> I'm<00:01:40.470> going

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
exactly what the state of hit really

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.859 
exactly what the state of hit really
because<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.920> might<00:01:47.070> go<00:01:47.250> fat<00:01:47.610> if<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.210> plug<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.689> in

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
so here we are this is the Panasonic

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.680 
so here we are this is the Panasonic
Essex<00:02:06.329> 690<00:02:07.259> now<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.829> particular<00:02:08.819> model<00:02:09.330> was

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
Essex 690 now this particular model was

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.540 
Essex 690 now this particular model was
probably<00:02:10.080> produced<00:02:10.470> early<00:02:11.160> nineteen

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
probably produced early nineteen

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.540 
probably produced early nineteen
seventies<00:02:11.879> or

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
seventies or

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.320 
seventies or

and very sturdy quite heavy but very
nice<00:02:17.840> very<00:02:18.260> desirable<00:02:18.940> now<00:02:19.940> as<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.240> can<00:02:20.390> see

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
nice very desirable now as you can see

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.670 
nice very desirable now as you can see
if<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.410> look<00:02:21.440> through<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.750> grille<00:02:23.750> there<00:02:24.230> you

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
if you look through the grille there you

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.490 
if you look through the grille there you
can<00:02:24.860> probably<00:02:25.069> just<00:02:25.220> about<00:02:25.430> see<00:02:25.819> some<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.270> the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
can probably just about see some of the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.290 
can probably just about see some of the
some<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.709> some<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.370> components<00:02:29.000> now

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
some of the some of the components now

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.090 
some of the some of the components now
if<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:29.480> take<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.900> top<00:02:30.110> off<00:02:30.170> which<00:02:30.560> one<00:02:30.740> has<00:02:30.860> done

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
if I take the top off which one has done

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.199 
if I take the top off which one has done
earlier<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:33.230> can<00:02:33.380> get<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.560> better<00:02:33.860> view<00:02:34.209> of

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
earlier you can get a better view of

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.610 
earlier you can get a better view of
what<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:36.490> lurking<00:02:37.490> beneath<00:02:37.970> as<00:02:38.450> they<00:02:38.660> say<00:02:38.989> and

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
what is lurking beneath as they say and

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.620 
what is lurking beneath as they say and
certainly<00:02:40.610> having<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.090> put<00:02:41.239> that<00:02:41.330> down<00:02:41.480> on<00:02:41.540> the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
certainly having to put that down on the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.190 
certainly having to put that down on the
ground<00:02:41.840> certainly<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:42.739> can<00:02:42.920> see<00:02:43.130> plenty<00:02:43.489> of

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
ground certainly you can see plenty of

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.070 
ground certainly you can see plenty of
sawdust<00:02:45.370> so<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.760> if<00:02:47.239> I<00:02:47.360> just<00:02:47.390> get<00:02:47.930> my<00:02:48.050> little

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
sawdust so and if I just get my little

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.680 
sawdust so and if I just get my little
red<00:02:48.410> pointer<00:02:48.830> out<00:02:48.860> here<00:02:49.850> we<00:02:49.970> go<00:02:50.120> look<00:02:50.420> all<00:02:50.630> of

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
red pointer out here we go look all of

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.340 
red pointer out here we go look all of
it<00:02:50.900> here

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
it here

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.970 
it here
I<00:02:52.090> haven't<00:02:53.090> even<00:02:53.300> attempted<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:54.050> turn<00:02:54.410> any<00:02:54.769> of

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
I haven't even attempted to turn any of

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.310 
I haven't even attempted to turn any of
the<00:02:55.100> control<00:02:56.030> knobs<00:02:56.390> here<00:02:56.660> because<00:02:57.050> I<00:02:57.080> don't

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
the control knobs here because I don't

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.210 
the control knobs here because I don't
want<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.560> make<00:02:57.709> it<00:02:57.950> worse<00:02:58.989> but<00:02:59.989> it<00:03:00.260> is<00:03:00.680> covered

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
want to make it worse but it is covered

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.940 
want to make it worse but it is covered
in<00:03:02.350> sawdust<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:03.590> muck<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.340> dust<00:03:05.950> interesting

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
in sawdust and muck and dust interesting

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.670 
in sawdust and muck and dust interesting
it's<00:03:07.220> got<00:03:07.400> these<00:03:07.550> wonderful<00:03:07.850> three<00:03:08.680> lamps

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
it's got these wonderful three lamps

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.699 
it's got these wonderful three lamps
here<00:03:10.540> which<00:03:11.540> obviously<00:03:11.930> fit<00:03:12.320> onto<00:03:12.500> this

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
here which obviously fit onto this

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.380 
here which obviously fit onto this
acrylic<00:03:15.250> backplate<00:03:16.250> which<00:03:16.580> then<00:03:16.820> goes<00:03:17.120> onto

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
acrylic backplate which then goes onto

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.039 
acrylic backplate which then goes onto
the<00:03:17.540> front<00:03:17.930> panel<00:03:18.470> of<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:19.600> tuner<00:03:20.630> now<00:03:20.989> the

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
the front panel of the tuner now the

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.960 
the front panel of the tuner now the
actual<00:03:21.440> thing<00:03:21.650> itself<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:22.130> just<00:03:22.340> turn<00:03:22.579> this<00:03:22.760> up

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
actual thing itself I just turn this up

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.150 
actual thing itself I just turn this up
a<00:03:23.000> bit<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:24.140> just<00:03:24.290> turn<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.739> up<00:03:24.799> so<00:03:24.980> we<00:03:25.070> can

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
a bit so I just turn it up so we can

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:34.150 
a bit so I just turn it up so we can
have<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:31.540> reflection<00:03:32.540> from<00:03:32.690> my<00:03:32.930> law<00:03:33.140> from<00:03:34.010> my

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
have a reflection from my law from my

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.130 
have a reflection from my law from my
angle<00:03:34.519> boys<00:03:34.760> lights<00:03:35.120> on<00:03:35.420> there<00:03:35.630> on<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.870> front

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
angle boys lights on there on the front

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.620 
angle boys lights on there on the front
grill<00:03:36.410> but<00:03:36.560> bear<00:03:37.100> with<00:03:37.130> me<00:03:37.519> right<00:03:38.299> so<00:03:38.829> whoops

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
grill but bear with me right so whoops

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.120 
grill but bear with me right so whoops
that's<00:03:41.630> just<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:41.989> top<00:03:42.140> falling<00:03:42.530> over<00:03:42.709> right

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
that's just the top falling over right

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.190 
that's just the top falling over right
so<00:03:43.340> this<00:03:43.519> end<00:03:43.790> we've<00:03:44.090> got<00:03:44.299> the<00:03:44.450> tuning<00:03:44.959> knob

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
so this end we've got the tuning knob

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.050 
so this end we've got the tuning knob
which<00:03:45.560> I<00:03:45.709> say<00:03:45.950> I'm<00:03:46.700> not<00:03:47.090> actually<00:03:47.299> going<00:03:47.600> to

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
which I say I'm not actually going to

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.050 
which I say I'm not actually going to
attempt<00:03:50.060> to<00:03:50.380> touch<00:03:51.380> you<00:03:51.980> then<00:03:52.280> next<00:03:52.700> to<00:03:53.030> that

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
attempt to touch you then next to that

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.600 
attempt to touch you then next to that
you've<00:03:53.690> got<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:54.019> usual<00:03:54.260> tuning<00:03:55.100> bar<00:03:55.340> which

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
you've got the usual tuning bar which

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.470 
you've got the usual tuning bar which
goes<00:03:55.820> along

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
goes along

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.530 
goes along
you've<00:03:56.870> got<00:03:57.110> the<00:03:58.480> FM<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.980> AM<00:04:01.540> tuning

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
you've got the FM and AM tuning

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.080 
you've got the FM and AM tuning
indicator<00:04:03.500> and<00:04:03.860> then<00:04:04.340> it<00:04:04.489> says<00:04:04.670> there's<00:04:05.030> a

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
indicator and then it says there's a

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.850 
indicator and then it says there's a
stereo<00:04:05.570> so<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:05.930> imagine<00:04:06.290> as<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.470> lamp<00:04:06.680> behind

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
stereo so I imagine as the lamp behind

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.330 
stereo so I imagine as the lamp behind
that<00:04:07.450> next<00:04:08.450> that<00:04:08.690> you've<00:04:08.840> got<00:04:09.049> the<00:04:09.590> source<00:04:09.950> and

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
that next that you've got the source and

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.130 
that next that you've got the source and
then<00:04:10.730> you've<00:04:10.850> got<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.090> tape<00:04:11.329> monitor<00:04:11.900> and

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
then you've got the tape monitor and

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.949 
then you've got the tape monitor and
then<00:04:12.620> this<00:04:12.829> end<00:04:13.190> you've<00:04:13.489> got<00:04:13.519> to<00:04:13.970> V<00:04:14.269> use<00:04:14.600> which

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
then this end you've got to V use which

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.430 
then this end you've got to V use which
to<00:04:15.140> say<00:04:15.470> what<00:04:15.829> eight<00:04:16.190> homes<00:04:16.880> on<00:04:17.239> there<00:04:17.510> which

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
to say what eight homes on there which

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.140 
to say what eight homes on there which
I'm<00:04:18.620> not<00:04:18.769> sure<00:04:19.010> what<00:04:19.250> they<00:04:19.400> do<00:04:19.459> whether<00:04:19.880> that's

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
I'm not sure what they do whether that's

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.570 
I'm not sure what they do whether that's
the<00:04:20.329> output<00:04:20.479> I'm<00:04:21.019> not<00:04:21.169> sure<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:22.370> then<00:04:22.490> you've

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
the output I'm not sure and then you've

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.630 
the output I'm not sure and then you've
got<00:04:22.669> this<00:04:22.789> wonderful<00:04:23.030> bar<00:04:24.190> which<00:04:25.190> goes<00:04:25.430> all

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
got this wonderful bar which goes all

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.770 
got this wonderful bar which goes all
the<00:04:25.669> way<00:04:25.849> along<00:04:26.150> now<00:04:26.479> Ben

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
the way along now Ben

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.590 
the way along now Ben
that<00:04:27.170> you've<00:04:27.470> got<00:04:27.680> loudness<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.240> volume

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
that you've got loudness and the volume

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.010 
that you've got loudness and the volume
control<00:04:30.100> balance<00:04:31.100> left<00:04:31.340> and<00:04:31.550> right<00:04:31.760> and<00:04:32.090> then

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
control balance left and right and then

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.480 
control balance left and right and then
the<00:04:33.440> function<00:04:34.100> so<00:04:34.310> it's<00:04:34.460> on<00:04:34.580> FM<00:04:34.940> at<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.120> moment

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
the function so it's on FM at the moment

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.390 
the function so it's on FM at the moment
am<00:04:37.490> phono<00:04:38.330> an<00:04:38.510> auxilary<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:39.889> then<00:04:40.040> you've<00:04:40.190> got

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
am phono an auxilary and then you've got

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.440 
am phono an auxilary and then you've got
the<00:04:40.610> mode<00:04:41.180> FM<00:04:41.810> mute<00:04:42.220> stereo<00:04:43.220> on<00:04:43.580> so<00:04:44.060> and<00:04:44.330> then

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
the mode FM mute stereo on so and then

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.129 
the mode FM mute stereo on so and then
obviously<00:04:44.780> just<00:04:45.400> mono<00:04:46.400> off<00:04:46.790> so<00:04:47.419> case<00:04:47.840> you've

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
obviously just mono off so case you've

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.980 
obviously just mono off so case you've
got<00:04:48.169> the<00:04:48.350> choice<00:04:48.590> there<00:04:49.040> for<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:49.990> frequency

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
got the choice there for the frequency

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.550 
got the choice there for the frequency
for<00:04:51.590> stereophonic<00:04:52.460> or<00:04:52.610> mono<00:04:53.210> and<00:04:53.600> then<00:04:54.139> treble

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
for stereophonic or mono and then treble

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.560 
for stereophonic or mono and then treble
and<00:04:54.650> bass<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:55.280> then<00:04:55.639> you've<00:04:55.790> got<00:04:55.880> speakers<00:04:56.360> a

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
and bass and then you've got speakers a

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.890 
and bass and then you've got speakers a
and<00:04:56.810> B<00:04:56.990> a<00:04:58.060> next<00:04:59.060> step<00:04:59.180> you've<00:04:59.300> got<00:04:59.390> a<00:04:59.419> phone<00:04:59.720> an

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
and B a next step you've got a phone an

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.930 
and B a next step you've got a phone an
output<00:05:00.260> and<00:05:00.500> then<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.710> power<00:05:00.980> switch<00:05:01.490> on<00:05:01.730> and

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
output and then the power switch on and

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.530 
output and then the power switch on and
off<00:05:02.770> so<00:05:03.770> it's<00:05:03.890> very<00:05:04.070> desirable<00:05:04.610> and<00:05:04.970> I've

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
off so it's very desirable and I've

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.420 
off so it's very desirable and I've
actually<00:05:05.720> seen<00:05:05.960> a<00:05:06.200> few<00:05:06.500> of<00:05:06.620> these<00:05:06.710> on<00:05:06.980> eBay

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
actually seen a few of these on eBay

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.940 
actually seen a few of these on eBay
going<00:05:07.820> for<00:05:08.000> about<00:05:08.180> 70<00:05:09.050> pounds<00:05:09.350> or<00:05:09.770> there

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
going for about 70 pounds or there

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.110 
going for about 70 pounds or there
abouts<00:05:10.250> so<00:05:11.240> and<00:05:12.280> find<00:05:13.280> out<00:05:13.400> as<00:05:13.610> you<00:05:13.730> can<00:05:13.850> see

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
abouts so and find out as you can see

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.950 
abouts so and find out as you can see
over<00:05:14.270> in<00:05:14.480> Mike<00:05:14.660> I've<00:05:14.990> got<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.380> Pioneer

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
over in Mike I've got the Pioneer

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.700 
over in Mike I've got the Pioneer
amplifier<00:05:17.960> over<00:05:18.290> there

hour<00:05:24.860> which<00:05:25.190> I've<00:05:25.340> had<00:05:25.520> since<00:05:26.080> about<00:05:27.100> 1976.i

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
hour which I've had since about 1976.i

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.630 
hour which I've had since about 1976.i
think<00:05:29.000> I<00:05:29.060> got<00:05:29.240> that<00:05:29.450> so<00:05:29.810> so<00:05:30.770> those<00:05:30.890> Terenas<00:05:31.460> but

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
think I got that so so those Terenas but

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.250 
think I got that so so those Terenas but
I<00:05:31.760> mean<00:05:31.910> this<00:05:32.000> is<00:05:32.150> solid<00:05:32.540> stuff<00:05:32.840> this<00:05:33.110> is

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
I mean this is solid stuff this is

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.510 
I mean this is solid stuff this is
really<00:05:33.650> really<00:05:34.930> heavy<00:05:35.930> if<00:05:36.860> I<00:05:37.010> just<00:05:37.220> put<00:05:37.400> her

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
really really heavy if I just put her

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.080 
really really heavy if I just put her
back<00:05:37.760> on<00:05:37.790> okay<00:05:38.630> I've<00:05:39.410> got<00:05:39.740> this<00:05:39.860> massive<00:05:40.250> mains

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
back on okay I've got this massive mains

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.580 
back on okay I've got this massive mains
transformer<00:05:42.020> here<00:05:42.260> and<00:05:42.680> then<00:05:44.560> followed<00:05:45.560> by

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
transformer here and then followed by

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.390 
transformer here and then followed by
obviously<00:05:46.310> some<00:05:46.490> surge<00:05:46.760> protectors<00:05:47.539> here

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
obviously some surge protectors here

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.400 
obviously some surge protectors here
over<00:05:49.400> here<00:05:49.610> and<00:05:49.940> then<00:05:50.330> you've<00:05:50.539> got<00:05:50.810> all<00:05:51.169> the

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
over here and then you've got all the

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.290 
over here and then you've got all the
components<00:05:51.820> we've<00:05:52.820> got<00:05:52.970> this<00:05:53.060> lovely

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
components we've got this lovely

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.640 
components we've got this lovely
heatsink<00:05:54.080> here<00:05:54.470> and<00:05:54.680> on<00:05:55.220> the<00:05:55.370> front<00:05:55.669> of<00:05:55.970> those

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
heatsink here and on the front of those

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.230 
heatsink here and on the front of those
you<00:05:57.650> just<00:05:57.950> see<00:05:58.220> you've<00:05:58.640> got<00:05:58.789> some<00:05:58.820> power

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
you just see you've got some power

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.580 
you just see you've got some power
amplifier<00:05:59.979> bits<00:06:00.979> here<00:06:01.280> as<00:06:01.400> well<00:06:02.229> I'm<00:06:03.229> not<00:06:03.380> sure

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
amplifier bits here as well I'm not sure

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.469 
amplifier bits here as well I'm not sure
what<00:06:03.800> they<00:06:03.950> are<00:06:04.130> actually<00:06:04.370> whether<00:06:05.180> they're

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
what they are actually whether they're

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:07.120 
what they are actually whether they're
the<00:06:05.690> rectifiers<00:06:06.350> or<00:06:06.620> whether<00:06:06.830> they're<00:06:07.100> just

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
the rectifiers or whether they're just

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.300 
the rectifiers or whether they're just
the<00:06:07.900> we're<00:06:08.900> going<00:06:09.020> to<00:06:09.110> do<00:06:09.200> the<00:06:09.320> transistors<00:06:10.130> in

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
the we're going to do the transistors in

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.040 
the we're going to do the transistors in
there<00:06:10.520> I'm<00:06:10.580> not<00:06:10.729> sure<00:06:11.060> but<00:06:11.330> it's<00:06:11.750> obviously

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
there I'm not sure but it's obviously

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.350 
there I'm not sure but it's obviously
how<00:06:12.140> it<00:06:12.229> needs<00:06:12.380> us<00:06:12.530> heatsink<00:06:13.340> to<00:06:13.430> dissipate

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
how it needs us heatsink to dissipate

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.540 
how it needs us heatsink to dissipate
some<00:06:14.720> of<00:06:14.840> the<00:06:14.960> heat<00:06:15.169> that<00:06:15.440> goes<00:06:16.070> along<00:06:16.220> there

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
some of the heat that goes along there

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.010 
some of the heat that goes along there
and<00:06:16.580> then<00:06:16.760> develop<00:06:17.000> protecting<00:06:17.479> wall<00:06:17.690> here

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
and then develop protecting wall here

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.710 
and then develop protecting wall here
then<00:06:19.010> obviously<00:06:19.130> the<00:06:19.460> components<00:06:20.060> are<00:06:20.360> in<00:06:20.600> the

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
then obviously the components are in the

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.480 
then obviously the components are in the
front<00:06:21.220> for<00:06:22.220> the<00:06:22.960> tune<00:06:23.960> apart<00:06:24.410> and<00:06:24.830> the

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
front for the tune apart and the
