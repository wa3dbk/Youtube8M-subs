longboarding<00:01:57.620> is<00:01:57.740> a<00:01:57.800> whole<00:01:57.920> different<00:01:58.160> story

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
longboarding is a whole different story

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.940 
longboarding is a whole different story
you<00:01:59.720> have<00:01:59.870> some<00:02:00.080> kind<00:02:00.230> of<00:02:00.350> two<00:02:00.530> schools<00:02:00.800> of

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
you have some kind of two schools of

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.070 
you have some kind of two schools of
thought<00:02:01.010> one<00:02:01.520> is<00:02:01.700> performance<00:02:02.600> longboarding

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
thought one is performance longboarding

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.450 
thought one is performance longboarding
which<00:02:03.230> is<00:02:03.410> turns<00:02:03.800> and<00:02:04.100> other<00:02:04.220> ones

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
which is turns and other ones

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.700 
which is turns and other ones
traditional<00:02:05.090> which<00:02:05.240> is<00:02:05.390> nose<00:02:05.600> rating<00:02:06.080> and<00:02:06.650> I

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
traditional which is nose rating and I

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.889 
traditional which is nose rating and I
think<00:02:06.980> we<00:02:07.100> have<00:02:07.310> maybe<00:02:08.030> sixty<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.690> seventy
