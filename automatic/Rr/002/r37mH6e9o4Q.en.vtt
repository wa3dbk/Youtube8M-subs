know<00:02:20.519> in<00:02:20.790> most<00:02:21.030> places<00:02:21.299> it's<00:02:21.900> not<00:02:22.079> illegal<00:02:22.379> if

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
know in most places it's not illegal if

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.050 
know in most places it's not illegal if
you're<00:02:22.739> over<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.129> age<00:02:23.159> of<00:02:23.340> 18<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.939> buy

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
you're over the age of 18 to buy

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.309 
you're over the age of 18 to buy
something<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:24.959> if<00:02:25.019> you're<00:02:25.200> in

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319

something like this so if you're in
college<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.069> you're<00:02:26.909> feeling<00:02:27.239> a<00:02:27.299> little

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:27.389 
college and you're feeling a little

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.420 
college and you're feeling a little
threatened<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.650> might<00:02:28.859> be<00:02:28.980> something<00:02:29.189> you

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
threatened this might be something you

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.599 
threatened this might be something you
can<00:02:29.549> use<00:02:29.819> it's<00:02:30.480> pretty<00:02:30.900> invisible<00:02:31.769> if<00:02:32.400> you

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
can use it's pretty invisible if you

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.729 
can use it's pretty invisible if you
bend<00:02:32.879> your<00:02:33.090> leg<00:02:33.329> you<00:02:33.959> can<00:02:34.079> kind<00:02:34.349> of<00:02:34.439> see<00:02:34.620> the

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
bend your leg you can kind of see the

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.580 
bend your leg you can kind of see the
end<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.129> right<00:02:35.159> here<00:02:35.579> now<00:02:36.150> if<00:02:36.450> you're<00:02:37.409> ready

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
end of it right here now if you're ready

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.740 
end of it right here now if you're ready
this<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.129> kind<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:38.579> drawing<00:02:38.849> a<00:02:39.150> firearm

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
this is kind of like drawing a firearm

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.360 
this is kind of like drawing a firearm
so<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.019> is<00:02:40.109> technically<00:02:40.469> good<00:02:40.739> practice<00:02:41.219> if

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
so this is technically good practice if

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.589 
so this is technically good practice if
you're<00:02:41.459> looking<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.879> maybe<00:02:42.180> getting<00:02:42.540> a

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599

you're looking and maybe getting a
firearm<00:02:44.150> maybe<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.269> clothing<00:02:45.629> out<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.780> the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
firearm maybe the clothing out of the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.349 
firearm maybe the clothing out of the
way<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.230> have<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.129> little<00:02:47.400> button<00:02:47.609> I<00:02:47.879> snapped

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
way I have that little button I snapped

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.199 
way I have that little button I snapped

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
and it draws straight up it was tight at

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.059 
and it draws straight up it was tight at
that<00:02:51.329> time<00:02:51.569> I<00:02:51.870> might<00:02:52.439> have<00:02:52.530> done<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.709> belt<00:02:52.950> a

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
that time I might have done the belt a

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.399 
that time I might have done the belt a
little<00:02:53.099> too<00:02:53.400> tight<00:02:54.439> there<00:02:55.439> you<00:02:55.500> go<00:02:56.840> yeah<00:02:57.840> just

little too tight there you go yeah just
draw<00:02:58.620> straight<00:02:59.340> up<00:02:59.489> and<00:03:00.109> then<00:03:01.109> that<00:03:01.290> has<00:03:01.469> it

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
draw straight up and then that has it

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.440 
draw straight up and then that has it
out<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:01.919> then<00:03:02.489> it's<00:03:02.730> actually<00:03:02.879> pretty<00:03:03.389> easy

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
out and then it's actually pretty easy

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.899 
out and then it's actually pretty easy
to<00:03:05.480> cheat<00:03:06.980> I'm<00:03:07.980> having<00:03:08.310> trouble<00:03:08.639> with<00:03:08.760> there

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
right now there we go but it pulls

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.140 
right now there we go but it pulls
straight<00:03:13.349> back<00:03:13.739> out<00:03:13.889> and<00:03:14.159> actually<00:03:14.909> you

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
straight back out and actually you

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.610 
straight back out and actually you
shouldn't<00:03:15.510> have<00:03:15.720> you're<00:03:16.290> worrying<00:03:16.560> about

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
shouldn't have you're worrying about

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.379 
shouldn't have you're worrying about
receiving<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:17.699> if<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:17.879> end<00:03:18.030> up<00:03:18.090> stabbing

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
receiving it if you end up stabbing

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:19.729 
receiving it if you end up stabbing
somebody<00:03:18.690> you're<00:03:19.019> calling<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.349> police<00:03:19.500> and

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
somebody you're calling the police and

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.580 
somebody you're calling the police and
you're<00:03:19.829> putting<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.159> on<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.430> ground<00:03:21.590> but

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379 
for a second this is great if you're

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:16.179 
for a second this is great if you're
trying<00:05:12.409> to<00:05:13.039> stab<00:05:13.909> like<00:05:14.210> this<00:05:14.680> if<00:05:15.680> you<00:05:15.860> put<00:05:16.069> your

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:16.189 
trying to stab like this if you put your

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:17.769 
trying to stab like this if you put your
knife<00:05:16.310> backwards<00:05:16.819> in<00:05:16.939> the<00:05:17.029> sheath<00:05:17.240> you<00:05:17.599> could

00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:17.779 
knife backwards in the sheath you could

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:20.920 
knife backwards in the sheath you could
pull<00:05:17.960> out<00:05:18.020> like<00:05:18.289> this<00:05:19.029> this<00:05:20.029> way<00:05:20.389> you<00:05:20.449> have

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
pull out like this this way you have

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.899 
pull out like this this way you have
more<00:05:21.259> of<00:05:21.289> a<00:05:21.500> chance<00:05:21.740> to<00:05:22.009> stab<00:05:22.310> yourself<00:05:22.490> and

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
more of a chance to stab yourself and

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:25.330 
more of a chance to stab yourself and
here's<00:05:23.090> why<00:05:23.439> because<00:05:24.439> if<00:05:24.650> you're<00:05:24.979> going<00:05:25.189> to

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
here's why because if you're going to

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.649 
here's why because if you're going to
stab<00:05:25.520> somebody<00:05:25.759> they're<00:05:26.090> gonna<00:05:26.180> block<00:05:26.629> it

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 
stab somebody they're gonna block it

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.390 
stab somebody they're gonna block it
down<00:05:26.960> like<00:05:27.199> this<00:05:27.409> and<00:05:27.650> when<00:05:27.860> that<00:05:27.979> goes<00:05:28.190> down

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
down like this and when that goes down

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.730 
down like this and when that goes down
it's<00:05:29.360> going<00:05:29.569> right<00:05:29.750> into<00:05:29.900> your<00:05:30.050> leg<00:05:30.259> because

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
it's going right into your leg because

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.740 
it's going right into your leg because
it's<00:05:31.039> like<00:05:31.159> a<00:05:31.190> fulcrum<00:05:31.639> coming<00:05:32.000> in<00:05:32.569> that

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
it's like a fulcrum coming in that

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.159 
it's like a fulcrum coming in that
motion<00:05:33.849> never<00:05:34.849> ever<00:05:35.180> ever<00:05:35.419> like<00:05:35.719> this<00:05:35.900> also

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
motion never ever ever like this also

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.640 
motion never ever ever like this also
the<00:05:36.440> easiest<00:05:36.680> to<00:05:36.800> block<00:05:38.199> always<00:05:39.199> straight<00:05:39.560> up

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
the easiest to block always straight up

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.800 
the easiest to block always straight up
the<00:05:39.740> middle<00:05:40.009> holding<00:05:40.879> it<00:05:41.150> like<00:05:41.990> so<00:05:42.490> cool

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810
