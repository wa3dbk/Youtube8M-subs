00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.050
 It's very special because I have a challenge with 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.210
 my friend fanny rodríguez who is going to 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:28.580
 be doing the same recipe from 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:31.520
 reynosa tamaulipas all friends and me 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.280
 I know I will win be competition click 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.590
 that will never win me ever never 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.590
 never but well nor the audience 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.950
 we will make fondant cake with 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.080
 cover of the best shirts 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.970
 footballers from the world of funk and it's going to be 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.830
 the cover with the Christian t-shirt 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.810
 ronaldo because he is the one who adds more 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.470
 bet according to her and was the one who chose 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.150
 me with the one of lionel messi because then 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.489
 was the only one left then that 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.280
 little woman that you see there is my opponent 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.470
 to go to his channel insult her 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.900
 say a lot of things stop me and it's 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.760
 both are created go to your channel so that 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.100
 see how the cake is left and then 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.869
 there will be a vote through their 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.729
 comments we will know who is 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.570
 the winner and the loser will have a 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.570
 severe punishment 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.320
 The first thing we need to do is the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.780
 cake that should have a consistency 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.640
 firm so that it will not break 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.620
 this time I will make a cake of 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.780
 red chocolate but everyone can 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.170
 do as it suits you or as more you 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.170
 like 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.950
 to that means thinking 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.930
 good to the fondant is like a kind of 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.820
 bitumen but instead of being sticky 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.370
 it's like play dough and you can find it 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.820
 in shopping centers or pastry shops 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.620
 but in ranchitos like where I live 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.320
 It is very difficult to find because you enter 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.500
 a store and you ask the lady 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.840
 today he makes an apology he knows where is the 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.209
 fondant and instead of having the 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.209
 aisle 26 young or something if they do not tell you 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.989
 You can also leave a comment or if 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.739
 are you familiar phrase this as good 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:28.269
 Let's start with the dirty work 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.269
 We are going to need white chocolates 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.950
 about 16 kilos are no longer created with 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.980
 what you see enough 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.349
 I'm going to use these but in the box 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.629
 descriptions I'm going to put them all 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.550
 the portions that we had and I'm going to 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.870
 use these chocolates in the form of 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.879
 heart 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.879
 and we are going to melt them slowly 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.150
 we must calculate according to the power of 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.400
 our oven the time it takes in 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.290
 melt the chocolate and we must also 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.040
 be checking it so that we are not 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.530
 go burn 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.079
 when a single mixture is made, 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.269
 ready to add the icing sugar but 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.270
 very careful with a little stick because 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.030
 we can burn 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.080
 and that's where the new shark or 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.700
 remember 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.550
 Now, yes, to work 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.800
 when it's cool we use cornstarch to 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.690
 that does not stick to us if we see that the 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.709
 fondant gets the sticky add 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.709
 more sugar icing 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.900
 And it will stain everything already when we have left 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.750
 our perfectly well made dough 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.240
 as a perfect circle and we already have the 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.020
 fondant base and we only 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.880
 it would be necessary to paint it with different colors 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.980
 with artificial colors and then the 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.660
 I invite you to continue seeing as equals 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.970
 the colors of the beach 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.640
 painting it is very simple but have 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.050
 careful because spots 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.620
 for example I left a dump of 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.620
 those 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.850
 to mold the bread prints a t-shirt 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:12.260
 as a template and placed it over for 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.260
 let us stay as it should be 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.870
 and then to plan our balls of 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.270
 fondant with the respective colors the 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.150
 we mold in my case I need bars 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.740
 blue and red we plan also 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.129
 we add cornstarch so we do not miss 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.620
 paste clean the fondant cut everything 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:41.750
 we cut the strips we cut to our 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.099
 girlfriends and ready 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.099
 there we have the shirt 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.230
 and that's how we look a bit even 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.410
 but it's okay because right now 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.410
 very cold 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.580
 well that's how I stay for a bit 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.940
 rustic if I have to accept it but 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.100
 Well, I never had and so 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.890
 you do not have to help decide which 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.790
 was the best for the loser to have 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.790
