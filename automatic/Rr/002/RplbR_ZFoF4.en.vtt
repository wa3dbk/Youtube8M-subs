00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello then let's go to make some 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.690
 nun farts and yes you have good 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.910
 understood dp2 so name this dp rating is this 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.160
 that it's these are donuts 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.400
 donuts that we make from a 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.980
 puff pastry so it's very simple so 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.769
 must the wolf I have 250 grams of water that 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.560
 I have already put in a pan 80 g of 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.949
 butter 125 g flour 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.099
 so I take fluid flour and 3 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.600
 or 4th so first step in the water I 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:41.219
 wanted to put a pinch of salt next 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:45.570
 I put my butter and I come to do 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:49.050
 melt everything on my gas simon butter 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.809
 which has melted well in the water now 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.949
 I extinguished the fire or I hold 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.579
 gas pans is out of the fire 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:07.080
 I incorporate my flour in one go so we 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:15.360
 put the flour we turn so that 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:18.659
 we get a dough we're going to come 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.460
 to dry out a little on the fire so a fire 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.259
 a little not too loud one to two minutes 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:30.659
 exactly like the attach that this pc 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:33.030
 you feel and a choux pastry I'm going 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:40.890
 transvase that's it then i'm going to come 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:43.619
 incorporate the eggs so to parent it's 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:50.259
 a little hard crushed 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:54.710
 that 's how it sounds the impact and 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.329
 you mix it feels like that 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.670
 will never get mixed up it'll never 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.090
 to be incorporated but if it's okay 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.319
 body provided after a while 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:21.530
 then these 3 or 4 th 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:23.000
 it depends on it has almost failed once 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.180
 my new and well incorporate one can 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:38.360
 put the second 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:45.470
 so we proceed like that so it's a 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:46.700
 little bit hard is normal here are my games 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.319
 well incorporate then what I forgot 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.420
 to tell you is that I will add 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.150
 also a little bit of lemon zest 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.230
 that is, you perfume your dough 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:02.900
 lemon vanilla pony ds of 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:14.120
 lemon what you want so I have 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:15.950
 made with lemons I mix everything 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.280
 is also I just put 20 sachet of 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.280
 vanilla sugar 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.690
 so here I put have read a last 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.690
 stroke 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.250
 so we have our paw ready 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.620
 now we're going to fill a pocket with 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.120
 bushing fans can fill a pocket 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.460
 so I take it to freeze 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:55.040
 it's exactly the same thing and I 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:57.870
 come put all my paw in yes 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.790
 in my freezer bag I come to do 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.790
 come all 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.700
 and here at the end we will cut a 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.609
 little by little angle so I also 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.039
 prepared a small dish with paper 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:27.250
 absorbent for m but bathed once 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:27.250
 next so here we are going to cut 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:37.389
 so we will also hold the chisel to 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:43.930
 provision close to our frying 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:47.419
 I have here my bag of pasta 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.190
 I'm going to come and make small 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.860
 balls but as I'm all alone so 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.270
 in fact 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.270
 I support I cut 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:12.660
 so we also lose to something in 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.660
 foaming infectious to beat them and 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.530
 wanted to do bigger there is not 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.090
 of importance and so let you fry 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.540
 it's okay once it takes a nice 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.930
 color well bray well we know 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.930
 it's cooked 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:35.740
 so here I showed you then I 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.300
 am going to play a little game after I 'm not going 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.060
 more talk too much because I'm going to put the 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.740
 high so where did you do a little bit of 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:47.030
 noise if I leave at the same time she not 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:50.860
 account in dhr again mini morocco 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.860
 sending the front I let you look 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.620
 here I come back to you you see that 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.630
 still inflates so careful do not do 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.090
 too beautiful so I leave you 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.380
 watch because with the high and well you 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.070
 do you go to you are not going anymore 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.650
 cumbersome 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.080
 so it's very simple it's cooking 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.150
 then once it is cooked is 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.710
 take it like that we drain it we put it on 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.320
 the table his rebound and we put a little bit of 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.630
 sugar on it then we put the sugar we 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.310
 wants to put the icing sugar are 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.450
 wounded nature too it's like you 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.450
 want no concern 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.340
 so here are the donuts are doing what 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.169
 I will show you this is 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:52.100
 interior 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:54.560
 so see it's hollow it's normal 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.180
 it's the puff pastry so it's very 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:02.620
 very good I made a little bigger at the 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:06.740
 end so we sprinkle sugar and that's it 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:09.280
 our pays of nuns so what is good 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:14.150
 with this recipe is that there is no 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:16.610
 rest the dough we prepare it and hop on 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:19.810
 in fact donuts then on this I 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.810
 you say enjoy yourself
