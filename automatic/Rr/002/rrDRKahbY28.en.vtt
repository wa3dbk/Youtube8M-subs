a little bit loose as of now and that's

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.689 
a little bit loose as of now and that's
because<00:04:35.410> we<00:04:35.800> need<00:04:35.949> to<00:04:36.039> take<00:04:36.190> our<00:04:36.400> hooking

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
because we need to take our hooking

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.250 
because we need to take our hooking
mechanism<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:38.340> very<00:04:39.340> carefully<00:04:40.260> allowing
