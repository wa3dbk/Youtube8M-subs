00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.160
 hi everyone is saying that at 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.020
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.360
 new glitch video on call of 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.500
 duty ghost to be able to get out of the 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.150
 bm aug card 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.519
 online so I do not know how 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.529
 really she is pronouncing a card but 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.119
 in any case it's devastation mapaq 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.439
 I believe and so that will allow you to 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.749
 take out the card we initiate you 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.460
 realize well so to start this 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.870
 geek you have found you one is my 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.880
 common law in the video and you 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.800
 will have to climb on the small barrier 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.210
 yellow as I show it and afterwards 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.860
 and tomorrow we will have to make a 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.379
 strap jump as I show in the 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.809
 video to be able to get on this pipe 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.280
 green so get on this little spot which 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.989
 until then it's really super simple 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.149
 it is until after the difficulty of 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.800
 glitch has increased a little bit so you 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.449
 will have to arrive on a big species 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.160
 white poles so it's really not 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.870
 easy to get there especially ben 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.309
 I do not come from the comic or the 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.440
 first will jump to the vivrons 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.910
 super simple just after as I you 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.739
 watch it in the video you go 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.990
 have to make another ploy to 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.400
 so get on this white pole he in 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.470
 arrives and is silent standards white pole 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.120
 until then the glitch has been 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.860
 practically realized because the most 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.300
 difficult will have been done it's especially this 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.430
 big white poles that's hard to 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.230
 access and so a phase this big spot 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.060
 hand in height but already you will have a 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.650
 Belgian girl seen on the map and to you 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.170
 just have the hands to finish the 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.150
 glitch do a strike jobs on the species 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.890
 two machines that will be right in 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.750
 face of you and therefore to reduce this 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.910
 machine there and well already you have just 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.680
 to lie down you will be invisible not 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.150
 invincible but just invisible he is 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.440
 ball goes through so at these two 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.090
 cities have no way this 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.250
 machine did and ben that you will be able to 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.680
 staying here has remained invisible but good 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.960
 if your enemies see you are there 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.610
 in there well they will not have to shoot 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.600
 through and you will necessarily die 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.520
 so it's not the top 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.720
 and so I show you how 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.460
 remove the card will not access very 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.410
 simple and well just behind you eh 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.450
 well you gild another little 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.010
 young to arrive on a wall years apart 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.750
 in the air as I showed in the video 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.520
 she took you will just have to 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.080
 get around the map by walking on the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.130
 invisible walls so you'll just have to 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.750
 do about how in the video 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.470
 it's really super simple montoute to 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.030
 manage easily 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.860
 after I do not know if you're there 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.239
 will see happen comic where is so at 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.069
 passage I advise you to start at 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.650
 realize it partly private for good 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.239
 learn 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.470
 arrange this glick if you count the 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.299
 do online but in any case I you 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.860
 the concept advises do it with your 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.480
 friends for a little explored gold of the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.310
 card or for even power to nothing any 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.379
 the card just be too much yours 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.549
 friends by being invisible but I you 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.959
 do not recommend doing it in one because that 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.040
 could also the craft is any 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.060
 way I try to do it online 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.769
 it's really hard 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.269
 me for myself as the map is very 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.040
 it's really very difficult 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.629
 to go on the youth stage because the 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.159
 most of the time the enemies come 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.780
 kill you quickly because as I 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.519
 wanted to say the map is very small 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.840
 so here I hope valence to life 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.609
 that I will have pleased you there so that she 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.200
 you will help do not hesitate 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.659
 to bombard green thumbs if that's 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.340
 the case and especially for the come back on 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.599
 call of duty ghost as I saw that the 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.159
 maps packs really makes me want to 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.139
 play and hand I think a real 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.420
 many masters on this club so ghost and 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:59.639
 you produce videos on this game 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.970
 regularly so in passing I'm going 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.930
 go out Wednesday will be editing on 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.159
 the special forces 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.599
 so it's a montage that holds me 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.340
 really at heart because it's a profession that 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.510
 I would like to do and so I master 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.799
 montage that I did for the hundred 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.750
 thousand subscribers and that I put 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.370
 almost a month to realize it eh 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.989
 well I'll put it on Wednesday the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.099
 chain and I strongly hope that it will 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.049
 will please because I really 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.620
 a lot of tone above so here you go 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.090
 I tell you so 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.099
 see you soon for next videos 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.410

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.459
 who will arrive primature machine and 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.459
