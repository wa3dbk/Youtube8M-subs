Center<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.930> tuning<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.500> these<00:02:17.710> drums<00:02:18.040> was

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
Center the tuning of these drums was

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.400 
Center the tuning of these drums was
like<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.790> tuning<00:02:19.210> of<00:02:19.300> a<00:02:19.420> lot<00:02:19.630> of<00:02:19.780> large<00:02:19.960> drums

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
like the tuning of a lot of large drums

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.740 
like the tuning of a lot of large drums
in<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.710> big<00:02:20.980> band<00:02:21.310> era<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.940> swing<00:02:22.300> era<00:02:22.480> in

think<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:31.090> reason<00:02:31.450> for<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.690> was<00:02:32.050> you're

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
think and the reason for that was you're

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.100 
think and the reason for that was you're
moving<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:33.040> lot<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.310> air<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.420> impact<00:02:34.930> of

moving a lot of air and the impact of

moving a lot of air and the impact of
the<00:02:35.230> beater<00:02:35.440> ball<00:02:35.710> on<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:35.920> head<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.430> want

the beater ball on that head you want

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.000 
the beater ball on that head you want
that<00:02:36.820> air<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.180> move<00:02:37.330> quickly<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:38.380> get<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.590> round

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010

full sound that was the secret of his

full sound that was the secret of his
great<00:02:42.550> sound<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.600> fact<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:43.990> these<00:02:44.230> heads

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
great sound is the fact that these heads

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.550 
great sound is the fact that these heads
were<00:02:44.860> tuned<00:02:45.190> up<00:02:45.460> a<00:02:45.640> lot<00:02:46.180> higher<00:02:46.600> on<00:02:46.960> the<00:02:47.110> bottom

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
were tuned up a lot higher on the bottom

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.890 
were tuned up a lot higher on the bottom
than<00:02:48.130> they<00:02:48.310> were<00:02:48.370> on<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.940> batter<00:02:49.180> side<00:02:49.570> and

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
than they were on the batter side and

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.160 
than they were on the batter side and
that<00:02:50.560> gave<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.490> whole<00:02:51.850> total<00:02:52.480> sound<00:02:52.780> of<00:02:53.080> the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
that gave that whole total sound of the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.500 
that gave that whole total sound of the
drum<00:02:53.470> upon<00:02:53.890> impact<00:02:54.430> from<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.760> stick<00:02:55.030> or<00:02:55.240> a

drum upon impact from a stick or a

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.290 
drum upon impact from a stick or a

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
beater ball from the pedal so on the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.710 
beater ball from the pedal so on the

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
rack Tom the the actual pitch of the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.370 
rack Tom the the actual pitch of the
bottom<00:03:02.080> head<00:03:02.410> was<00:03:03.160> for<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:03.910> large<00:03:04.750> drum<00:03:05.140> like

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
bottom head was for a large drum like

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.520 
bottom head was for a large drum like
that<00:03:05.620> was<00:03:06.220> pitched<00:03:06.670> way<00:03:07.180> up<00:03:07.390> like<00:03:08.170> you<00:03:08.350> would

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
that was pitched way up like you would

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.010 
that was pitched way up like you would
hear<00:03:08.830> a<00:03:08.860> snare<00:03:09.310> drum<00:03:09.340> being<00:03:09.880> tuned<00:03:10.240> and<00:03:10.540> so

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
hear a snare drum being tuned and so

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.750 
hear a snare drum being tuned and so
that's<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.530> hence<00:03:11.740> that's<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.220> way<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.550> rest

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
that's the hence that's the way the rest

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.420 
that's the hence that's the way the rest
of<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:12.970> drums<00:03:13.180> would<00:03:13.330> go<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.950> snare<00:03:15.220> drum

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
of the drums would go the snare drum

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.910 
of the drums would go the snare drum
tuning<00:03:15.700> was<00:03:16.150> also<00:03:16.570> a<00:03:16.840> real<00:03:17.170> important<00:03:17.650> part<00:03:17.860> of

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
tuning was also a real important part of

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.070 
tuning was also a real important part of
John<00:03:18.160> Bonham<00:03:18.550> sound<00:03:18.820> he<00:03:19.000> understood<00:03:19.600> the

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
John Bonham sound he understood the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.800 
John Bonham sound he understood the
dynamics<00:03:20.490> between<00:03:21.490> the<00:03:21.670> snare<00:03:22.030> side<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.660> the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
dynamics between the snare side and the

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.590 
dynamics between the snare side and the
batter<00:03:23.020> side<00:03:23.350> in<00:03:23.680> that<00:03:24.340> he<00:03:24.610> pitched<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.330> snare

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
batter side in that he pitched the snare

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.260 
batter side in that he pitched the snare
side<00:03:25.870> way<00:03:26.230> up<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.680> he<00:03:27.459> never<00:03:27.700> choked<00:03:28.090> the

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
side way up and he never choked the

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.970 
side way up and he never choked the
snares<00:03:28.540> he<00:03:28.870> loosened<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.290> snares<00:03:29.560> just

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
snares he loosened the snares just

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.160 
snares he loosened the snares just
enough<00:03:30.310> so<00:03:30.910> you'd<00:03:31.120> get<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.480> sensitivity<00:03:32.140> of

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
enough so you'd get the sensitivity of

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.230 
enough so you'd get the sensitivity of
the<00:03:32.350> snares<00:03:32.620> but<00:03:33.220> you'd<00:03:33.400> also<00:03:33.610> get<00:03:33.940> the

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
the snares but you'd also get the

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.880 
the snares but you'd also get the
wholeness<00:03:34.480> of<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.930> drum<00:03:35.230> from<00:03:35.410> top<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.680> bottom

wholeness of the drum from top to bottom

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.910 
wholeness of the drum from top to bottom

the batter head and / coated like I said

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.370 
the batter head and / coated like I said
before<00:03:39.100> was<00:03:39.790> always<00:03:40.090> pitched<00:03:40.420> way<00:03:40.780> up<00:03:40.990> but

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
before was always pitched way up but

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.130 
before was always pitched way up but
never<00:03:41.770> so<00:03:42.190> far<00:03:42.520> as<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:43.000> lose<00:03:43.240> some<00:03:43.959> of<00:03:44.080> the

never so far as to lose some of the

never so far as to lose some of the
dynamics<00:03:44.680> between<00:03:44.830> the<00:03:45.100> batter<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:45.490> the
