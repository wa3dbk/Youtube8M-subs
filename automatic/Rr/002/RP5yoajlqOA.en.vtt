fairly precise and confined target to

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
make it look as though you're attacking

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.740 
make it look as though you're attacking
you<00:01:45.280> know<00:01:45.430> a<00:01:45.460> ship<00:01:45.820> or<00:01:46.000> something<00:01:46.360> of<00:01:46.720> that

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
you know a ship or something of that

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.990 
you know a ship or something of that
nature<00:01:46.899> so<00:01:47.380> you're<00:01:47.590> you're<00:01:48.250> coming<00:01:48.610> in<00:01:48.759> at<00:01:48.909> a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
nature so you're you're coming in at a

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.249 
nature so you're you're coming in at a
pretty<00:01:49.210> pronounced<00:01:49.720> nose-down<00:01:50.200> attitude

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
pretty pronounced nose-down attitude

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.920 
pretty pronounced nose-down attitude
with<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.009> pretty<00:01:51.219> good<00:01:51.369> bit<00:01:51.579> of<00:01:51.610> energy<00:01:51.820> and<00:01:52.210> the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
with a pretty good bit of energy and the

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.420 
with a pretty good bit of energy and the
air<00:01:53.049> speeds<00:01:53.350> wrapping<00:01:53.799> up<00:01:53.920> on<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.130> on<00:01:54.399> the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
air speeds wrapping up on the on the

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.219 
air speeds wrapping up on the on the
airspeed<00:01:54.759> indicator<00:01:55.000> so<00:01:55.210> it's<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:56.049> have<00:01:56.170> to

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
airspeed indicator so it's you have to

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.719 
airspeed indicator so it's you have to
fly<00:01:56.469> the<00:01:56.530> airplane<00:01:56.920> fairly<00:01:57.280> aggressively

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
fly the airplane fairly aggressively

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.340 
fly the airplane fairly aggressively
because<00:01:57.969> that's<00:01:58.360> how<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.509> Japanese<00:01:58.750> flew<00:01:59.229> the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
because that's how the Japanese flew the

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.560 
because that's how the Japanese flew the
aircraft<00:01:59.469> to<00:01:59.860> make<00:01:59.979> it<00:02:00.100> a<00:02:00.159> convincing<00:02:00.610> attack

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
aircraft to make it a convincing attack

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.719 
aircraft to make it a convincing attack
you<00:02:01.750> can't<00:02:01.960> fly<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.259> like<00:02:02.469> a<00:02:02.500> dc-3<00:02:02.950> or<00:02:03.490> or

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
you can't fly it like a dc-3 or or

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.300 
you can't fly it like a dc-3 or or

attack<00:02:14.049> the<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.650> object<00:02:15.100> and<00:02:15.310> then<00:02:15.760> there's

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
attack the the object and then there's

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.150 
attack the the object and then there's
pyro<00:02:16.209> down<00:02:16.480> there<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:16.720> blows
