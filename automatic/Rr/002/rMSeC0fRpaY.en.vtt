00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.620
 row tour unusual game this is not a race this 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.590
 not the most realistic simulator in the world 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.550
 it's not even a two-wheeled grant 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.639
 tourism what her adverbs managed it 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.379
 just the best and grata 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.950
 motorcycles yes just so this game is about 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.020
 motorcycles they product on them 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.670
 just look at these replays and all 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.010
 understand see how love is made 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.860
 each model has details in it 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.270
 you can see everything as it moves 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.730
 the racer is just a fairy tale with which 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.440
 smooth and graceful he 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.440
 shifts the bike switches 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.120
 transfer and wind the handle 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.600
 there was no such gas exactly in any 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.339
 moto race exactly one and the other 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:43.239
 a platform 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.309
 even motta jeep 2006 on players 360 can not 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.519
 asori line beauty and 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.710
 motorcycle detail and animation 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.280
 the pilot 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.480
 and what is the number of these motorcycles 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.930
 Tory strings will not have rivals yet 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.860
 long such a set of nearly a hundred motorcycle 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.600
 under different manufacturers yet 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.130
 there is such a detailing can 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.070
 afford only polyphony digital 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.010
 close attention by the way 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.280
 awarded not only the motorcycles themselves but also 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.970
 racers 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.820
 first you can dress your protege 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.000
 dozens and to your taste 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.820
 licensed glove hats 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.880
 jacket and pants boots and what 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.440
 interesting you are free to set up even as 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.730
 your charges will be riding a motorcycle and 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.770
 how do go turns will he 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.280
 hang your bike or 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.980
 lay it on one side 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.940
 in your hands you can 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.890
 Fully beaver own 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.800
 driving style unless of course you have it 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.510
 there is 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.840
 but after such a real one in fine 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.510
 settings and game physics starts 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.120
 surprising because everyone is used to the fact that 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.010
 Gran Turismo is real 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.930
 car simulator and cars there lead 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.480
 yourself quite adequately therefore about the torus string 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.900
 all of course waited for the same but these hopes 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.690
 the game justified only partly trouble round 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.910
 the lines are that the raide was burning 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.510
 give Iran becomes only in 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.530
 certain conditions travels fast 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.340
 and not trying to knuckle it all looks 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.290
 great especially good coming out 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.530
 Pro control mode is on when 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.760
 deactivated all helpers and you can 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.050
 arrange peregazovkoy in 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.030
 cornering only brakes front or 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.340
 rear wheel only 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.080
 and decide when the driver should 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.290
 appear because of such as the villagers and that 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.280
 especially nice to every motorcycle 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.989
 not only has its own unique external 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.040
 the look and sound of the engine but also quite 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.190
 memorable nurov which still 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.309
 to get used to 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:27.869
 but as soon as she tries to commit 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.029
 any asset annoyance can not be avoided 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:32.459
 motorcycles can't build a burnout and 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.529
 legalize on the spot burning rubber on 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.699
 rear wheel they are generally very bad 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:38.149
 feel at low speed 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:40.629
 why the developers did not allow such 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.969
 basic things like exhibiting found on 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:44.649
 small speed opportunity 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:45.629
 lean on her 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.639
 totally incomprehensible like this 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.079
 tried to turn around and the pilot only called 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.509
 I fell off the bike myself 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:54.709
 same story with rear wheel demolition 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.899
 go through the drift you can 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.389
 summit but will inevitably fall upon exiting 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.829
 he is especially surprised by the participator. 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.119
 Enduro motorcycle and style 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:06.299
 driving motor co 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.359
 of course in the torus row you can ride on 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.299
 front and rear wheels but not here 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.979
 did without strangeness for example 

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:13.540
 There are motorcycles that, in principle 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.290
 refuses to get up need to be 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.169
 or what is most surprising about this 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.290
 the list hit many of those motorcycles 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.199
 who in life stand on it 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:23.180
 the wheel easily especially surprised 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.120
 four hundred cube suzuki from enduro 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.209
 class well where did you watch comrades 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.329
 developers yes this bike is literally 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.089
 created to on it in every way 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:32.759
 have fun 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.819
 however do not look at the May quibbles they 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.139
 rather addressed to fans of motorsport in 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.039
 In the end, no matter how cool we are 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:40.209
 motorcycle game 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.030
 Of course her physics has not yet grown to 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.590
 level is represented in cars for superbikes 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.060
 in general, everything is just fine motorcycles 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.569
 really great at high speed 3d 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.749
 models masterpiece animators and does 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:53.889
 have turned out to remember them so 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:54.989
 if you want a closer look 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.120
 get to know the world of motorcycles the best 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.519
 explorer than the string tour you just don't 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:03:59.809
 to find
